their domestication is a highly debated topic in zooarchaeology. Identifying the domestic species (alpaca and llama) in archaeological sites based solely on morphological data is challenging due to their similarity with respect to their wild ancestors. Using genetic methods also presents challenges due to the hybridization history of the domestic species, which are thought to have extensively hybridized following the Spanish conquest of South America that resulted in camelids slaughtered en masse. In this study, we generated mitochondrial genomes for 61 ancient South American camelids dated between 3,500 and 2,400 years before the present (Early Formative period) from two archaeological sites in Northern Chile (Tulán-54 and Tulán-85), as well as 66 modern camelid mitogenomes and 815 modern mitochondrial control region sequences from across South America. In addition, we performed osteometric analyses to differentiate big and small body size camelids. A comparative analysis of these data suggests that a substantial proportion of the ancient vicuña genetic variation has been lost since the Early Formative period, as it is not present in modern specimens. Moreover, we propose a domestication hypothesis that includes an ancient guanaco population that no longer exists. Finally, we find evidence that interbreeding practices were widespread during the domestication process by the early camelid herders in the Atacama during the Early Formative period and predating the Spanish conquest.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ancient DNA</kwd><kwd>camelids</kwd><kwd>domestication</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial genome</kwd><kwd>Tulán</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010751</institution-id><institution>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1070040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz-Maroto</surname><given-names>Paloma</given-names></name><name><surname>Cartajena</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Núñez</surname><given-names>Lautaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010751</institution-id><institution>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico, Tecnológico y de Innovación Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1020316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz-Maroto</surname><given-names>Paloma</given-names></name><name><surname>Cartajena</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Núñez</surname><given-names>Lautaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002850</institution-id><institution>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1130917</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz-Maroto</surname><given-names>Paloma</given-names></name><name><surname>Cartajena</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name><name><surname>Núñez</surname><given-names>Lautaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002850</institution-id><institution>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id><bold>1140785</bold></award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marin</surname><given-names>Juan Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>aDNA revealed a model of domestication where an ancient guanaco population no longer exists, the loss of the ancient vicuña genetic variation in the modern populations, and frequently interbreeding practices.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The study of South American camelids (SACs) and their domestication has been a central subject in South American zooarchaeology since the 1970s. Many studies have focused on elucidating the domestication process as well as use and exploitation of camelid species in the past. These animals were extremely plastic, able to adapt to a great variety of environments found across the Andes and were even present in remote islands, emphasizing their importance in local ecosystems and for historic/prehistoric human populations. Camelids were key in the transition from hunter-gatherer to a mixed economy and played a central role in the cosmic vision of past Andean communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wing, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stahl, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stanley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wheeler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Olivera, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yacobaccio et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cartajena, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Izeta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">L' Heureux, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yacobaccio and Vilá, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gasco et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are currently four camelid species inhabiting South America: two wild species, guanaco (<italic>Lama guanicoe</italic>) and vicuña (<italic>Vicugna vicugna</italic>), and two domestic species, llama (<italic>Lama glama</italic>) and alpaca (<italic>Vicugna pacos</italic>). Guanaco and vicuña are the most important endemic large herbivores in South America due to their ecological dominance in the upper Andean ecosystem and their importance for human populations in terms of their subsistence strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Muñoz and Mondini, 2008</xref>). Llama and alpaca first appeared in the fossil record around 7,000 years before the present (yr BP) as the result of domestication carried out by human communities across the Andes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pires-Ferreira et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wheeler, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wheeler, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Several hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the domestic species (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wheeler, 1995</xref>): (1) llamas were domesticated from guanacos and alpacas were domesticated from vicuñas, (2) llamas were domesticated from guanacos and alpacas derived from hybridization between llamas and vicuñas, (3) llamas and alpacas were both domesticated from guanacos while vicuña was never domesticated, and (4) llama and alpaca evolved from extinct wild precursors, while guanaco and vicuña were never domesticated.</p><p>To elucidate the origin and evolutionary history of camelids, numerous studies have performed DNA analyses on extant specimens (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">González et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marín et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marín et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kadwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stanley et al., 1994</xref>). However, the conclusions drawn from these studies are ambiguous. Some mitochondrial DNA results have established the occurrence of hybridization in the past between wild and domestic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stanley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vidal-Rioja et al., 1994</xref>). Others support the concomitant domestication of guanacos and vicuñas into llamas and alpacas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stanley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kadwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marín et al., 2007a</xref>).

The two main sites, Tulán-54 and Tulán-85, belong to the Early Formative period where the camelid domestication is already incorporated into the economic activities by human groups of this area. Tulán-54 is located in Tulán ravine at the Atacama Desert and it shows the development of ceremonial and public architecture. Archaeological remains from offerings and domestic activities evidence that Tulán-54 was an important place of cultural and economic transformation from hunter-gatherers to early pastoralist communities in the highlands of the Southern Andes during the Early Formative society (ca. 3500–2400 BP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Núñez et al., 2017b</xref>).

While that could have happened, it is also possible that alpacas are the outcome of hybridization between llamas and vicuñas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wheeler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wheeler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Renneberg, 2008</xref>). Alpacas are assumed to have been domesticated independently of llama and probably earlier too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wheeler, 2016</xref>). Peruvian archaeological time series showing the transition from human hunting of wild vicuñas and guanacos (9,000–6,000 years ago) to the establishment of early domestic forms (6,000–5,500 years ago) and the development of human societies centered around pastoralism focused on alpacas and llamas management at high altitude starting 5,500 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wheeler, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wheeler, 1999</xref>). Yet, so far, no evidence of domestication of alpacas has been found outside the domestication center in central Peru (for which no zooarchaeological or modern samples that could cluster with the vicuña samples are thus far available). However, the archaeological evidence indicates that pre-Columbian alpaca populations were substantially larger than today and that a dramatic bottleneck occurred during the Spanish conquest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wheeler, 2016</xref>). Thus, it is possible that some of the genetic information about multiple domestication centers for alpaca, as observed in llama, does not exist anymore. Alternatively, the zooarchaeological samples of Tulán that are putative alpacas may represent one of those non-central Peruvian alpaca domesticated lineages resulting from the cross of female llamas with male vicuñas resulting in phenotypical alpacas that carry a <italic>Lama</italic> mitogenome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Early hybridization of domesticated camelids</title><p>Modern alpacas and llamas are the outcome of an extensive hybridization that has been attributed to the species near demise following the Spanish conquest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kadwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2020</xref>), hybridization that so far has not been shown to have affected the wild SACs (i.e. guanaco and vicuña). During the Spanish conquest, camelid populations were drastically reduced (Gade, 2013), probably due to (i) a lack of understanding of the superior quality of their fiber for the textile industry, (ii) the interest in the introduction and establishment of cattle and sheep for the production of wool that was in high demand in the Low Countries, and (iii) as a measure to control local human populations by destabilizing their means of sustenance. Consequently, the paralleled decline in the Indigenous population and the disappearance of their camelid breeding tradition due to the lack of a written system resulted in a small domestic camelid population that largely was left unmanaged and which could interbreed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wheeler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marín et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pinto, 2012</xref>). Hybridization between llamas and alpacas has become such an extensive issue that up to 40% of llamas and 80% of alpacas show evidence of hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kadwell et al., 2001</xref>), and through recent whole genome sequencing efforts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2020</xref> reported that up to 36% of the modern alpaca genome is likely derived from llama hybridization.</p><p>In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2020</xref> timed the hybridization history between SACs and found evidence for a postcolonial hybridization, and not an ancient one, thereby suggesting that the bulk of the taxonomic uncertainty driven by this process affects modern samples. Moreover, although rare, hybridization between llamas and guanacos (i.e. large bodied animals) and separately between alpacas and vicuñas (small bodied animals) has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">González et al., 2020</xref>). While the results presented here do not disagree with the hybridization patterns described elsewhere (i.e. the recent hybridization history timed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2020</xref>), the observation of hybrid animals among the zooarchaeological samples (i.e. those samples that present a discordance between their taxon identification based on bone morphology and their molecular taxonomic identification) suggests that the hybridization history of the domestic camelids is yet far from understood, and could have also occurred prior to the European colonization of South America. Moreover, artificial hybridization (human driven) between SACs mostly occurs between crosses of one male with several females of another species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marín et al., 2017</xref>), with the offspring only carrying the maternal mitochondrial DNA and thus presenting no evidence in this locus of the hybridization event from which they derive. Consequently, the results presented here advocate for efforts to be made to attempt sequencing the Y-chromosome of ancient samples that may further help unraveling this hybridization history. In the absence of Y-chromosome sequences, efforts to obtain ancient nuclear DNA sequences discriminating between the four species would also help understanding the patterns of hybridization as indicated with modern samples by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>However, despite advances in the field of ancient DNA, it still remains very challenging to obtain nuclear data from ancient samples, due to the fragmentary nature of the DNA on these samples and the low endogenous content and, so far, it has not been possible to be obtained from ancient SAC samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lindahl, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bollongino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pruvost et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hofreiter and Shapiro, 2012</xref>). In fact, the hybrid samples (i.e. C69, C77, and C70) present in Tulán (3,400–2,300 yr BP) not only further support the presence of domestic camelids associated with the human settlements in the region, they also provide information about breeding practices by these ancient formative pastoralist communities. Such ancient hybridization is consistent with hypotheses of human controlled crossings between species during the domestication period and afterward to maintain variation of interest (e.g. adaptive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moore, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marshall et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, although the wild, a hybrid lineages can consistently carry the same mitochondrial haplotype throughout time, they may change body size (e.g. become larger) through backcrossing as the host population genome becomes prevalent in the lineage due to Mendelian inheritance. Lastly, it is possible that the ancient DNA samples in Clades 1–3 represent mostly guanacos and not domestic camelids, suggesting that llamas were domesticated from two different guanaco clades (i.e. Clades 1 and 3) in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yacobaccio, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallardo and Yacobaccio, 2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mengoni Goñalons, 2008</xref> that suggest two different domestication centers.

As small sized animals (putatively alpaca) are found in both the <italic>Lama</italic> and <italic>Vicugna</italic> clades, alpaca may have derived in some part from both species with an important component of its genetic variation comprises guanaco, which indicates that hybridization between these species played a role in its evolutionary history.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Loss of genetic variation</title><p>The demographic analyses of the ancient and modern samples of each clade in our tree revealed contrasting demographic histories across the dataset. The BSP inferred from the wild animals (Clades 2 and 4) showed that substantial demographic expansions started in the middle of the previous interglacial and continued expanding throughout the last glacial period. Such an observation is consistent with an increase in habitable land for <italic>Lama</italic> and <italic>Vicugna</italic> as their distribution ranges probably shifted north and toward lower altitudes as the far South and mountaintops started to freeze. Contrastingly, the ancient domestic samples from Clades 1 and 3 present a roughly stable ancient demography (Clade 3) or a comparatively moderate population expansion at the onset of the last glacial period (Clade 1). Interestingly, the four clades all show a demographic decline starting near ~ 10,000 yr BP reaching its lowest point around ~ 6,000 years ago. These dates coincide with the establishment of human populations throughout the upper Andes ~ 9,000 yr BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldenderfer, 1999</xref>) and the establishment of a specialized hunting for vicuña and guanaco (9,000–6,000 yr BP) prior to the onset of the domestication process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pires-Ferreira et al., 1976</xref>). The brief reduction in effective population size is recovered by a population expansion also present in the four clades but exacerbated on the clades with domestic animals where the recovery is substantially larger (Clades 1 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The larger population expansion in Clades 1 and 3, rather than on the clades with wild animals (Clades 2 and 4), is consistent with an increase in domestic animals population size following the onset of the domestication process and the breeding of camelids with traits of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wheeler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baied and Wheeler, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the comparative analysis of both the demographic histories and levels of genetic diversity in both datasets indicates that the ancient camelids presented a much larger genetic pool than the modern ones. In the BSP, it can be seen that the plots obtained from the ancient samples (albeit fewer than the modern ones) result in substantially larger effective population sizes and more ancient coalescent times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), reflecting higher genetic variation in those samples. Similarly, the genetic diversity measured in terms of haplotype sharing between ancient and modern samples, or the number of haplotypes and total number of substitutions observed in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), also shows that the ancient samples presented significantly more genetic variation than the modern ones, with the vicuña having lost the most genetic variation across time. The latter is consistent with the evidence for bottlenecks in the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wheeler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">González et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>This is not surprising when considering the relative homogeneity of the environment where vicuñas are found and how gregarious they are in comparison to guanacos. Vicuñas are constrained to the upper Andes High Plateau at altitudes above 3,500 masl, while guanacos are largely freely roaming and found across a much wider altitudinal gradient from the sea level to the same altitudes where vicuñas are found. Additionally, vicuñas are gregarious animals being able to form herds of 100 animals or more in some parts of their Peruvian range (<italic>V. v. mensalis</italic>) where guanacos (<italic>L. g. cacsiliensis</italic>) tend to form small family groups of 5–10 individuals (usually one male and one to two females with their offspring), while in the southern ranges vicuña groups tend to be smaller (<italic>V. v. vicugna</italic>) and the guanacos (<italic>L. g. guanicoe</italic>) are larger than in northern locations. Such differences between the two species likely made the vicuña a preferential hunting target for the upper Andean human population, as they were easier to find in large quantities and because their groups were found in relative proximity to each other due to the environmental constraint of their habitat distribution. Lastly, by inhabiting a much more homogeneous habitat in the upper Andes (the High Plateau) reflecting the narrower gradient of the Andean slopes where they are found, vicuñas are more susceptible to environmental changes that affect their habitat as these likely impact their entire range. Nevertheless, while human-driven demographic changes are likely to have driven some of the changes observed in this data, the effect of environmental changes cannot be ignored, in particular during the middle Holocene climatic optimum (~8.2 kyr BP–4.2 kyr BP). This time span is marked by a period of strong hydroclimate shifts that led to the aridization of the Andes as rainfalls became more stochastic and temperatures increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Riris and Arroyo-Kalin, 2019</xref>). Such aridification is likely to have changed the habitable range for the vicuña, further exacerbating the demographic pressure that it was already experiencing.</p><p>Finally, all four SAC species show evidence of having lost a very large proportion of their genetic variation as modern populations only represent a small fraction of historical population diversities. This loss of diversity may lead to problems in the survival of these species in the future. Although some extant camelid populations have been brought back from the brink of extinction within the last 50 years (e.g. the Peruvian vicuña was once as few as 5,000 individuals mid last century, but through the international Plan de Manejo de la Vicuña it has since recovered to over 100,000 individuals), current climate change exacerbating the aridification of the upper Andes, land conversion for agriculture, and a general lack of appetite from local governments to invest in these native species of agricultural value are likely to drive these camelids into further trouble.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Archaeological samples</title><p>The study area is located in the II Region of Chile (Antofagasta), specifically in the western slope of the Puna de Atacama (22°−24°S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) at the south eastern border of the Atacama saltpan.

Due to fragmentation or bad preservation, 18 out of 61 samples were not used for morphometric analysis. Osteometric measures were performed on each bone sample prior to drilling for aDNA to avoid bias due to damage during drilling. Measurements were performed on phalanx and astragalus. Bones were selected from different levels and squares in the excavation sites in order to choose different individuals (Table S4). Only adult individuals determined by a phalanx with fused epiphysis were selected for the morphometric analysis. The first anterior phalanx was selected due to its high frequency in the sites and because it is easy to differentiate between anterior and posterior phalanx. Breadth of proximal articulation (BFp) and the depth of the proximal epiphysis (Dp) measures were taken from the proximal side of the phalanx. In the case of the astragalus, growth occurs from a single primary center of ossification, with the bone continuing to grow after birth until the bone is completely ossified. The reduction of bone porosity and well-delimited medial intertarsal and plantar trochlea articular surfaces were used as criteria to identify bones from adult animals that were collected for this work.

It offers a large dataset of modern and ancient mitochondrial sequences from across South America and from the sites of Tulán-54 and Tulán-85 in northern Chile, respectively. By drawing samples from a time before recent major losses of camelid diversity, ancient DNA allows identification of lost lineages, and reveals layers of complexity in the process of domestication for both large and small camelid taxa. This has implications ranging from understanding the history of culturally iconic species to aiding in the conservation of threatened lineages.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ancient DNA reveals the lost domestication history of South American camelids in Northern Chile and across the Andes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Jessica C Thompson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by George Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mariana Mondini (Reviewer #3); Pamela A. Burger (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Reviewers included area specialists in zooarchaeology and in genetics. All were in agreement that this is a well-written paper, with important implications for understanding camelid domestication in South America. All reviewers also agreed that the data are robust and well-presented. The content is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, and the approach is both well-justified and a welcome connection between morphology and aDNA. The reviewers focus on eight major points that should be addressed in a revision. Special attention should be given to the points about the figures, which could be made more clear.</p><p>The reviewers also wanted to make it clear that future work should involve samples drawn from a larger time span, or with more specific assignment within the ~800 year time span of the sites that dominate this sample. Specifically, it would be very useful to include earlier samples, before culturally induced interbreeding took place. Also, it would be crucial to include camelid fibers, especially those of the early type resembling modern llamas that is no longer found in extant wild populations, as they might correspond to the now extinct wild component of Clade 3. As the archaeological sample is from an area far from the current known range of alpacas – in wetter altiplano areas –, specimens confidently attributed to ancient alpacas that are not suspected to be hybrids and with less interbreeding than modern ones should also be compared in future. It is important that further studies also discuss ways to test the hypothesis of the cross of female llamas with male vicuñas to end up in &quot;phenotypical alpacas&quot; in San Pedro de Atacama ca. 3000 years ago.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Osteological measurements: There are issues here of both nomenclature and method:</p><p>– Astragali have no lines of fusion and therefore an intermediate or small size can simply be a juvenile of a larger species. No criteria are mentioned for defining the condition of &quot;adult&quot; for the astragali. An astragalus of a young individual of the large group could overlap in size with that of an adult of the small group. If this were to occur, some specimens could be wrongly attributed to a different size group and this, as the authors have pointed out, has implications for the taxonomic discussion. Phalanges can be more useful in this way, but they do not seem to discriminate as well. Given the history of hybridization revealed by the mtDNA analysis, there needs to be more nuance in interpreting metric data from phalanges.</p><p>– The bivariate plot of Figure 2A based on measurements of the phalanxes show two size clusters (big and small) but there are several cases (nearly a 25% of the total) that are intermediate in size. This pattern needs a further explanation that it is not included in that section of the paper. Also Figure 2B based on the astragali shows several outliers that cannot be interpreted in a straightforward manner.</p><p>– While osteometry is mentioned, there are also geometric morphometric studies that address shape instead of size to determine camelid taxa that could be mentioned. The section called &quot;Morphometric analysis&quot; should in fact be renamed as &quot;Osteometric analysis,&quot; as it does not address shape.</p><p>– Figures need to be adjusted so that the samples are clearer (especially the older sample), and where the samples came from (and modern distributions) are better-justified.</p><p>2) Archaeological context of the samples: This needs to be much clearer and more specific, and there seem to be superfluous images of some contexts (like the burial) without explanation about their relevance to the sample. Specifically:</p><p>– There is little discussion about what happened with the single specimen that was older, from TU-52, or the significance/insight of the contemporaneous specimen from TU-94, which was ostensibly sampled to develop the more regional view. It is really challenging to find these on the various figures without a lot of flipping back and forth between sections of the manuscript. Information provided on Tulán-52 and Tulán-94 sites is too short and uneven. The samples from these sites (2 from each?) should better be listed in Table S1 in Supplementary file 1. It is not clear why only two samples were taken from these two sites, especially Tulán-52, which represents an earlier period that was critical in SAC domestication. In presenting the region, note that mention of San Pedro de Atacama desert only appears in the Discussion.</p><p>– What is the specific significance of the locality of Tulán with respect to this problem? How might the story change if a different locality had been sampled? The supplementary information on this is not very detailed and, as mentioned above, the significance of specimens from multiple sites at Tulán is not really explored.</p><p>– What was the context of the sampled remains? They were inside or outside of ceremonial or inhabited areas, but were they from ceremonial contexts, or trash middens? Supplementary Figure 2B – what is the purpose of illustrating the human burial with the offering? Is it because this is the context from which the camelid remains derived?</p><p>– Supplementary Figures 1 and 2: A &quot;partial&quot; (Tulán 54) and &quot;panoramic&quot; (Tulán 84) site views are provided. However, it would be useful to include a plan of both sites to know the spatial provenience of the bones discussed at a more detailed scale.</p><p>– In the subsection “Biogeographical area”, different dates are provided for the Formative period; it would be clearer to state that it starts at c. 5000 BP and the period represented in these particular sites is c. 3360-2370 BP. The inference that human populations started selecting wild camelids to raise their own herds c. 3000 years ago should be supported with some references.</p><p>3) Explicit discussion of limitations: The authors should be certain to clearly state the caveats of this study. They should be clear about the potential influence of factors, and their timing, that are independent of domestication on both size and molecular diversity. Specifically, these are limitations imposed by:</p><p>– The osteometric and aDNA methods.</p><p>– The archaeological sample relative to the research question (e.g. the chronological and geographical representation of the selected sample).</p><p>– Hybridization and later killing-off events.</p><p>– Potential impact of climatic/environmental changes.</p><p>– The extent to which any of the above is knowable.</p><p>4) Interpretations of hybridization:</p><p>In the subsection “Early Hybridization of domesticated camelids”, if modern genomes are extensively hybridized in the recent past, how valid are the modern samples used in this analysis? In other words how can a molecular taxonomic identification actually work – and be compared against the morphological results – if the modern reference collection of, say, a &quot;guanaco&quot; might actually have been hybridized in the recent past? And if only mitogenomes are used in this analysis, how can such hybridization truly be pulled apart? Then, the specific &quot;hybrid specimens&quot; described here are not really directly addressed in the Results sections; on what basis are these individuals determined to be hybrids? If it is simply the difference between morphology and mitogenome haplotype (which seems to be the case), then we should investigate which specimens were first phalanges and which ones were astragali, because the astragali seem to be much more effective at separating them out (see point #1). On the trees that code the specimens by size, I am reading this to mean that anything in the &quot;intermediate&quot; category was a phalanx, and therefore I'm not sure that this is a &quot;hybrid&quot; so much as a problem with the discrimination of the method. Alternatively, if they are truly hybrids, then there might not be expected to be a clear morphological result from the bone measurements.</p><p>5) Discussion of implications of bottlenecks:</p><p>– It is interesting that the vicuña, which according to the model reconstructed here was not a major source of domesticated stock in the past, is the one that has undergone the most genetic bottlenecking; could this potentially be as a result of human manipulation of other taxa that caused their populations to increase at the expense of wild vicuña habitat? What is the actual mechanism that the authors propose for the bottleneck in vicuña?</p><p>– The Holocene SAC demographic decline is related to human behavior in the manuscript. It would be interesting to assess the impact of climatic and concomitant environmental changes since the late Pleistocene – including the Antarctic Cold Reversal and the Hypsithermal – on their demography as well. The reasons for vicuñas undergoing bottlenecks unlike guanacos is also worth further exploring. It will also be interesting to explore why vicuña demography has recovered so nicely in recent years in spite of that, while Andean and Chaco guanacos – excluding Fuego-Patagonian steppe populations – are now so patchily distributed that are considered to be endangered. It would be interesting to know how genetic variation corresponds to camelid subspecies in modern samples, and whether this variation can be traced back in the fossil samples.</p><p>6) Adjustments to figures:</p><p>– Figure 1: The map legend should stress on what kind of data it is based, whether on the documented provenience localities where the subspecies have been previously described from a taxonomic point of view, or from any other source of information. It would be also helpful to have some precisions on the time period represented: pre or postcolonial times. The sources of the distributional information should be cited. More importantly, the fact that there are these subspecies and their main differences should be introduced when presenting SACs and before the figure. The color-coding used for the map is not enough clear to distinguish the overlapping distribution of these four subspecies, as is the case of the southern vicugna and the guanaco. Also, there are extant guanaco populations in Córdoba, Santiago del Estero and Buenos Aires provinces in Argentina that do not appear in Figure 1. The map should show the georeferenced points from where the specimens used in the analysis (data from Table S3 in Supplementary file 1). The apparent attribution to the L. g. guanicoe subspecies in the map is a supposition since the guanaco of Northwest Argentina has not been studied genetically yet. As <italic>L.g. cacsilensis</italic> is present in southern latitudes (for example, at Ovalle and Paposo in Chile, according to Table S3 in Supplementary file 1), distant from its northern type locality, and the Andes appear &quot;to offer little impediment to movement&quot; (González et al., 2006: 170) it would be important to establish if in the past there has been an interconnection between both guanaco populations.</p><p>– Figure 2: In the section &quot;Morphometric analysis&quot; it says that measurements were taken from 61 specimens out of a sample of 75 bones, and that of those measured specimens 18 were not considered for morphometric analysis. In a previous section it says that the mitogenomes dataset comprises 60 ancient records. These numbers do not add up. This seems to suggest that DNA was extracted from bones that were not included in the morphometric analysis. If this is true it should be mentioned. It would give a better understanding of the complementary nature of the osteometric and genetic database and the research design. The dots are also difficult to differentiate, because the labels overlap so much and the dots are the same size and color; which ones are archaeological and included versus not included in the analysis? There also seem to be no modern camelid measurements for the astragalus?</p><p>– Figure 3: Even with a zoom 200% it is impossible to read the posterior probability values of the support of the nodes. It is interesting that there are a number of &quot;small-sized&quot; archaeological specimens in Clade 2. Are these samples on astragali (better indicators) or phalanges (more variation)? There is a lot more variation in the sizes of adult phalanges and astragali in the archaeological sample than in the modern sample, and potentially this may have something to do with active moments of admixture and hybridization between the different clades. This relationship between the morphological data from the two different elements and how this would be represented under various hybridization scenarios could be better-addressed in the text (see point #4).</p><p>– Figure 5 is really interesting and easy to read, but surprising that the small-sized archaeological samples group exclusively away from the vicuña.</p><p>– Figure 6: Is there some way to indicate which taxa are associated with which haplogroups here, as well as linking the past with the present? It is a really useful figure, but difficult to understand the relationships between taxa (even if only the modern taxa are indicated). Perhaps the (lost) vicuña haplotypes be indicated by A vicuña figure, similar to Figure 5 – which is very clear.</p><p>– Figure 7: the labelled panels (A, B, etc.) do not have any specific information about the samples to which they pertain.</p><p>– Supplementary Figure 3: A minor thing maybe, but the underlying grey map seems to have different square shades of grey. This is a bit irritating. The legend next to the map is difficult to read, the quality of the letters is not good and the green and blue dots have grey squares around them.</p><p>7) References:</p><p>Check for missing references, incomplete ones and errors in them. There are some inconsistencies in how the authors are listed in the text and in the Bibliography, particularly with authors who have two last names/surnames. For example: &quot;López, P.&quot; and &quot;López Mendoza, P.&quot; are the same person; while &quot;Mengoni-Goñalons&quot; correctly in the text, is only &quot;Goñalons&quot; in the Bibliography. The authors might also consider how their names are listed here with respect to how they have published their names in other papers.</p><p>8) Formatting:</p><p>– Although it is possible to place Materials and methods to be near the front of the manuscript, <italic>eLife</italic> style does typically place it at the end.</p><p>– The supplementary information should also appear together at the end of the manuscript, not divided up into sections within the main body of the manuscript.</p><p>– Check for typos and formatting errors; date ranges should always be provided from the older to the younger age. Also check for grammar and sentence structure across the text, as many phrases need rewriting (for instance, that in the Abstract reading &quot;we generated mitochondrial genomes for… 815 extant mitochondrial control region sequences from across South America&quot;; &quot;Northeastern Argentina&quot; should read &quot;Northwestern Argentina,&quot; etc.). The text needs extensive revision in this regard.</p><p>– Figures and tables are not numbered after the order in which they appear in the text, and formatting is not even (e.g., way to name pictures within one figure). While the text mentions that first phalanges were measured, the figures and tables should also read so (and not just &quot;phalanx&quot;). Letters in the pictures making up Supplementary Figure 2 do not match the legend; they mix with Supplementary Figure 1. Figure 3—figure supplement 3 is only mentioned in the legend of another figure and not in the main text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63390.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Osteological measurements: There are issues here of both nomenclature and method:</p><p>– Astragali have no lines of fusion and therefore an intermediate or small size can simply be a juvenile of a larger species. No criteria are mentioned for defining the condition of &quot;adult&quot; for the astragali. An astragalus of a young individual of the large group could overlap in size with that of an adult of the small group. If this were to occur, some specimens could be wrongly attributed to a different size group and this, as the authors have pointed out, has implications for the taxonomic discussion. Phalanges can be more useful in this way, but they do not seem to discriminate as well. Given the history of hybridization revealed by the mtDNA analysis, there needs to be more nuance in interpreting metric data from phalanges.</p></disp-quote><p>In the case of the astragalus, growth occurs from a single primary center of ossification, after birth the bone continues growing until the bone is completely ossified. The reduction of bone porosity and well delimited medial intertarsal and plantar trochlear articular surfaces were used as criteria to select the samples. Modern measurement of subadult individuals of the big size camelid does not overlap in size with that of an adult of the small group (Cartajena, 2003). However, we cannot rule out the possible overlapping due to age in the smaller size camelid group (Izeta, 2004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>–The bivariate plot of Figure 2A based on measurements of the phalanxes show two size clusters (big and small) but there are several cases (nearly a 25% of the total) that are intermediate in size.

Also Figure 2B based on the astragali shows several outliers that cannot be interpreted in a straightforward manner.</p><p>– While osteometry is mentioned, there are also geometric morphometric studies that address shape instead of size to determine camelid taxa that could be mentioned. The section called &quot;Morphometric analysis&quot; should in fact be renamed as &quot;Osteometric analysis,&quot; as it does not address shape.</p><p>– Figures need to be adjusted so that the samples are clearer (especially the older sample), and where the samples came from (and modern distributions) are better-justified.</p></disp-quote><p>The provenance of the ancient samples used in this study are included in Table S1 in Supplementary file 1.

Specifically:</p><p>– There is little discussion about what happened with the single specimen that was older, from TU-52, or the significance/insight of the contemporaneous specimen from TU-94, which was ostensibly sampled to develop the more regional view. It is really challenging to find these on the various figures without a lot of flipping back and forth between sections of the manuscript. Information provided on Tulán-52 and Tulán-94 sites is too short and uneven. The samples from these sites (2 from each?) should better be listed in Table S1 in Supplementary file 1. It is not clear why only two samples were taken from these two sites, especially Tulán-52, which represents an earlier period that was critical in SAC domestication. In presenting the region, note that mention of San Pedro de Atacama desert only appears in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We mention briefly in the main text, subsection “Archaeological samples” the presence of domestic camelids during the Late Archaic period suggested as well by osteometry and fibers analysis (Cartajena et al., 2007, Cartajena, 2013). Early Formative groups show strong continuity with Late Archaic ones expressed in architectural patterns and lithic material among others (Núñez et al., 2006). Introduction.</p><p>The principal focus of this project was the material from the sites TU-54 and TU-85. During the experimental work we included two samples from TU-52 and TU-94 to evaluate the DNA preservation of material from other archaeological sites from the same area for further genetic studies at Tulán Ravine. We agree with the reviewer that it would have been a good idea to further sample other sites. However, this was not possible at the time this project was conducted.</p><p>The study area located in the western slope of the Puna de Atacama (22°-24°S) at the southeastern border of the Salar de Atacama salt is mentioned at the beginning of Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What is the specific significance of the locality of Tulán with respect to this problem? How might the story change if a different locality had been sampled? The supplementary information on this is not very detailed and, as mentioned above, the significance of specimens from multiple sites at Tulán is not really explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We develop the description of the main formative sites (Tu-54 and Tu-85) in the text and only leave the figures in the supplementary material. As we pointed out in the main text, the Tulán ravine contains a complete occupational sequence from the Early Holocene to the recent times (modern pastoralists). It is characterized by a redundancy of occupations in a long span of time and Tu-54 is the only site with monumental architecture in the region during the Early Formative. This site could be considered as a local political and religious center. Furthermore, it shows the integration of macro-regional interaction networks between the cost and Northwest Argentina (Núñez et al., 2017a and b). These are the reasons why we chose this area to explore the history of domestication of South American camelids through ancient DNA.</p><p>Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What was the context of the sampled remains?

Stratigraphic analyses showed recurrent discarding events during the occupation of the site, suggesting the practice was repeated over time until it was completely covered to a maximum depth of around 2m Cartajena et al., 2019. Samples were collected at different levels and sectors in the sites, incorporating samples from inside the ceremonial structures and outside, related to domestic activities.</p><p>The image with the human burial has been removed, it was used to illustrate the ritual context of the site, but was not in direct relation with the samples.

Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Interpretations of hybridization:</p><p>In the subsection “Early Hybridization of domesticated camelids”, if modern genomes are extensively hybridized in the recent past, how valid are the modern samples used in this analysis? In other words how can a molecular taxonomic identification actually work – and be compared against the morphological results – if the modern reference collection of, say, a &quot;guanaco&quot; might actually have been hybridized in the recent past? And if only mitogenomes are used in this analysis, how can such hybridization truly be pulled apart? Then, the specific &quot;hybrid specimens&quot; described here are not really directly addressed in the Results sections; on what basis are these individuals determined to be hybrids?

Alternatively, if they are truly hybrids, then there might not be expected to be a clear morphological result from the bone measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>The hybridisation history of South American Camelids is focused around the hybridisation events that occurred between alpacas and llamas, i.e. between the domestic forms and not between the wild camelids (Guanacos and Vicuñas). Hence any statement reflecting hybridisation events in the past are limited to those that occurred between llamas and alpacas.</p><p>Three main sections for this argument:</p><p>1) We do find significant differences between large and small animals with morphology. Discussion.</p><p>The bones from which no DNA was extracted were removed from the analyses as their results bear little consequence to our work presented here (we updated Figure 2 accordingly). Additionally, we carried out statistical tests between the different measurements carried out for each of the bones and showed that the large specimens are significantly different from the small specimens (all p-values were smaller than 10<sup>-4</sup>).</p><p>2) Hybridization is largely a new thing and not an old event.</p><p>“In particular, Fan et al., 2020, timed the hybridization history between South American camelids and found evidence for a post-colonial hybridization, and not an ancient one, thereby suggesting that the bulk of the taxonomic uncertainty driven by this process affects modern samples. Moreover, although rare, hybridization between llamas and guanacos (i.e. large bodied animals), and separately between alpacas and vicuñas (small bodied animals) have been previously reported (González et al., 2020). While the results presented here do not disagree with the hybridization patterns described elsewhere (i.e. the recent hybridization history timed by Fan et al., 2020), the observation of hybrid animals among the zooarcheological samples (i.e. those samples that present a discordance between their taxon identification based on bone morphology and their molecular taxonomic identification), suggests that the hybridization history of the domestic camelids is yet far from understood, and could have also occurred prior to the European colonization of South America.”</p><p>3) It is possible that Clades 1-3 are mostly guanacos and not domestic animals:</p><p>“Furthermore, although the wild, a hybrid lineages can consistently may carry the same mitochondrial haplotype throughout time, they may change body size (e.g. become larger) through backcrossing as the host population genome becomes prevalent in the lineage due to mendelian inheritance. […] However, the presence of both domestic camelids in Tulán has been previously established through the analyses of bone remains (Cartajena et al., 2007; Núñez et al., 2017), microscopic camelid fiber analyses (Benavente, 2005, 2006), and the analyses of bone collagen stable isotopes that differentiate llamas ritually fed with maize from wild guanacos (López, Cartajena and Núñez, 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discussion of implications of bottlenecks:</p><p>– It is interesting that the vicuña, which according to the model reconstructed here was not a major source of domesticated stock in the past, is the one that has undergone the most genetic bottlenecking; could this potentially be as a result of human manipulation of other taxa that caused their populations to increase at the expense of wild vicuña habitat? What is the actual mechanism that the authors propose for the bottleneck in vicuña?</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that the stronger loss of variation in the vicuña is the outcome of the preferential hunting of vicuñas rather than guanacos by the early upper Andean communities, reflecting aspects of the ecology and behavior of vicunas:</p><p>“This is not surprising when considering the relative homogeneity of the environment where vicuñas are found and how gregarious they are in comparison to guanacos. […] Such aridification is likely to have changed the habitable range for the vicuña further exacerbating the demographic pressure that it was already experiencing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The Holocene SAC demographic decline is related to human behavior in the manuscript.

Nevertheless, location of the archaeological site and map of modern camelid samples included in the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was included in the new Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) References:</p><p>Check for missing references, incomplete ones and errors in them. There are some inconsistencies in how the authors are listed in the text and in the Bibliography, particularly with authors who have two last names/surnames. For example: &quot;López, P.&quot; and &quot;López Mendoza, P.&quot; are the same person; while &quot;Mengoni-Goñalons&quot; correctly in the text, is only &quot;Goñalons&quot; in the Bibliography. The authors might also consider how their names are listed here with respect to how they have published their names in other papers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have checked and fixed the errata in the bibliography.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Formatting:</p><p>– Although it is possible to place Materials and methods to be near the front of the manuscript, eLife style does typically place it at the end.</p></disp-quote><p>Materials and methods has been moved to the end of the manuscript before the bibliography.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The supplementary information should also appear together at the end of the manuscript, not divided up into sections within the main body of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary material has been moved to the end of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Check for typos and formatting errors; date ranges should always be provided from the older to the younger age. Also check for grammar and sentence structure across the text, as many phrases need rewriting (for instance, that in the Abstract reading &quot;we generated mitochondrial genomes for… 815 extant mitochondrial control region sequences from across South America&quot;; &quot;Northeastern Argentina&quot; should read &quot;Northwestern Argentina,&quot; etc.). The text needs extensive revision in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the observation. We have checked and reviewed those errata.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figures and tables are not numbered after the order in which they appear in the text, and formatting is not even (e.g., way to name pictures within one figure). While the text mentions that first phalanges were measured, the figures and tables should also read so (and not just &quot;phalanx&quot;). Letters in the pictures making up Supplementary Figure 2 do not match the legend; they mix with Supplementary Figure 1. Figure 3—figure supplement 3 is only mentioned in the legend of another figure and not in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have checked and reviewed those errata.</p></body></sub-article></article>
