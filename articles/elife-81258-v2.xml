Here, we found that <italic>FOXP2</italic> is overexpressed in human prostate cancer cells and prostate tumors, but its expression is absent in normal prostate epithelial cells and low in benign prostatic hyperplasia. <italic>FOXP2</italic> is a FOX transcription factor family member and tightly associated with vocal development. To date, little is known regarding the link of <italic>FOXP2</italic> to prostate cancer. We observed that high <italic>FOXP2</italic> expression and frequent amplification are significantly associated with high Gleason score. Ectopic expression of <italic>FOXP2</italic> induces malignant transformation of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human prostate epithelial cell RWPE-1. Conversely, <italic>FOXP2</italic> knockdown suppresses the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Transgenic overexpression of <italic>FOXP2</italic> in the mouse prostate causes prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Overexpression of <italic>FOXP2</italic> aberrantly activates oncogenic MET signaling and inhibition of MET signaling effectively reverts the <italic>FOXP2</italic>-induced oncogenic phenotype. CUT&amp;Tag assay identified FOXP2-binding sites located in <italic>MET</italic> and its associated gene <italic>HGF</italic>. Additionally, the novel recurrent <italic>FOXP2-CPED1</italic> fusion identified in prostate tumors results in high expression of truncated FOXP2, which exhibit a similar capacity for malignant transformation. Together, our data indicate that <italic>FOXP2</italic> is involved in tumorigenicity of prostate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FOXP2</kwd><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>oncogene</kwd><kwd>transformation</kwd><kwd>MET signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81872096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Xiaoquan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81541152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yanyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81472408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jianye</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81570789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019018</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Initiative for Innovative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-I2M-1-050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yanyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019018</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Initiative for Innovative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-I2M-1-002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yanyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Scientific Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12th 5-year National Program - 2012BAI10B01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ze</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jianye</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>973 Program Grants - 2014CB910503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>FOXP2</italic>, encoding a forkhead-box transcription factor regarded as vital to proper development of human speech, was revealed to have an oncogenic potential and activate MET signaling in prostate cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oncogenes arise as a consequence of genetic alterations that increase the expression level or activity of a proto-oncogene. Activation of oncogenes causes malignant transformation of normal cells and maintains cancerous cell proliferation and survival. Clinical intervention strategies targeting oncoproteins and their related signaling pathways lead to growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weinstein and Joe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide in men, with ~1.3 million new cases and ~0.36 million deaths in 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Culp et al., 2020</xref>). In China, the incidence rate of prostate cancer has increased quickly, with an annual percentage change of ~13% since 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). These findings stress the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the genesis of prostate cancer. Accumulating data from genomic characterization and functional studies have revealed some oncogenes, including the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family genes <italic>ERG</italic> and <italic>ETV1</italic>, among others, whose overexpression is involved in prostate tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baena et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carver et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tomlins et al., 2005</xref>). However, the oncogenes that contribute to the initiation of the disease remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we identified a previously unknown intrachromosomal gene fusion involving <italic>FOXP2</italic> in primary prostate tumors by RNA-Seq and RT-PCR combined with Sanger sequencing. The fusion encodes a truncated FOXP2 mutant protein encompassing the key domains and is highly expressed in the fusion-carrying prostate tumor. <italic>FOXP2</italic> encodes a highly conserved forkhead box transcription factor and is tightly associated with vocal development in humans and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher and Scharff, 2009</xref>). Mutations in <italic>FOXP2</italic> are the only known cause of developmental speech and language disorder in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spiteri et al., 2007</xref>). Most of the recent studies investigating the roles of <italic>FOXP2</italic> in cancer have focused on noncoding RNA-mediated dysregulation of <italic>FOXP2</italic>, suggesting that <italic>FOXP2</italic> has either oncogenic or tumor-suppressive effects on cancer development in different tumor contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuiffo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). However, to date, little is known regarding the link between <italic>FOXP2</italic> and prostate cancer. Here, we investigated the expression of <italic>FOXP2</italic> in prostate cancer samples.

The <italic>FOXP2</italic> mRNA levels were significantly increased in prostate cancer samples with respect to normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). We then examined tissue extracts by immunoblotting. The amounts of FOXP2 protein were evidently increased in primary prostate adenocarcinomas relative to the matched normal tissues and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). We further carried out an immunohistochemical assay on 25 BPH samples and 45 primary prostate tumors. Strong or medium staining of FOXP2 protein was observed in 53% (24/45) of primary prostate adenocarcinomas. No or low nuclear staining of FOXP2 was observed in 96% (24/25) of benign prostatic tissues. There was a statistically significant difference in the FOXP2 staining intensity between prostate cancer and benign prostate tissue (two-tailed p=0.001, by Fisher’s exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Likewise, <italic>FOXP2</italic> expression was markedly elevated in human prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, LNCaP, VCaP, and DU145), but was undetectable or low in normal or immortalized human prostate epithelial cells (HPrEC and RWPE-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Given the data above, these findings suggested that there is a tendency for increased expression of FOXP2 protein between normal tissue and prostate neoplasia. Together, our data indicated that <italic>FOXP2</italic> was highly expressed in human prostate tumors.</p><p>Overexpression of specific genes such as <italic>ERG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carver et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomlins et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>EZH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varambally et al., 2002</xref>) results in a phenotype of hyperplasia and promotes of invasive properties in the prostate, indicating a critical proto-oncogenic role in prostate tumorigenesis. Therefore, in this study, to explore the biological consequence of high expression of the <italic>FOXP2</italic> gene, we first introduced the wild-type or fusion <italic>FOXP2</italic> cDNA into mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts that lack endogenous Foxp2 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>) and then carried out a colony formation assay. NIH3T3 fibroblasts, as normal fibroblasts, are considered to be entirely anchorage-dependent for proliferation. We found that <italic>FOXP2</italic> can transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts, inducing loss of contact inhibition and gain of anchorage-independent growth, which are tumorigenic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). We also noted that, as anticipated from the structural properties of the <italic>FOXP2-CPED1</italic> fusion, it was able to confer this oncogenic phenotype as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>).

We next determined the oncogenic activity of <italic>FOXP2</italic> and its rearrangement lesion in a NOD-SCID mouse model. We observed that <italic>FOXP2</italic>-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells injected into the flanks of NOD-SCID mice formed tumors at a higher penetrance than did parental or empty vector control cells: in 10/15 mice compared with 0/5 mice for parental cells and 0/8 for control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E and F</xref>).

However, the <italic>FOXP2</italic> expression pattern in normal prostate tissue and malignant neoplasms of the prostate has not been clearly characterized. Our findings revealed that FOXP2 protein expression is absent or low in normal human prostate epithelial cells and benign prostatic hyperplasia but is markedly increased in PIN, localized prostate tumors, and metastatic prostate cancer cell lines. We found that primary prostate tumors with <italic>FOXP2</italic> expression had a higher Gleason grade than cases without <italic>FOXP2</italic> expression by analyzing the clinical data of 491 human TCGA primary prostate tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Next, we observed frequent amplification of the <italic>FOXP2</italic> gene, which occurred in 15–20% of primary prostate tumors from the Broad/Cornell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baca et al., 2013</xref>) and TCGA datasets and in 25% of metastatic tumors from the SU2C dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Moreover, we conducted the analysis on tumors with both <italic>FOXP2</italic> gene expression and amplification data available in the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) datasets. In 268 tumors with <italic>FOXP2</italic> amplification at the DNA level, we observed consistent <italic>FOXP2</italic> mRNA overexpression across most tumors (197/268) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Frequent <italic>FOXP2</italic> gain also occurred in 18 other types of human solid tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Finally, we evaluated the clinical significance of <italic>FOXP2</italic> copy number alterations (CNAs) in 487 primary prostate tumors. CNAs of <italic>FOXP2</italic> were significantly associated with high Gleason scores (Gleason score ≥ 8) (OR = 2.10; 95% CI, 1.38–3.22; p=0.001, by Fisher’s exact test) and high-grade pathologic T stages (T ≥ 3a) (OR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.26–3.21; p=0.003, by Fisher’s exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). These data suggested that the genomic lesion in <italic>FOXP2</italic> might contribute to high-risk prostate cancer. In addition, we found that CNAs of <italic>FOXP2</italic> were prominently enriched in ETS fusion-negative prostate tumors from the MSKCC/DFCI dataset (n = 685) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armenia et al., 2018</xref>) (p=2.42 × 10<sup>–6</sup>, by Fisher’s exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4F</xref>), suggesting that <italic>FOXP2</italic> CNAs and ETS fusions were partially mutually exclusive. Similar to our observation, Stumm et al. reported moderate to strong FOXP2 protein expression in 75% of prostate tumors, and a higher protein expression level of FOXP2 was correlated with higher Gleason score, advanced T stage, and earlier cancer recurrence in <italic>ERG</italic> fusion-negative prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stumm et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identified a novel recurrent <italic>FOXP2-CPED1</italic> fusion in two localized prostate tumors. Due to loss of miR-27a/b-mediated transcriptional regulation, the fusion yielded a truncated FOXP2 protein that was highly expressed in the fusion-carrying tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–L</xref>). In addition, whole-genome sequencing of the fusion-positive tumor suggested that the <italic>FOXP2</italic> fusion was an early event in the tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The truncated FOXP2 protein retained the full forkhead DNA binding domain (DBD). In humans, mutations in the DBD of FOXP2 cause severe autosomal-dominant disorders of speech and language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2001</xref>). Several lines of evidence also showed that the DBD of some other FOX family proteins was crucial for the growth and invasion of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gormally et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with the observation of cellular transformation resulting from <italic>FOXP2</italic> overexpression, ectopically expressed <italic>FOXP2-CPED1</italic> induced the transformation of normal or benign prostate cells to malignant cells in vitro and in vivo and aberrantly activated oncogenic MET signaling, suggesting that the oncogenic role of the FOXP2 protein could be DBD dependent. Taken together, these findings for the <italic>FOXP2</italic> fusion further supported that <italic>FOXP2</italic> has an oncogenic potential.</p><p>To identify genes that are significantly regulated by <italic>FOXP2</italic>, we compared two sources of differential gene expression data from TCGA primary prostate tumors and our <italic>FOXP2</italic>-transformed NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Our data showed that overexpression of <italic>FOXP2</italic> activated oncogenic MET signaling in <italic>FOXP2</italic>-transformed prostate epithelial cells and human prostate tumors, and inhibition of MET signaing activation in <italic>FOXP2</italic>-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells and NIH3T3 cells significantly suppressed the anchorage-independent growth or foci formation of these cells.

Additionally, we observed that overexpression of <italic>FOXP2</italic> resulted in an increased phosphorylation level of MET in RWPE-1 cells, while knockdown of <italic>FOXP2</italic> resulted in a decreased phosphorylation level of MET in PC3 and LNCaP cells. Furthermore, we identified potential FOXP2-binding fragments in both <italic>MET</italic> and <italic>HGF</italic> using the CUT&amp;Tag method. Based on these findings, we speculate that the increased phosphorylation of MET may be due to the increased expression of MET itself and the increased expression of its ligand HGF.</p><p>Phase III clinical trials have shown that the MET kinase inhibitor cabozantinib has some clinical activity in patients with advanced prostate cancer, including conferring improvements in the bone scan response, radiographic progression-free survival, and circulating tumor cell conversion, although it failed to significantly improve overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sonpavde et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qiao et al., 2016</xref> provided experimental evidence that MET inhibition was only effective in prostate cancer cells with MET activation.

Briefly, Beads containing oligo (dT) were used to isolate poly (A) mRNA from total RNA. The mRNA was fragmented into short fragments by the fragmentation buffer. Using these short fragments as templates, random hexamer-primers were used for synthesization of the first-strand cDNA. After purification with the G-50 gel filtration spin-column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) to remove dNTPs, second-strand synthesis was performed by incubation with RNase H, DNA polymerase, and dNTPs containing dUTP (Promega). A single 3′ ‘A’ base was added to the end-repaired cDNA. Upon ligation with the Illumina PE adaptors, the products were gel-recovered and subsequently digested with N-glycosylase (UNG; Applied Biosystems) to remove the second-strand cDNA.

To annotate and categorize small RNAs into different classes, we filtered out small RNA reads that might be from known noncoding RNAs by comparing them with known noncoding RNAs, including rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and snoRNA, which were deposited in the Rfam database and the NCBI GenBank. Small RNA reads assigned to exonic regions were also discarded. After removing small RNA reads in term of the above categories, the rest were subjected to MIREAP, which identified miRNA candidates according to the canonical hairpin structure and sequencing data.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Paivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the FOXP2 data are compelling and convincing, it is not clear yet whether this effect is specific, or if FOXP2 is e.g. universally relevant for cell viability. Targeting FOXP2 by siRNA/shRNA in a non-transformed cell line would address this issue.</p><p>2) No data are presented for how FOXP2 regulates MET signaling. While the authors provide correlative data suggesting that FOXP2 could increase the expression of MET signaling components, it is not clear how FOXP2 controls MET levels. It would be of interest to search for and validate the importance of potential FOXP2 binding sites in or around MET and the genes of MET-associated proteins. At a minimum, it should be confirmed whether MET is a primary or secondary target of FOXP2. ChIP would easily address if it is direct regulation of MET and analysis of FOXP2 ChIP-seq could provide insights.</p><p>3) The authors claim that FOXP2 functions as an oncogene, but the most-severe phenotype that is observed in vivo, is PIN lesions, not tumors. While this is an exciting observation, it is not the full story of an oncogene. Can the authors justifiably claim that FOXP2 is an oncogene, based on these results?</p><p>4) Beyond the 2 fusions in the 100 PCa patient cohort it is unclear how FOXP2 is overexpressed in PCa. In the discussion and in FS5 some data are presented indicating amplification and CNAs, however, these are not directly linked to FOXP2 expression.</p><p>5) There are some hints that full-length FOXP2 and the FOXP2-CPED1 function differently. In SF2E the size/number of colonies between full-length FOXP2 and fusion are different. If the assay was run for the same length of time, then it indicates different biologies of the over-expressed FOXP2 and FOXP2-CPED1 fusion. Additionally, in F3E the sensitization is different depending on the transgene.</p><p>6) The authors are requested to report on what happened to the 4-gene MET signature in the FOXP2 knockdown cell models.</p><p>7) The authors are requested to test if overexpression of MET can rescue the anti-growth effects of FOXP2 knockdown in prostate cancer cells (positive or negative results would be informative).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Full-size westerns are required to assess the quality of these data, and this should be provided in a revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Increased FOXP2 expression in prostate cancer has been studied in depth in prior work such as that by Stumm et al. 2013 who evaluated FOXP2 protein levels via tissue microarrays covering &gt;11,000 prostate cancer specimens. Moreover, FOXP2's functional pro-cancer role in prostate cancer has also been demonstrated by other groups. So, while the implication of FOXP2 as a novel oncogene and driver of prostate cancer initiation appears novel, its role in promoting prostate cancer is known. Hence, the claims that &quot;the FOXP2 expression pattern in prostate cancer has remained unclear&quot; should be corrected.</p><p>The authors suggest that FOXP2 expression could guide the use of MET-targeting agents. However, given the presented mechanism of action, it is unclear if this would be any better than simply assessing the expression of MET.</p><p>More can be added regarding the newly identified FOXP2-CPED1 fusion. The authors should include in the main figures a figure illustrating the newly identified FOXP2-CPED1 fusion compared to wildtype and the domains retained or lost. In addition, it would strengthen the study if the existence of the fusion is corroborated in other clinical cohorts and whether it tracks with disease severity or is it only found in indolent prostate cancers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Other issues identified in the manuscript.</p><p>Identifying the fusion should not entirely be in the supplement. This is the initiating discovery that led to studying FOXP2 in PCa and explains the use of FOXP2-CPED1. Some panels in the supplement should be moved to the main manuscript.</p><p>The authors should be more explicit in their language when describing the soft agar experiments and make it very clear that many cell lines were made and tested in soft agar assays.</p><p>SF2J representative images are only high magnification and there is no quantification.</p><p>Figures 3A, 3B, 3F, and 3G should be quantified. These experiments should also be repeated (independent biological experiments) so that n=3. More details should also be provided. How long cells are treated with the drug for F3A, B is omitted. There are no total MET and AKT controls in F3C (critical to know if there is a stochiometric change in phosphorylation or if phospho-levels are up due to more protein). In F3I there is no vector control (do RWPE1 cells form colonies?). It is not clear how F3D and E are normalized. Are all samples normalized to the untreated vector, or is each line normalized to the untreated (is there an effect on 2D growth with FOXP2 over-expression)?</p><p>Figure 4C should be quantified. Higher magnification images (perhaps as an inset) should be shown. The pMET staining is unconvincing (perhaps too much counter-stain).</p><p>Not at all clear why FS5 data are in discussion. This data fits best in the Results.</p><p>Labeling of supplemental figures is not in accordance with <italic>eLife</italic>. There are some other formatting oddities, such as different font sizes in the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>FOXP2</italic> confers oncogenic effects in prostate cancer through activating MET signalling&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Paivi Ojala (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Comment 7. The authors are requested to test if overexpression of MET can rescue the anti- growth effects of FOXP2 knockdown in prostate cancer cells (positive or negative results would be informative).</p><p>Answer 7. We thank the reviewer very much for the comment. We rescued the expression of HA-tagged MET in FOXP2 knockdown PC3 cells and performed a cell proliferation assay. We observed that MET restoration partially reversed the change in the viability of FOXP2-KD prostate cancer cells (Figure C in response letter), which further supports the involvement of MET in FOXP2-induced oncogenic effect.</p><p>Response: The data does not support the conclusion. First, statistics cannot be performed within one replicate, but needs to be done in comparing different biological replicates. In doing so, I would conclude there is no statistically significant difference when MET is overexpressed or not. The authors should either change this conclusion or provide sufficient convincing data that would support this conclusion (which is not the case now).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Comment 3. Unfortunately, not a single chemical inhibitor is truly 100% specific. Therefore, the Foretinib and MK2206 experiments should be confirmed using shRNAs/KOs targeting MEK and AKT. With the inclusion of such data, the authors would make a very compelling argument that indeed MEK/AKT signalling is driving the phenotype.</p><p>Answer 3. We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point and we agree with the reviewer's point that no chemical inhibitor is 100% specific. In this study, we used chemical inhibitors to provide further supportive data indicating that FOXP2 confers oncogenic effects by activating MET signaling. We characterized a FOXP2-binding fragment located in MET and HGF in LNCaP prostate cancer cells by utilizing the CUT&amp;Tag method. We also found that MET restoration partially reversed oncogenic phenotypes in FOXP2-KD prostate cancer cells. All these data consistently supported that FOXP2 activates MET signaling in prostate cancer. Please refer to the &quot;Answer to Essential Revisions #2 from the Editors&quot; and to the &quot;Answer to Essential Revisions #7 from the Editors&quot; for details</p><p>Response: Without the use of shRNAs/siRNAs/KOs, the claim of MEK/AKT signalling driving the phenotype cannot be made. In this, the Cut&amp; Tag experiments don't help to address the issue, and the requested knockdown/knockout experiments should be provided.</p><p>Comment 6. The clinical and phenotypic observations are exciting and relevant. The mechanistic insights of the study are quite limited in the current stage. How does FOXP2 give its phenotype, and result in increased MET phosphorylation? The association is there, but it is unclear how this happens.</p><p>Answer 6. We appreciate this valuable suggestion. In the current study, we used the CUT&amp;Tag method to explore how FOXP2 activated MET signaling in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and we identified potential FOXP2-binding fragments in MET and HGF. Therefore, we proposed that FOXP2 activates MET signaling in prostate cancer through its binding to MET and MET- associated gene. Please refer to the &quot;Answer to Essential Revisions #2 from the Editors&quot; for details.</p><p>Response: The Cut&amp; Tag experiment provides information that MET may be under transcriptional control of FOXP2. However, this does not provide an indication of how it could affect signalling/ increased phosphorylation. This issue should be addressed</p><p>Comment 1. Full-size westerns are required to assess the quality of these data, and this should be provided in a revised version.</p><p>Answer 1. We thank the reviewer very much for the comment. As recommended, we provided all of the raw data from western blot analyses in the Source data files.</p><p>Response: Thank you for providing the raw data. However, in the current format, it's not possible for the reader to decipher what band is what. For example, for Figure 1 Supplement 2, raw data was provided, this is all is not labeled. The authors should provide proper labels to these files, so that it is clear which band in the raw data, was used in which subpanel of which figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Comment 4. Figure 4C should be quantified. Higher magnification images (perhaps as an inset) should be shown. The pMET staining is unconvincing (perhaps too much counter-stain).</p><p>Answer 4. We thank the reviewer very much for the valuable suggestions.

We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point and we agree with the reviewer's point that no chemical inhibitor is 100% specific. In this study, we used chemical inhibitors to provide further supportive data indicating that FOXP2 confers oncogenic effects by activating MET signaling. We characterized a FOXP2-binding fragment located in MET and HGF in LNCaP prostate cancer cells by utilizing the CUT&amp;Tag method. We also found that MET restoration partially reversed oncogenic phenotypes in FOXP2-KD prostate cancer cells.

While the authors provide correlative data suggesting that FOXP2 could increase the expression of MET signaling components, it is not clear how FOXP2 controls MET levels. It would be of interest to search for and validate the importance of potential FOXP2 binding sites in or around MET and the genes of MET-associated proteins. At a minimum, it should be confirmed whether MET is a primary or secondary target of FOXP2. ChIP would easily address if it is direct regulation of MET and analysis of FOXP2 ChIP-seq could provide insights.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer and editors for the comment, and we agree that it could be very informative, to test whether <italic>MET</italic> and its associated genes are bound by FOXP2 in prostate cancer. We employed Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) strategy<sup>5</sup>, which is an alternative method of ChIP-seq. As shown in Figure 3J-3K and Figure 3figure supplement 1A-1B, we identified potential FOXP2-binding fragments located in <italic>MET</italic> and <italic>HGF</italic> in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Combined with several lines of evidence supporting the implication of MET signaling in the <italic>FOXP2</italic>-induced oncogenic phenotype in vitro and in vivo in our study, our analysis of the CUT&amp;Tag data further supported that FOXP2 activates MET signaling in prostate cancer.</p><p>We added the following sentence to the Results section:</p><p>“Additionally, to test whether <italic>MET</italic> and its associated genes are bound by FOXP2, we carried out Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) assay (Kaya-Okur et al., 2019) in LNCaP cells overexpressing HAtagged <italic>FOXP2</italic>.

While this is an exciting observation, it is not the full story of an oncogene. Can the authors justifiably claim that FOXP2 is an oncogene, based on these results?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer very much for the comment, and we agree with the concerns of the reviewer and editors. Although <italic>FOXP2</italic> induces malignant transformation of human prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1) and can activate an oncogenic signaling pathway mediated by MET, we observed that <italic>FOXP2</italic> alone was not sufficient to cause cancer in the murine prostate.

To make our conclusion more persuasive, we made the corresponding revision in the tracked changes version of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Beyond the 2 fusions in the 100 PCa patient cohort it is unclear how FOXP2 is overexpressed in PCa.

In SF2E the size/number of colonies between full-length FOXP2 and fusion are different. If the assay was run for the same length of time, then it indicates different biologies of the over-expressed FOXP2 and FOXP2-CPED1 fusion. Additionally, in F3E the sensitization is different depending on the transgene.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer very much for the comment. In our study, repeated four-week colony formation assays exhibited that 21 of the 42 NIH3T3 cell lines expressing the <italic>FOXP2CPED</italic>1 fusion gained the ability for anchorage-independent growth, as did 10 of the 32 cell lines with <italic>FOXP2</italic> expression, indicating that <italic>FOXP2-CPED1</italic> and <italic>FOXP2</italic> show comparable effects on cell transformation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.23, by Fisher’s exact test). Similar observations were in RWPE-1 human prostate epithelial cells (<italic>P</italic> = 0.69, by Fisher’s exact test). Our data from the xenograft model indicated that cells expressing <italic>FOXP2</italic> generated tumors in 10/15 NOD/SCID mice and that <italic>FOXP2-CPED1</italic> cells produced tumors in 11/15 mice. Moreover, <italic>FOXP2</italic> and the <italic>FOXP2-CPED1</italic> fusion can induce PIN in mice, but neither was sufficient to cause prostate cancer in the transgenic mouse model. Collectively, these data suggested that <italic>FOXP2</italic> and the <italic>FOXP2-CPED1</italic> fusion produced similar oncogenic phenotypes. We consider that the resemblance observed between <italic>FOXP2</italic> fusion- and wild-type <italic>FOXP2</italic>-overexpressing cells could be because the FOXP2 fusion product retained the intact zinc-finger motif and forkhead DNA binding domain (Ile502-Arg584) (Figure 1C), which are required for transcriptional regulation of target genes<sup>6-9</sup>.

Increased FOXP2 expression in prostate cancer has been studied in depth in prior work such as that by Stumm et al. 2013 who evaluated FOXP2 protein levels via tissue microarrays covering &gt;11,000 prostate cancer specimens. Moreover, FOXP2's functional pro-cancer role in prostate cancer has also been demonstrated by other groups. So, while the implication of FOXP2 as a novel oncogene and driver of prostate cancer initiation appears novel, its role in promoting prostate cancer is known. Hence, the claims that &quot;the FOXP2 expression pattern in prostate cancer has remained unclear&quot; should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the correction. We agree with the reviewer’s concern. In the revised manuscript, to provide a more precise description, we deleted the sentence ‘the FOXP2 expression pattern in prostate cancer has remained unclear’ without changing the meaning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors suggest that FOXP2 expression could guide the use of MET-targeting agents. However, given the presented mechanism of action, it is unclear if this would be any better than simply assessing the expression of MET.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. In this study, we identified a significantly positive correlation between <italic>FOXP2</italic> expression and that of the four members of the MET pathway, including <italic>HGF</italic> and <italic>MET</italic>. Further functional assays showed that overexpression of <italic>FOXP2</italic> activated oncogenic MET signaling and that inhibition of MET signaling activation suppressed the <italic>FOXP2</italic>-induced oncogenic phenotype of human prostate cells. Moreover, we identified the binding of FOXP2 to <italic>MET</italic> and <italic>HGF</italic> in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. HGF binds its receptor MET, leading to MET activation. Therefore, we feel it would be worth evaluating <italic>FOXP2</italic> expression when the use of MET-targeting agents could be considered. We also agree that assessment of MET and phospho-MET protein level is an alternative strategy under such conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. More can be added regarding the newly identified FOXP2-CPED1 fusion. The authors should include in the main figures a figure illustrating the newly identified FOXP2-CPED1 fusion compared to wildtype and the domains retained or lost. In addition, it would strengthen the study if the existence of the fusion is corroborated in other clinical cohorts and whether it tracks with disease severity or is it only found in indolent prostate cancers.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these valuable comments. As suggested, we moved a schematic view of the FOXP2-CPED1 fusion protein as well as a set of data regarding the newly identified <italic>FOXP2</italic> fusion to Figure 1 to make our manuscript more informative. In addition, we monitored the statuses of the two patients carrying the <italic>FOXP2-CPED</italic>1 fusion mutation (PC_1 and PC_11).

In doing so, I would conclude there is no statistically significant difference when MET is overexpressed or not. The authors should either change this conclusion or provide sufficient convincing data that would support this conclusion (which is not the case now).</p><p>Answer: We thank the editors for the comments very much. We have provided additional biological replicates then performed statistical analyses. Even though we observed that the expression of HA-tagged MET in FOXP2 knockdown PC3 cell clones partially reversed cell growth, given that the efficiency of stable expression of MET is relatively low, the difference in restoration did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>Further revisions requested following the third round of review:</p><p>Additional round of response: please specify how these results are implemented in the paper, as apparently the data do not support the original conclusion. These results should thus be incorporated in the paper, and the conclusion updated that MET restoration apparently does not reverse the change in viability of FOXP2-KD prostate cancer cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors very much for the helpful comments.

Therefore, the Foretinib and MK2206 experiments should be confirmed using shRNAs/KOs targeting MEK and AKT. With the inclusion of such data, the authors would make a very compelling argument that indeed MEK/AKT signalling is driving the phenotype.</p><p>Answer 3. We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point and we agree with the reviewer's point that no chemical inhibitor is 100% specific. In this study, we used chemical inhibitors to provide further supportive data indicating that FOXP2 confers oncogenic effects by activating MET signaling. We characterized a FOXP2-binding fragment located in MET and HGF in LNCaP prostate cancer cells by utilizing the CUT&amp;Tag method. We also found that MET restoration partially reversed oncogenic phenotypes in FOXP2-KD prostate cancer cells. All these data consistently supported that FOXP2 activates MET signaling in prostate cancer.

In this, the Cut&amp; Tag experiments don't help to address the issue, and the requested knockdown/knockout experiments should be provided.</p><p>Answer: Following the comment, we knocked down MET in human prostate epithelial cells RWPE-1 overexpressing FOXP2 or FOXP2-CPED1 and observed decreased MET expression and decreased phosphor-AKT in the cells.
