differentiate themselves from organisms of different or even the same species. Allorecognition processes in filamentous fungi are essential to ensure identity of an interconnected syncytial colony to protect it from exploitation and disease. <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> has three cell fusion checkpoints controlling formation of an interconnected mycelial network. The locus that controls the second checkpoint, which allows for cell wall dissolution and subsequent fusion between cells/hyphae, <italic>cwr</italic> (cell wall remodeling)<italic>,</italic> encodes two linked genes, <italic>cwr-1</italic> and <italic>cwr-2</italic>. Previously, it was shown that <italic>cwr-1</italic> and <italic>cwr-2</italic> show severe linkage disequilibrium with six different haplogroups present in <italic>N. crassa</italic> populations. Isolates from an identical <italic>cwr</italic> haplogroup show robust fusion, while somatic cell fusion between isolates of different haplogroups is significantly blocked in cell wall dissolution. The <italic>cwr-1</italic> gene encodes a putative polysaccharide monooxygenase (PMO). Herein we confirm that CWR-1 is a C1-oxidizing chitin PMO. We show that the catalytic (PMO) domain of CWR-1 was sufficient for checkpoint function and cell fusion blockage; however, through analysis of active-site, histidine-brace mutants, the catalytic activity of CWR-1 was ruled out as a major factor for allorecognition. Swapping a portion of the PMO domain (V86 to T130) did not switch <italic>cwr</italic> haplogroup specificity, but rather cells containing this chimera exhibited a novel haplogroup specificity. Allorecognition to mediate cell fusion blockage is likely occurring through a protein–protein interaction between CWR-1 with CWR-2. These data highlight a moonlighting role in allorecognition of the CWR-1 PMO domain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>allorecognition</kwd><kwd>polysaccharide monooxygenase</kwd><kwd>somatic cell fusion</kwd><kwd>non-self-recognition</kwd><kwd>cell fusion checkpoint</kwd><kwd>chitin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Neurospora</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1818283</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rico-Ramírez</surname><given-names>Adriana M</given-names></name><name><surname>Glass</surname><given-names>N Louise</given-names></name><name><surname>Detomasi</surname><given-names>Tyler C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CHE-1904540</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Detomasi</surname><given-names>Tyler C</given-names></name><name><surname>Marletta</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Allorecognition in Neurospora crassa requires CWR-1 (cell wall remodeling protein), an essential process that ensures identity of an interconnected fungal syncytial colony and requires the CWR-1 polysaccharide monooxygenase domain, but not its catalytic activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allorecognition is the ability of a cell to recognize self or kin and has widespread importance for many organisms that have multicellular organization.

In vertebrate species, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is crucial for the immune response and allows cells to identify infected cells or cells that are no longer kin for destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afzali et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marino et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although not strictly multicellular, most filamentous fungi grow as an interconnected hyphal network that shares cytoplasm, nuclei, and nutrients, and utilizes allorecognition machinery to regulate this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gonçalves and Glass, 2020</xref>). This syncytial organization of filamentous fungi allows an interconnected colony to thrive in an environment that is heterogeneous for nutrients and habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anna et al., 2012</xref>). The formation of an interconnected mycelial network is a process that is controlled by communication and cell fusion checkpoints to help ensure that cells with higher genetic identity form a colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>). Without checkpoints, cell fusion can occur between genetically unrelated colonies and cells, allowing ‘cheater’ nuclei to steal resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastiaans et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grum-Grzhimaylo et al., 2021</xref>) or enabling the spread of cytoplasmic diseases such as mycoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang and Nuss, 2016</xref>) or selfish genetic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debets et al., 2012</xref>), which are spread via cell fusion throughout fungal populations.</p><p>The filamentous ascomycete species, <italic>Neurospora crassa,</italic> has three cell fusion checkpoints that function in allorecognition. The first checkpoint regulates chemotropic interactions between hyphae and/or germinated asexual spores (germlings) and is controlled by the determinant of communication (<italic>doc</italic>) locus that senses chemosignaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heller et al., 2016</xref>). Cells with identical allelic specificity at the <italic>doc</italic> locus undergo chemotropic interactions, while cells with alternate <italic>doc</italic> allelic specificity show greatly reduced interactions. The second checkpoint is regulated by the cell wall remodeling locus<italic>, cwr</italic>, which contains the two linked genes, <italic>cwr-1</italic> (UniProtKB Q1K703) and <italic>cwr-2</italic> (UniProtKB Q1K701) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves et al., 2019</xref>). Cells/hyphae with identical allelic specificity at <italic>doc</italic> and <italic>cwr</italic> undergo chemotropic interactions and, upon contact, undergo cell wall dissolution, membrane merger, and cytoplasmic mixing. However, if cells have identical <italic>doc</italic> specificity, but differ in <italic>cwr</italic> allelic specificity, hyphae/cells undergo chemotropic interactions, but upon contact, cells remain adhered and fail to undergo cell wall deconstruction and membrane merger at the point of contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves et al., 2019</xref>). The final checkpoint is a post-fusion checkpoint. Following chemotrophic interactions (<italic>doc</italic> alleles with identical allelic specificity) and cell fusion (<italic>cwr</italic> alleles with identical allelic specificity), if cells/hyphae differ in specificity at several post-fusion allorecognition loci, the fusion cell is compartmentalized and undergoes rapid cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daskalov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rico-Ramírez et al., 2022</xref>). Recent data in <italic>N. crassa</italic> showed that one of these post-fusion allorecognition loci has functional and structural similarity to mammalian gasdermin and confers rapid cell death via a pyroptotic-like mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corinne et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daskalov and Glass, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daskalov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rico-Ramírez et al., 2022</xref>) while in the related filamentous fungus, <italic>Podospora anserina</italic>, a different post-fusion cell death allorecognition locus has functional similarities to necroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saupe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saupe, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>cwr-1</italic> gene is predicted to encode a chitin-active polysaccharide monooxygenase (PMO) in the CAZy (Carbohydrate-Active enZYme) database designation of Auxiliary Activity 11 (AA11) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Levasseur et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>cwr-2</italic> gene encodes a predicted protein that contains eight transmembrane regions with two annotated domains of unknown function (PF11915). Within populations of <italic>N. crassa</italic>, <italic>cwr-1/cwr-2</italic> alleles show severe linkage disequilibrium and fall into six different haplogroups (HGs). Cells/germlings containing only CWR-1 from HG1 are blocked in cell fusion with isogenic cells containing only CWR-2 from a different haplogroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves et al., 2019</xref>). These data indicate that incompatible CWR-1-CWR-2 function in <italic>trans</italic> when present in different interacting cells and are necessary and sufficient to trigger the cell fusion block.</p><p>PMOs, alternatively referred to as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), have been studied extensively for over a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Phillips et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vaaje-Kolstad et al., 2010</xref>). These proteins were first discovered as auxiliary redox enzymes that greatly enhance cellulose degradation in combination with glycosyl hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris et al., 2010</xref>). Beyond just cellulolytic activity, other PMOs have been demonstrated to show activity on other polysaccharides such as chitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hemsworth et al., 2014</xref>), starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vu et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lo Leggio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vu and Marletta, 2016</xref>), xylans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couturier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hüttner et al., 2019</xref>), and various hemicelluloses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monclaro et al., 2020</xref>). PMOs have been of fundamental interest because they catalyze the hydroxylation of a strong C–H bond and their utility in industrial biofuel and nanocellulose applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johansen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreau et al., 2019</xref>). However, as more PMO families have been identified, other roles have been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vandhana et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hangasky et al., 2020</xref>), including in the life cycle of insect viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2015</xref>), insect development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sabbadin et al., 2018</xref>), fungal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maddi et al., 2012</xref>), and in symbiotic associations between bacteria and arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Distel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pinheiro et al., 2015</xref>). A family of related proteins termed X325 have a similar fold and bind copper but are not functional PMOs. Instead one member of this family has a unique biological role in copper transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia-Santamarina et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>All PMOs contain a secretion signal peptide that is cleaved, leaving the mature protein with an N-terminal histidine residue that binds a single copper atom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Phillips et al., 2011</xref>). Of the four other proteins characterized in the AA11 family, only a chitin-degradation role has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hemsworth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rieder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Støpamo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). Three of the four proteins have a similar protein architecture composed of an N-terminal PMO domain followed by a glycine serine (GS)-rich disordered linker and an X278 domain at the C-terminus. The X278 domain has been compared to CBM sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hemsworth et al., 2014</xref>). The recently published Alphafold structure in UniProt (UniProtKB Q1K703) shows two aromatic residues on the same side of a small predominant beta-sheet domain that may be positioned to bind polysaccharides. If this is a true CBM, it likely binds chitin as it is also found in GH18 chitinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hemsworth et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we assessed whether CWR-1 from each of the six different haplogroups has PMO activity and defined the substrate and products of that PMO activity. We also assessed whether CWR-1 proteins from each haplogroup formed unique products that would explain CWR-1 allelic specificity. By the further construction of PMO domain chimeras, we evaluated whether a polymorphic region of the PMO domain (LS and LC loop) was a factor in triggering allorecognition in interactions with CWR-2. Our data indicates that CWR-1 has chitin PMO activity, but that catalytic activity was not required for cell fusion blockage, highlighting an evolved and additional function of this PMO in allorecognition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The PMO domain of CWR-1 is sufficient to confer an allorecognition checkpoint</title><p>A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of characterized AA11s revealed that three of the four characterized PMOs maintain a three-part architecture, while the other is a single-domain PMO containing only a catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To more fully examine the relationships of predicted AA11 proteins, we performed sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis using the EFI-EST BLAST feature with the CWR-1<sup>HG1</sup> sequence as the search peptide, which yielded ~1700 sequences. The three characterized AA11 proteins and CWR-1 that contained the GS linker and X278 domain were found in a single cluster (blue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The single AA11 domain enzyme (<italic>Af</italic>AA11A) clustered separately into the red cluster. Since these domain architectures are clustered separately, this suggests a different biological function in fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is not solely due to the difference in domain organization, for example, starch PMOs with different architectures cluster together at ~40% sequence ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vu et al., 2019</xref>). To determine which domain of CWR-1 was involved in allorecognition and the fusion checkpoint, a series of truncations were generated in the HG1 (FGSC2489) <italic>cwr-1</italic> allele: full-length <italic>cwr-1</italic>, removal of the GS linker, and removal of the GS linker and X278 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Full-length and truncated constructs were inserted at the <italic>his-3</italic> locus under the native promoter (1111 bp) and transformed into a strain of <italic>N. crassa</italic> bearing a deletion of <italic>cwr-1</italic> (NCU01380) and <italic>cwr-2</italic> (NCU01382) (<italic>Δcwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic>) and expressing cytoplasmic GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves et al., 2019</xref>). These strains were assessed for cell fusion in pairings with isogenic strains containing the <italic>cwr-2</italic> allele from each of the HG strains (HG1-6). The <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup></italic> strain gave the strongest cell fusion block in pairings with <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG3</sup></italic> germlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). This <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG3</sup></italic> strain was therefore used to test strains harboring the <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup></italic> truncations that lacked the GS linker or the GS linker and the X278 domain. Strains containing any of the <italic>cwr-1</italic> truncations showed a block in cell fusion with the <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG3</sup></italic> strain, including the truncation strain with only the catalytic PMO domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). As a control, all of the truncation strains were also paired with a permissive mutant lacking <italic>cwr-1</italic> and <italic>cwr-2</italic> (<italic>Δcwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic>); all showed robust cell fusion frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). These data showed that the PMO catalytic domain was sufficient to cause cell fusion arrest at the CWR allorecognition checkpoint.</p><p>Given that the PMO catalytic domain alone was responsible for conferring allorecognition, we performed experiments to probe the activity for this domain. The PMO catalytic domain of the <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup></italic> allele was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> using the periplasmic expression pelB system, which cleaves scarlessly during expression to ensure an N-terminal histidine with a C-terminal cleavable hexahistidine tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and subsequently purified using Ni-IMAC. The protein ran slightly higher (~26–27 kDa) on an SDS-PAGE gel than the predicted size of 22.6 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>); the mass was validated with whole-protein mass spectrometry. The spectrum revealed a deconvoluted mass of 22,624 Da, which corresponds to the exact mass of the protein with three disulfide bonds (22,630 – 3 × (2 Da for each disulfide)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The CWR-1<sup>HG1</sup> PMO domain bound ~0.7 equivalents of copper after reconstitution and was shown to reduce oxygen to hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ascorbate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The activity of the CWR-1<sup>HG1</sup> protein was then tested with β-chitin as a substrate. New peaks between 18 and 22 min that corresponded to C1-oxidized products were only observed in the presence of both ascorbate and the CWR-1<sup>HG1</sup> PMO domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). C1-oxidized standards were generated from chitooligosaccharides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>) using the AA3, chitin-C1-oxidizing enzyme, ChitO (from <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). The ChitO-C1-oxidized oligosaccharides eluted at timepoints similar to the new peaks from CWR-1<sup>HG1</sup> PMO at around 18–22 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To further validate the CWR-1<sup>HG1</sup> C1 regioselectivity, tandem MS/MS was performed on the crude reaction from PMO<sup>HG1</sup> action on α-chitin in the presence of ascorbate. The resulting spectra were consistent with C1 oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). These data were in line with all other characterized AA11 PMOs that exhibit C1-oxidative activity on both α-chitin and β-chitin.</p><p>Our data showed that the PMO domain of CWR-1<sup>HG1</sup> was the driver for fusion arrest at the <italic>cwr</italic> allorecognition checkpoint. We therefore compared sequences of the PMO domain bioinformatically from the six different CWR-1 haplogroups.

We therefore tested whether these HG1-6 PMOs had differences in activity on a more physiologically relevant substrate, the cell wall from an HG1 strain (FGSC2489). This cell wall was purified and assessed as a substrate for the PMO domains from the six different CWR-1 haplogroups. New peaks that corresponded to C1-oxidized chitooligosaccharides and soluble chitooligosaccharides appeared only in the presence of both reductant and the PMO. The products from the CWR-1 PMOs from haplogroups 1,4 and 5 showed a similar pattern of four peaks in the C1-oxidized chitin fragments region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), whereas the CWR-1 PMO from haplogroups 2, 3, and 6 showed only two prominent C1-oxidized peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Since this pattern did not correlate with phenotypic aspects of cell fusion incompatibility for the six CWR-1 haplogroups, we attributed this result to small rate differences between the CWR-1 PMO domains from the different haplogroups and heterogeneity in the purified cell wall suspension. As a control, cell wall components from the Δ<italic>cwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic> strain were purified and used as a substrate. Although all six CWR-1 PMO haplogroups exhibited oxidized C1-oxidized products, there appeared to be two main groupings of peak patterns: CWR-1 from HG1 and 5 contained a third oxidized chitin fragment, while CWR-1 from HGs 2, 3, 4, and 6 showed only two prominent peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These data indicated that cell walls from both HG1 and the <italic>Δcwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic> strains were similar and that differences could be attributed to small rate differences or cell wall sample heterogeneity. Efforts to identify low-abundance carbohydrates or other potential products through ESI-MS were unsuccessful.</p><p>PMO activity was also determined on purified cell walls from a self-incompatible strain (<italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup>cwr-2<sup>HG1</sup>; cwr-1<sup>HG2</sup>);</italic> this strain shows reduced growth, asexual spore production, and lack of self-fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves et al., 2019</xref>). However, the pattern of products on this substrate for all six PMO domain haplogroups had very similar product profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The PMO reaction products from CWR-1<sup>HG1</sup> and CWR-1<sup>HG4</sup> on chitin and purified cell walls from FGSC2489 (HG1) and JW242 (HG4) strains were also used in the germling fusion assays. However, neither the addition of the PMO reaction products nor the cell walls from the incompatible strains blocked or reduced cell fusion frequencies between compatible strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Since there were no striking differences between CWR-1 PMO haplogroups for either products or substrates, the requirement for catalytic activity in fusion blockage was tested. In <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> alanine variants in the second histidine (corresponding to His78 for CWR-1<sup>HG1</sup>) of the histidine brace in AA10 PMOs (CBP21 and CbpD, respectively) disrupt PMO activity with no oxidized products observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Askarian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vaaje-Kolstad et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we constructed <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup></italic> and <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG6</sup></italic> variants containing His→Ala substitution of the first histidine (His20), a second set of variants containing a His→Ala substitution at H78 and double His→Ala substitutions (H20A; H78A). Similar to the WT PMOs, the variant proteins’ deconvoluted mass was consistent with three disulfides and confirmed the construct was correctly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These CWR-1 PMO His→Ala variants were assessed for catalytic activity, copper-binding, and/or subsequent hydrogen peroxide generation. All single and double histidine variants of PMO<sup>HG1</sup>, PMO<sup>HG6</sup>, and the Tyr→Ala variant PMO<sup>HG1</sup> were inactive on β-chitin, where no oxidative activity could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). PMO<sup>HG1</sup> H20A and H78A variants and PMO<sup>HG6</sup> H79A variants retained copper-binding after purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These variants were functional in an oxygen reduction assay but exhibited slightly lower rates as compared to WT CWR-1 PMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Both PMO<sup>HG1</sup> and PMO<sup>HG6</sup> His→Ala double variants greatly reduced copper-binding and had lower oxygen reduction rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). X-band continuous-wave EPR spectra were acquired for the WT PMO<sup>HG1</sup> and PMO<sup>H78A</sup> proteins. Both PMO<sup>HG1</sup> and its H78A variants bound copper; this active site copper center is in the Cu(II) oxidation state under aerobic conditions. Cu(II) has an S = 1/2 spin state, and EPR is a sensitive probe for the primary coordination sphere at the active site. The EPR spectra of the WT and H78A PMO<sup>HG1</sup> variant proteins were compared to identify any differences in Cu(II) binding between WT and H78A mutant PMO proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The WT PMO<sup>HG1</sup> spectrum is consistent with other reported PMOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frandsen et al., 2016</xref>) that contain axial Cu (II) sites with observed g values of g1 = 2.245, g2 = 2.065, and g3 = 2.005 with visible N–hyperfine splitting. The spectrum from the PMO<sup>HG1</sup> H78A variant is distinct from WT PMO<sup>HG1</sup>, displaying more splitting g2 and g3 values, indicative of a more rhombic coordination environment: g1 = 2.245, g2 = 2.08, and g3 = 2.05. The EPR differences between WT and the PMO H78A variant suggests a significant change to the primary coordination sphere of the Cu(II) ion and is presumably because the rigid histidine brace has been changed and replaced by water molecules. Since the PMO<sup>HG6</sup> variant proteins were not substantially different from the PMO<sup>HG1</sup> variant proteins, these results likely represent all the PMO proteins in the six haplogroups.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Characterization of CWR-1 polysaccharide monooxygenase (PMO) active-site variants.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Comparison of the ability of active-site variants of the PMO<sup>HG1</sup> and PMO<sup>HG6</sup> domains and their ability to degrade β-chitin.

Here, we further assessed these findings using an HG1 strain bearing a mutation in <italic>cwr-1</italic> (<italic>cwr-1</italic> <sup>HG1 Y159A</sup>) in a <italic>Δcwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic> deletion strain and paired with isogenic germlings bearing a <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG3</sup></italic> allele in a <italic>Δcwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic> background. In these pairings, a significant block in cell fusion was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). These data suggest that other genetic factors in the JW199 strain affected cell fusion frequencies when paired with the HG1 <italic>cwr-1</italic><sup>Y159A</sup> mutant in an otherwise FGSC2489 background. However, using isogenic strains here showed that allorecognition and a significant cell fusion block occurred between a strain bearing only CWR-1<sup>Y159A</sup> and a strain bearing only CWR-2<sup>HG3</sup>.</p><p>Mutations in the histidine brace resulted in chitin-inactive variants, although the purified PMO<sup>HG1</sup> H20A, PMO<sup>HG1</sup> H78A, and PMO<sup>HG6</sup> H79A variants could still bind copper. With the retention of copper, hydrogen peroxide could still be generated from these single His→Ala variants. We, therefore, tested whether the single histidine brace variants (H20A and H78A) and the double His→Ala variant (H20A; H78A) were affected in allorecognition and cell fusion. Isogenic fungal strains were constructed bearing HG1 <italic>cwr-1<sup>H20A</sup></italic>, <italic>cwr-1</italic><sup>H78A</sup>, and <italic>cwr-1</italic> <sup>H20A; H78A</sup> alleles.

Contrary to expectations, the single <italic>cwr-1</italic> histidine variants (H20A and H78A), including the inactive double mutant (H20A; H78A), still retained the ability to trigger allorecognition and block cell fusion when paired with germlings that expressed an incompatible <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG3</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). As a control, all the His→Ala <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup></italic> variants were paired with <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup> cwr-2<sup>HG1</sup></italic> (FGSC2489) germlings, and all underwent robust cell fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). These data rule out hydrogen peroxide generation as a contributing factor in blocking cell fusion as the copper-deficient <italic>cwr-1</italic><sup>H20A; H78A</sup> variant was not different from those that retained some copper-binding. Taken together, these data suggest that the <italic>cwr</italic> fusion block checkpoint is not dependent on enzymatic activity, and the CWR-1 PMO domain is not generating a signal to block cell fusion via a substrate preference or generated product.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PMO domain loops confer specificity for cell fusion block</title><p>Our data showed that the PMO domain is essential for allorecognition, but that catalytic activity of the PMO domain was not required. An examination of a homology model of the six different CWR-1 PMO haplogroups based on the structure of <italic>Ao</italic>AA11 revealed that differences appeared to be most significant in the region of the LS loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To assess whether this region of CWR-1 was important for conferring allorecognition specificity, we constructed a loop-swap chimeric construct: the first where the entire LS loop and surrounding amino acids from PMO<sup>HG1</sup> (I85 to G129) was replaced with the sequence from PMO<sup>HG6</sup> (V86 to T130) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). If this region of the CWR-1 protein was necessary for allelic specificity, the chimeric strains would have a higher fusion frequency with a <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG6</sup></italic> (in a <italic>Δcwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic> background) strain and a lower fusion frequency with the <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup> cwr-2<sup>HG1</sup></italic> strain or <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG1</sup></italic> in the <italic>Δcwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic> background. However, the <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup>LS <sup>HG6</sup></italic> chimera maintained the same specificity as HG1 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). These studies indicate that this region, which is different in all six CWR-1 PMO haplogroups, was insufficient to switch allelic specificity. A second chimeric construct was generated; this new chimera includes LS loop, L8 loop, and the first half of the LC loop. The L8 and LC regions showed differences between haplogroups in the MSA and homology models, but more so in the case of the LC region. We hypothesized that a combination of these three regions could impart specificity. The region I85 to D201 of CWR-1<sup>HG1</sup> was replaced with V86-D202 from CWR-1<sup>HG6</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1/HG6</sup></italic> chimera showed increased fusion percentages (~55%) with <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG6</sup></italic> cells, but a decreased fusion percentage (~35%) with both the HG1 strain (FGSC2489) and a <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG1</sup></italic> strain in the <italic>Δcwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). These results suggest that the V86-D202 region in CWR-1 contains some but not all required residues to elicit the allorecognition response. To determine whether we had created an allele with a new <italic>cwr-1</italic> specificity, we assessed fusion percentages of this chimera with strains bearing the other <italic>cwr-2</italic> haplogroup alleles in a <italic>Δcwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic> background. The <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1/HG6</sup></italic> chimeric strain showed fusion percentages of ~21, ~20, and~27% with strains bearing <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG2</sup></italic>, <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG3</sup></italic>, and <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG5</sup></italic>, but a higher fusion percentage with a <italic>cwr-2<sup>HG4</sup></italic> strain (~50%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Although the PMO domain is only one part of a multidomain protein (PMO, GS linker, and X278), its activity is similar to the characterized, single-domain AA11 PMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Støpamo et al., 2021</xref>). These data suggest that these two types of architectures in the context of chitin degradation may be redundant, that is, both architectures perform the same reaction that has been observed previously for AA9 and AA13 PMOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vu et al., 2019</xref>). The biological role of the long GS linker and carbohydrate-binding module remains unclear. However, this linker and carbohydrate-binding module may allow the CWR-1 protein to remain bound to the cell wall through chitin–protein interactions, which may be important for non-allorecognition functions, including CWR-1 PMO activity. This work shows that CWR-1 can degrade chitin present in the fungal cell wall, which may aid in cell wall dissolution; the <italic>Δcwr-1Δ81Δcwr-2</italic> mutant shows a slight delay in fusion between compatible cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gonçalves et al., 2019</xref>) and is thus consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>In biochemical analyses of the PMO domain catalytic function, it was surprising that several His→Ala variants still bound copper with 1:1 stoichiometry after reconstitution. Even though copper is bound, oxygen-dependent chitin turnover was abolished. The EPR of the bound copper showed the importance of the histidine brace in catalysis. Mutations of either the Cu-coordinating histidine or the non-coordinating axial tyrosine to alanine eliminated all catalytic activity on insoluble substrates. Previously, it was demonstrated that mutation of the axial tyrosine to phenylalanine in an AA10 PMO from <italic>Thermobifida fusca</italic> or an AA9 PMO from <italic>Hypocrea jecorina</italic> resulted in a less, but still active protein that maintains the ability to degrade phosphoric-acid swollen cellulose (PASC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kruer-Zerhusen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2020</xref>). In nature, PMOs without tyrosine in this position often have phenylalanine as a replacement. It may be that any aromatic residue is essential in this position for oxygen-dependent catalysis and has some role in forcing the copper into the correct geometry through longer-range structural interactions.</p><p>Peroxide-generating activity was observed in single CWR-1 histidine variants, yet subsequent Fenton-like chemistry that would cleave chitin did not occur. Thus, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the single histidine brace variants may retain the ability to bind copper and subsequently reduce oxygen, and while inactive on carbohydrate substrates, they will reduce O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and may elicit an oxidative response. However, the block in cell fusion observed in germlings carrying single histidine brace CWR-1 variants suggests that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is not a signal involved in cell fusion. The increase in cell fusion percentages in strains carrying truncated versions of <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup></italic>, or the histidine or tyrosine variants (~20%) in pairings with <italic>cwr-2</italic> incompatible cells, as compared to fusion percentages in strains with wild-type <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup></italic> (~6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>), may indicate that these changes may affect stability or alter CWR-1 conformational structure. Altogether, our data support that the catalytically dead CWR-1 variants still function to impose the cell wall remodeling checkpoint.</p><p>The region of the PMO domain essential for allelic specificity encompasses additional residues than what were swapped in the chimeric-loop constructs. As homology models may be inaccurate, changing alleles may require all three loops: L2, LS, and LC. More advanced structural studies would provide insight into the inter-haplogroup differences between CWR-1 proteins from the different haplogroups. The <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup> LS-L8-LC<sup>HG6</sup></italic> chimera showed a reduction in cell fusion percentages when paired with strains expressing <italic>cwr-2</italic> from any of the six different haplogroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These data suggest that the CWR-1<sup>HG1/HG6</sup> chimera expresses a functional protein capable of allorecognition and that this chimera may confer a novel <italic>cwr-1</italic> specificity. This <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup> LS-L8-LC<sup>HG6</sup></italic> chimera will be useful in defining domains of CWR-2 that confer haplogroup allelic specificity and raises the possibility of constructing a new <italic>cwr</italic> haplogroup by the construction of a <italic>cwr-2</italic> chimera that is fully compatible with strains carrying the <italic>cwr-1<sup>HG1</sup> LS-L8-LC<sup>HG6</sup></italic> chimera. It should be noted, however, that wild isolates contain both <italic>cwr-1</italic> and <italic>cwr-2</italic> alleles, and thus potentially two incompatible <italic>cwr-1-cwr-2</italic> interactions can be triggered during the cell fusion process.</p><p>There are several examples of proteins that have been co-opted by biology to perform a completely different role in the cell. This behavior is termed ‘moonlighting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeffery, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeffery, 2018</xref>) and includes enzymes that form structural components of mammalian eyeball lenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Piatigorsky, 1998</xref>), an aconitase that acts as an iron sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gunawardena et al., 2016</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A moonlighting function of a chitin polysaccharide monooxygenase, CWR-1, in allorecognition in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jean-Guy Berrin (Reviewer #1); Katja Salomon Johansen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was a strong consensus among the reviewers that this is a very rigorous and well-executed study. There is a series of suggestions that I ask you to consider as you revise your manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have only a list of comments that may help the authors to improve the manuscript before publication:</p><p>– In the abstract please define cwr.</p><p>– The term moonlighting has already been used by others in the PMO/LPMO field. In the abstract and line 923, it feels as if the authors were using this term for the first time in this field.</p><p>– The authors should mention that PMOs are also called LPMOs.</p><p>– Line 29: which domain? The catalytic domain?</p><p>– Line 36: CWR-1.</p><p>– Several times a space is missing before or after (refs).</p><p>– Line 97: Is it the right ref??? Levasseur et al.</p><p>– Line 110: Moreau et al. refer to the production of nanocellulose and not to biofuels. Please correct the sentence accordingly.</p><p>– Lines 111-115: the authors could quote the review &quot;On the expansion of biological functions of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases by Vandhana et al. New Phytologist.</p><p>– Line 122: What is a domain similar in sequence to X278? Please clarify this statement. Later in the manuscript, the authors make the assumption that the X278 binds to chitin but it would have been good to test the binding of this domain (or full-length PMO) to chitin or fungal cell wall to strengthen the hypothesis.</p><p>– Line 123: GH18 (without hyphen).</p><p>– Line 345: what is ChitO? Which type of enzyme? A chitooligosaccharide oxidase? From which organism? Which CAZy family?</p><p>– Figure 1: The units of the oxygen reduction assay look a bit odd: 540 nm min-1? Same comment in the other figures.</p><p>– Line 540-543: a reference is needed (AA9 nomenclature of loops).</p><p>– Figure 3B: Are the GS linkers always the same length?</p><p>– Figures 5A and B: inactive mutants seem to release some non-oxidized chitin oligomers. Is it due to binding?</p><p>– It would be better to name chitooligosaccharides as chitobiose, triose, … and not as trimer, tetramer… which might be misleading. Another way is to mention their degree of polymerisation (DP).</p><p>– Line 871: not clear.</p><p>– Lines 932-941: I don't understand why the authors speculate that CWR-2 could act as electron donors (like CDH) if the activity of CWR-1 is not required for cell fusion blockage. By the way, <italic>N. crassa</italic> displays a CDH. Do the authors know if the CDH gene is co-regulated with cwr-1?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Main comment:</p><p>The manuscript is quite long. However, because the enzyme activity – or rather lack of- is central to this work, the authors should pay more attention to the recent literature concerning the (lack of) reactivity of similar mono-nuclear proteins. In particular, the work directly comparing the reactivity of LPMO with the X325 (named Bim1) from Cryptococcus and the bacterial copper chaperone CopC is relevant. Importantly, Bim1 functions together with the copper transporter CTRL1. Could the interaction between cwr-1 and cwr-2 turn out to be similar in the sense that it has more to do with copper than with catalysis?</p><p>In my view, no further data are required for publication. However, a closer look at the copper affinity and potential redox activity of the mutant cwr-1 seems to be an important follow-up to this study. The &quot;oxygen reduction assay&quot; using amplex red use here is not the best choice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would suggest the authors to better characterise the X278 domain and show that it binds to chitin and/or cell walls of Neurospora. While this is expected, it is interesting to include it to further strengthen the model.</p><p>Furthermore, is CWR-1 demonstrated to sit on the outer cell surface? Is there experimental data available to warrant this claim?</p><p>Finally, in the model both germlines have a set of proteins involved in cell fusion (as depicted in Figure 7B). Are both systems active and required to get fusion, or is one enough (as shown in 7C)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80459.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have only a list of comments that may help the authors to improve the manuscript before publication:</p><p>– In the abstract please define cwr.</p></disp-quote><p>Definition added (line 21-22 in tracked changes manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The term moonlighting has already been used by others in the PMO/LPMO field.

We have references to reviews on this topic in the introduction (Vandhana et al. 2022, Hangasky et al. 2020) (Line 111-112) and to clarify that others have used this term to describe the observation that PMOs and related proteins that are not PMOs perform other unrelated functions (line 947-959). Additional text about X325 proteins has also been added to the introduction (line 115-118). Below, in response to reviewer #2, we discuss the definition of “moonlighting” and those comments are equally relevant here. It is worthy of note that true “moonlighting” as defined, namely a single polypeptide with two distinct functions applies to CWR-1, but not to all PMOs whose physiological function is distinct from the catalytic activity and where catalytic activity has yet to be demonstrated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should mention that PMOs are also called LPMOs.</p></disp-quote><p>We mention this additional nomenclature in line 99, so no change is necessary. Although almost alone in this, we do not use the LPMO nomenclature. The reasoning is simple. After hydroxylation, the unstable glycosyl linkage breaks without enzymatic intervention. There is no evidence for such intervention (for example general base catalysis). An analogous situation is with the cytochrome P450s. For example, when these enzymes hydroxylate a position α to an amine (a dealkylation reaction), the carbinolamine generated falls apart on its own. The enzyme does not participate; hence they are not called lytic cytochrome P450s.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 29: which domain?

Is it due to binding?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the fine attention to detail. Some of the signal is due to ascorbate. There may be very minor amounts of non-oxidized oligomers due to weak hydrolytic activity as observed with other PMOs or as the reviewer suggests may be from binding to the substrate. However, the amount present does not appear to be relevant when compared to WT traces and, most importantly, there are no oxidized peaks present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be better to name chitooligosaccharides as chitobiose, triose, … and not as trimer, tetramer… which might be misleading.

By the way, <italic>N. crassa</italic> displays a CDH. Do the authors know if the CDH gene is co-regulated with cwr-1?</p></disp-quote><p>After consideration of the reviewers’ comments, we agree that this speculation is not related or necessary for the story and could cause confusion. We therefore removed this entire paragraph from the discussion. CDHs have been shown to be partners with AA9s and are active on cellobiose, which matches the cellulose substrate of AA9 enzymes. In the context of AA11 enzymes, it is not clear why CDH would be present with AA11s that are active on chitin substrates. Additional experimentation is needed to make a more definitive claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Main comment:</p><p>The manuscript is quite long. However, because the enzyme activity – or rather lack of- is central to this work, the authors should pay more attention to the recent literature concerning the (lack of) reactivity of similar mono-nuclear proteins. In particular, the work directly comparing the reactivity of LPMO with the X325 (named Bim1) from Cryptococcus and the bacterial copper chaperone CopC is relevant. Importantly, Bim1 functions together with the copper transporter CTRL1. Could the interaction between cwr-1 and cwr-2 turn out to be similar in the sense that it has more to do with copper than with catalysis?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a good point. Bim1 (and other X325 proteins), while sharing a similar fold and copper binding site, are not a PMO, and to date catalytic activity has not been observed on any polysaccharide substrate. CWR-1 is active on chitin, and has an additional role in allorecognition, which does not involve catalysis. CWR-1 is not involved in copper transport since a variant that no longer binds copper is still functional in allorecognition, whereas in Bim1, the copper site is required for transport. We have referenced this class of proteins that are not PMOs in the introduction (lines 115-118).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In my view, no further data are required for publication. However, a closer look at the copper affinity and potential redox activity of the mutant cwr-1 seems to be an important follow-up to this study. The &quot;oxygen reduction assay&quot; using amplex red use here is not the best choice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you and we agree with this comment. The Amplex Red assay shows clearly that the enzyme is competent for oxygen reduction. The double His mutant is the essential variant for this paper and no longer binds copper. It would, of course, have no oxygen reduction activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would suggest the authors to better characterise the X278 domain and show that it binds to chitin and/or cell walls of Neurospora. While this is expected, it is interesting to include it to further strengthen the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting and worthwhile experiment, however since the X278 domain does not appear to be important for the observed phenotype this will be pursued in follow up studies as is not directly relevant to the process of allorecognition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, is CWR-1 demonstrated to sit on the outer cell surface? Is there experimental data available to warrant this claim?</p></disp-quote><p>CWR-1 has a signal peptide and predicted cleavage at the histidine site that is common in PMO that are secreted. We were unable to observe GFP-labeled CWR-1 in live cells using the native promoter, but observed both intracellular and membrane localization in an overexpression strain. To fully understand the localization of both CWR-1 and CWR-2 during growth and during a fusion block, we believe that immunogold labeling and TEM are necessary, which will be pursued in further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, in the model both germlines have a set of proteins involved in cell fusion (as depicted in Figure 7B). Are both systems active and required to get fusion, or is one enough (as shown in 7C)?</p></disp-quote><p>In wild type cells, both CWR-1 and CWR-2 are present, making it possible that the fusion block could be triggered by two incompatible CWR-1/CWR-2 interactions. In our simplified system, we showed that, in otherwise isogenic strains, one incompatible CWR-1/CWR-2 interaction is sufficient to trigger allorecognition and a block in cell fusion and which function <italic>in trans</italic> (CWR-1 in one cell in interactions with incompatible CWR-2 in a separate cell is sufficient to trigger cell fusion arrest). While both incompatible combinations of CWR-1 and CWR-2 are present in wild type cells, Figure 7C simplifies this model to explain what was shown in this study. One CWR-1/CWR-2 mismatch is enough, but we note in the text and figure legend that both are present and result in a potential redundancy in this mismatch recognition.</p></body></sub-article></article>
