However, the mechanisms of microbiome–brain interaction in AD were so far unknown. Here, we identify microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFA) as microbial metabolites which promote Aβ deposition. Germ-free (GF) AD mice exhibit a substantially reduced Aβ plaque load and markedly reduced SCFA plasma concentrations; conversely, SCFA supplementation to GF AD mice increased the Aβ plaque load to levels of conventionally colonized (specific pathogen-free [SPF]) animals and SCFA supplementation to SPF mice even further exacerbated plaque load. This was accompanied by the pronounced alterations in microglial transcriptomic profile, including upregulation of ApoE. Despite increased microglial recruitment to Aβ plaques upon SCFA supplementation, microglia contained less intracellular Aβ. Taken together, our results demonstrate that microbiota-derived SCFA are critical mediators along the gut-brain axis which promote Aβ deposition likely via modulation of the microglial phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>amyloid</kwd><kwd>metabolites</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Vascular Dementia Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dichgans</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Liesz</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STE847/6-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steiner</surname><given-names>Harald</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-StG 802305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liesz</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001656</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Zukunftsthema &quot;Immunology and Inflammation&quot;)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haass</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NCL Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tahirovic</surname><given-names>Sabina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010146</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer Forschung Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tahirovic</surname><given-names>Sabina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA1737/16-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haass</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2145 SyNergy -

The identification of several AD risk genes such as TREM2, CD33, or CR1 as key regulators of microglial function triggered mechanistic studies revealing the contribution of the brain’s resident innate immune cells to AD pathology. In particular, triggering microglial phagocytic clearance of Aβ can reduce amyloid plaque pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). Besides the already well-acknowledged contribution of amyloidogenic protein processing and neuroinflammation to AD pathology, the gut microbiome is emerging as a novel and highly relevant modifier of brain pathology. A key function of the gut microbiome has been established over the past decades in a number of neurological diseases spanning across neurodevelopment, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tremlett et al., 2017</xref>). For example, we have previously described an intricate bidirectional link between the gut and brain after acute stroke, where stroke changes the gut microbiota composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). In turn, post-stroke dysbiosis induced changes in the immune response to stroke. Most importantly, the gut microbiota composition can be modulated to improve the disease outcome in stroke and other neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benakis et al., 2020</xref>), a finding that was robustly reproduced across disease entities and laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cryan and O'Mahony, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Only recently, a role of gut microbiota was also established in AD. AD patients have an altered gut microbiome compared to matched control patients, characterized by reduced species diversity and an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vogt et al., 2017</xref>). Similar findings were obtained in 5xFAD and APPPS1 amyloidosis mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandscheid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harach et al., 2017</xref>). Other studies have identified that antibiotic treatment-induced changes in microbiota composition as well as microbial deficiency in germ-free (GF) animals were associated with reduced Aβ pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dodiya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Minter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Minter et al., 2016</xref>). This effect could result from reduced Aβ production or increased clearance. Interestingly, GF animals as well as antibiotic-mediated dysbiotic animals exhibited reduced microglial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Minter et al., 2017</xref>). While previous studies documented a link between the gut microbiome and Aβ pathology, the underlying mechanisms and molecular mediators remain elusive. To address this key question, we generated a GF amyloidosis mouse model which allowed us to explore and identify bacterial metabolites that mediate gut-brain axis in AD. Moreover, we performed a detailed analysis of the gut microbiome’s impact on amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation, in order to differentiate between direct effects on Aβ generation and effects mediated via microglial cells. Our findings identify microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFA), bacterial fermentation products of fiber, as the sufficient mediator to promote Aβ plaque deposition. We further identified microglial transcriptomic and functional alterations that may underscore increased Aβ deposition triggered by SCFA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The gut microbiome promotes AD pathology</title><p>In order to study mechanisms of microbiota–brain interaction in AD, we generated a GF amyloidosis mouse model (APPPS1) by embryo transfer into axenic mice. GF APPPS1 mice were generated independent of previous studies using a similar approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Minter et al., 2016</xref>). In accordance with these reports, we also observed a striking reduction in cerebral Aβ plaque load in 5 months old GF APPPS1 animals compared to their littermate GF APPPS1 animals which have been naturally recolonized (Rec) or APPPS1 mice housed under conventional, specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although not powered to specifically investigate sex differences, an increase of plaque load by bacterial colonization was apparent also in a sex-specific analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Correspondingly, GF APPPS1 mice demonstrated a significantly better cognitive performance in a spatial memory task compared to recolonized and SPF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We further analyzed the size distribution of Aβ plaques between the GF and SPF animals using an automated analysis paradigm of three-dimensional plaque segmentation and quantification in the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peters et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This showed that GF mice display a significantly decreased density of small (4–8 µm) Methoxy-X04-positive plaques compared to SPF, while larger plaques were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This result suggests that bacterial colonization might preferentially affect plaque formation rather than plaque growth.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Germ-free APPPS1 mice show reduced Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images and analysis of brain cortices from 5 months old germ-free (GF), naturally recolonized (Rec) and conventionally colonized (specific pathogen-free [SPF]) APPPS1 mice immunostained for Aβ (clone 6E10).

Previous studies have demonstrated that SCFA (acetate, butyrate, and propionate) are metabolites produced by the gut microbiota which are critical mediators in various brain diseases such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dalile et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we quantitatively analyzed the total plasma SCFA concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and propionate (C:2 C:4 SCFA) using gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) based analysis in GF, recolonized and SPF mice. We observed an increase in plasma concentrations for all three SCFA in SPF APPPS1 mice compared to GF conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In order to study a causal link between SCFA and Aβ deposition, we performed a SCFA supplementation experiment by providing SCFA to GF APPPS1 mice. We used a combination of all three SCFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), because all three were affected in plasma by bacterial colonization and this combination was also used by us and others in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sadler et al., 2020</xref>). In accordance with previous reports, the used amounts of supplemented SCFA in the drinking water were sufficient to normalize plasma SCFA levels comparable to SPF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, SCFA supplementation of GF APPPS1 mice was sufficient to nearly double cerebral Aβ plaque load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Next, we treated SPF APPPS1 mice (4 weeks supplementation, starting at 8 weeks of age) in order to test a bona fide disease-promoting function of SCFA.

First, we explored potential direct effects of SCFA on amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression and processing by immunoblot analysis of brain tissue of GF APPPS1 mice with SCFA or control supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In accordance with the histological plaque load analysis, we identified markedly increased Aβ levels in SCFA- compared to control-supplemented GF APPPS1 mice. However, levels of the full-length APP (APP FL) were comparable between the groups. We observed only a mildly reduced ratio of the APP C-terminal fragment (CTFs) C83 (** in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, produced by ADAM10 cleavage) and C99 (* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, produced by BACE1 cleavage). However, this slightly increased amyloidogenic APP processing upon SCFA supplementation to GF APPPS1 mice is unlikely to explain alone the substantially increased levels of Aβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We further analyzed protein levels of secretases responsible for APP processing (BACE1, ADAM10, and a catalytic subunit of γ-secretase PSEN1), but could not detect any alterations upon the SCFA supplementation of GF APPPS1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Moreover, using an in vitro γ-secretase activity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we show that addition of SCFA does not change γ-secretase activity or processivity as reflected by comparable levels of total Aβ and unaltered profiles of Aβ species (Aβ37, 38, 40, and 42/43) in this cell free assay. In contrast to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ho et al., 2018</xref>), we could exclude a direct effect of SCFA on Aβ aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) as similar Aβ aggregation kinetics were determined in the presence or absence of SCFA in a Thioflavin T aggregation assay. Taken together, our data suggest that increased levels of Aβ triggered by SCFA in vivo are not mediated by major quantitative or qualitative changes in Aβ production but may rather be triggered by alterations in Aβ deposition and clearance.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) mildly increase amyloidogenic processing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis and (<bold>B</bold>) its densitometry quantification of 3 months old brain homogenates of control (Ctrl)- and SCFA-supplemented germ-free (GF) APPPS1 animals.

We observed increased microglial recruitment to Aβ plaques in SCFA- compared to control-treated APPPS1 GF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we investigated the influence of bacterial colonization on microglial reactivity in the WT background. To this end, we injected brain homogenates from 8 months old APPPS1 mice containing abundant Aβ into the hippocampus of GF or SPF WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and subsequently analyzed microglial abundance and <italic>Trem2</italic> mRNA expression as a marker of microglial activation by smFISH.

Moreover, microglia in SPF mice expressed significantly more <italic>Trem2</italic> mRNA puncta per microglia compared to GF WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Next, we questioned whether this SCFA-induced change in microglial recruitment and reactivity might also be associated with an altered phagocytic capacity of microglia, which is one of the most intensively investigated microglial functions in the context of AD. Therefore, we assessed the recruitment of microglia to Aβ plaques and their phagocytic uptake. This was analyzed by SCFA- or control-treatment in SPF APPPS1 mice to avoid potential counteracting effects of GF mice on microglial recruitment or phagocytosis. Corresponding to the increased recruitment and reactivity in GF SCFA-supplemented mice, we also observed a significantly increased microglial recruitment to Aβ plaques in SCFA-supplemented SPF APPPS1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

However, the mechanisms by which the microbiome modulates disease progression and the molecular mediators along the gut-brain axis have remained unknown. In this study, we identified microbiota-derived SCFA as microbial metabolites contributing to Aβ plaque deposition in the brain. GF APPPS1 mice have markedly reduced SCFA concentrations and reduced plaque load, and supplementation with SCFA is sufficient to mimic the microbiome’s effect and increase Aβ plaque burden. We identified microglia as the key cell population responsive to SCFA and increased microglial ApoE may mediate accelerated Aβ deposition during early stages of amyloidogenesis.</p><p>The gut bacteria have an intricate function in preserving the integrity of an intestinal–epithelial barrier, but exceeding this function, they have also been demonstrated to be critical for shaping the immune system, host metabolism, and nutrient processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bäckhed et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hooper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Round et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the functions of the gut microbiome extend beyond the intestinal tract. With their rich repertoire of antigens, metabolites, and direct interaction with the autonomic nervous system the microbiome potently influences remote organ function including the brain. The microbiome plays an important role in microglial maturation during development and in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Haq et al., 2019</xref>). Previously believed to be shielded from the peripheral immune system and blood-borne mediators, it became apparent that the brain is accessible for microbial metabolites to affect cerebral immunity in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Haq et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janakiraman and Krishnamoorthy, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In accordance with our observation of SCFA to be the mediator along the gut-brain axis in AD, multiple lines of evidence have indicated that SCFA might be the key microbial metabolite group acting on brain function. Particularly, SCFA have been demonstrated to induce microglial maturation using a similar analysis paradigm by SCFA supplementation in GF mice as used in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erny et al., 2015</xref>). In a Parkinson’s disease mouse model, SCFA were sufficient to induce neuroinflammation and disease progression in the absence of the gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sampson et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, SCFA have been implicated in a wide range of brain disorders or physiological functions under cerebral control such as mood disorders, autism spectrum disease, or energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cryan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van de Wouw et al., 2018</xref>).

One previous clinical study focusing on the association between SCFA concentration and AD disease burden suggested a correlation between amyloid load and blood SCFA concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marizzoni et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, all these clinical evidence of a potential association between SCFA concentrations and disease progression in AD is rather preliminary and requires confirmation in prospectively recruited and larger cohorts.</p><p>Over the past decade, microglial cells have come into the focus of experimental AD research. This has been driven by the identification of several genetic AD risk loci being associated with microglial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Long and Holtzman, 2019</xref>). Moreover, microglia have been demonstrated in murine AD models to actively contribute to various pathophysiological process in AD such as plaque seeding, plaque phagocytosis, and neuronal dysfunction by synaptic pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heneka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heneka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sarlus and Heneka, 2017</xref>). Previous proof-of-concept studies investigating a potential role of the microbiome in AD have already indicated an effect of microbial colonization or antibiotic treatment on microglial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dodiya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Minter et al., 2017</xref>). Although previous studies did not reveal a mechanistic link between microbiome function and Aβ plaque pathology, they have reproducibly shown that microbiota eradication (GF mice) or impairing the microbiome’s metabolic function (antibiotic treatment) reduced microglial activation and Aβ plaque load, which is in accordance with our study. This may at first glance appear contradicting with the research hypothesis supporting microglial activation and their corresponding increased phagocytic clearance as an approach to reduce Aβ plaque load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guillot-Sestier et al., 2015</xref>). However, we should bear in mind a potentially dual nature of microglial responses and their concomitant beneficial and detrimental roles in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewcock et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, previous studies have unequivocally demonstrated a role of microglia in promoting plaque seeding and growth, particularly at early stages of AD pathology. For example, microglia have been attributed to promote plaque seeding by the release of pro-inflammatory protein complexes, the so-called ASC specks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Venegas et al., 2017</xref>). A recent elegant study using sustained microglia depletion starting before plaque pathogenesis revealed a critical role of microglia in the formation of Aβ plaques and plaque density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spangenberg et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, preventing microglial activation, such as upon loss of Trem2, increased amyloid seeding due to reduced phagocytic clearance of Aβ seeds, but at the same time reduced plaque-associated ApoE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parhizkar et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that ApoE co-aggregates with Aβ fibrils and contributes to plaque seeding and plaque core stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liao et al., 2015</xref>), thus underscoring the complexity of microglia–ApoE interactions during amyloidogenesis.</p><p>ApoE is predominantly produced by astrocytes under physiological conditions, but upregulated in AD microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sala Frigerio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sebastian Monasor et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, microglial depletion in the 5xFAD mouse model resulted in a marked reduction of plaque-associated ApoE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spangenberg et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study we identified upregulation of microglial ApoE expression. We hypothesize that increased ApoE expression may contribute to SCFA-driven microglial activation and increased plaque load. However, final proof for this link requires investigation of SCFA effects in mice with microglia-specific ApoE depletion and awaits future studies.</p><p>SCFA use membrane-receptors as well as receptor-independent mechanisms to enter target cells and exert their functions. Receptors specifically activated by SCFA (free fatty-acid receptor-2 and -3) have been identified in several organs, including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Layden et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, the SCFA can also freely enter target cells by simple diffusion or fatty acid transporters and exert their biological function intracellularly, independent of specific receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moschen et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the most likely target mechanism to interfere with SCFA effects in microglia could be on the level of chromatin remodeling and regulation of target gene expression as it has previously been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huuskonen et al., 2004</xref>). However, the detailed mechanistic understanding of SCFA on microglial transcriptomic and functional regulation remains unclear and requires future investigations.</p><p>Besides direct effects on brain function including glial cell homeostasis, SCFA can also affect peripheral immune cells and thereby indirectly modulate neuroinflammatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cryan et al., 2019</xref>). SCFA have been demonstrated to be potent immune modulators particularly of T cell function and their polarization into pro- and anti-inflammatory subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, we have previously demonstrated that the effect of SCFA on post-stroke recovery in an experimental brain ischemia model was dependent on circulating T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sadler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sadler et al., 2017</xref>). In these previous studies, circulating T cells mediated the effects of SCFA on the cerebral micromilieu either by their reduction in cerebral invasion or by polarization of the secreted cytokine profile. However, in contrast to AD, stroke induces a pronounced neuroinflammatory response to the acute tissue injury with the invasion of large numbers of circulating T cells, which have been demonstrated to contribute substantially to stroke pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cramer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liesz et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, while the peripheral polarization of T cells and their consecutive impact on local neuroinflammation is conceivable after stroke, this pathway seems less likely in AD with only very limited invasion of circulating immune cells into the brain, particularly in the early stages of AD pathology. Moreover, the effect of SCFA on the peripheral immune compartment is most likely site-dependent and might occur within the intestinal wall, blood circulation of secondary lymphatic organs. It is a limitation of this study that SCFA supplementation was performed only by oral administration (in drinking water) which might lead to unphysiologically high SCFA concentrations in the upper gastrointestinal tract while physiological SCFA as fermentation products of the microbiota occurs predominantly in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morrison and Preston, 2016</xref>). While site-specific effects of SCFA and differing resorption routes were beyond the scope of the present proof-of-concept study, these aspects are critical for the clinical translation and require further studies.</p><p>Interestingly, the biological effect of SCFA on microglia seems to be largely dependent on the specific disease condition. While SCFA in neurodegenerative conditions, as also in our study, have been associated with microglial reactivity and activation, their function in primary autoimmune and acute brain disorders has mainly been described to be anti-inflammatory. For example, we have been previously shown that SCFA treatment promotes anti-inflammatory mechanisms and improve neuronal function in ischemic stroke and similar findings have also been reported in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haghikia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sadler et al., 2020</xref>). The detailed cause of this divergent functions of SCFA in different disease conditions is currently still unknown and requires further exploration for the potential use of personalized treatment approaches. Yet, in light of our results in the AD compared to the stroke model, it seems likely that the different effects of SCFA treatment on disease outcome could be due to engaging different mechanistic routes, such as peripheral lymphocyte polarization in EAE and stroke versus local effects on microglia in AD.</p><p>Our study suggests that SCFA-regulated pathways might be promising drug targets in the peripheral circulation for early-stage AD to prevent microglial activation, ApoE production, and the development of amyloid pathology. However, the therapeutic targeting and neutralization of SCFA, e.g. by specific SCFA-scavengers, in order to chronically reduce circulating SCFA blood concentrations is currently not established. Also attempting to reduce SCFA concentrations by reduction of nutritional fiber intake is not a feasible therapeutic approach. Reduced fiber intake correlates with increased risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Furthermore, dietary fiber restriction will most likely not be efficient to affect microglial activation in early-stage AD because a near-complete reduction of blood SCFA concentrations, as seen in GF mice, will not be achieved by dietary intervention.</p><p>In conclusion, our study identifies SCFA as molecular mediators along the gut-brain axis in AD. Identification of this novel pathway will open up new avenues for therapeutic targeting of the microbiome-SCFA-microglia axis to reduce the inflammatory impact on AD development.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Free floating 30 µm sagittal brain sections have been permeabilized and blocked for 1 hr in PBS/0.5% Triton x-100/5% normal goat serum (NGS). Next, samples have been incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody anti β-amyloid (Aβ) (clone 6E10, 1:500, BioLegend) diluted in blocking buffer and stained with the corresponding goat secondary antibody. Immunostainings have been performed on six brain sections/animal collected every 300 µm starting from the interhemispheric fissure. Three 10× images/section (front, middle, and rear cortex) have been acquired and the plaque load (6E10 coverage area) has been determined using the particle analysis tool in ImageJ software (NIH) and normalized on total tissue area. Analysis has been performed at least on five mice per group/time point. Histological analysis has been performed by an investigator (AVC) blinded to treatment groups. For analysis of plaque density, 30 µm sections were stained with Methoxy-X04 and confocal images were collected in Z-stacks. Eight ROI were selected across the cortex and acquired across the different cortical layers. Image data analysis was performed as previously reported in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peters et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, local background correction was applied to diminish intensity variations among different stacks and to account for the intensity decline in the axial dimension due to absorption and scattering of photons. For this purpose, the voxel intensity was normalized in each Z-layer to the 70th percentile of Methoxy-X04 fluorescence intensity. Subsequently, amyloid plaques were defined by applying the 90th percentile in the Methoxy-X04 fluorescence data stacks. The radius of each individual plaque was calculated from the Z-plane with the largest area extension in XY (radius=√(area/π)), assuming spherical shape of plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hefendehl et al., 2011</xref>).

The elevated 20-hole apparatus (diameter: 100 cm, hole diameter: 10 cm) had a target box which was placed under the maze. The protocol includes three phases of interaction of mice with the maze: (1) habituation to the maze, (2) a 2-day training period, and (3) a probe trial 48 hr later. Before each day of training or probe mice were placed 30 min prior procedure in the testing room for acclimatization. On day 1 mice were habituated to the maze. Therefore, mice were placed in the center of the maze in a 2 l glass beaker. After 1 min of acclimatization, mice were guided slowly by moving the glass beaker toward the target hole. This was done three consecutive times per mouse. On day 2 mice were placed in center and given the possibility to freely explore and find the target hole. If mice did not reach the target hole within 3 min the glass beaker was used to slowly guide them to the target. This was done in three consecutive trials. On day 3 mice were placed under the beaker and 10 s after placement the beaker was removed, and mice were allowed to explore freely and find the target hole. Again, three consecutive trials were performed with every mouse. This procedure was repeated for the actual probe 48 hr later.

Thereafter, samples were derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr), as follows: 100 μl 172 mM PFBBr (Thermo) in acetone was added, samples were mixed and heated to 60°C for 30 min. After the samples had cooled down to room temperature a liquid–liquid extraction was performed using 500 μl n-hexane (Sigma-Aldrich) and 250 μl LC-MS grade water. The upper n-hexane layer was transferred to a fresh glass vial and subsequently used for GC-MS analysis. Calibration standards were prepared analogous. For calibration standards no plasma was added and 10 μl of EtOH was replaced by 10 μl standards solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in EtOH. Samples were analyzed on a Bruker Scion 436 GC fitted with an Agilent VF-5ms capillary column (25 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) coupled with a Bruker Scion TQ MS.

Aβ positive microglia (Iba1 positive together with CD68 and 3552 co-localization) have been quantified and normalized on the total number of microglia recruited to Aβ plaques. Histological analysis has been performed by an investigator (AVC) blinded to treatment groups with at least five images per mouse. All data have been normalized to control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Stereotaxic hippocampal injections</title><p>All animal handling and surgical procedures for GF as well as the SPF mice were performed under sterile conditions in a microbiological safety cabinet. Animals were anaesthetized, placed in a stereotactic device, and a midline incision was performed to expose the skull. The skull was thinned above the injection point (coordinates: lateral 1 mm, caudal 2.3 mm from bregma) and 2.5 µl mouse brain homogenate with high plaque burden from 8 months old APPPS1 mice or saline were microinjected (Hamilton syringe at 1 µl/min; 2.5 mm depth from the brain surface). The needle was retained for additional 2 min before it was slowly withdrawn. 24 hr after injection, animals were sacrificed, and brain samples processed for immunofluorescence and fluorescence in situ hybridization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization</title><p>Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) by the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, free floating 30 µm sagittal brain sections were first dried, washed, and then incubated in RNAscope Hydrogen Peroxide. Antigen retrieval and protease treatment were performed as per protocol. Sections were then incubated with the probe mix (C2-TREM2 and C1-CX3XR1) for 2 hr at 40°C and then immediately washed with wash buffer. Next, sections were incubated with RNAscope Multiplex FL v2 AMP1, AMP2, and AMP3, and then probes were counter stained with TSA Plus Cy3 for C1-<italic>Cx3cr1</italic> and TSA Plus Cy5 for C2-<italic>Trem2</italic>. After washing with PBS and blocking buffer, plaques were identified using primary rat anti-2D8 antibody (1:300, Abcam #16669) and counterstained with secondary antibody AF488 goat anti-rat (1:200, Invitrogen #A11006). Finally, sections were stained with DAPI. smFISH-stained RNA molecules were counted only within the DAPI staining of the cell; a cell was considered CX3CR1-positive when more than four <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> puncta were present. A cell was quantified as <italic>Trem2</italic> positive when <italic>Trem2</italic> smFISH molecules were observed in the <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-positive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Ex vivo Aβ plaque clearance and phagocytosis assay</title><p>We investigated microglial phagocytosis by an ex vivo assay as already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colombo et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, 10 µm brain sections from APPPS1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Radde et al., 2006</xref>) were incubated on coverslips with anti-Aβ antibodies (6E10, 5 μg/ml) to stimulate microglia recruitment. Primary microglia were isolated from P7 WT mouse pups using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit, CD11b microbeads, and a column MACS separation system (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified microglia were resuspended in DMEM F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% PenStrep (Gibco). Then, isolated microglia were incubated for 5 days at a density of 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/coverslip in culturing medium containing 250 µM mixed SCFA (acetate, butyrate, and propionate, each 83.3 µM) or control 250 µM NaCl. Next, sections were fixed and permeabilized and stained with primary antibodies against CD68 (1:500, AbDserotec) and Aβ (3552, 1:500, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamasaki et al., 2006</xref>) and corresponding secondary antibodies as well as the nuclear dye Hoechst and fibrillar Aβ dye Thiazine red (ThR 2 µM, Sigma Aldrich). Full sections were analyzed by tile scan mode on a Leica SP5 II confocal microscope. To evaluate microglial phagocytic capacity, difference in plaque coverage (ThR signal area) was quantified between brain sections incubated with microglia and a consecutive section where no microglia have been plated using ImageJ software (NIH). Each experimental group has been tested in three animals (three independent experiments with two technical replicates each).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>SCFA treatment of primary microglia</title><p>Single cell suspension was obtained from P7 WT mouse brains using an enzymatic (200U of papain, Sigma Aldrich) and a mechanical dissociation in DMEM GlutaMAX high glucose and pyruvate (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Microglia were isolated using CD11b microbeads and a column MACS separation system (Miltenyi Biotec). Purified microglia were resuspended and plated in DMEM F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% PenStrep (Gibco) in a 96-well plate format at a density of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. At 5DIV culturing medium was replaced with fresh medium containing single SCFA (acetate, butyrate, or propionate, Sigma Aldrich) or an equimolar combination of them (final concentration 250 µM for all conditions). NaCl was used as control in equimolar concentration. After 24 hr incubation, cells were lysed in Qiazol Lysis Reagent and RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (all Qiagen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Nanostring analysis</title><p>RNA samples from primary microglial cell were obtained as stated above. Brain samples were lysed in Qiazol Lysis Reagent and total RNA was extracted using the MaXtract High Density kit with further purification using the RNeasy Mini Kit (all Qiagen). 70 ng of total RNA per sample was then hybridized with reporter and capture probes for nCounter Gene Expression code sets (Mouse Neuroinflammation codeset) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (NanoString Technologies). Samples were injected into NanoString cartridge and measurement run was performed according to nCounter SPRINT protocol. Background (negative control) was quantified by code set intrinsic molecular color-coded barcodes lacking the RNA linkage. As positive control code set intrinsic control RNAs were used at increasing concentrations. Data were analyzed using the nSolver software 4.0. In the standard data analysis procedure, all genes counts were normalized to the positive control values and the values for the standard reference genes. Clustering and heatmaps were performed using the ClustVis package on normalized expression values derived from the nSolver report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metsalu and Vilo, 2015</xref>). For clustering, the z-scores were calculated using the mean expression of biological replicates per condition and then clustered using K-means. Data were further analyzed using the Ingenuity software (Ingenuity Systems). Differentially expressed genes (with corresponding fold changes and p-values) were used for generating a merged biological network as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butovsky et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses, unless otherwise specified, have been performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, version 6.0). Sample size was chosen based on experience from previous experiments and exact n numbers are reported in figure legends. The groups containing normally distributed independent data were analyzed using unpaired T-test (for two groups) or ANOVA (for &gt;2 groups). The remaining data were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U-test (for two groups). Similar variance was assured for all groups, which were statistically compared. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was regarded as statistically significant and displayed in all figures.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Kerstin Thuß-Silczak for excellent technical support and Anna Daria for the help in genotyping.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Peter Turnbaugh as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: John F Cryan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Colombo et al. present an intriguing set of findings from the amyloidosis mouse model (APPS1). Rederivation of this model under germ-free conditions led to both decreased plaque load and impaired cognitive performance. Administration of a cocktail of SCFAs and salt (sodium propionate, butyrate, and acetate) significantly increased plaque levels, microglial activation, and ApoE expression. Together, these findings suggest a potential pathway through which the microbiome could impact cognitive performance. The paper is well-written, with a clear description of the current results and a logical flow to the text and figures. These data are a good starting point for further mechanistic dissection and add another welcome piece to the puzzle of how the microbiota affect the brain.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Lack of consideration of sex and small sample sizes. Prior work in this area has demonstrated that it is important to look at sufficient numbers of both female and male mice, individually, and not just group them. Moreover, the average number of mice used in each experiment (N=5) is relatively small. We recommend repeating the key experiments with both larger numbers and both male and female mice (analyzed separately).</p><p>2. Experimental perturbation of the proposed pathway. The manuscript leads to a nice model; however, the data are descriptive in nature. The impact of this study would be increased substantially if at least one mechanistic link between SCFAs and AB, microglia, or ApoE were experimentally validated. While most of the text avoids making causal claims based on correlative evidence, the one sentence summary states that SCFAs impact disease &quot;via activation of microglial cells and upregulation of ApoE.&quot;</p><p>3. Identify which SCFA matters. The experiments all rely on a mixture of 3 SCFAs making it impossible to determine which compound is responsible or if there are differences in effects of the individual short-chain fatty acids. There is also high salt in this mixture which confounds the interpretation further. At a minimum, each individual compound needs to be tested using an equimolar amount of salt as a negative control. The authors should also note issues with oral delivery of SCFAs, which does not necessarily mimic production in the colon. Ideally, tributyrin, or a similar ester for acetate or propionate should be used. Another key missing control is the administration of SCFAs to SPF mice. It is also important to be clear that while SCFAs are sufficient to impact AB, there is no evidence in the paper to suggest that they are necessary, the full scope of &quot;key microbial metabolites&quot; remain to be determined. If the authors want to claim necessity, they would need to deplete specific SCFAs in the presence of a complex gut microbiome.</p><p>4. Be more cautious in discussing the role of the microbiome in Alzheimer's disease. The background discussion includes studies that show correlations in humans and phenotypic differences in germ-free mouse models, which in our opinion are insufficient to claim a causal role in human disease. The authors should discuss the level of evidence in humans for a causal role of the microbiome and its relative impact relative to other risk factors, including any prospective or intervention studies that have been conducted. They should also take care not to extrapolate differences in intermediate phenotypes in mice (plaque levels, microglial activation, and ApoE expression) to human disease. For example, the one sentence summary says, &quot;contributing to AD disease progression&quot;. The authors should also discuss whether or not cognitive performance was evaluated in response to SCFAs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59826.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Lack of consideration of sex and small sample sizes. Prior work in this area has demonstrated that it is important to look at sufficient numbers of both female and male mice, individually, and not just group them. Moreover, the average number of mice used in each experiment (N=5) is relatively small. We recommend repeating the key experiments with both larger numbers and both male and female mice (analyzed separately).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have repeated the key experiment shown in Figure 1 (i.e. effect of bacterial colonization on plaque load at 5 months of age) and increased the sample size per group to analyze sex-specific effects. Of note, repetition of this experiment has been greatly challenged by the still ongoing pandemic and its impact on our possibilities to breed transgenic mice and maintain germfree mouse colonies. Nevertheless, we were able to increase the sample size per group from 5 to 9 animals (SPF and GF). Additionally, we added a third group of recolonized animals (Rec), this is Ex-GF littermate mice which have been naturally recolonized by co-housing with SPF mice under conventional housing conditions.</p><p>Increase of sample size confirmed the substantial effect of bacterial colonization on cerebral amyloid plaque load. The effect of bacterial colonization on plaque load was further corroborated by the increase in recolonized (Rec) mice. The increase of plaque load was statistically only significant in female but not in male mice, however, sample sizes of our experimental groups are still not large enough to study sex-specific differences with sufficient statistical power.</p><p>Furthermore, we have increased the sample size for Barnes maze behavior test as well as included the recolonized animal group also for this parameter assessing spatial memory deficits. Increasing the sample size as well as adding the recolonized animal group strengthened the main finding of a significant impact of bacterial colonization on memory deficits.</p><p>These additional findings have been added to the revised Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1 and the respective Results section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Experimental perturbation of the proposed pathway. The manuscript leads to a nice model; however, the data are descriptive in nature. The impact of this study would be increased substantially if at least one mechanistic link between SCFAs and AB, microglia, or ApoE were experimentally validated. While most of the text avoids making causal claims based on correlative evidence, the one sentence summary states that SCFAs impact disease &quot;via activation of microglial cells and upregulation of ApoE.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the direct mechanistic link between SCFA, microglia/ApoE and Aβ is still missing. A full mechanistic analysis of the cellular and molecular interactions along this proposed pathway is surely beyond the scope of a single manuscript.</p><p>However, in order to strengthen the mechanistic understanding of this newly described SCFA dependent phenomenon, we performed several new experiments:</p><p>a) SCFA promote AD progression</p><p>A critical claim based on our original findings was that SCFA is a key driver of (microbiota-mediated) AD progression. However, this interpretation was only derived from SCFA-supplemented germfree mice, which are largely devoid of endogenous SCFA. In order to further test the direct disease-modifying properties of SCFA, we treated conventionally housed SPF mice with SCFA in drinking water over 4 weeks. Interestingly, SCFA treated SPF mice had a significantly increased plaque load compared to control-treated SPF mice, unequivocally demonstrating the disease-promoting role of SCFA in this experimental model. This new dataset has been added as the revised Figure 2D.</p><p>b) SCFA modulate microglia</p><p>We hypothesized that the SCFA modulate microglial function and this effect may contribute to increased Aβ plaque load. This conclusion was mainly based on the morphological and transcriptomic analysis of microglia between GF and SCFA-supplemented GF mice as well as the observed difference in microglial activation towards injected amyloid in SPF and GF mouse brains. In order to further support the impact of SCFA on microglia, we assessed the recruitment of microglia to amyloid plaques and the microglial Aβ content in SPF mice which have been treated with either control or SCFA over 4 weeks in drinking water. This experiment was performed in SPF mice to avoid a potentially counteracting bias of immature microglia in GF mice. Here, we identified that SCFA-treatment increased microglial accumulation at the amyloid plaques but at the same time microglia contained significantly less Aβ. This new dataset has been added as Figure 4F to the revised manuscript.</p><p>Next, we aimed to further elaborate on the direct effects of SCFA on microglia. Therefore, we established a primary microglia cell culture system in which we treated microglia with either combined SCFA or single SCFA. We observed a significant upregulation of mRNA transcription of SCFA-treated microglia for various genes previously associated with the activation state of microglia (Casp1, Fcrls, Gadd45, Il6ra, and others). Pathway analysis of the regulated genes suggested mainly a modulatory effect of SCFA on the NF-κB pathway and NF-κB-regulated secretory functions of microglia. Please see the summary of the pathway analysis – further analyses are presented in the new Supplementary Figure to Figure 5.</p><p>In addition to performing the new experiments, which all supported a modulatory effect of SCFA on microglia, we have also carefully revised the manuscript to avoid overinterpretation of the findings and toned down our one sentence summary (now denoted as impact statement due to editorial guidelines).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Identify which SCFA matters. The experiments all rely on a mixture of 3 SCFAs making it impossible to determine which compound is responsible or if there are differences in effects of the individual short-chain fatty acids. There is also high salt in this mixture which confounds the interpretation further. At a minimum, each individual compound needs to be tested using an equimolar amount of salt as a negative control. The authors should also note issues with oral delivery of SCFAs, which does not necessarily mimic production in the colon. Ideally, tributyrin, or a similar ester for acetate or propionate should be used. Another key missing control is the administration of SCFAs to SPF mice. It is also important to be clear that while SCFAs are sufficient to impact AB, there is no evidence in the paper to suggest that they are necessary, the full scope of &quot;key microbial metabolites&quot; remain to be determined. If the authors want to claim necessity, they would need to deplete specific SCFAs in the presence of a complex gut microbiome.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, that investigating individual SCFA is a relevant aspect which was missed in the original manuscript. In order to address this, we first quantified blood concentrations of the individual SCFA in the portal vein blood of germfree, naturally recolonized (Ex-GF) and SPF mice. Results from this experiment clearly demonstrated that all three SCFA—although at different degrees—are increased in the blood of mice with bacterial colonization. This finding is now included as Figure 2A in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The rationale for selecting a combination of all three SCFA was mainly based on the comparability to previous reports that have used the exact same SCFA supplementation protocols in AD (Erny, Nature Neuroscience, 2015) and stroke (Sadler, Journal of Neuroscience, 2020) mouse models. The finding that differences in plasma concentrations (at various degrees) for all three SCFA can be observed between germfree and colonized animals further corroborates this rationale. This issue has now been clarified in the revised Results section in its first paragraph.</p><p>Next, we performed the suggested experiment to compare the effect of single SCFA (i.e. Acetate, Butyrate and Propionate) to combined SCFA treatment in equimolar concentrations and in comparison to an equimolar salt control on polarizing microglial activation.</p><p>Since it was impossible for us to perform such axenic animal experiments during the current pandemic in vivo using the model of germfree APPPS1 mouse + supplementation (salt control, combined SCFA, Acetate, Butyrate, Propionate), we decided to compare the effects of combined <italic>versus</italic> individual SCFA in cultured primary microglia followed by Nanostring analysis of microglial transcriptomics. This experimental setting also enabled us to validate the potential of SCFA to directly modulate microglia.</p><p>This comparison demonstrated that while acetate is the most abundantly detected SCFA in the plasma and also most consistently increased after bacterial colonization (see above), the effect of butyrate and propionate resemble much closer the changes in the transcriptomic profile of microglia treated with combined SCFA than was observed for acetate. Specifically, while we observed a large overlap in the significantly regulated genes between combined SCFA, butyrate and propionate treatment to the respective control, none of the genes detected to be significantly regulated (up- or down-regulated) by acetate overlapped with the combined SCFA treatment. Correspondingly, a comparison by pathway analysis of the differential impact between the treatment groups on biological processes, revealed the same pattern that butyrate and propionate more closely resembled the effects of combined treatment than acetate (see above, answer to essential revision 2). However, each single SCFA treatment only partially resembled the effects of the combined treatment, suggesting a potentially synergistic effect on microglial polarization. These new results are included in the Supplementary Figure to Figure 5.</p><p>Additionally, we performed the requested control experiment in which we treated SPF APPPS1 mice with SCFA or control supplementation. As described in more detail above (response to essential revision 2), we observed a significant increase in amyloid plaque load in SCFA-supplemented in comparison to control treated mice.</p><p>While we see the relevance of investigating in more depth the production or potentially different effects of SCFA-esters (such as for the proposed tributyrin), we think that this aspect is beyond the scope of the present manuscript. More detailed studies on various aspects of this complex pathway, including the relevance of production and resorption site, will require future studies. However, this aspect has now been included and discussed in the revised Discussion section.</p><p>Finally, we clearly want to state that we did not intend to propose that SCFA are necessary mediators for amyloid plaque deposition. We carefully reviewed the manuscript and do not claim that SCFA are “necessary” or “required” for amyloid plaque deposition. However, based on the findings of substantially increased plaque load by the SCFA supplementation, even in the presence of the normal gut microbiome of the SPF APPPS1 mice, we think it is justified to describe SCFA as metabolites that are sufficient to promote Aβ plaque deposition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
