We report seven rare missense or in-frame microdeletion human <italic>SARM1</italic> variant alleles in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or other motor nerve disorders that alter the SARM1 auto-inhibitory ARM domain and constitutively hyperactivate SARM1 NADase activity. The constitutive NADase activity of these seven variants is similar to that of SARM1 lacking the entire ARM domain and greatly exceeds the activity of wild-type SARM1, even in the presence of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), its physiological activator. This rise in constitutive activity alone is enough to promote neuronal degeneration in response to otherwise non-harmful, mild stress. Importantly, these strong gain-of-function alleles are completely patient-specific in the cohorts studied and show a highly significant association with disease at the single gene level. These findings of disease-associated coding variants that alter SARM1 function build on previously reported genome-wide significant association with ALS for a neighbouring, more common <italic>SARM1</italic> intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to support a contributory role of SARM1 in these disorders. A broad phenotypic heterogeneity and variable age-of-onset of disease among patients with these alleles also raises intriguing questions about the pathogenic mechanism of hyperactive SARM1 variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARM1</kwd><kwd>NADase</kwd><kwd>ALS</kwd><kwd>risk allele</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

The SARM1 TIR domain has a critical NAD<sup>+</sup> consuming multifunctional glycohydrolase (NADase) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wan et al., 2019</xref>) and, intriguingly, NMNAT substrate, NMN, and its product, NAD<sup>+</sup>, can both influence this activity: NMN activates SARM1 NADase by binding to an allosteric site in the auto-inhibitory ARM domain of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figley et al., 2021</xref>), whereas NAD<sup>+</sup> can oppose this activation by competing for binding to the same site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figley et al., 2021</xref>). Rising NMN and declining NAD<sup>+</sup> as a consequence of loss of very short-lived NMNAT2 in damaged axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Stefano et al., 2015</xref>) thus leads directly to activation of SARM1 NADase and a self-reinforcing NAD<sup>+</sup> decline that represents one possible cause of degeneration.</p><p>As well as its established role in axons, SARM1 can promote neuronal cell death under certain conditions. In most cases, the extent to which cell death and concurrent axon degeneration are primary or secondary events has not been fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Summers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Summers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>). However, recent studies do suggest direct involvement of SARM1 in neuronal cell death in some situations, including photoreceptor loss in models of retinal degeneration and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sasaki et al., 2020</xref>) and as a result of Vacor neurotoxicity when specifically applied to cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loreto et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Extensive evidence from animal models has implicated NMNAT-sensitive and SARM1-dependent axon degeneration and/or cell death in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conforti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coleman and Höke, 2020</xref>), but knowledge of genetic association with human diseases is more limited. To date, biallelic <italic>NMNAT2</italic> loss-of-function (LoF) variants have been associated with two rare polyneuropathies that broadly resemble the corresponding mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huppke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lukacs et al., 2019</xref>), and <italic>NMNAT1</italic> mutations cause photoreceptor loss in LCA via a mechanism involving SARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sasaki et al., 2020</xref>). While no firm association between <italic>SARM1</italic> variation and human disease has yet been established, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have linked the <italic>SARM1</italic> chromosomal locus, including an intragenic SNP, to sporadic ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fogh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Rheenen et al., 2016</xref>), although whether <italic>SARM1</italic> is the causative gene is not known.</p><p>Motor nerve disorders are neurodegenerative disorders that affect motor neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. These include ALS, the most common adult-onset motor nerve disorder, as well as other inherited conditions like hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goutman, 2017</xref>). There is also some phenotypic and genetic overlap with the hereditary motor neuropathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rossor et al., 2012</xref>). These disorders exhibit broad phenotypic heterogeneity and variable age-of-onset. Recently, SARM1-dependent death mechanisms have been found to play a significant role in a mutant TDP-43 model of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">White et al., 2019</xref>). This is important as TDP-43 aggregation is an almost universal pathologic feature in ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neumann et al., 2006</xref>). While removal of SARM1 does not alleviate motor neuron degeneration in a <italic>SOD1</italic> model of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peters et al., 2018</xref>), this could be explained by the finding that TDP-43 aggregation is usually not seen in ALS linked to <italic>SOD1</italic> or <italic>FUS</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mackenzie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maekawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McAlary et al., 2019</xref>). It therefore remains possible that SARM1 plays an important role in a majority of ALS cases.</p><p>Here, we have identified a number of rare alleles specific to ALS patients in Project MinE initiative data freeze 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Project MinE ALS Sequencing Consortium, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Spek et al., 2019</xref>) and the Answer ALS project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothstein et al., 2020</xref>) encoding missense substitutions and in-frame microdeletions in the auto-inhibitory ARM domain of SARM1 that confer substantial pro-degenerative NADase gain-of-function (GoF). A number of these GoF alleles were subsequently identified in additional ALS patients and in HSP or other motor nerve disorder patients in other databases but, crucially, were not seen at all in any individuals in the control groups. Based on their strongly skewed distribution between patients and controls, we propose that these <italic>SARM1</italic> GoF alleles are thus strong candidates for risk alleles in ALS and other motor nerve disorders and raises the possibility that other mechanisms of SARM1 activation could make a wider contribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a cluster of ALS patient-specific SARM1 ARM domain coding variants in Project MinE data freeze 1</title><p>Previous studies have shown that artificial missense mutations and in-frame deletions in the auto-inhibitory ARM domain of SARM1 are more likely to result in pro-degenerative GoF than disruption of its SAM multimerization domains or catalytic TIR domain, which instead is more likely to give rise to protective LoF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Summers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shen et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, if SARM1 contributes to ALS pathogenesis, we predicted that there might be a relative paucity of naturally occurring coding variation in the SAM and TIR domains and/or an enrichment of coding variation in the ARM domain among patients, with the opposite in unaffected individuals.</p><p>To explore this, we assessed the distribution of mostly rare <italic>SARM1</italic> missense SNP and small, in-frame deletion alleles between cases and controls in Project MinE consortium data freeze 1 (DF1), a public database containing WGS data for 4,366 mostly sporadic ALS patients and 1,832 non-ALS controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Project MinE ALS Sequencing Consortium, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Spek et al., 2019</xref>). Even accounting for the fact that a proportion of the coding variation is likely to be functionally neutral, the distribution of alleles was notably skewed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Specifically, of the 16 alleles encoding changes between amino acids 112 and 385 of the SARM1 ARM domain, all are seen in patients, but only the two relatively more common alleles are also seen in controls, whereas the distribution of coding variation between patients and controls for the remainder of the gene is largely unremarkable, being much more proportional to the sizes of the patient and control groups. Based on this uneven distribution, we thus hypothesised that some of the patient-specific Project MinE DF1 ARM domain alleles are risk alleles for ALS through pro-degenerative GoF.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SARM1 coding variants in ALS patient and control groups.</title><p>Schematic representation of the canonical 724 amino acid human SARM1 protein showing basic domain structure and the approximate locations of the coding variation present in the Project MinE DF1 and Answer ALS datasets.

MTS, &quot;mitochondrial&quot; targeting sequence; ARM, HEAT/Armadillo motif domain; SAM, sterile alpha motif domains; TIR, Toll/Interleukin receptor domain. <underline>Special note:</underline> Variants are annotated according to the canonical 724 amino acid SARM1. Project MinE DF1 currently uses gnomAD v2.1.1, which is based on genome build GRCh37/ hg19, and annotates variants to a 690 amino acid product of a non-canonical reference <italic>SARM1</italic> cDNA sequence. This cDNA, and genome build GRCh37, contain single nucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions at its 5' end when compared to gnomAD v3.1.1 and GRCh38/ hg38 which annotate to the canonical 724 amino acid SARM1. These differences mean that the 690 amino acid &quot;isoform&quot; has a truncated N-terminus, due to use of an alternative ATG codon, and switches frame until it eventually synchronises with 724 amino acid SARM1 at amino acid 107 (73 in the 690 amino acid ‘&quot;isoform&quot;). As such, numbering of SARM1 variants in Project MinE DF1 (and any databases annotated to gnomAD v2.11/ GRCh37) is 34 residues lower than that shown here over the synchronised region and differences more N-terminal to this must be determined individually by lift over from GRCh37 to GRCh38. Notably, the NCBI Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP, including rsIDs) uses numbering based on the 724 amino acid SARM1 protein.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70905-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>SARM1 coding variants in Project MinE DF1.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="bottom">SARM1 domain</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="bottom">Coding variant<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3">*</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="bottom">rsID</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="bottom">Chr.17 position and change<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn4">†</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="bottom">EuropeanMAF<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn5">‡</xref></th><th align="left" colspan="2" valign="bottom">Carriers</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Cases (4,366)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Controls (1,832)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T39M</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">rs988047470</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">28372148 C &gt;

Data for empty vector and WT SARM1 show that NR supplementation substantially boosts NAD<sup>+</sup> production. The lack of a robust increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in cells expressing putative strong GoF SARM1 variants simply indicates that enhanced NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption still exceeds the NR-dependent increase in synthesis. Nevertheless, the greater NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis capacity provided by NR should delay the point at which NAD<sup>+</sup> and/or ATP becomes limiting for <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis in these cells.

Molecular weight markers (kDa) are shown on the right of each panel. Notably, NR supports substantially higher expression of all of the putative strong GoF SARM1 variants and the co-expressed zsGreen. This supports a model in which low expression levels in (untreated) cells is due to limiting NAD<sup>+</sup> (and/or ATP) as a result of SARM1 NADase GoF. NR does not boost WT SARM1 or co-expressed zsGreen expression under these conditions presumably because NAD<sup>+</sup> levels do not become limiting.

The standard density of HEK cells was ~50% confluence at the time of transfection. For this experiment the different cell densities were diluted from the same original cell suspension. A large increase in the number of dead, PI-stained cells is clearly evident even as the total number of cells is reduced. It is likely that cells at lower density are less resistant to the effects of SARM1 activity-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion as they will be dividing more rapidly and thus already under greater metabolic stress. We routinely transfect HEK cells at the standard density shown to avoid significant cell death. The amount of SAM-TIR construct used in this assay is also substantially higher (16x) than that used for screening of the ALS patient variants and we would thus expect very low rates of cell death in the screening assays.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70905-fig2-figsupp3-v3.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Importantly, the lower level of NAD<sup>+</sup> seen for some variants in these assays was not a result of greater variant overexpression. Instead, we found that the variants that caused the greatest NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion are barely detectable by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). By using antibodies against either the C-terminal Flag tag or the N-terminus of SARM1, we can rule out any contribution of truncated forms of the variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This indicates that enhanced NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion is achieved by substantially lower levels of full-length versions of some of the variants and suggests very strong GoF. IRES-driven expression of ZsGreen (in a bicistronic cassette with SARM1) was also found to be substantially lower in cells with the greatest NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Crucially, fluorescence imaging suggested that this reflected suppressed ZsGreen expression within cells rather than reduced transfection efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which would anyhow be incompatible with almost complete NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion if many cells remained untransfected. However, this appears to be consistent with a previous report showing that overexpression of (WT) SARM1 suppresses <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of exogenous proteins in an NADase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Izadifar et al., 2021</xref>). In support of this mechanism, we found that the cell permeable NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) allows higher levels of expression of both zsGreen and the putative strong NADase GoF SARM1 variants themselves, presumably by boosting NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis and thus delaying the point at which NAD<sup>+</sup> becomes limiting for <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis as a result of enhanced SARM1 NADase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>).

While this probably partly reflects that we use a lower amount of SARM1 expression construct in our assays, we also found that SARM1 activity-dependent loss of viability of transfected HEK 293T cells is very dependent on cell density, with the high cell densities we routinely use also conferring substantial protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Project MinE DF1 putative GoF SARM1 variants have very high constitutive NADase activity</title><p>Our measurements of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in transfected HEK 293T cells indirectly pointed to variable degrees of NADase GoF for a number of the Project MinE patient-specific SARM1 ARM domain coding variants. Therefore, we next directly tested the NADase activity of purified recombinant WT and variant SARM1. Recombinant proteins were purified from transfected HEK 293T cell lysates by immunoprecipitation following NR supplementation of the HEK 293T cell medium to boost expression and maximise yield, particularly of the strong GoF variants (see above) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Constitutive (basal) NADase activity of the purified proteins in reactions containing just NAD<sup>+</sup> was assayed first.

Importantly, these assays confirmed the hypothesised NADase GoF for most of the variants that increased depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup> in transfected HEK 293T cells, but in some cases, their constitutive activity was unexpectedly high: rates for five of the patient-specific variants - L223P, Δ229–235, Δ249–252, V331E and E340K - were found to be up to 20 times higher than WT SARM1 and a sixth - T385A - around 10 times higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

P332Q SARM1, a more common variant equally abundant in ALS patients and controls, appears much more inducible than WT SARM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), but this largely reflects its substantially lower constitutive activity with its NMN-activated rate being only marginally higher than that of WT SARM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Indeed, none of the NMN-activated rates of any of the other NMN-responsive variants were significantly higher than that of WT SARM1, and for some (R244S, R310H and N337D SARM1) the activated rate was lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). On the other hand, V112I SARM1, which has moderately raised constitutive NADase activity, instead showed no NMN-responsiveness and its activity in the presence of 50 µM NMN is lower than the NMN-induced activity of WT SARM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Increased sensitivity to lower concentrations of NMN could represent an alternative pro-degenerative GoF mechanism, so we next assessed triggering of NADase activity by 10 µM NMN (excluding the non-responsive strong GoF variants). This concentration of NMN is likely to be closer to the concentration in damaged neurons / axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angeletti et al., 2021</xref>) but is the lowest concentration that gives consistent activation of WT SARM1 in these in vitro assays. The increase in activity of WT SARM1 in the presence of 10 µM NMN was roughly half that seen with 50 µM NMN (in parallel assays) and all the ALS patient variants previously found to be responsive to 50 µM NMN showed a similar or even lower relative level of activation with 10 µM NMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>), apart from V112I SARM1 which again is not inducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As with 50 µM NMN, 10 µM NMN induced P332Q SARM1 activity to a greater extent than that of WT SARM1 but its activated rate in the presence of 10 µM NMN in this case was below that of WT SARM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>).</p><p>Together, these NADase activity data indicate that six of the exclusively patient-associated <italic>SARM1</italic> ARM domain alleles in Project MinE DF1 encode variants with greatly enhanced constitutive activity comparable to that of the fully disinhibited SAM-TIR fragment, and one additional patient-associated variant showed more moderate constitutive NADase GoF. Surprisingly, however, no variants showed enhanced responsiveness to NMN from the normal basal level. Thus, the point mutations and small in-frame deletions that confer the strongest GoF mimic the effects of complete removal of ARM domain auto-inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Identification of an additional ALS patient-associated strong GoF SARM1 variant in the Answer ALS project database</title><p>We next extended our search for putative ALS-associated <italic>SARM1</italic> GoF alleles to the Answer ALS project database consisting of WGS data for 706 ALS patients and 92 matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothstein et al., 2020</xref>).

However, in both cases expression is driven by the same CMV promoter and the use of the different vector backbones does not alter the functional outcome (data not shown).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70905-fig6-figsupp1-v3.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig6s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Injection of empty vector does not affect SCG neuron viability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Numbers of DsRed-positive neurons 24 hr after microinjection with empty pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 vector (the backbone for the SARM1 constructs used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and DsRed (at 2.5 ng/µl and 40 ng/µl in the injection mix, respectively) ± 2 mM NR addition to the culture medium at the time of injection.

Intriguingly, we found that the modest stresses associated with changes in culture conditions as a result of media change, even to new NR-containing medium, was sufficient to trigger a substantial loss of the Δ229–235 SARM1 neurons (compared to not changing media), and further manipulations designed to reduce NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis – removal of NR, or a combination of NR removal and incubation with NAMPT inhibitor FK866 to block the rate-limiting step in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway – caused additional, incremental decreases in cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). In contrast, neurons injected with the WT SARM1 construct or empty vector were not substantially affected by any of the manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, we could not differentiate the timing of cell death and neurite degeneration in these experiments, suggesting either that the primary effect is on neuronal viability or that separate cell body and neurite death mechanisms occur simultaneously.</p><p>In order to assess whether NADase activity is required for the pro-death effects of Δ229–235 SARM1, we combined the Δ229–235 deletion with the E642A NADase-inactivating mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>). We found that double mutant Δ229–235/E642A SARM1, like single mutant E642A SARM1, has little or no effect on NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in transfected HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), consistent with a lack of NADase activity. We also saw much more robust expression of Δ229–235/E642A SARM1 and co-expressed ZsGreen compared to cells expressing Δ229–235 SARM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This further supports a correlation between SARM1 NADase activity and <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis. Crucially, in contrast to Δ229–235 SARM1, SCG neurons injected with a Δ229–235/E642A SARM1 construct were easily identified, even in the absence of NR supplementation, and were not sensitive to combined NR removal and incubation with NAMPT inhibitor FK866 (after being cultured in the presence of NR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Therefore, NADase activity is required for the pro-death effects of Δ229–235 SARM1 in this assay.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>NADase activity is required for the pro-death effects of Δ229–235 SARM1 in SCG neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in extracts of HEK 293T cells 24 hr after transfection with expression constructs for WT, E642A, Δ229–235 or Δ229–235/E642A SARM1, as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

No other variants came close to this level, although V112I (in a patient) and V88M and A210V (in controls) showed more modest increases in constitutive activity to 1.7–2.2 times that of WT SARM1. Therefore, within these datasets, strong NADase GoF <italic>SARM1</italic> alleles are only seen in patients and never in controls. This is consistent with our hypothesis that strong SARM1 NADase GoF is a risk factor for ALS.</p><p>In order to investigate this association in more depth, we assessed whether any of the 23 variants assessed for function in this study appear in other relevant cohorts, including cohorts containing patients with HSP and other motor nerve disorders. If the association is robust, then the rare, strong GoF variant alleles identified here should remain enriched in patients and underrepresented in control individuals, while variants with properties more like WT SARM1 would not show consistent association with either group. We identified the following additional datasets for this purpose: case and control samples in Project MinE data freeze 2 (DF2) that were not part of DF1; samples from motor nerve disorder cases and selected control groups (see Materials and methods) from the GENESIS project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonzalez et al., 2015</xref>) and a UCL rare disease (neurology) dataset; cases and controls from an HSP study; and the Lothian birth cohort (LBC) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lothianbirthcohort.ed.ac.uk">http://www.lothianbirthcohort.ed.ac.uk</ext-link>) as an additional aged control cohort. Among these datasets, four additional cases are heterozygous for one of the strong GoF alleles (two ALS cases, one HSP case and one upper and lower motor nerve disorder case) whereas no controls in any dataset were identified as carriers of these alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, in total, 13 of the 11,117 patients in the combined datasets are heterozygous for a strong GoF <italic>SARM1</italic> allele (13 out of 22,234 alleles), with no carriers among 10,402 controls (0 out of 20,804 alleles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, a number of the other alleles encoding variants with properties more similar to WT SARM1, including some of those previously only associated with cases in Project MinE DF1 and Answer ALS, were present in both cases and controls in the new datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Occurrences of SARM1 alleles encoding ARM domain and other N-terminal variants in individual datasets.</title><p>* Extra samples in Project MinE DF2 that were not part of DF1. † MAFs for the P332Q SARM1 allele in each dataset (in cases plus controls combined) of 0.012 (MinE DF1), 0.012 (Answer ALS), 0.014 (MinE DF2 extras), 0.0055 (GENESIS), 0.0086 (UCL), 0.0010 (LBC) and 0.0083 (HSP study) are, barring the more ethnically-diverse GENESIS cohorts, broadly consistent with each dataset containing predominantly European samples as the European MAF of 0.012 is substantially higher than in other populations (gnomAD v3.1.1).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig8sdata1"><label>Figure 8—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70905-fig8-data1-v3.docx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70905-fig8-v3.tif"/></fig><p>We next performed statistical analyses on aggregated data from all the datasets to test the strength of the association specifically between SARM1 GoF and motor nerve disorders. Crucially, burden testing of the group of seven strong GoF variant alleles together in the combined datasets revealed a highly significant association with disease (burden test and SKAT-O p = 0.00017), whereas there was no clear association with disease when considering all the other alleles as a group (burden test p = 0.47, SKAT-O p = 0.61). In addition, there is a greater than four times enrichment of the strong GoF alleles among our aggregated patient cohorts compared to European (non-Finnish) non-neuro samples from gnomAD v3.1.1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> - MAF of 0.00058 vs 0.00014) and, despite the presence of a few carriers of strong GoF <italic>SARM1</italic> alleles in this gnomAD cohort and the uncertainty regarding their health status (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> legend), their inclusion as additional controls in the statistical tests actually strengthens the association between the <italic>SARM1</italic> strong GoF alleles and disease (burden test p = 0.000025, SKAT-O p = 0.000057). Notably, disease-association also remains even when the patient-associated V112I <italic>SARM1</italic> allele and control-associated V88M and A210V <italic>SARM1</italic> alleles, encoding more modest GoF variants, are grouped with the strong GoF alleles (burden test p = 0.0042, SKAT-O p = 0.0021 excluding gnomAD samples, and burden test p = 0.000047, SKAT-O p = 0.00019 including gnomAD samples). Together, these tests suggest that SARM1 ARM domain coding variation that results in constitutive NADase hyperactivation is very strongly associated with ALS and other motor nerve disorders. Individual-level data were not available for all datasets to identify covariates to correct for population stratification, but the use of broadly matched datasets to minimise the effect of population variation (see Materials and methods) means that results are likely to reflect true disease-associated genetic variation.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table

severity probably indicates that SARM1 GoF is not the only driver of disease in some or all of these cases. In this respect it is notable that two of the ALS cases are also heterozygous for I114T (previously reported as I113T) <italic>SOD1</italic> and L17P <italic>FIG4</italic> variant alleles that have previously been linked to ALS or recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4 J (CMT4J). Given that the I114T <italic>SOD1</italic> allele shows incomplete penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopate et al., 2010</xref>) and the L17P <italic>FIG4</italic> allele has previously only been associated with CMT4J in combination with a null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nicholson et al., 2011</xref>), it raises the possibility that an interaction with the <italic>SARM1</italic> GoF alleles is critical for pathogenesis in these ALS cases. Therefore, an interaction between <italic>SARM1</italic> GoF alleles and other risk alleles may enhance phenotypic expressivity and underlie some of the variability in clinical presentation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have identified seven disease-associated <italic>SARM1</italic> alleles in patients with ALS or other motor nerve disorders that encode missense or in-frame microdeletion variants with constitutive NADase activity as much as ten to twenty times higher than that of WT SARM1. This level of activity is comparable to that of SARM1 lacking any auto-inhibition and is substantially higher than the activity of WT SARM1 in the presence of NMN, a natural activator of SARM1 NADase during injury-induced and other related forms of axon degeneration. Although co-expression experiments suggest that the NADase activity of hetero-oligomers of WT and strong NADase GoF SARM1 will be around half that of homo-oligomers of strong GoF SARM1 alone, this still represents a considerable increase in activity. Consistent with this, acute expression of strong NADase GoF SARM1 alongside WT SARM1 in primary cultured neurons is sufficient to promote robust NADase-dependent cell death (and simultaneous or secondary axon degeneration) in response to otherwise non-harmful mild stress. Crucially, these seven strong GoF alleles are enriched in the motor nerve disorder cohorts studied compared to control groups or the wider population implicating constitutively hyperactivated SARM1 as a risk factor for these diseases.</p><p>Despite the robust association between SARM1 strong GoF variants and disease in these cohorts, the proportion of motor nerve disorder cases that are heterozygous for the strong GoF alleles identified here is only 0.12 %. However, other ALS patient-associated <italic>SARM1</italic> alleles encoding variants with predicted strong NADase GoF have been identified concurrently with this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloom et al., 2021</xref>), and there are many other ARM domain variant alleles among our extended datasets that remain untested and could, therefore, include additional GoF alleles. The real percentage may thus be higher. Furthermore, in light of this association, we expect that other SARM1 GoF and/or activation mechanisms will also be found to play a key role in motor nerve disorders. For example, the GWAS association between a <italic>SARM1</italic> intragenic SNP and ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fogh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Rheenen et al., 2016</xref>) could be driven by increased SARM1 expression as a result of more common variants which impact transcriptional regulation of the <italic>SARM1</italic> gene. Reduced expression of Stathmin-2 (STMN2, also known as SCG10), which potentiates programmed axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shin et al., 2012</xref>), has also been linked to the disease via a mechanism that is expected to involve aberrant SARM1 activation. Specifically, STMN2 depletion increases the vulnerability of ALS patient iPSC-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melamed et al., 2019</xref>), and a non-coding <italic>STMN2</italic> variant that influences gene expression has recently also been associated with increased risk of sporadic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Theunissen et al., 2021</xref>). An age-related decline in NMNAT2 expression and/or delivery to axons or exposure to environmental toxins could also result in aberrant SARM1 activation and increased risk of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milde et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loreto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The association between motor nerve disorders and functionally confirmed strong GoF variants of SARM1 we report here is highly significant at the individual gene level and contrasts with the absence of disease association for neighbouring variants with properties more comparable to WT SARM1 (thereby representing good controls for testing our hypothesis). Thus, unlike a conventional gene burden analysis, it is the functional consequence of each variant, rather than its location, that correlates with disease. The low allele frequency of the GoF variants, even after their enrichment in ALS, means there is insufficient power to show genome-wide significance, although the lead SNP in an ALS GWAS study, rs35714695, which is far more common and hence does show genome-wide significance, is located only 8.3–11.4 kb from each of these strong GoF variants within the same ~200 kb linkage disequilibrium block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fogh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Rheenen et al., 2016</xref>). Although these are essentially independent observations, as it is not feasible to confirm linkage disequilibrium between such rare SNPs and rs35714695, they separately support the notion that SARM1 contributes to ALS. Hypothesis-driven studies such as this one are, of course, not unbiased in the way that GWAS is, but instead depend substantially on the strength of the hypothesis and the availability of clear functional data to support it. However, where these are both provided they have a vital role to play in complementing GWAS studies by closing the large heritability gap in ALS and other disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van Damme, 2018</xref>), since genome wide significance for genuinely pathogenic, but very rare alleles, may not be an achievable goal. The current study also illustrates the importance of publicly available datasets such as Project MinE in making such work possible.</p><p>Among the SARM1 variants tested for function in this study, the seven with strong NADase GoF can be clearly differentiated from the rest. However, we cannot rule out that a more modest increase in constitutive NADase GoF, directly demonstrated for some variants in NADase assays of recombinant protein (V88M, V112I, and A210V SARM1), or possibly implied for others based on their ability to modestly enhance NAD<sup>+</sup> loss in HEK cells (A275V and A341V SARM1), might also have biologically-relevant consequences. It was also surprising to us that raised constitutive activity was the only GoF effect we identified among the ALS patient-associated <italic>SARM1</italic> alleles, with no evidence of enhanced triggering by NMN from a normal basal level. While our recombinant protein assays provide a useful insight into the relative NMN-responsiveness of the different variants, and can clearly identify reduced NMN sensitivity, it is possible that some GoF relating to enhanced inducibility may not yet have been identified and that this could contribute to pathogenesis in some patients.</p><p>Recently, substantial progress has been made into elucidating the mechanism of auto-inhibition of SARM1 NADase activity by the ARM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shen et al., 2021</xref>) and the strong GoF variants identified here could represent useful tools for further understanding. Given their vastly higher activities relative to NMN-activated WT SARM1, it seems unlikely that the amino acid changes in the strong GoF variants simply mimic the effects of NMN binding and/or block NAD<sup>+</sup> binding in the allosteric site in the ARM domain and, notably, there is little direct overlap with residues that appear to be critical for NAD<sup>+</sup>/NMN interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Figley et al., 2021</xref>). Instead, constitutive activities similar to the activity of the SAM-TIR fragment of SARM1 lacking the entire auto-inhibitory ARM domain suggest that the amino acid changes probably cause more profound structural changes that disrupt inhibitory interaction between the ARM and TIR domains completely. This would also explain the complete unresponsiveness of the variants to NMN. Consistent with this, some of the changes in the strong GoF variants involve residues located at an ARM-TIR interface (R249 and E252), an ARM-SAM interface (V331) or an ARM-ARM interface (T385) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Given the potent pro-death effect of constitutively hyperactivated SARM1 in primary neuronal cultures, the heterogeneous clinical presentation of motor nerve disorder patients with strong GoF <italic>SARM1</italic> alleles is surprising. In fact, that they survive at all with such high constitutive SARM1 NADase activity is, in itself, unexpected given that our data indicate that WT SARM1 in the presence of NMN is less active than hetero-oligomers of WT and strong GoF SARM1 but is still predicted to be responsible for the early lethality in both mice and humans lacking functional NMNAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lukacs et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore propose that chronic, physiological expression of constitutively hyperactivated SARM1 specifically triggers compensatory responses during development to limit its impact. Suppressed expression of SARM1 itself, as seen in transfected HEK 293T cells, is one possible compensatory change that could restrict NADase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, although this seems to be a direct consequence of acute and extensive SARM1-dependent depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup> (and/or ATP) resulting in suppression of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis and it is hard to imagine long-term neuron survival under these conditions. Intriguingly, differential responses to constitutive or acute silencing of a single <italic>Nmnat2</italic> allele is also suggestive of compensatory changes in the chronic condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilley et al., 2013</xref>) and it is tempting to speculate that they might be related.</p><p>It will also be important to firmly establish the extent of the penetrance of the GoF alleles identified here and whether any show a familial association with motor nerve disorders. However, their presence in sporadic cases, and co-occurrence with partially-penetrant disease variants of other genes in some patients, suggest that they have to interact with other risk factors to reveal their pathogenicity. Future human genetics studies should help to address these possible associations. There are also a number of drug development programmes and other avenues of therapeutic intervention targeting SARM1 currently being pursued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geisler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hughes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosanac et al., 2021</xref>) and individuals with <italic>SARM1</italic> GoF alleles would thus be ideal test subjects if other requirements are met.</p><p>In summary, we report seven rare <italic>SARM1</italic> alleles encoding variants with constitutive NADase activity much higher than NMN-activated wild-type SARM1, and broadly comparable to that of completely uninhibited SARM1, that show clear association with ALS and other motor nerve disorders in a small percentage of patients. There is phenotypic heterogeneity in the clinical presentation, reminiscent of other ALS disease genes, and this raises intriguing questions both about the potential pathogenic role of constitutively hyperactive SARM1 and about why their extraordinarily high NADase activity is not immediately lethal. Association of function-altering coding variants also supports the notion that SARM1 has a wider contribution to ALS. While further replication in other cohorts is important, along with direct evidence that SARM1 activity is necessary for pathogenesis to firmly establish causation, the results presented here strongly implicate SARM1 as a risk factor in this group of diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs and reagents</title><p>The bicistronic pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 vector (Clontech / Takara Bio 632187) was the backbone for all SARM1 expression constructs used in this study, unless stated otherwise.

Efficient lysis with KHM buffer required an initial trituration by pipetting and intermittent vortexing over a 10 min incubation on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm in a microfuge at 4 °C to pellet insoluble material, and supernatants were then collected on ice and diluted to 0.5 µg/µl in cold KHM buffer after protein concentrations had been determined using the Pierce BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The NAD/NADH-Glo and NADP/NADPH-Glo assays (Promega) were used to measure NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup> in extracts. First, 25 µl of each extract was mixed with 12.5 µl 0.4 M HCl and heated to 60 °C for 15 min to degrade NADH and NADPH before being allowed to cool to room temperature (RT) for 10 min. Reactions were then neutralised by adding 12.5 µl 0.5 M Tris base and 10 µl of each neutralised reaction was mixed with 10 µl of the relevant detection reagent on ice in wells of a 384-well white polystyrene microplate (Corning). Once all reactions had been set up the plate was moved to a GloMax Explorer plate reader (Promega) and incubated for 40 min at 25 °C before reading for luminescence. The CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega) was used to measure ATP in extracts. Here, 10 µl of extract was mixed directly with 10 µl of assay reagent on ice in wells of a 384-well white polystyrene microplate. Luminescence was then read after 10 min at 25 °C using a GloMax Explorer plate reader.

For co-immunoprecipitations, beads were collected on a magnetic rack and washed 3 x with KHM buffer and 1 x with PBS (with protease inhibitors) and then resuspended in PBS containing 1 µg/µl BSA. Beads were resuspended in 150 µl per ml of the original immunoprecipitation volume for normal yield proteins, or 25–50 µl for low yield proteins. Inclusion of BSA in the re-suspension buffer allowed samples to be frozen without substantial loss of SARM1 activity (activity is almost completely lost after one freeze/thaw cycle without its inclusion). The concentrations of SARM1 proteins in the bead suspension were determined by comparison to a standard curve generated from a dilution series of recombinant SARM1 of known concentration (purified from insect cells) after detection by immunoblotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the SAM domains of human SARM1 (both kindly provided by AstraZeneca).</p><p>Of particular note, the use of KHM lysis buffer is critical for subsequent assaying of the NADase activity of the purified SARM1 protein.

Optimised reaction conditions were as follows: 25 µl reactions (overall 1 x PBS) contained 1 ng/µl SARM1 protein for strong GoF variants (L223P, Δ229–235, Δ249–252, V331E, E340K and T385A) or SAM-TIR fragment, or 5 ng/µl of WT SARM1 and other variants, together with 25 µM NAD<sup>+</sup> ± 10 µM or 50 µM NMN. Reactions were kept on ice until all had been set up. All reactions were performed with the recombinant SARM1 still attached to beads as inefficient elution severely restricted the yield of the poorly expressed GoF variants. Bead suspensions were thoroughly mixed prior to addition to the reactions. Constitutive (basal) NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption was measured from reactions containing just NAD<sup>+</sup> as the difference between starting levels (0 hr) and levels remaining after a 1 hr (for strong GoF variants) or 2 hr (for all other variants) incubation at 25 °C. NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption in the presence of NMN (both 10 µM and 50 µM) was calculated after a 1 hr incubation for all variants. Reactions were each mixed once mid-way through the incubation period to resuspend the beads. To measure NAD<sup>+</sup> using the NAD/NADH-Glo assay, 5 µl aliquots of the reaction were removed immediately after setting up (whilst still on ice), to obtain precise starting levels in individual reactions, and after the defined times listed above. Aliquots were then mixed with 2.5 µl of 0.4 M HCl, to stop the reaction, and neutralised by mixing with 2.5 µl 0.5 M Tris base after 10 min. To bring NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations down to the linear range of the NAD/NADH-Gloassay, neutralised samples were subsequently diluted 1 in 50 in a buffer consisting of 50 % PBS, 25 % 0.4 M HCL, 25 % 0.5 M Tris base. Ten µl of the diluted sample was then mixed with 10 µl of detection reagent on ice in wells of a 384-well white polystyrene microplate (Corning). Once all reactions had been set up the plate was moved to a GloMax Explorer plate reader (Promega) and incubated for 40 min at 25 °C before reading for luminescence. NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations were determined from standard curves (as above). NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption rates were converted to mol consumed per min per mol of SARM1 protein (mol/min/mol SARM1). This allows a direct comparison of rates between full-length SARM1 and the SAM-TIR fragment. Individual data points for each separate protein preparation are the means of two technical replicates in most cases. Non-specific activity on bead/antibody complexes in control immunoprecipitations (from HEK 293T cells transfected with empty vector) was negligible at less than 0.5 % of the constitutive NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption seen for WT SARM1 (average of n = 4 assays).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Protein extracts from transfected HEK 293T cells used for nucleotide measurements (0.5 µg protein/µl, see above) were diluted 1 in 2 with 2 x SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and bead suspensions of immunoprecipitated recombinant SARM1 proteins were diluted 1 in 16 for immunoblotting. Samples were incubated at 100 °C for 3 min and 10 µl of sample per lane resolved on 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) before being transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked in TBS (20 mM Tris p.H. 8.3, 150 mM NaCl) containing 5 % skim milk powder for 30 mins at RT before being incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in TBS containing 0.05 % Tween-20 (Merck) (TBST) and 5 % milk. After 3 × 10 min washes in TBST, blots were incubated for 1–2 hr at RT with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted 1 in 3,000, Bio-Rad) in TBST with 5 % milk. After 3 × 10 min washes in TBST and one rinse in TBS, blots were incubated with Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate or SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (both Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged using an Alliance chemiluminescence imaging system (UVITEC Cambridge).

Mice were used in accordance with the Home Office Animal Scientific Procedures Act (ASPA), 1986 under project licence P98A03BF9. Dissected SCG ganglia were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in 0.025 % trypsin (Sigma) dissolved in PBS followed by 20 min in 0.2 % collagenase type II (Gibco) in PBS (with calcium and magnesium). After, ganglia were gently triturated using a pipette tip in SCG culture medium comprising Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (4500 mg/L glucose and 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate, Sigma) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen), 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 10 % fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 µg/ml aphidicolin (Calbiochem), and 100 ng/ml 7 S NGF (Invitrogen). After a 1–2 hr pre-plating stage to remove non-neuronal cells, dissociated neurons were plated in a small laminin-coated area on ibidi µ-dishes pre-coated with poly-L-lysine (Thistle Scientific). Cultures were maintained in SCG medium, which was changed every 2–3 days, and were injected after 5–7 days. The inclusion of aphidicolin in the medium suppressed growth and proliferation of any non-neuronal cells.</p><p>SCG neurons were microinjected using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with an Eppendorf 5,171 transjector and 5,246 micromanipulator system and Eppendorf Femtotips. Expression constructs were diluted in 0.5 x PBS and cleared by spinning through a Spin-X filter (Costar). The mix was injected into the nuclei of SCG neurons. The concentrations of expression constructs in the injection mix are listed in figure legends. A total of 40–45 neurons were injected per dish. Although ZsGreen is co-expressed from the SARM1 vector used in these studies, restricting the amount of vector injected to limit SARM1 expression meant that the resulting ZsGreen expression was itself not sufficient for clear visualisation of injected neurons and their neurites. For the purposes of visualisation we thus had to co-inject a DsRed expression construct at a higher concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Imaging</title><p>Fluorescence and phase contrast images of transfected HEK 293T cells and injected SCG neurons were acquired with a Leica DFC365FX fluorescence monochrome camera attached to a Leica DMi8 inverted fluorescence microscope using 10 x and 20 x objectives.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Database resources</title><p>The different datasets used in this study are annotated to different genome builds, either Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 37 (GRCh37), also known as hg19 (for Project MinE, GENESIS and the HSP cohort) or GRCh38/ hg38 (for Answer ALS, UCL and the LBC). GRCh37 is annotated to a non-canonical <italic>SARM1</italic> cDNA and there are sequence irregularities compared to GRCh38 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend). Therefore, throughout this study we only report <italic>SARM1</italic> genetic variation using numbering for genome build to GRCh38 and the canonical 724 amino acid SARM1 protein (having converted all GRCh37-based information from datasets that use that build). For this reason, we also use population MAFs reported in gnomAD v3.1.1 in this study as it is referenced to GRCh38 (as opposed to gnomAD v2.1.1 which is referenced to GRCh37 and consequently contains a number of MAF discrepancies and additionally a lack of coverage for some alleles).</p><p>Many neurological disorders are represented in the complete GENESIS and UCL databases. Therefore, for the purposes of this study, our disease cohorts are restricted to individuals with motor nerve disorders and our control cohorts are restricted to unaffected individuals and individuals with non-neurological conditions. For GENESIS, the disease cohort consisted of individuals with ALS, pure or complex HSP, distal hereditary motor neuropathy and frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease, and the control cohort consisted of unaffected individuals, individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy and small numbers of individuals with metabolic or congenital disorders. For the UCL dataset, the disease cohort consisted of cases of spinal muscular atrophy and related disorders (including ALS), HSP and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, and the control cohort consisted of unaffected (control) individuals and a smaller number of individuals with Cluster headache syndrome.</p><p>Sample sequencing, variant calling and quality control methods for each dataset are broadly comparable. These are described elsewhere for Project MinE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Project MinE ALS Sequencing Consortium, 2018</xref>) and the LBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wragg et al., 2020</xref>). Information for <italic>SARM1</italic> variants in the Answer ALS project was obtained using ANNOVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) annotation on GRCh38 positions, after read mapping with Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li and Durbin, 2010</xref>), variant calling with GATK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>), and joint-genotype using Sentieon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freed et al., 2017</xref>). For GENESIS samples, Illumina WGS sequencing samples were aligned to the GRCh37 reference using BWA. Duplicate reads were marked using Picard’s MarkDuplicates utility. The bam file containing de-dupped reads was then used to call single nucleotide variations and indels using Freebayes, prior to October 2018, or later with GATK (v4). For the UCL rare disease dataset, exome sequencing was performed using the Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6 enrichment and enriched libraries underwent 150 base pair, paired-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSeqX10 next-generation sequencing platform. Sequence data were aligned to GRCh38 and variant calling using GATK with filtering of PCR duplicates. For the HSP study samples, WES and WGS sequencing data were processed by GSvar pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits">https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schroeder et al., 2017</xref>) and sequencing files were aligned to GRCh37 human reference by BWA. Variants were called by GATK v4 with filtering of PCR duplicates. It was not feasible within the context of this study to validate variants by obtaining raw sequencing data or DNAs for Sanger sequencing but there is strong confidence in calling all variants tested in this study based on phred-scaled quality scores, when available.</p><p>Although complete ancestry information is not available to us, the vast majority of samples in all datasets used in this study, other than those in the GENESIS cohorts, are expected to be of predominantly European ancestry, and even within the GENESIS cohorts a smaller majority are expected to be of European origin. This is broadly supported by the observed frequency of the P332Q <italic>SARM1</italic> allele in each cohort, an allele that is relatively more common in the European (non-Finnish) population than other populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As such, ancestry is not expected to have a substantial effect on the association statistics we have performed using aggregated data.</p><p>No new datasets or code were generated for this study.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Enrichment of SARM1 alleles encoding variants with constitutively hyperactive NADase in patients with ALS and other motor nerve disorders&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor and J. Paul Taylor as the Reviewing Editor. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers and reviewing editor thought that the findings described in this manuscript are potentially very important, underscoring a role for axonal degeneration in some forms of motor neuron disease and providing rationale for SARM1-directed therapeutic intervention. There were some suggestions for strengthening the functional data, but for the most part this aspect of the manuscript was considered a strength. On the other hand, the genetic evidence was considered insufficiently persuasive to support publication at this time. This issue was discussed in some detail and this resulted in some specific suggestions for approaches to strengthening this aspect of the study, including validation in independent cohorts (several large cohorts exist that are likely to be receptive), and functional evaluation of a greater number of variants, including not only those unique to cases, but also those shared by cases and controls. Evidence of gain of function in variants shared by cases and controls (or unique to controls) would undermine the significance of the association.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This work initially investigates the possible role of SARM1 in the pathogenesis of ALS by testing for an enrichment of rare alleles within cases and controls from the Project Mine Consortium dataset. Here, they identify an increase in rare variants within the autoinhibitory ARM domain of SARM1. Functional assays were employed to demonstrate that several of the variants display constitutively active properties. Further evaluation of additional databases identified the enriched alleles in ALS and HSP cases. The authors conclude that the alleles represent risk alleles for ALS and other motor nerve disorders.</p><p>Although the identification of risk factors for ALS and elucidating their pathogenic mechanism is of high relevance, several of the conclusions are not fully supported by the data analysis and need to be extended.</p><p>1. The testing for enrichment of SARM1 alleles within cases vs. controls in the Project Mine dataset was not performed at an unbiased genome-wide level but rather at the candidate gene level. This is reminiscent of candidate gene association testing prior to the advent of GWAS. Unfortunately, &gt;90% of published candidate gene associations were shown to be false-positives once GWAS studies were conducted. As such, caution must be taken in interpreting these results. If indeed a genome-wide multiple test correction were applied to the association testing, the results as presented would not be statistically significant. Further, odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals resulting from the data analysis should be presented.</p><p>2. The association testing limits itself to only testing variants within the Project Mine dataset. This dataset is limited in the number of controls and may be underpowered to achieve genome-wide significance. Data from the additional sets (gnomAD, AnswerALS, Genesis) described within the manuscript could be incorporated to improve the burden testing. Please note that caution should be taken in combining aggregate data sets to ensure that functional equivalent pipelines and variant calling parameters were used. This is especially the case for rare variants and difficult to call variants (i.e. indels). It is ideal that identified rare variants, especially indels, are validated using Sanger sequencing or other method.</p><p>3. The study does not appear to address possible effects of population stratification or other quality control parameters (e.g. sample call rates, variant call rates, etc.) within any of the data sets used for the burden testing.</p><p>4. Several aspects of the functional assay were concerning in supporting the conclusions of the manuscript. Most of the functional experiments were performed in HEK293 cells. For such experiments, a neuronal cell line would be more appropriate. More importantly though, the near total lack of expression of SARM1 variant forms displaying the proposed gain of function activity is most concerning. The reason for the decreased expression was not rigorously addressed. For instance, was the lower expression due to lower RNA expression, increased protein degradation or even possibly due to protein aggregation that may not be detected under the immunoblotting conditions. Alternatively, given that a C-terminal Flag epitope tag was used, transcription or translation could have been prematurely terminated. Establishing the cause of the lower level of expression may shed light on understanding the mechanism of these variants.</p><p>5. Similarly, the suppression of expression of ZsGreen (and subsequently DsRed) which is expressed through an IRES element within the SARM1 expression construct, was not appropriately addressed. The rational that this is due to the gain of function properties of the SARM1 variants is not supported by the data presented.</p><p>6. Several figures lacked a vector only control and none of the figures displayed the position of molecular weight markers. Further, the level of exogenous vs. endogenous SARM1 expression was not compared throughout the study. As such, it is difficult to assess the possible contribution of the endogenous protein towards the results observed. This information may be valuable is assessing the mechanism of the variant forms.</p><p>7. The manuscript briefly mentions that SARM1 forms an octamer complex (Nature 588:658-663). As such, the possibility exists that the SARM1 variants are also contributing their effects through a dominant negative mechanism. It is not known if the SARM1 variants can bind to the WT SARM1.</p><p>8. The study microinjects expression constructs into SARM1-/- primary neurons to investigate the response when expressing WT or variant SARM1. Initial experiments demonstrated that injection with WT SARM1 is enough to restore injury-induced neurite degeneration to SARM1-/- neurons. However, the variant SARM1 was not individually expressed into the SARM1-/- but only co-expressed with WT SARM1. Evaluating the SARM1 variant's ability to restore injury-induced neurite degeneration to SARM1-/- neurons would provide additional insight into its mechanism.</p><p>9. The manuscript states that injection of the SARM1 constructs was hampered by the limited ability to assess neuron survival. An alternative approach commonly used to study the effect of mutant ALS genes is by longitudinal imaging of primary neurons transfected with expression constructs for ALS associated genes (J. Neurosci. 30:639-649 (2010)).</p><p>10. The manuscript describes association testing of only the initial 8 rare variants observed in the Project Mine dataset within the Answer ALS and Genesis datasets. The testing includes the original Project Mine dataset and therefore do not represent an independent replication set. Further, burden testing of only the initial 8 rare variants is biased for the original hypothesis that there is an enrichment in rare variants in the ARM domain. Such tests should include all rare variants identified in the ARM domain observed within cases and controls, not just the initially observed variants.</p><p>If indeed there is a true association of rare variants in the ARM domain of SARM1 and ALS, the manuscript will be of high impact. In addition to addressing the concerns above, several additional experiments are suggested to strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>11. As noted, GWAS have detected an association between a variant within the SARM1 region (rs35714695; Nature Gen. 48: 1043-1048) and ALS. Given the enrichment of the delta226-232 (rs782325355), it would of interest to test whether these 2 variants are in linkage disequilibrium with each other.</p><p>12. Allele frequency data from gnomAD was shown for the alleles detected in the Project Mine dataset. Although not optimal, incorporating this large dataset into the burden testing may help validate the enrichment. However, a quick evaluation of the gnomAD database shows that there are many rare alleles present within the ARM domain (amino acids 61-397) of SARM1 with a combined allele frequency greater than that observed in the Project Mine dataset (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000004139?dataset=gnomad_r3 ).</p><p>13. The optimal analysis for enrichment would be to obtain raw sequencing data from large number of cases and controls (Project Mine, AnswerALS, Genesis, and additional datasets from dbGaP and EGA). The raw data can then be harmonized together and allow for proper QC. However, this deep of an analysis is quite intensive.</p><p>14. Table 1 is confusing in several aspects. The table may be clearer by presenting the chromosome position, major/alternative alleles, dbSNP ID, protein effect and allele frequencies within the cases and controls (as opposed to allele count).</p><p>15. In the functional assays, incorporation of a constitutively active form of SARM1, previously created by mutating the ARM domain (Nature 588:658-663), would be useful to demonstrate similar gain of function activities.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors screened patient data for mutations associated with ALS and found the auto-inhibitory ARM domain of Sarm1 to be important. This is the domain that keeps Sarm1, an NAD+ hydrolase that drive degeneration, off. Interestingly, many of these mutations were found to increase the ability of Sarm1 to drive NAD+ loss in HEK cells, and efficiently degrade NAD+ when purfied and assayed <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is consistent with the notion that they are GOF. In agreement with this effect being via the ARM domain, many are insensitive to further stimulation by NMN, which is thought to activate Sarm1 through destabilizing ARM-TIR interactions. Overall, this is an rigorous study that makes a compelling case for these ALS-associated mutations being GOF. Now the question is, do these mutations cause ALS?</p><p>It is quite puzzling that many of these mutations are tolerated in patients to such an age, when many are more potent than the ARM-deleted (thought to be fully-activated) version of Sarm1. This is likely to change how we think about Sarm1 regulation.</p><p>It is important to consider that the amounts of NMN used (10 or 50 uM) are quite high. Cellular levels are thought to be much lower.</p><p>Please discuss the caveats of the NMN studies.</p><p>Can any prediction be made from the recent structural work on Sarm1 to inform how these variants might alter the ARM domain?</p><p>How do patients live so long with these mutations?</p><p>Did the authors generate any NADase-dead (E642A) versions of these molecules? If so, did that completely block their effects?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70905.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

In contrast, there are still no carriers of these alleles within the new control groups. In total, we now have 11,117 cases and 10,402 confirmed ALS-free controls in our combined datasets and we have matched their ancestry as far as is reasonably possible. Another large exome cohort we explored appears to have poor representation of the ARM domain, as indicated by complete absence of the most common, and probably functionally neutral, ARM domain variant (P332Q), so this dataset was not included. Crucially, the confirmed gain-of-function (GoF) variants remain patient-specific in the expanded cohorts, and if the statistics are recalculated with inclusion of data from the best-matched gnomAD population, this further strengthens the significance, despite the likelihood of there being some ALS cases within the gnomAD ‘non-neuro’ population that would weaken this conclusion.</p><p>We acknowledge that a hypothesis-driven approach has some caveats as there is a reliance on the strength of the hypothesis and the functional data supporting it. However, both are very strong in this study. We now address this in Discussion paragraph 3, where we also discuss the essential role of well-founded, function-led studies such as this in closing the heritability gap, and the crucial role of public WGS data in Project MinE for this. These complement unbiased, genome-wide studies because rare, but genuinely pathogenic variants may otherwise be impossible to identify because even the largest datasets lack sufficient power.</p><p>As suggested, we have performed functional evaluation of more variants that are present either just in controls (3) or just in patients (2) (Figure 4). None of the control-specific alleles shows strong GoF. We have also addressed all other comments from both reviewers below, including the addition of substantial amounts of new data. To accommodate this new data and provide more clarity with respect to our main hypothesis we have substantially re-structured and re-written parts of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This work initially investigates the possible role of SARM1 in the pathogenesis of ALS by testing for an enrichment of rare alleles within cases and controls from the Project Mine Consortium dataset.

However, the hypothesis that SARM1 contributes to ALS is already based in part on genome-wide significant association of a nearby SARM1 intragenic SNP in GWAS studies, and well-founded, hypothesis-led studies have an essential role in closing the heritability gap that we also now discuss (Discussion paragraph 3). This may be the only realistic way to identify true pathogenic roles of many rare variants, when even the largest datasets lack sufficient power to rule them either in or out at genome-wide level, and co-ordinating even larger ones is impractical. Moreover, the genome-wide rare variant burden analysis previously used for loss-of-function variants, for example with KIF5A, NEK1, etc, cannot be done for GoF variants as very few can be predicted from sequence alone. However, despite their rarity, their identification is important, because evidence of harmful SARM1 GoF associated with ALS supports the notion that other causes of SARM1 activation could also be involved, for example downstream of STMN2 depletion or SARM1 activation by environmental toxins such as that we recently reported <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.304261v2">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.18.304261v2</ext-link>.</p><p>Regarding multiple test correction, the whole genome burden test at gene level is not as demanding as GWAS as it is corrected by the number of genes rather than number of SNPs. While we agree there could still be random associations, the p value of 0.00017 is quite convincing, especially considering that a more common SARM1 intragenic SNP that does show genome-wide significant association with ALS (RS35714695) is located just 8-11kb from most of these variants and the ones we include in this calculation all show confirmed GoF. This contrasts with the complete lack of association in neighbouring variants that we found are not strong GoF and illustrates why inclusion of these in the burden test risks masking a genuine pathogenic role of the rare hyperactivating variants.</p><p>A true odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) cannot be calculated for burden tests, as different variants have different effect sizes and different directions. Calculation of an accurate OR is also problematic since the number of GoF variants among the controls is zero. Adding a continuity correction of 0.5 would give an OR well into double figures but also a huge CI ranging from very low to several hundred, which would be of little use.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Crucially, the first tests were only performed as a broad indicator that coding variation in the ARM domain might be relevant in ALS, prior to any functional data being obtained, whereas it was the later tests that were used to specifically assess the strength of our main hypothesis that SARM1 GoF is associated with ALS and other motor nerve disorders. Therefore, to avoid possible confusion, we have omitted the first tests from the revised manuscript (as they are anyhow effectively rendered superfluous by the later tests), and we have also re-structured the first Results section for greater clarity with regard to generation of our main hypothesis.</p><p>More specifically, data from Answer ALS and GENESIS were already included in the burden/SKAT-O tests reported on page 13 in the original manuscript. In the revised manuscript we have now also added patients and controls from Project MinE Data Freeze 2, a UCL rare disease dataset and an HSP cohort, along with additional controls from the Lothian Birth Cohort. We are cautious about including gnomAD because, unlike these well-phenotyped cohorts, gnomAD does not exclude individuals who may have ALS. Even the ‘non-neuro’ filter only excludes samples obtained from neurological or psychiatric studies, so with a lifetime risk of ALS of around 1/350 it is almost certain there will be many ALS cases even in this filtered group. We have, however, run a separate comparison that shows significant enrichment of the confirmed SARM1 GoF variants relative to the best matched background population (European non-Finnish, non-neuro) in gnomAD v3.1.1 (reasons for specifically using this release are provided in the Materials and methods in the revised manuscript) consisting of 30,000+ individuals. This actually strengthens the association (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.000057). As such, the association testing now described in the penultimate Results section is much more thorough, and data for individual cohorts and aggregate data can now be found in two new tables (Table 3 and Table 4 in the revised manuscript). We agree about the need for caution in combining datasets and have taken steps to address this (see below). Unfortunately, we do not have access to the DNAs to perform Sanger sequencing (now noted in the Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The study does not appear to address possible effects of population stratification or other quality control parameters (e.g. sample call rates, variant call rates, etc.) within any of the data sets used for the burden testing.</p></disp-quote><p>Testing for such covariates across all cohorts is not feasible because this will require access to individual level data. In addition, we have done all that can reasonably be done to address population stratification by using aggregate data from predominantly European datasets and by comparing study dataset frequencies with the European non-Finnish gnomAD population (Table 4 in the revised manuscript). The frequency of the relatively more common P332Q allele, which has a higher frequency in Europeans than other populations, broadly confirms that each dataset is predominantly European or contains a substantial proportion of individuals of European ancestry, as discussed in the Database resources section of the Materials and methods and the Table 3 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Importantly, we specifically chose to purify recombinant protein from HEK cells, rather than bacterial or insect cells, as they should support any mammalian-specific post-translational modification that might be critical for NADase activity.</p><p>We have addressed the points raised about the low level of expression of GoF variants with new data in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and additional discussion within the main text in the context of a recent report (Izadifar et al., 2021, PMID: 34384519) that describes a similar effect with overexpression of WT SARM1. That study established that SARM1 overexpression suppresses <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis in an NADase-dependent manner. Our new data, showing that expression of the strong GoF SARM1 variants and co-expressed ZsGreen is increased when NAD<sup>+</sup> production is boosted by nicotinamide riboside supplementation, is entirely consistent with this model. Importantly, this model is further supported by other observations throughout the paper, which we now point out. We also rule out an involvement of truncated form of the variants in question by immunoblotting with antibodies against both the N- and C-terminus of SARM1-Flag. We consider that a low level of expression of full-length variants in HEK cells actually reinforces their strong GoF credentials – essentially much greater NAD consumption is achieved by much less protein. We agree that this a potentially important and relevant observation and this is the reason we highlighted it in the original manuscript. Surprisingly, other manuscripts reporting SARM1 GoF variants / mutants do not appear to report levels of protein expression in (untreated) cells, but we expect they would see a similar effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Similarly, the suppression of expression of ZsGreen (and subsequently DsRed) which is expressed through an IRES element within the SARM1 expression construct, was not appropriately addressed.

Several figures lacked a vector only control and none of the figures displayed the position of molecular weight markers.</p></disp-quote><p>All experiments were performed with vector only controls (empty vector). In the HEK cell assays all data was normalised to data from cells transfected with empty vector alone (set at 1, and now shown as a dotted line on graphs). In the NADase assays of recombinant proteins, immunoprecipitations from cells transfected with empty vector were performed in parallel to assess non-specific pull-down of contaminating NAD-consuming activities. A proportionately insignificant NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming activity was seen for these immunoprecipitations. These results were already noted in the relevant section of the Materials and methods in original submission. However, it is not possible to convey this activity in direct relation to that of the SARM1 proteins on graphs reporting mol/min/mol enzyme rate as there is no measurable SARM1 in these controls immunoprecipitations. For the SCG injection experiments, the failure to show (or even mention) empty vector control data was an oversight. These have now been included as new supplementary data (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><p>We have also now added the positions of molecular weight markers for all blots in all figures (relative migration of protein bands and molecular weight markers can also be seen in the source data files for each blot that were included with the original submission).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the level of exogenous vs. endogenous SARM1 expression was not compared throughout the study. As such, it is difficult to assess the possible contribution of the endogenous protein towards the results observed. This information may be valuable is assessing the mechanism of the variant forms.</p></disp-quote><p>Endogenous SARM1 expression in HEK cells is barely detectable under the conditions we use that can readily detect exogenous WT SARM1 and variants. We have now included a representative blot in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and discuss what this means for our assays in the main text and relevant figure legends. Essentially endogenous should not make a significant contribution in the HEK cell-based assays or for recombinant protein purified from HEK cells (as a result of co-precipitation in oligomers with the exogenous SARM1).</p><p>The situation in injected SCG neurons is less clear, but the amount of expression construct was titrated to minimise pro-death effects of WT SARM1 due to overexpression so it is likely that endogenous SARM1 (which is easily detected by immunostaining using a SARM1 antibody) will be more abundant than the low level of exogenous WT or GoF SARM1 (which cannot be readily detected by immunofluorescence). We have included a comment in the text to that effect, but unfortunately, a direct quantification of endogenous and exogenous SARM1 expression levels in injected SCGs is technically very challenging and would be unreliable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The manuscript briefly mentions that SARM1 forms an octamer complex (Nature 588:658-663). As such, the possibility exists that the SARM1 variants are also contributing their effects through a dominant negative mechanism. It is not known if the SARM1 variants can bind to the WT SARM1.</p></disp-quote><p>On this point, we believe the reviewer might have been referring to a possible dominant-positive effect rather than dominant-negative effect (which if it occurred, would be protective not harmful). We previously showed some data supporting this possibility (Figure 3A and 3B in the orginal, now Figure 5A and 5B) but have investigated this in more detail and now provide additional data. This includes co-immunoprecipitation data showing strong GoF SARM1 can oligomerise with WT SARM1 (Figure 5C) and that hetero-oligomers of the two have an intermediate activity (Figure 5D) suggesting that each contributes their individual activity equally to the complex. Importantly, hetero-oligomers of WT and strong GoF SARM1 still have much higher activity than WT SARM1 alone and this explains the &quot;dominant&quot; effect of expression of the strong GoF SARM1 alongside endogenous WT SARM1 in SCG neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The study microinjects expression constructs into SARM1-/- primary neurons to investigate the response when expressing WT or variant SARM1. Initial experiments demonstrated that injection with WT SARM1 is enough to restore injury-induced neurite degeneration to SARM1-/- neurons. However, the variant SARM1 was not individually expressed into the SARM1-/- but only co-expressed with WT SARM1. Evaluating the SARM1 variant's ability to restore injury-induced neurite degeneration to SARM1-/- neurons would provide additional insight into its mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>SCG neuron experiments reported in the main figures are restricted to wild-type cultures so that the GoF variant is expressed on a background of endogenous SARM1 to mirror, as best we can, the situation in heterozygous individuals who will express both wild-type and variant SARM1 together. This is outlined in the main text. One of the figure supplements describes the ability of WT SARM1, but not enzymatically-inactive E642A SARM1, to restore axon degeneration in <italic>Sarm1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neurons, but this was simply to show that the amount of expression vector we inject provides sufficient expression of WT SARM1 to be functionally relevant. A similar assessment of strong GoF in this context is more difficult given the associated strong pro-death effect on cell bodies and, whilst interesting, the results would not impact the overall conclusions made in the paper as we already demonstrate clear pro-death/degeneration effects of a strong GoF variant in our current assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The manuscript states that injection of the SARM1 constructs was hampered by the limited ability to assess neuron survival. An alternative approach commonly used to study the effect of mutant ALS genes is by longitudinal imaging of primary neurons transfected with expression constructs for ALS associated genes (J. Neurosci. 30:639-649 (2010)).</p></disp-quote><p>We actually consider our injection assay to be very comparable to the assays described in the citation provided and anticipate that the same problems relating to visualisation of cells injected with the GoF construct (which hampers assessing the effects on neuron/neurite survival rather than injection itself) would also apply to transfected primary neurons (as in transfected HEKs). Furthermore, we feel that injection allows for much greater control over several key variables than transfection (control over quantity of construct introduced and an ability to target neurons in a defined location, among others). We alluded to these benefits as being one reason for favouring this assay but have made this clearer in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The manuscript describes association testing of only the initial 8 rare variants observed in the Project Mine dataset within the Answer ALS and Genesis datasets. The testing includes the original Project Mine dataset and therefore do not represent an independent replication set. Further, burden testing of only the initial 8 rare variants is biased for the original hypothesis that there is an enrichment in rare variants in the ARM domain. Such tests should include all rare variants identified in the ARM domain observed within cases and controls, not just the initially observed variants.</p></disp-quote><p>Grouping all rare ARM domain variants together in the burden testing across multiple cohorts, makes the assumption that they are all functionally equivalent, but this is clearly not the case. We have grouped variants together based on strong functional data and we see a strong association with disease for the strong GoF variant group and a complete lack of association for the larger group of other variants that have properties more like WT SARM1. Grouping all variants together therefore would raise the real risk of the non-GoF variants masking a genuine pathogenic role of the smaller number of rare hyperactivating variants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If indeed there is a true association of rare variants in the ARM domain of SARM1 and ALS, the manuscript will be of high impact. In addition to addressing the concerns above, several additional experiments are suggested to strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>11. As noted, GWAS have detected an association between a variant within the SARM1 region (rs35714695; Nature Gen. 48: 1043-1048) and ALS. Given the enrichment of the delta226-232 (rs782325355), it would of interest to test whether these 2 variants are in linkage disequilibrium with each other.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting suggestion, but even the most common GoF variant is too rare to give any meaningful indication of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the GWAS SNP (D’=1; r<sup>2</sup> = 2.147845e-05). Thus, as we now outline in Discussion paragraph 3, the GWAS and the association with rare GoF variants are independent pieces of data both supporting the involvement of SARM1 in ALS, but each with its own different caveats. Importantly, the reviewer’s question also prompted us to note the close physical proximity of the GWAS SNP and all of the strong GoF SNPs we studied (8.3-11.4kb), all within the same LD block and all within the SARM1 gene so this is now also pointed out in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Allele frequency data from gnomAD was shown for the alleles detected in the Project Mine dataset. Although not optimal, incorporating this large dataset into the burden testing may help validate the enrichment. However, a quick evaluation of the gnomAD database shows that there are many rare alleles present within the ARM domain (amino acids 61-397) of SARM1 with a combined allele frequency greater than that observed in the Project Mine dataset (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000004139?dataset=gnomad_r3 ).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have considered the burden analysis for known GoF variants both with and without the inclusion of the best matched gnomAD population on page 17, and despite its caveats (that there are likely to be some gnomAD individuals with ALS or HSP) its inclusion does increase the significance. Regarding the other rare ARM domain variants in gnomAD, whilst there are many and together they have a higher combined allele frequency, the fact remains that they are absent in our cohorts. Testing each of them for GoF is also neither feasible nor particularly useful given their extremely low individual frequencies, and including them in the analysis regardless of whether they cause functional change adds unnecessary noise as reasoned above in point 10. The gnomAD dataset also includes several very different ethnic populations so a correct comparison would need to stratify it accordingly. Thus, we prefer to limit the inclusion of gnomAD data to that reported in the penultimate Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The optimal analysis for enrichment would be to obtain raw sequencing data from large number of cases and controls (Project Mine, AnswerALS, Genesis, and additional datasets from dbGaP and EGA). The raw data can then be harmonized together and allow for proper QC. However, this deep of an analysis is quite intensive.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that analysing raw sequencing data for all of these and other cohorts would be very intensive and is thus not really feasible within the timeframe of normal revisions. However, there is strong confidence in the calling of the variants tested in this study based on phred-scaled quality scores (when available). We have included a comment in the Materials and methods in this regard.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Table 1 is confusing in several aspects. The table may be clearer by presenting the chromosome position, major/alternative alleles, dbSNP ID, protein effect and allele frequencies within the cases and controls (as opposed to allele count).</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide substantially more detail about the variants (both ARM domain and other regions) for both Project MinE (data freeze 1) and Answer ALS in Table 1 and Table 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. In the functional assays, incorporation of a constitutively active form of SARM1, previously created by mutating the ARM domain (Nature 588:658-663), would be useful to demonstrate similar gain of function activities.</p></disp-quote><p>Constitutive NADase activities obtained from the recombinant protein assays were already compared to the activity of the well-established SAM-TIR fragment lacking the entire auto-inhibitory ARM domain. This is widely considered in the field to have &quot;maximal&quot; activity and be the most suitable reference for GoF. In the original submission the data was rather hidden away in the main text and based on activity measurements from independent experiments. We have now repeated the experiments in parallel with one of the strong GoF variants identified in this study and present the data in Figure 3B in the revised manuscript. Importantly the reported activities in these assays are per mol rates allowing the most accurate comparison possible. This is not possible using indirect measures from transfected cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:The authors screened patient data for mutations associated with ALS and found the auto-inhibitory ARM domain of Sarm1 to be important. This is the domain that keeps Sarm1, an NAD+ hydrolase that drive degeneration, off. Interestingly, many of these mutations were found to increase the ability of Sarm1 to drive NAD+ loss in HEK cells, and efficiently degrade NAD+ when purfied and assayed <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is consistent with the notion that they are GOF. In agreement with this effect being via the ARM domain, many are insensitive to further stimulation by NMN, which is thought to activate Sarm1 through destabilizing ARM-TIR interactions. Overall, this is an rigorous study that makes a compelling case for these ALS-associated mutations being GOF. Now the question is, do these mutations cause ALS?</p><p>It is quite puzzling that many of these mutations are tolerated in patients to such an age, when many are more potent than the ARM-deleted (thought to be fully-activated) version of Sarm1. This is likely to change how we think about Sarm1 regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we have discussed this point in paragraph 6 of the Discussion. We consider it very likely that this inconsistency points to compensatory changes during development in the carriers in response to chronic expression of strong NADase activity. At this point we cannot provide any detail about what these changes might be.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is important to consider that the amounts of NMN used (10 or 50 uM) are quite high. Cellular levels are thought to be much lower.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our assays of recombinant proteins will not reflect physiological conditions but we have now provided explanations in the relevant parts of the main text as to why we chose these concentrations and how they might relate to physiological levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can any prediction be made from the recent structural work on Sarm1 to inform how these variants might alter the ARM domain?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting suggestion. We have touched on the relationship between the GoF variants and existing structural knowledge in paragraph 5 of the Discussion. However, in our experience this is not a substitute for empirical testing although sometimes it is useful as a guide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do patients live so long with these mutations?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, this is one of the key questions arising from this work and we allude to it several times in the manuscript. However, as yet, we cannot provide an answer. This will be the focus of follow-up studiesbut we consider it out of the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors generate any NADase-dead (E642A) versions of these molecules? If so, did that completely block their effects?</p></disp-quote><p>We have made a double mutant combining E642A with one of the strong GoF mutations and we describe its effects in some of our key assays in new Figure 7. Most importantly, we show that this blocks the pro-death effects in SCG neurons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
