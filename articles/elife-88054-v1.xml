The resulting aneuploidy can drive evolution and associates with poor prognosis in various cancer types as well as poor response to T-cell checkpoint blockade in melanoma. Macrophages and the SIRPα-CD47 checkpoint are understudied in such contexts. Here, CIN is induced in poorly immunogenic B16F10 mouse melanoma cells using spindle assembly checkpoint MPS1 inhibitors that generate persistent micronuclei and diverse aneuploidy while skewing macrophages toward a tumoricidal ‘M1-like’ phenotype based on markers and short-term anti-tumor studies. Mice bearing CIN-afflicted tumors with wild-type CD47 levels succumb similar to controls, but long-term survival is maximized by SIRPα blockade on adoptively transferred myeloid cells plus anti-tumor monoclonal IgG. Such cells are the initiating effector cells, and survivors make de novo anti-cancer IgG that not only promote phagocytosis of CD47-null cells but also suppress tumor growth. CIN does not affect the IgG response, but pairing CIN with maximal macrophage anti-cancer activity increases durable cures that possess a vaccination-like response against recurrence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>SIRPα</kwd><kwd>antibodies</kwd><kwd>CIN</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 CA254886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Discher</surname><given-names>Dennis E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 CA265794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Discher</surname><given-names>Dennis E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP DGE-1845298</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayes</surname><given-names>Brandon H</given-names></name><name><surname>Andrechak</surname><given-names>Jason C</given-names></name><name><surname>Tobin</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 CA228285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dooling</surname><given-names>Lawrence J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chromosomal instability induced in solid tumors can combine with macrophages that are made highly phagocytic to thereby initiate elimination of and immunity against poorly immunogenic tumors in immunocompetent mice.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosomal instability (CIN) has long been associated with poor prognosis and reduced immune cell activity against tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vasudevan et al., 2021</xref>). The high frequency of chromosome mis-segregation in CIN often generates micronuclei and can cause aneuploidy – an abnormal ratio of chromosomes. CIN-induced genetic heterogeneity can serve as a tumor promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sheltzer et al., 2017</xref>) and allow some tumor subpopulations to favor aggression, metastatic potential, immune evasion, and resistance to therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-David and Amon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chunduri and Storchová, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vasudevan et al., 2021</xref>). However, early-stage CIN also induces anti-cancer vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen-Sharir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vasudevan et al., 2020</xref>), such as proliferation deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Early-stage CIN-afflicted cells have yet to adapt and achieve aneuploidies that favor growth and immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tripathi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vasudevan et al., 2021</xref>). CIN in diploid cells that is caused by spindle assembly checkpoint disruption via MPS1 kinase inhibition (MPS1i) further induces a senescence-associated secretory pathway phenotype and upregulation of NF-κB and interferon-mediated pathways, among others, that drive immune clearance of chromosomally aberrant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Santaguida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). CIN and ploidy changes also inhibit tumor growth in immunocompetent mice while having little effect in immunocompromised mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Senovilla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boilève et al., 2013</xref>), which suggests CIN somehow increases immunogenicity.</p><p>Recent analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that highly aneuploid tumors include macrophages that are polarized toward a pro-cancer, M2-like phenotype, among other pro-cancer immune changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>). MPS1i-treated cancer cells have also been reported to escape immune-mediated clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), with another study reporting that cancer cells respond to CIN with IL6-STAT3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hong et al., 2022</xref>) that protects from CIN-induced cell death, allows cells to adapt to CIN- and aneuploidy-induced stresses, and minimizes interferon-related anti-cancer responses. Pro-survival signaling amidst CIN also increases factors (such as IL6) that can induce a pro-cancer, M2-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernando et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, ploidy changes tend to increase factors that can promote macrophage-mediated phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krysko et al., 2018</xref>), which led us to hypothesize that macrophages can be manipulated to more productively counter CIN- and aneuploidy-afflicted tumors.</p><p>Phagocytosis of ‘self’ cells including cancer cells is generally inhibited by the macrophage checkpoint interaction between SIRPα on the macrophage and ubiquitously expressed CD47 on any target cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oldenborg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsai and Discher, 2008</xref>). While tumor cell engulfment can be driven to some extent via IgG opsonization by using anti-tumor monoclonal antibodies that bind Fc receptors on macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suter et al., 2021</xref>), this is generally insufficient to eliminate cancers, especially solid tumors. Maximal macrophage-mediated phagocytosis is achieved when CD47-SIRPα signaling is simultaneously disrupted. However, achieving tumor rejection is still a major challenge for macrophage-oriented therapies in clinically relevant immunocompetent mice with syngeneic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ingram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sockolosky et al., 2016</xref>). In patients, multiple clinical trials of antibody blockade of CD47 have been stopped due to safety concerns and little to no efficacy - which motivates more fundamental studies as well as safer approaches. Additionally, macrophages often polarize toward tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotypes that tend to correlate with poor clinical prognoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerezo-Wallis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noy and Pollard, 2014</xref>), have poor phagocytic function, and can promote tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Georgouli et al., 2019</xref>). The cited TCGA analyses that indicated pro-cancer macrophages predominate in highly aneuploid tumors almost certainly reflects selection for cancer growth but might not reflect high levels of ongoing CIN.</p><p>We hypothesized that early-stage CIN in cancer cells can stimulate anti-cancer activity of macrophages sufficient to dominate proliferation of high CIN tumors, but probably only when maximizing pro-phagocytic conditions, such as with blockade of SIRPα (rather than ubiquitous CD47). Our results provide initial in vitro and in vivo evidence that CIN indeed favors anti-cancer macrophage activity and consistently increases durable cures in mice under conditions of maximal phagocytosis. Elimination of these CIN-afflicted solid tumors further drives development of both anti-cancer opsonizing IgGs and enhanced cell-mediated immunity, both of which can help suppress growth against aggressive chromosomally stable tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CIN-afflicted tumors skew macrophages toward an anti-cancer phenotype</title><p>To investigate the possible effects that cancer cell CIN may have in mediating macrophage immune response, we focused on the poorly immunogenic B16F10 mouse melanoma model.

MPS1i increased the frequency of micronuclei visible in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as micronuclei are often used as a surrogate for CIN and genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen-Sharir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crasta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mackenzie et al., 2017</xref>). Regardless of the MPS1i concentration, we saw &gt;10-fold increases of micronuclei over the cell line’s low basal level (~1% of cells), and two other MPS1i inhibitors AZ3146 and BAY12-17389 confirm such effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Micronuclei-positive cells can persist up to 12 days after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), while control cells maintain the low basal levels.

We proceeded to establish tumors in mice with either MPS1i-treated or DMSO-treated B16F10 (following the same schema outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We isolated tumors from mice at two timepoints, 5 and 10 days after initial challenge, and then we processed whole tumors for bulk RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Comparison of tumors comprised of MPS1i-treated and DMSO-treated cells by differential gene expression showed distinct downregulated transcripts for numerous genes encoding M2-like (pro-cancer) macrophage polarization markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). At day 5 post-challenge, classical M2 markers <italic>Arg1</italic>, <italic>Marco</italic>, and <italic>Cd274</italic> are downregulated, and although several M2 markers are upregulated (<italic>Mrc1</italic>, <italic>Cd163</italic>, and C1q complement genes), by day 10, these, <italic>Marco</italic>, and <italic>Cd27</italic> are all downregulated.

Two clusters (0 and 2) consisted of ~75% of macrophages treated with MPS1i-treated B16F10 secretome, and two clusters (1 and 3) consisted of ~75% of macrophages treated with DMSO-treated B16F10 secretome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The latter showed increased expression of M2-like pro-cancer and anti-inflammatory markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).

We used CD47 knockout (KO) B16F10 cells, which removes the inhibitory effect of CD47 on phagocytosis, noting that KO does not perturb surface levels of Tyrp1, which is targetable for opsonization with anti-Tyrp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). BMDMs were added to pre-assembled tumoroids at a 3:1 ratio, and we first assessed surface protein expression of macrophage polarization markers. Consistent with our whole-tumor bulk RNA-sequencing and also single-cell RNA-sequencing of BMDM monocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, I, and J</xref>), BMDMs from immunotumoroids of MPS1i-treated B16F10 showed increased surface expression of M1-like markers MHCII and CD86 while showing decreased expression of M2-like markers CD163 and CD206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Although these macrophages seemed poised for anticancer activity, the cancer cells showed decreased binding of anti-Tyrp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and ~20% larger size in flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The latter likely reflects cytokinesis defects and poly-ploidy as acute effects of CIN induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chunduri and Storchová, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mallin et al., 2023</xref>). Such cancer cell changes might explain why standard 2D phagocytosis assays show BMDMs attached to rigid plastic engulf relatively few anti-Tyrp1 opsonized cancer cells pre-treated with MPS1i versus DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In such cultures, BMDMs use their cytoskeleton to attach and spread, competing with engulfment of large and poorly opsonized targets. Noting that tumors in vivo are not as rigid as plastic, our 3D immunotumoroids eliminate attachment to plastic, and large numbers of macrophages can cluster and cooperate in engulfing cancer cells in a cohesive mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>). We indeed find CIN-afflicted tumoroids are eliminated by BMDMs regardless of anti-Tyrp1 opsonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>), whereas anti-Tyrp1 is required for clearance of DMSO control tumoroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Imaging also suggests that cancer CIN stimulates macrophages to cluster (compare day 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which favors cooperative phagocytosis of tumoroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>), and occurs despite the lack of cancer cell opsonization and their larger cell size. The 3D immunotumoroid results with induced CIN are thus consistent with a more pro-phagocytic M1-type polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B, C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Chromosomally unstable tumoroids and tumors in early stages show increased anti-cancer macrophage polarization and activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic for ‘immuno-tumoroids’.

Mice with CIN-afflicted B16F10 sgCtrl tumors ultimately showed exponential growth and no survivors as well, but they did show increased median survival. Furthermore, median survival increased even further when mice were treated with anti-Tyrp1, such that all mice were considered partial responders (survival of 20+ days, 1 week longer than median survival of tumors comprised of DMSO-treated B16F10 sgCtrl without anti-Tyrp1 treatment). All tumors comprised of DMSO-treated B16F10 CD47 KO showed exponential growth and no survivors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), regardless of anti-Tyrp1 treatment or not. However, CIN-afflicted B16F10 CD47 KO tumors showed more positive outcomes. Even without anti-Tyrp1, all challenged mice with CIN-afflicted CD47 KO tumors were either cured completely (28%) or considered partial responders. When paired with anti-Tyrp1 treatment, 97% of mice challenged with CIN-afflicted CD47 KO tumors survive.</p><p>Long-term survival results show that challenging mice with both MPS1i-treated and DMSO-treated B16F10 sgCtrl failed to yield any survivors, regardless of anti-Tyrp1 opsonization or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D – i</xref>). Similarly, we also failed to generate any survivors among mice challenged with DMSO-treated B16F10 CD47 KO cells, regardless of anti-Tyrp1 opsonization or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D – ii and iii</xref>). This again highlights a challenge in optimizing macrophage-mediated therapies: achieving consistency in long-term therapeutic outcomes. Mice challenged with MPS1i-treated B16F10 CD47 KO cells, however, were able to survive, both without anti-Tyrp1 (28% survival) and with anti-Tyrp1 (97% survival) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D – ii</xref>). To determine if the degree of CIN affected survival, we also challenged mice with B16F10 CD47 KO cells treated with varying concentrations of reversine. Even at the lowest concentration that causes just 10% of cells to have micronuclei for days or less, &gt;80% of mice survive when also treated with anti-Tyrp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results show that, in physiologically relevant microenvironments, early-stage CIN can favor survival when paired with IgG opsonization and CD47 disruption. This further suggests that macrophages are key effector cells in achieving survival against CIN-afflicted tumors, since 97% survival was achieved under conditions of maximal phagocytosis.</p><p>Although no mice challenged with CIN-afflicted B16F10 sgCtrl survived, MPS1i increase median survival significantly when paired with anti-Tyrp1 opsonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D – i</xref>). This suggests that macrophages still display some anti-cancer activity, despite the inhibitory effects of CD47, and are important effector cells in final therapeutic outcome. To better support the hypothesis that macrophages are indeed key effector cells in rejecting CIN-afflicted tumors, we established tumors comprised of WT B16F10 in mice. Although WT tumors are generally unaffected by anti-CD47 and anti-Tyrp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayes et al., 2023</xref>), we hypothesized that we could eliminate CIN-afflicted WT B16F10 tumors by providing adoptive transfer of marrow to increase macrophage numbers to compensate for the CD47-mediated inhibition of endogenous macrophages. Furthermore, we engineered marrow by priming Fcγ receptors with anti-Tyrp1, initially inhibiting CD47-SIRPα interaction via anti-SIRPα antibody blockade or combining both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E – i</xref>). Mice challenged with CIN-afflicted WT tumors and treated with unprimed marrow all succumbed, surviving longer than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E – ii and iii</xref>) and similar to mice that did not receive marrow (blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D – i</xref>). Chromosomally stable (DMSO) WT tumors treated with marrow primed with both anti-SIRPα and anti-Tyrp1 were statistically the same, despite one survivor (17%). Increased macrophage numbers thus provide little to no benefit on their own. However, 37% of mice challenged with CIN-afflicted WT tumors survived when treated with marrow that was initially engineered with anti-SIRPα, and 50% survived with marrow primed with anti-Tyrp1. Anti-Tyrp1 without adoptive transfer of marrow gave no long-term survivors (red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D – i</xref>), which highlights a key role for infusions of marrow myeloid cells. Intriguingly, 80% of mice survived with anti-SIRPα-blocked marrow myeloid cells primed with anti-Tyrp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E – ii and iii</xref>). These results together support three conclusions for CIN-driven tumors: (1) increased survival attributed to anti-SIRPα supports the idea that CD47 modulates therapeutic outcome even during CIN; (2) increased survival attributed to anti-Tyrp1 highlights the importance of IgG opsonization; (3) maximal survival with the combination emphasizes that macrophages – which are skewed by CIN – play a key role in achieving near-complete rejection of tumor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Clearance of CIN-afflicted tumors promotes de novo pro-phagocytic and anti-cancer IgG</title><p>Macrophages and related phagocytic myeloid cells constitute a first line of innate immune defense against pathogens and disease, but some can also initiate acquired immunity. Two key branches of such immunity are humoral immunity mediated by macromolecules such as antibodies and cell-mediated immunity involving T cells, for example. We hypothesized that mice that survived challenges with CIN-afflicted tumors would show signs of acquired immunity due to their high survival rate, and we focused on IgG because of our many functional assays.</p><p>We collected convalescent serum from survivors to quantify de novo anti-cancer IgG antibodies that possibly resulted from successful rejection and clearance of CIN-afflicted tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Sera were collected and then subsequently used in antibody binding testing and western blotting to assess emergence of anti-B16F10 antibodies. We first quantified IgG2a and IgG2b titers in convalescent sera, both of which have been previously found to engage mouse macrophage Fcγ receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruhns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nimmerjahn et al., 2010</xref>) that are typically required for macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. B16F10 cells, either Tyrp1-expresing or Tyrp1 KO, were incubated with sera (convalescent from survivors or naïve from unchallenged mice) and then counterstained with conjugated antibodies against IgG2a/c and IgG2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B – i and ii</xref>). All mice that survived challenges from CIN-afflicted tumors yielded sera that showed significantly large increases in IgG2a/c binding against both Tyrp1-positive and Tyrp1 KO B16F10 cells. We similarly saw a statistically significant increases in IgG2b binding against both Tyrp1-positive and Tyrp1 KO B16F10 cells using the same sera, although the increases in binding were more variable. The increases in binding observed against Tyrp1 KO cells also suggest that IgG antibodies target a repertoire of antigens beyond Tyrp1, which we further qualitatively confirmed via western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B – iii</xref>). Convalescent sera were used to immunoblot against B16F10 lysates, revealing many bands at multiple molecular weights and more bands than when immunoblotting with naïve sera, supporting our hypothesis of antigen broadening beyond Tyrp1. Lastly, we also tested IgG2a/c and IgG2b titers from additional in vivo experiments: survivors from both titrated CIN-afflicted tumors from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and adoptive marrow transfers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>.

Under conditions of CD47 KO, we see that nearly all unpurified convalescent sera increased phagocytosis relative to naïve serum and mIgG2a isotype control. Furthermore, this increase in phagocytosis is identical to that provided by anti-Tyrp1 (both ~5-fold higher than baseline). We also find that sera continue to promote phagocytosis even in B16F10 CD47/Tyrp1 double KO cells (~3-fold higher than baseline). Convalescent sera are still able to increase phagocytosis against double KO cells, whereas anti-Tyrp1 expectedly does not drive phagocytosis due to lack of antigen. This again supports the hypothesis of acquired immunity with de novo IgG antibodies that target B16F10 antigens beyond Tyrp1.</p><p>Upon confirming the functional effect of de novo IgG in the convalescent sera, we then wondered if convalescent serum IgG would be able to suppress tumoroid growth, given that this model better captures both the biophysical microenvironment and proliferative capacity of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, we found that convalescent serum IgG added simultaneously with macrophages to B16F10 CD47 KO tumoroids led to either tumoroid elimination or significantly suppressed growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C – ii</xref>), although the efficacy was less potent than anti-Tyrp1. This suggests that perhaps the polyclonal de novo IgGs here still lack the specificity benefits that accompany a monoclonal antibody such as anti-Tyrp1. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate induction of a generally potent anti-cancer antibody response to CIN-afflicted B16F10 in a CD47 KO context. Importantly, comparing these sera results for CIN-afflicted tumors to our recent studies of the same tumor model without CIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayes et al., 2023</xref>), we find similar levels of IgG induction (e.g. ~100-fold above naive on average for IgG2a/c), similar increases in phagocytosis by sera opsonization (e.g. equivalent to anti-Tyrp1), and similar levels of suppressed tumoroid growth – including the variability.</p><p>We then proceeded to test the function of convalescent serum in vivo by opsonizing B16F10 CD47 KO cells just prior to subcutaneous implantation in naïve mice. For comparison, we also opsonized B16F10 CD47 KO cells with either anti-Tyrp1 (positive control) or mIgG2a control (negative control). We found that both convalescent sera and anti-Tyrp1 suppressed tumor growth by days 11 and 13 relative to mIgG2a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D – i</xref>). Interestingly, we found that convalescent sera showed a trend of suppressing growth more than anti-Tyrp1, although this was not statistically significant. We continued to monitor all mice for long-term survival, and we found that this pre-opsonization with both convalescent sera and anti-Tyrp1 eliminated tumors in challenged mice with near identical cure rates (25% and 22%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D – ii</xref>). Altogether, we found that the convalescent sera from mice originally challenged with chromosomally unstable tumors has potent anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Acquired immunity suppresses growth of chromosomally stable tumors and becomes more effective with ongoing challenges of CIN-afflicted tumors</title><p>The anti-cancer IgG antibody development in survivors led us to further hypothesize that we should see improved median survival and/or survival rate if surviving mice were re-challenged. We therefore challenged surviving mice with a second injection of either DMSO-treated or MPSi-treated B16F10 CD47 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). If additional survivors resulted from this experiment, we also intended to undertake a third challenge, akin to a prime-and-boost strategy for anti-cancer vaccination. It should be highlighted that starting from this second challenge, no mice received anti-Tyrp1. This was done to maximally challenge acquired immunity and to better simulate the possibility of recurrence post-therapy. Age-matched naïve mice receiving their first challenge responded similarly to the younger cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Of the previously cured mice, only a single mouse (of 11 total) survived a challenge with DMSO-treated B16F10 CD47 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, median survival increased (21 days) compared to their naïve counterparts (14 days), supporting the initial hypothesis of prolonged survival and consistent not only with past results indicating major benefits of a prime-and-boost approach with anti-Tyrp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>) but also with the noted similarities in induced IgG levels. Survivors that were re-challenged again with MPS1i-treated cells, however, showed 100% survival, even in the absence of anti-Tyrp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Age-matched naïve mice receiving their first challenge of MPS1i-treated cells responded relatively similarly (a single survivor out of 6 total, 17% survival) to the younger cohort (28% survival). This complete success rate against a second challenge of CIN-afflicted B16F10 CD47 KO further supports an acquired immune response, at least against ongoing chromosomally unstable cells.</p><p>Mice that failed to reject re-challenge tumors comprised of DMSO-treated B16F10 CD47 KO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> were euthanized and had their tumors harvested to measure their immune cell infiltrate by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although these mice did not survive, we found that these previous survivors showed roughly a 2-fold increase in the number of immune cells in their tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G – i</xref>), a 2-fold increase in the number of CD3+ CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G – ii</xref>), and a near 3-fold increase in the number of F4/80+ macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G – iii</xref>) compared to their naïve counterparts. We further found that of the F4/80+ macrophage infiltrate, previous survivors had roughly four times as many MHCII-high macrophages (M1-like, anti-cancer). These immune infiltrate analyses suggest that although the acquired immune response in these previous survivors was still not potent enough to clear chromosomally stable and normally proliferating B16F10 CD47 KO tumors, it did enhance cell-mediated immunity.</p><p>Lastly, we performed a third tumor challenge on second challenge survivors with untreated B16F10 CD47 KO cells (chromosomally stable and regular proliferating). Mice were left untreated post-challenge (no anti-Tyrp1). ~56% of these mice completely resisted tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H – i</xref>). Of the four mice that developed tumors, two had to be euthanized prematurely due to tumor rupture but were indeed showing signs of growth suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H – ii</xref>). The last two mice consisted of two long-term partial responders: one whose tumor did not reach terminal burden until 82 days post-challenge and another who experienced stable tumor regression with almost no regrowth. Overall, the 56% survival rate in the third challenge, in the absence of anti-Tyrp1, and the partial responses observed in mice that grew tumors suggest a durable immunological response that results from encountering and clearing CIN tumors, at least in the context of CD47 disruption.</p><p>Macrophages seem to be the key <italic><underline>initiating</underline>-</italic>effector cells, based in part on the following findings. First, macrophages and related myeloid cells with both SIRPα blockade and FcR-engaging, tumor-targeting IgG maximize survival of mice with WT B16+Rev tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) – noting that macrophages express SIRPα and FcRs, but most or all T cells do not. Despite the clear benefits of adding macrophages, to further assess whether T and B cells are key <underline>initiating</underline>-effector cells, new experiments were done with mice lacking T and B cells. We compared the growth delay of MPS1i versus DMSO treatments in these mice to the delay in fully immunocompetent mice with T and B cells – with all studies done at the same time. We found that slower growth with Rev relative to DMSO was similar in mice without T and B cells when compared to immunocompetent C57 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We conclude therefore that T and B cells are not key <underline>initiating</underline>-effector cells. At later times, B cells are likely effector cells at least in terms of making anti-tumor IgG, and T cells in tumor re-challenges are also increased in number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G – ii</xref>). We further note that in our earlier collaborative study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harding et al., 2017</xref>) WT B16 cells were pre-treated by genome-damaging irradiation before engraftment in C57 mice, and these cells grew minimally – similar to MPS1i treatment – while untreated WT B16 cells grew normally at a contralateral site in the same mouse. Such results indicate that T and B cells in C57BL/6 mice are not sufficiently stimulated by genome-damaged B16 cells to generically impact the growth of undamaged B16 cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Macrophage-directed immunotherapies against solid tumors have the potential for maximal efficacy when at least three elements are combined: large numbers of macrophages for cooperativity (in clusters), IgG opsonization that activates Fc receptors and stimulates macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, and disruption of the CD47 macrophage immune checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>). Screens might add to this as might discoveries in aneuploidy, but even for well-established factors properly applied, complete tumor rejection and clearance is not guaranteed and varies greatly across in vivo mouse studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrechak et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayes et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen-Sharir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamber et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show a 97% survival rate of immunocompetent mice challenged with CIN-afflicted, syngeneic B16F10 tumors when maximizing macrophage-mediated activity. The result is notable given that B16F10 tumors are poorly immunogenic, do not respond to either anti-CD47 or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapies, and show modest and variable cure rates (~20–40%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayes et al., 2023</xref>) even when macrophages have been made maximally phagocytic according to notions above. We should note here that our whole-tumor RNA-sequencing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) shows that expression of PD-1 (<italic>Pdcd1</italic>) follows no consistent trend upon MPS1i treatment, and that <italic>Pdcd1</italic> was not detected in our single-cell RNA-sequencing data for macrophage cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) – motivating further study.</p><p>These results suggest that CIN in early stages generates anti-cancer vulnerabilities that favor macrophage-mediated immune response, contingent on conditions for maximal phagocytosis. Immunocompetent mice consistently survive these challenges at high survival rates. These survivors also develop de novo anti-cancer IgG, similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayes et al., 2023</xref>), that are pro-phagocytic, multi-epitope, and efficacious in vivo. The emergence of these IgGs could be synergistic with clinically relevant CD47 blockade treatments for solid tumors and help address concerns regarding resistance due to antigen loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jalil et al., 2020</xref>). Mice that are re-challenged with chromosomally stable CD47 KO tumors (and without exogenous anti-Tyrp1 opsonization) show increased median survival and increased immune infiltrate, further supporting the hypothesis of newly generated anti-cancer acquired immunity. More interestingly, though, we see that all mice re-challenged with CIN-afflicted CD47 KO tumors survive, even in the absence of anti-Tyrp1 opsonization. A third challenge of these two-time survivors with chromosomally stable CD47 KO tumors shows &gt;50% mice survive and improved median survival for non-survivors. These results elucidate at least two advantages that CIN can provide to better therapeutic outcomes. First, early-stage CIN facilitates survival while generating potent de novo IgGs that can drive positive phagocytic feedback to minimize recurrence. Second, ongoing vulnerability-inducing CIN in tumor cells can both strengthen cell-mediated acquired immunity and create an antigen reservoir for the maintenance of long-term humoral immunity.</p><p>The effects of CIN and aneuploidy in macrophages certainly require further investigation. We did publish initial results showing M1-like polarization of BMDMs with IFNγ priming is sufficient to suppress growth of B16 tumoroids with anti-Tyrp1 opsonization more rapidly than unpolarized/unprimed macrophages and much more rapidly than M2-like polarization of BMDMs with IL4 (Extended Data Fig.5a in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>); hence, anti-cancer polarization contributes in this assay. While the secretome from MPS1i-treated cancer cells has been found to trigger expression of <italic>Arg1</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xian et al., 2021</xref>), both of which are pro-cancer M2-like macrophage markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernando et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mujal et al., 2022</xref>), our findings suggest that polarization is much more complex. Here, whole-tumor bulk RNA-sequencing hints at CIN-afflicted tumors having a macrophage population that is both less anti-inflammatory and M2-like. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of BMDMs treated with secretome from CIN-afflicted cells further suggests that CIN induces a microenvironment that can push macrophages to a pro-inflammatory, anti-cancer phenotype while minimizing polarization to a pro-cancer phenotype. Our transcriptomics analyses also align more with deeper investigation that suggest additional markers are required for macrophage polarization distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jablonski et al., 2015</xref>). We further confirm these findings by observing increased surface protein expression of anti-cancer M1-like macrophages in in vitro 3D tumoroid co-cultures with CIN-afflicted cells and in vivo immune infiltrate experiments. Functional tests are also crucial: BMDMs show enhanced clearance of CIN-afflicted cells in 3D tumoroid phagocytosis assays. Additionally, the aforementioned study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xian et al., 2021</xref>) only found this trend in SKOV3 cells, whereas their aneuploid fused B16 cells show decreased <italic>Arg1</italic> expression, suggesting possible cell-intrinsic complications. Marker-based meta-analyses of aneuploid tumor data from TCGA also suggested reduced anti-cancer macrophage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xian et al., 2021</xref>), but TCGA studies are likely limited to late timepoints when cancer cells have overcome CIN- and aneuploidy-associated stresses and selected for those aneuploidies that drive tumor progression in the diagnosed patients. More recently, for some solid tumors, aneuploidy with high mutational burdens reportedly shows increased survival in immunotherapy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spurr et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spurr et al., 2022b</xref>). Assuming that progress can be made on clinically safe targeting of the macrophage checkpoint, to overcome some current issues, the results here also suggest interesting effects and possible benefits when combining cancer CIN with sufficient myeloid cells, disruption of CD47-SIRPα, and tumor opsonization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>B16F10 cells (CRL-6475) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

For assessing immune infiltrates in early stages of tumor engraftment, when tumors are still small, we used a relatively high number of tumor cells (500,000 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>) to achieve sufficient cell numbers after dissociating the tumors, particularly for the slow-growing MPS1i-treated tumors. More specifically, with dissection, collagenase treatment, passage through a filter to remove clumps, we would lose many cells, and yet needed 100,000 viable cells or more for bulk RNA-sequencing suspensions and for flow cytometry measurements. For all other studies, 200,000 cancer cells were injected, and for subsequent treatments, mice received either intravenous or intraperitoneal injections of anti-Tyrp1 clone TA99 or mouse IgG2a isotype control clone C1.18.4 (250 μg antibody in 100 μL PBS) on days 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 post-tumor challenge. Intravenous injections were done via the lateral tail vein. Tumors were monitored by palpation and measured with digital calipers. The projected area was roughly elliptical and was calculated as A = π/4 × L × W, where L is the length along the longest axis and W is the width measured along the perpendicular axis. For our studies, a projected area of 125 mm<sup>2</sup> was considered terminal burden for survival analyses. Mice were humanely euthanized following IACUC protocols if tumor size reached 2.0 cm on either axis, if tumor reached a projected area greater than 200 mm<sup>2</sup> or if a tumor was ulcerated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Adoptive cell transfers</title><p>Fresh bone marrow was harvested as described in the Bone marrow-derived macrophages section of Materials and methods. Marrow cells were counted on a hemocytometer and resuspended to a concentration of 8×10<sup>7</sup> cells per mL in 5% (vol/vol) FBS/PBS. To block SIRPα, cells were then incubated with anti-SIRPα clone P84 (18 μg/mL) for 1 hr at room temperature on a rotator. After the incubation period elapsed, cells were centrifuged at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, washed with PBS, and then centrifuged once more at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min to remove any unbound anti-SIRPα. Cells were again resuspended to a concentration of 8×10<sup>7</sup> cells per mL in 2% (vol/vol) FBS/PBS, with or without anti-Tyrp1 clone TA99 (1 mg/mL). Marrow cells were then injected intravenously (2×10<sup>7</sup> cells in 250 μL per mouse) into tumor-bearing mice. All adoptive transfers were done 4 days post-challenge. Control data were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dooling et al., 2023</xref>, to minimize mice for experiments, since the cited study establishes proper benchmarks for comparison and also finds that these control conditions minimally (if at all) improve survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Serum collection and IgG titer quantification</title><p>Blood was drawn retro-orbitally from mice anesthetized under isoflurane, using heparin- or EDTA-coated microcapillary tubes.

The serum was separated from the clot by centrifugation at 1500 × <italic>g</italic> and stored at –20°C for use in flow cytometry and phagocytosis assays.</p><p>For IgG titer quantification, B16F10 cells were detached by trypsinization and incubated with 5% (vol/vol) mouse serum in 1% BSA. Opsonization was allowed for 30–45 min on ice. After the incubation period elapsed, cells were centrifuged at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, washed once with PBS, centrifuged again at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and then resuspended in 0.1% (wt/vol) BSA with both PE anti-mouse IgG2a/c clone RMG2a-62 and APC anti-mouse IgG2b clone RMG2b-1 (see Antibodies section for more information). Anti-IgG-conjugated antibody incubation occurred for 30–45 min, after which cells were centrifuged at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, washed once with PBS, centrifuged again at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and then resuspended in 5% (vol/vol) FBS/PBS.

Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in NuPage 4–12% Bis-Tris gels run with 1× MOPS buffer (Invitrogen NP0323) and transferred to an iBlot nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen IB301002). The membranes were blocked with 5% (wt/vol) non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) plus Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hr and stained with 5% (vol/vol) mouse serum overnight at 4°C with agitation. The membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with 1:500 secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in 5% (wt/vol) milk in TBST for 1 hr at room temperature with agitation. The membranes were then washed again three times with TBST. Membranes probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody were developed a 3,3’,5,5’-teramethylbenzidine substrate (Millipore Sigma T0565). Developed membranes were scanned and then processed with ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immune infiltrate analysis of tumors</title><p>For day 5 post-challenge measurements: If mice required anti-Tyrp1 treatment, mice received a single dose of intravenously delivered anti-Tyrp1 or mouse IgG2a isotype control 4 days (96 hr) post-tumor challenge. 24 hr later, mice were humanely sacrificed. Otherwise, mice were sacrificed 5 days post-tumor challenge.

Tumors were then disaggregated using Dispase (Corning 354235) supplemented with 4 mg/mL of collagenase type IV (Gibco 17104-019) and DNAse I (Millipore Sigma, 101041159001) for 30–45 min (until noticeable disaggregation) at 37°C, centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × <italic>g</italic>, and resuspended in 1 mL of ACK lysis buffer for 12 min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × <italic>g</italic>, washed once with PBS, and then resuspended in 5% (wt/vol) BSA/PBS for 20 min. After 20 min elapsed, fluorophore-conjugated antibodies to immune markers were added to each cell suspension. The following markers were used for analysis: for macrophages, CD45, CD11b, F4/80, Ly-6C, Ly-6G, CD86, CD206, MHCII; for T cells, CD45, CD3e, CD8a. Antibody binding occurred for 30 min while samples were kept on ice and covered from light. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × <italic>g</italic>, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in FluoroFix Buffer (BioLegend, 422101) for 1 hr at room temperature prior to analysis on a BD LSRII (Benton Dickinson) flow cytometer. For day 5 post-challenge measurements, 100,000–200,000 live cells were collected. For in vivo tumor infiltrate studies in re-challenged mice, 10 million live cells were collected.

The library prepared was processed at the Next Generation Sequencing Core at the University of Pennsylvania (12-160, Translational Research Center) using NovaSeq 6000, 100 cycles (Illumina). The reads were aligned to mouse reference, mm10 (GENCODE vM23/Ensembl 98) using star alignment. Cell count matrix was generated and imported to RStudio for downstream analysis. Package ‘DESeq2’ (v1.32.0) was used for normalization and differential expression analysis. Package ‘fgsea’ (v1.18.0) was used for GSEA. Additional exploratory data analysis was then done using either RStudio or Python 3.8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Single-cell RNA-sequencing</title><p>RNA libraries were prepared using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression kit (v3.1, single index, PN-1000128; PN-1000127; PN-1000213) per the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced at the Next Generation Sequencing Core using NovaSeq 6000, 100 cycles (Illumina). Raw base call (BCL) files were analyzed using CellRanger (version 5.0.1) to generate FASTQ files, and the ‘count’ command was used to generate raw count matrices aligned to mm10 (GENCODE vM23/Ensembl 98). Cells were filtered to make sure that they expressed a minimum of 1400 genes with less than 15% mitochondrial content. Data was normalized using the ‘LogNormalize’' method from the Seurat package.

Gene position files were created for GRCm38. Single-cell RNA-sequencing data of DMSO-treated B16F10 were used as reference for copy number profile construction. Cell types were annotated either manually or using the package ‘SingleR’ (v1.6.1). For manual annotation, cells were clustered and assigned cell types based on the expression of cell type-specific signature genes (SI.5a). Denoised results from InferCNV were used as the input (‘infercnv.observations.txt’). The averaged copy number of each chromosome segment was calculated, and the difference between each cell’s copy number and the overall mean at each segment was calculated. The deviation was summed across the entire chromosome to obtain the distribution of the deviation. Cells sharing an absolute deviation that is more than 2.5 times standard deviation away from the distribution peak were marked as outliers for a certain chromosome in question.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Transcriptomic gene sets</title><p>For analyzing both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, either hallmark gene sets (from the Human Molecular Signatures Database) or customized gene sets were used.

Whether macrophages alone can be powerful enough to permanently eliminate a tumor is a high-priority question. In addition, the factors making different tumors more vulnerable to macrophage attack have not been completely defined. In this paper, the authors find that MSP1 inhibition, most notable for causing chromosomal instability (CIN), in cancer cells improves the effect of macrophage targeted immunotherapies. They demonstrate that MSP1 inhibited tumors secrete factors that polarize macrophages to a more tumoricidal fate through several methods. The most compelling experiment is transferring conditioned media from MSP1 inhibited and control cancer cells, then using RNAseq to demonstrate that the MSP1-inhibited conditioned media causes a shift towards a more tumoricidal macrophage phenotype. In mice with MSP1 inhibited (CIN) B16 melanoma tumors, a combination of CD47 knockdown and anti-Tyrp1 IgG is sufficient for long term survival in nearly all mice. This combination is a striking improvement from conditions without CIN.</p><p>Like any interesting paper, this study leaves several unanswered questions. First, how do CIN tumors repolarize macrophages? The authors demonstrate that conditioned media is sufficient for this repolarization, implicating secreted factors, but the specific mechanism is unclear. The main caveat of the study is that chromosomal instability is driven by MSP1 inhibition in all the experiments, leaving open the possibility that some effects are due to MSP1 inhibition specifically rather than CIN more generally. To specifically connect CIN and macrophage repolarization, future studies will need to examine tumors with CIN unrelated to MSP1 inhibition to determine if these are also able to repolarize macrophages.</p><p>Overall, this is a thought-provoking study that will be of broad interest to many different fields including cancer biology, immunology and cell biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88054.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hayes</surname><given-names>Brandon H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Mai</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Phan</surname><given-names>Steven H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dooling</surname><given-names>Lawrence J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Andrechak</surname><given-names>Jason C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Alexander H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tobin</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ontko</surname><given-names>Nicholas M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marchena</surname><given-names>Tristan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Discher</surname><given-names>Dennis E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>[The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the time and efforts of the Reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In light of your data showing that the IgG response is similar with and without CIN, it would be good to drop &quot;and induce abroad, vaccination-like anti-tumor IgG response&quot;.

In all cases, the tumor cells were pre-treated with MPS1i or had a genetic knockout of CD47. This makes it difficult to see how this would translate clinically.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the Reviewer’s interest in the topic and its potential, but our manuscript makes no claims of immediate clinical translation. Chromosomal instability (CIN) studies have to date not yet discovered or described whether and how CIN can affect macrophage function. To our knowledge, this is the first study to begin such characterizations with various MPS1i drugs to induce CIN. Many variations of the approach can be envisioned for future studies.</p><p>Our Results include some key studies of cancer cells with wildtype levels of CD47- including in vivo tumor elimination (Fig.3E). Nonetheless, we do conduct some of our studies in a CD47 knockout context to remove this “brake” that generally impedes phagocytosis, with our goal being to better understand how CIN affects phagocytosis. As cited to some extent in our Introduction, there are many efforts in clinical trials to disrupt this macrophage checkpoint and others focused on macrophage immunotherapy. Whether CIN can be induced by clinically translatable drugs and specifically in cancer cells is beyond the scope of our studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would like to see the amount of CIN that occurs in WT B16F10 over the course of tumorigenesis (ie longer than 5 days). This is because I would assume that CIN would eventually occur in the WT B16F10 regardless of whether MPS1i is being given. And if that's the case, then the initiation of CIN at day 10 after implantation (for example) would still be considered &quot;early stage&quot; CIN. If the therapy is then initiated at this point, does the effect remain? Or put differently, how would the authors propose to induce the appropriate level of CIN in an established tumor? Why is pretreatment necessary?</p></disp-quote><p>Untreated B16F10 cells fail to produce micronuclei over 12 days compared to MPS1i treated cells – as shown in a newly added panel in Fig. S1:</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88054-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>This helps support our decision to pre-treat cells with MPS1i to stimulate genomic instability and is described in the first section of Results:</p><p>“…we saw &gt;10-fold increases of micronuclei over the cell line’s low basal level (~1% of cells), and two other MPS1i inhibitors AZ3146 and BAY12-17389 confirm such effects (Fig. S1A). Micronuclei-positive cells can persist up to 12 days after treatment (Fig. S1B), while control cells maintain the low basal levels.

We should note here that our whole-tumor RNA-seq data (Fig.1E) shows expression of PD-1 (gene Pdcd1) follows no consistent trend upon MPS1i treatment, and that Pdcd1 was not detected in our scRNA-seq data for macrophage cultures (Fig.1G) – motivating further study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors must explain how the proposed therapy works since MPS1i increases tumor (cell) size, making it difficult for macrophages to phagocytose the tumor cells. It also reduces or suppresses Tyrp1 expression on the cancer cells, making it harder to opsonize. Since these were two main points for the rationale of this study, the authors need to reconcile them.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and have re-organized this Results section to try to minimize confusion:</p><p>CIN-afflicted, CD47-knockout tumoroids are eliminated by Macrophages</p><p>To assess functional effects of macrophage polarization, we focused on a 3D “immuno-tumoroid” model in which macrophage activity can work (or not) over many days against a solid proliferating mass of cancer cells in non-adherent roundbottom wells (Fig. 2A) (Dooling et al., 2023). We used CD47 knockout (KO) B16F10 cells, which removes the inhibitory effect of CD47 on phagocytosis, noting that KO does not perturb surface levels of Tyrp1, which is targetable for opsonization with anti-Tyrp1 (Fig. S2A). BMDMs were added to pre-assembled tumoroids at a 3:1 ratio, and we first assessed surface protein expression of macrophage polarization markers. Consistent with our whole-tumor bulk RNA-sequencing and also single-cell RNA-sequencing of BMDM monocultures (Fig. 1E, 1I-J), BMDMs from immunotumoroids of MPS1i-treated B16F10 showed increased surface expression of M1-like markers MHCII and CD86 while showing decreased expression of M2-like markers CD163 and CD206 (Fig. 2B-C). Although these macrophages seemed poised for anticancer activity, the cancer cells showed decreased binding of anti-Tyrp1 (Fig. S2B) and ~20% larger size in flow cytometry (Fig. S2C). The latter likely reflects cytokinesis defects and poly-ploidy as acute effects of CIN induction (Chunduri &amp; Storchová, 2019; Mallin et al., 2022). Such cancer cell changes might explain why standard 2D phagocytosis assays show BMDMs attached to rigid plastic engulf relatively few anti-Tyrp1 opsonized cancer cells pretreated with MPS1i versus DMSO (Fig. S2D). In such cultures, BMDMs use their cytoskeleton to attach and spread, competing with engulfment of large and poorly opsonized targets. Noting that tumors in vivo are not as rigid as plastic, our 3D immunotumoroids eliminate attachment to plastic, and large numbers of macrophages can cluster and cooperate in engulfing cancer cells in a cohesive mass (Dooling et al., 2023). We indeed find CIN-afflicted tumoroids are eliminated by BMDMs regardless of anti-Tyrp1 opsonization (Fig. 2D-E), whereas anti-Tyrp1 is required for clearance of DMSO control tumoroids (Fig. 2D, S3B). Imaging also suggests that cancer CIN stimulates macrophages to cluster (compare Day-4 in Fig. 2D), which favors cooperative phagocytosis of tumoroids (Dooling et al., 2023), and occurs despite the lack of cancer cell opsonization and their larger cell size. The 3D immunotumoroid results with induced CIN are thus consistent with a more pro-phagocytic M1-type polarization (Fig.1J and 2B,C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors used varying numbers of tumor cells for the in vivo portions of the study; the first half of the manuscript uses 500,000 cells, while the latter half uses 200,000 cells. Why?</p></disp-quote><p>The reasons for the difference in numbers is now clarified in the Methods:</p><p>For assessing immune infiltrates in early stages of tumor engraftment, when tumors are still small, we used a relatively high number of tumor cells (500,000 cells in Fig. 1D and Fig. 2F-G) to achieve sufficient cell numbers after dissociating the tumors, particularly for the slow-growing MPS1i-treated tumors. More specifically, with dissection, collagenase treatment, passage through a filter to remove clumps, we would lose many cells, and yet needed 100,000 viable cells or more for bulk RNA-seq suspensions and for flow cytometry measurements. For all other studies, 200,000 cancer cells were injected,</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors need to report the tumor volumes and the total number of cells isolated from the day five tumors to avoid grossly inflating the effect (i.e. Fig 2G and 4G).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added relevant numbers in the Methods:</p><p>For day 5 post-challenge measurements, 100,000 to 200,000 live cells were collected.

The text has been edited to indicate 'macrophages are key initiating-effector cells', and some evidence for this is the maximal survival of (WT B16 + Rev tumors) in Fig.3E upon treatment with Marrow Macrophages plus Macrophage-relevant SIRPa blockade and Macrophage-relevant IgG (via FcR).

We compared the growth of MPS1i vs DMSO treatments in these mice to results in mice with T and B cells (which should replicate our previous results in Fig.3D-i). We found that slower growth with Rev relative to DMSO was similar in mice without T and B cells compared to mice with T and B cells. We have added to the text our conclusion that: T and B cells are not key initiating-effector cells. Whereas B cells are effector cells at least in terms of eventually making anti-tumor IgG, our results show that macrophages are key initiating-effector cells because macrophages certainly affect the growth of (WT B16 + Rev tumors) when more are added (Fig.3E).</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Growth of CIN-afflicted wild-type (WT) tumors in T- and B-cell deficient mice and T- and B-cell replete mice.</title><p>Similar growth delays for MPS1i-pretreated B16F10 cells in T- and B-cell deficient NSG mice and immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice.

First, macrophages with both SIRPα blockade and FcR-engaging, tumor-targeting IgG maximize survival of mice with WT B16 + Rev tumors (Fig. 3E) – noting that macrophages but not T cells express SIRPα and FcR’s. Despite the clear benefits of adding macrophages, to further assess whether T and B cells are key initiating-effector cells, new experiments were done with mice depleted of T and B cells. We compared the growth delay of MPS1i versus DMSO treatments in these mice to the delay in fully immunocompetent mice with T and B cells – with all studies done at the same time. We found that slower growth with Rev relative to DMSO was similar in mice without T and B cells when compared to immunocompetent C57 mice (Fig.S9). We conclude therefore that T and B cells are not key initiating-effector cells. At later times, B cells are likely effector cells at least in terms of making anti-tumor IgG, and T cells in tumor re-challenges are also increased in number (Fig. 4G-ii). We further note that in our earlier collaborative study (Harding et al., 2017) WT B16 cells were pre-treated by genome-damaging irradiation before engraftment in C57 mice, and these cells grew minimally – similar to MPS1i treatment – while untreated WT B16 cells grew normally at a contralateral site in the same mouse. Such results indicate that T and B cells in C57BL/6 mice are not sufficiently stimulated by genome-damaged B16 cells to generically impact the growth of undamaged B16 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Harnessing macrophages to attack cancer is an immunotherapy strategy that has been steadily gaining interest. Whether macrophages alone can be powerful enough to permanently eliminate a tumor is a high-priority question. In addition, the factors making different tumors more vulnerable to macrophage attack have not been completely defined. In this paper, the authors find that chromosomal instability (CIN) in cancer cells improves the effect of macrophage targeted immunotherapies. They demonstrate that CIN tumors secrete factors that polarize macrophages to a more tumoricidal fate through several methods. The most compelling experiment is transferring conditioned media from MSP1 inhibited and control cancer cells, then using RNAseq to demonstrate that the MSP1-inhibited conditioned media causes a shift towards a more tumoricidal macrophage phenotype. In mice with MSP1 inhibited (CIN) B16 melanoma tumors, a combination of CD47 knockdown and anti-Tyrp1 IgG is sufficient for long term survival in nearly all mice. This combination is a striking improvement from conditions without CIN.</p><p>Like any interesting paper, this study leaves several unanswered questions. First, how do CIN tumors repolarize macrophages? The authors demonstrate that conditioned media is sufficient for this repolarization, implicating secreted factors, but the specific mechanism is unclear. In addition, the connection between the broad, vaccination-like IgG response and CIN is not completely delineated. The authors demonstrate that mice who successfully clear CIN tumors have a broad anti-tumor IgG response. This broad IgG response has previously been demonstrated for tumors that do not have CIN. It is not clear if CIN specifically enhances the anti-tumor IgG response or if the broad IgG response is similar to other tumors. Finally, CIN is always induced with MSP1 inhibition. To specifically attribute this phenotype to CIN it would be most compelling to demonstrate that tumors with CIN unrelated to MSP1 inhibition are also able to repolarize macrophages.</p><p>Overall, this is a thought-provoking study that will be of broad interest to many different fields including cancer biology, immunology and cell biology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their enthusiastic and positive comments toward the manuscript.</p><p>Our main purpose with this study has been discovery science oriented and mechanistic, with implications for improving macrophage immunotherapies. More experimentation needs to be done to further understand how this positive immune response emerges. However, we could address whether CIN enhances or not the anti-tumor IgG response by quantitative comparisons to our two other recent studies, and we conclude that it does not per new edits in the Abstract and the Results. See attached PPT for full details and comparison.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>“CIN does not greatly affect the level of the induced response but does significantly increase survival.”</p><p>“…these results demonstrate induction of a generally potent anti-cancer antibody response to CIN-afflicted B16F10 in a CD47 KO context. Importantly, comparing these sera results for CINafflicted tumors to our recent studies of the same tumor model without CIN (Dooling et al., 2022; Hayes et al., 2022), we find similar levels of IgG induction (e.g. ~100-fold above naive on average for IgG2a/c), similar increases in phagocytosis by sera opsonization (e.g. equivalent to antiTyrp1), and similar levels of suppressed tumoroid growth – including the variability.</p><p>…</p><p>However, median survival increased (21 days) compared to their naïve counterparts (14 days), supporting the initial hypothesis of prolonged survival and consistent not only with past results indicating major benefits of a prime-&amp;-boost approach with anti-Tyrp1 (Dooling et al., 2022) but also with the noted similarities in induced IgG levels.”</p><p>Future studies could certainly focus on trying to identify what secreted factors might be inducing the M1-like polarization (using ELISA assays for cytokine detection, for example). This could be important because a main finding here is that we achieve nearly a 100% success rate in clearing tumors when we combine CD47 ablation and IgG opsonization with cancer cell CIN. Previous studies were only able to achieve about 40% cures in mice when working with CD47 disription and IgG opsonization alone, suggesting CIN in this experimental context does improve macrophage response.</p><p>Lastly, we agree with the Reviewer that future studies should also address how CIN in general (not MPS1i-induced) affects tumor growth. The final paragraph of our Discussion at least cites support for consistent effects of M1-like polarization:</p><p>“The effects of CIN and aneuploidy in macrophages certainly requires further investigation. We did publish recently that M1-like polarization of BMDMs with IFNg priming is sufficient to suppress growth of B16 tumoroids with anti-Tyrp1 opsonization more rapidly than unpolarized/unprimed macrophages and much more rapidly than M2-like polarization of BMDMs with IL4 (Extended Data Fig.5a in Dooling et al., 2023); hence, anti-cancer polarization contributes in this assay.</p><p>While the secretome from MPS1i-treated cancer cells has been found to trigger…”</p><p>Nonetheless, we can only speculate that there is a threshold of CIN reached by a certain timepoint in tumor engraftment and growth. Natural CIN might not be enough, so we pursued a pharmacological approach consistent with ongoing pre-clinical studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0500">https://doi.org/10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-15-0500</ext-link>). Future studies should consider trying knockdown models to gradually accrue CIN in tumors or using more relevant pharmacological drugs that are known to induce CIN not associated with the spindle. We believe, however, that these are larger questions on their own and are beyond the scope of the foundational discoveries in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>None</p></disp-quote><p>We again thank the Reviewer for their support and enthusiasm for the manuscript.
