Sperm epigenome undergoes age-dependent changes increasing risks of adverse conditions in offspring conceived by fathers of advanced age. The mechanism(s) linking paternal age with epigenetic changes in sperm remain unknown. The sperm epigenome is shaped in a compartment protected by the blood-testes barrier (BTB) known to deteriorate with age. Permeability of the BTB is regulated by the balance of two mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells where mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes the opening of the BTB and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) promotes its integrity. We hypothesized that this balance is also responsible for age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed reproductive outcomes, including sperm DNA methylation in transgenic mice with Sertoli cell-specific suppression of mTORC1 (<italic>Rptor</italic> KO) or mTORC2 (<italic>Rictor</italic> KO). mTORC2 suppression accelerated aging of the sperm DNA methylome and resulted in a reproductive phenotype concordant with older age, including decreased testes weight and sperm counts, and increased percent of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa and mitochondrial DNA copy number. Suppression of mTORC1 resulted in the shift of DNA methylome in sperm opposite to the shift associated with physiological aging – sperm DNA methylome rejuvenation and mild changes in sperm parameters. These results demonstrate for the first time that the balance of mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells regulates the rate of sperm epigenetic aging. Thus, mTOR pathway in Sertoli cells may be used as a novel target of therapeutic interventions to rejuvenate the sperm epigenome in advanced-age fathers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rejuvenation</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>sperm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008975</institution-id><institution>School of Public Health and Health Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dean's Research Enhancement Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suvorov</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>For the first time, a molecular mechanism is identified, for experimental acceleration and deceleration (rejuvenation) of sperm epigenetic aging.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past several decades, a trend toward delayed childbirth has led to increases in parental age at the time of conception. This delayed parenthood is attributed to secular and socioeconomic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Waldenström, 2016</xref>), reproductive technological advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bray et al., 2006</xref>), and higher levels of post-graduate education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mills et al., 2011</xref>). The suppressive role of overpopulation on reproductive behavior was also hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suvorov, 2021</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that higher male age contributes to poor pregnancy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hassan and Killick, 2003</xref>), lower odds of live birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horta et al., 2019</xref>), and adverse health of offspring in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Montgomery et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puleo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saha et al., 2009</xref>), including increased susceptibility to early development of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Contreras et al., 2017</xref>), as well as neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gratten et al., 2016</xref>) and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reichenberg et al., 2006</xref>). In experiments with mice it was demonstrated that higher male age is associated with reduced life span in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). Increasing evidence links advanced paternal age with altered offspring phenotype via age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashapkin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins et al., 2014</xref>). Published data indicate that age is a powerful factor affecting DNA methylation and other epigenetic markers in mammalian sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashapkin et al., 2023</xref>), and age-dependent changes in these epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the regulation of key developmental pathways, including nervous system-related signaling, Wnt, Hippo, mTOR, and Igf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pilsner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suvorov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoshizaki et al., 2021</xref>). Despite this evidence, the mechanistic link between age and epigenetic changes in sperm remains unknown.</p><p>Final DNA methylation profiles of spermatozoa are a result of epigenetic events that occur during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2015b</xref>), including meiotic divisions of spermatogonia and spermatocytes associated with passive loss of methylation and de novo methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oakes et al., 2007</xref>). Global methylation drop of around 12–13% occurs in preleptotene spermatocytes and methylation is gradually reestablished during leptotene-pachytene stages so that the final DNA methylation patterns are obtained by the end of pachytene spermatocyte stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaysinskaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loukinov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oakes et al., 2007</xref>). A recent rat study identified the transition from elongating spermatids to late spermatids as another stage associated with changes in methylation of more than 5000 DNA regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Omri-Charai et al., 2023</xref>). After fertilization, most parental-specific epigenetic marks of gametes undergo reprogramming to establish totipotency in the developing embryo. However, imprinted loci, certain classes of repetitive sequences, and other genomic loci escape this reprogramming event and contribute to a non-Mendelian form of inheritance as demonstrated in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atsem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denomme et al., 2020</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oluwayiose et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xie et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the final sperm epigenome acquired during spermatogenesis is a significant channel for the transfer of inheritable information to the next generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lismer and Kimmins, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Epigenetic events during spermatogenesis occur in the unique biochemical environment of the apical compartment of seminiferous epithelium, protected from body fluids by the blood-testis barrier (BTB) – the tightest blood-tissue barrier composed of coexisting tight junctions, basal ectoplasmic specializations, gap junctions, and desmosomes in Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The BTB regulates the entry of chemical compounds, including nutrients, hormones, electrolytes, and harmful toxicants, thus creating a unique and highly selective environment for germ cells undergoing epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mok et al., 2013a</xref>). In rodents, age-dependent declines in fertility are caused by deterioration of the BTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paul and Robaire, 2013</xref>). Recent studies demonstrate that BTB integrity is determined by the balance between activities of the two complexes of the serine/threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in Sertoli cells, whereby mTOR complex one (mTORC1) promotes disassembly of the BTB and mTOR complex two (mTORC2) promotes its integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Cheng, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mok et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mok et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). mTOR expression is highest in testes out of all tissues in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fagerberg et al., 2014</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yue et al., 2014</xref>), and the mTOR pathway is recognized today as a major mechanism of longevity and aging regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Papadopoli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weichhart, 2018</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that the balance of mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells may also play a significant role in age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome. In the current study we test this hypothesis using transgenic mice with manipulated activity of mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in the balance of mTOR complexes and aging affect biochemical conditions of spermatogenesis in the apical compartment of seminiferous epithelium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Seminiferous tubule with tight blood-testis barrier (BTB) where interstitial environment (shown in blue) penetrates only to basal compartment of seminiferous epithelium as shown by color and arrows.

Thus, we characterized age-dependent changes in methylation of 254,410 CpGs sites over eight timepoint covering the period from 56 to 334 postnatal day (PND) using BeadChip methylation arrays and Short-Time Series Expression Miner (STEM) time series analysis which selects temporal profiles independent of the data and identifies significance of enrichment of clusters of similar profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ernst and Bar-Joseph, 2006</xref>). STEM analysis demonstrated that only two clusters were enriched significantly representing linear increase and linear decrease in methylation over the entire analyzed age-period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We repeated this analysis for the top 10% CpGs with highest variance across all ages. The results were the same as analysis done for all CpGs – only clusters of linear age-dependent methylation increase and decrease were enriched significantly (data not shown). These results suggest that within the studied period (56–334 PND), methylation of most DNA regions undergoing age-dependent changes in methylation in sperm is associated with age linearly or semi-linearly. Thus, within the studied period, comparison of any two age-groups, distant enough to detect age-dependent change, may be used to characterize sperm methylome aging as well as sperm methylome aging acceleration/deceleration.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Time series of age-dependent DNA methylation change in sperm.</title><p>Significantly enriched time-series are shown in color.

We used the Cre-Lox approach to knockout (KO) critical components of mTORC1 or mTORC2 – <italic>Rptor</italic> and <italic>Rictor</italic>, respectively. In both experiments, <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase was controlled by the anti-Mullerian hormone (<italic>Amh</italic>) promoter to insure KO of Raptor or Rictor in Sertoli cells only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) with antibodies for Raptor and Rictor to test efficiency of our genetic manipulations. Indeed, staining of Sertoli cells with Raptor and Rictor antibodies was abolished in corresponding KO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). BTB permeability was measured in 22-week-old KO mice and their wildtype (WT) siblings using a biotin tracer assay, where biotin is injected into the testis interstitium in vivo, and its diffusion into the apical compartment of seminiferous epithelium is visualized in histological sections by streptavidin conjugated with a florescent dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meng et al., 2005</xref>). As predicted, in mice with suppressed mTORC2 the BTB was loose enough to allow biotin to migrate to the lumen of seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Scheme of experimental design for DNA methylation analysis.</title><p>This study utilized experiments with two transgenic mouse models: (1) one with mTORC1 suppression in Sertoli cells due to the cell-specific knockout (KO) of <italic>Rptor</italic>, and (2) another with mTORC2 suppression in Sertoli cells due to the cell-specific KO of <italic>Rictor</italic>. Suppression of mTORC1 results in tightening of the blood-testis barrier (BTB) (3) and suppression of mTORC2 results in loosening of the BTB (4). DNA methylation changes were analyzed in sperm of each genotype on postnatal weeks 8 and 22 (5). In each experiment, we first identified physiological age-dependent changes in sperm DNA methylation by comparing epigenomes of wildtype (WT) 8-week-old mice and WT 22-week-old mice (6). We further used both experiments to test the hypothesis that age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome are associated with the age-dependent increase in permeability of the BTB. Specifically, to test this hypothesis using the mTORC1 experiment, we compared physiological age-dependent changes (6) with changes induced by KO (tighter BTB) in older mice (7). Our hypothesis predicts that mTORC1 suppression in older mice will affect age-dependent DMRs in the direction opposite to the one induced by age (8). Similarly, to test our hypothesis using the mTORC2 experiment, we compared physiological age-dependent changes (6) with changes induced by KO (loose BTB) in younger mice (9). Our hypothesis predicts that mTORC2 suppression in young mice due to KO will produce similar effects on age-dependent DMRs as age itself (10). Outcomes of both experiments were used to support or reject our hypothesis (11).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90992-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Immunohistochemistry analysis of the efficiency of <italic>Rictor</italic> and <italic>Rptor</italic> knockout (KO) in Sertoli cells.</title><p>Representative images illustrate lack of staining for Rictor and Raptor proteins in Sertoli cells in corresponding KO models.

For this analysis we first identified regions of DNA that undergo significant changes in methylation in WT animals. To do so, we compared profiles of DNA methylation between 8- and 22-week-old WT mice in each of the two experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These ages correspond to young pubertal and mature adult stages in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flurkey et al., 2007</xref>). The first age (8 weeks) was selected to avoid sperm from the first wave of spermatogenesis be included in the analysis to ensure that observed changes are truly aging dependent rather than associated with different stages of reproductive system maturation. C57BL/6 mice first have fertile sperm in cauda epididymis at 37 days of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mochida et al., 2019</xref>), and young C57BL/6 mice ejaculate spontaneously around three times per 5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 1980</xref>). Thus, no sperm from the first wave of spermatogenesis may survive in their cauda epididymides to the age of 8 weeks. Methylation changes were analyzed for 100 bp windows containing a minimum of 1 CpG. Average number of CpGs per region was 10.18±0.08 and 10.32±0.09 (mean±SE) in mTORC1 and mTORC2 experiments, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Significant DMRs were defined as any 100 bp window with methylation difference at FDR&lt;0.05. Using this approach, we identified 1731 age-dependent DMRs in the mTORC1 experiment and 797 DMRs in the mTORC2 experiment, with 79 common DMRs identified in both experiments. In both experiments age-dependent changes were dominated by an age-dependent increase in methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We assigned each DMR to a gene with overlapping gene body or to a closest gene with transcription start site within 5000 bp downstream of the DMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir et al., 2023</xref>) and used Metascape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>) to analyze biological categories associated with differentially methylated regions. Furthermore, we determined genomic elements associated with significant DMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This analysis demonstrated that in both experiments, lists of genes associated with significant age-dependent DMRs are enriched with developmental categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), indicative of the possibility that age-dependent changes in sperm DNA methylation may be causative of the transfer of different developmental epigenetic information to the next generation. These findings are concordant with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pilsner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suvorov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, common highly enriched categories across both experiments included tube morphogenesis, brain development, cell morphogenesis, and other categories relevant to growth, embryo development, development of nervous system, muscles, and others. Enriched molecular mechanisms were dominated by small GTPase-mediated signal transduction and regulation of kinase activity (protein phosphorylation, signaling by receptor tyrosine kinase, and other).

Given that age-dependent changes in the sperm methylome are associated with age-dependent increase in the BTB permeability, we assumed that decreased permeability of the BTB due to genetic manipulation may result in sperm epigenome ‘rejuvenation’. Thus, our hypothesis predicts that DNA regions that undergo methylation changes in WT animals with age will undergo the opposite change in older animals with Sertoli-specific inactivation of mTORC1 as compared to WT mice of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In other words, DMRs that change with age will be returned to their younger state by mTORC1 inactivation. We identified 2738 significant DMRs induced by mTORC1 inactivation in mature mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir et al., 2023</xref>) and compared them with age-dependent DMRs in WT animals. Most of the DNA regions induced by genetic manipulation of Raptor undergo hypomethylation – the direction of change opposite to the one induced by age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The distribution of genic elements associated with DMRs was similar in relation to age and genetic manipulation, suggesting that both factors affect the similar sets of elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Age is the most powerful known factor affecting DNA methylation in mammalian sperm (reviewed at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashapkin et al., 2023</xref>), and age-dependent changes in epigenetic mechanisms in sperm are involved in the regulation of major developmental pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashapkin et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, offspring conceived by fathers of advanced age had shorter lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the rates of sperm epigenetic aging (DNA methylation and small noncoding RNA) may be modified by exposures to environmental xenobiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pilsner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suvorov et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite this evidence, the mechanism(s) linking age or other paternal factors with epigenetic changes in sperm were unknown. The results of our experiments suggest that shifts of the balance of mTOR complexes activities in favor of mTORC1 or mTORC2 in Sertoli cells produce changes in sperm DNA methylation matching aging and rejuvenation respectively. Additionally, decreased activity of mTORC2 produced changes in reproductive parameters concordant with aging. Thus, mTOR pathway in Sertoli cells may be used as novel target of therapeutic interventions to rejuvenate the sperm epigenome in advanced-age fathers.</p><p>The complete cascade of molecular events that links mTOR complexes activity with rates of sperm epigenome aging remains unclear.

Each group consisted of four mice except PND 118 and PND 225 groups which included three mice each. All animals were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Sperm DNA methylation was determined using Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip (MM285K, Illumina) which covers &gt;285,000 methylation sites. The methylation of each CpG in the array was estimated based on the intensity of unmethylated and methylated probes. A total of 288,658 probes were identified and were preprocessed using the sesame function which included background and dye-bias corrections as well as the removal of SNPs and repeated probes in R. The minfi package was used to remove probes that are below background fluorescence levels, adjust the difference in Type I and II probes, and correct for technical variations in the background signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niu et al., 2016</xref>). The ComBat function was used to correct batch effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leek et al., 2012</xref>). This resulted in a total of 254,410 CpGs for downstream analyses. The results are reported in beta values, which is a measure of methylation levels from 0 to 1. The beta values are converted to M-values by log2 transformation, as this has been reported to be a more significant valid approach for differential methylation analysis and better conforms to the linear model homoscedasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2010</xref>). To visualize the sperm DNA methylation pattern with age, a time series analysis of all CpGs was then plotted using the STEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ernst and Bar-Joseph, 2006</xref>). All animal procedures followed the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the approval for this study was received from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Massachusetts, Amherst (protocol # IACUC: 3615).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Transgenic mice with Sertoli-specific inactivation of mTORC1 or mTORC2</title><p>To inactivate mTORC1, we used a Raptor (component of mTORC1) KO model.

Animals with these two different genotypes were paired together to produce F3 mice, which were used for sperm collection and reproductive phenotype assessment. F3 male mice were represented by two genotypes: Sertoli-specific KO of <italic>Rptor</italic> (suppressed mTORC1) and WT animals used as controls. The same breeding scheme was used to produce F3 male mice with Sertoli-specific KO of <italic>Rictor</italic> (suppressed mTORC2) and their corresponding WT siblings. All animals used in breeding were 9–10 weeks of age. Breeding was done by pairing one male and two female breeders overnight. Females were inspected for vaginal plugs at 9 am every morning and presence of the plug was considered pregnancy day 1. Pregnant females were housed individually. At weaning on PND 21 all animals were identified via ear-punching, and ear tissue samples obtained from ear-punching were used for genotyping. Genotyping was done using RT-qPCR as recommended by the Jackson Laboratories. All animals were housed in a temperature (23±2°C) and humidity (40±10 %) controlled environment, with a 12 hr light/dark cycle, and food and water available ad libitum. F3 male mice were euthanized at four timepoints: 8, 12, 22, and 56 weeks of age (n≥5 per genotype/timepoint). At each euthanasia testes were collected, weighed, and fixed in modified Davidson’s solution and caudal epididymal sperm was collected via swim-up procedure (see below, Sperm collection and DNA extraction).

Differentially methylated regions were identified using the Methyl kit (v1.24.0) pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akalin et al., 2012</xref>). In brief, the genome was tiled into sliding windows and a weighted methylation level was calculated for each window. To minimize error in base calling, we filtered out bases with less than 10× coverage and read counts more than 99.9th percentile and coverage values were normalized using default settings. We used a logistic regression model for p-value calculation subsequently adjusted for multiple comparison (FDR) using the SLIM method for final DMR identification. Individual DMRs were identified for a 100 bp sliding window with a minimum of one CpG in at least three samples out of four in an age/genotype group. DMRs with methylation difference at FDR &lt;0.05 were used to compare different age/genotype groups. To compare the overlap between DMRs induced by age and DMRs induced by KO we used Fisher’s exact test. For overlapping DMRs we used Pearson correlation to establish concordance of DNA methylation change induced by aging and genetic manipulations. Genomic ranges were compared using the FindOverlapOfPeaks function available in the chiPpeakAnno package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). The total number of methylation regions used as a background was determined as a list of 100 bp tiles containing CpGs obtained by intersecting lists from two respective comparisons (e.g. WT8 vs WT22 and WT22 vs KO22 in mTORC1 experiment and WT8 vs WT22 and WT8 vs KO8 in mTORC2 experiment).

In order to demonstrate the relevance of a functioning BTB for the maintenance of sperm methylation patterns, the authors generated mice with genetically disrupted mTORC2 complex or mTORC1 complex in Sertoli cells and determined sperm methylation patterns in comparison to isogenic wild-type males. In line with previously published scientific literature (e.g. Mok et al., 2013; Dong et al, 2015; and others), the manuscript corroborates that a Sertoli-cell specific deletion of mTORC2 caused a loss of BTB function and a progressive spermatogenic defect. The authors further show that sperm DNA is differentially methylated (DMRs) as a consequence of either a mTORC2 disruption (associated with a loss of BTB function) or following a mTORC1 disruption (BTB function either increased or not leaky) when compared to their isogenic age-matched wt controls. Those DMRs overlap partially with changes in sperm DNA methylation that were found when comparing sperm from 8-week males with sperm isolated from 22-week-old male mice.</p><p>The authors interpret the observed changes as representative of the sperm DNA methylation changes that occur during normal chronological aging of the male. For an aged control group, the authors use sperm DNA of 22-week-old wild-type mates from the mTORC2 and mTORC2 KO breeding and compare the sperm methylation patterns found in sperm from those 22-week males to 8-week young males, that are intended to represent an old and a young cohort, respectively. DNA methylation analysis indicates that a disruption of mTORC2 (&amp; decrease of BTB function) results in increased DNA methylation of sperm DNA, while a disruption of mTORC1 (and proposed increase of BTB tightness, not shown in the manuscript, though) resulted in increased hypomethylation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the hypothesis and experimental system are interesting and the data demonstrating the relevance of the mTORC2 complex for BTB function is convincing, several open questions limit the evidence that supports the hypothesis that the sperm DNA methylation changes seen in old males are caused by BTB failure following an imbalance of mTOR signaling complexes. The major critique points are the lack of a chronologically old group and the choice of 8 weeks &amp; 22 weeks age of age:</p><p>- Data illustrating the degree of BTB decline and sperm DNA methylation changes from chronologically &quot;old&quot; male mice is missing. 22-week-old mice are not considered old but are of good and mature breeding age, equivalent to humans in their mid-late twenties. In the manuscript, the 22-week-old wildtype mice show no evidence of BTB breakdown (Figure 3), so why are their sperm used to represent &quot;aged&quot; sperm?</p><p>- Adding a group of &quot;old&quot; wild-type mice of 12-14 months of age, which is closer to the end of effective reproduction in mice, more equivalent to 45-59 year-old humans could be used to illustrate that (a) aging causes a marked decrease in BTB function at this time in mouse life, and that this BTB breakdown chronologically aligns with the age-associated DNA hypermethylation seen in old sperm. Age-matched &quot;old&quot; mTORC1 KO, with a (supposedly) tighter BTB barrier, could then be expected to have a sperm DMA methylation profile closer to that of younger wild-type animals. Such data are currently missing. While the progressive testicular decline observed in the mTORC1 KO (Fig.5) could make it difficult to obtain the appropriately aged mTORC1 KO tissues, it is completely feasible to obtain data from chronologically old wild-type males. (The progressive testicular decline further raises the question of what additional defects the KO causes, and how such additional defects would influence the sperm DNA methylation profile.) The addition of data from an old group to the currently included groups could strengthen the interpretation that the observations in the BTB-defective mTORC2 KO mice are modelling an age-related testicular decline, provided that the DMRs seen in the chronologically old group significantly overlap with the BTB-defective changes.</p><p>- In the current form, the described differences in sperm DNA methylation are based on comparisons between pubertal mice (8 weeks) and mature but not old adult males (22 weeks), while a chronologically &quot;old&quot; group is missing from the data sets and comparisons. Thus, it appears that the described sperm methylation changes reflect developmental changes associated with normal maturation and not necessarily declining sperm quality due to aging. (Sperm obtained from 8-week-old mice likely were generated, at least in part, during the 1st wave of spermatogenesis, which is known to differ from the continuously proceeding spermatogenesis during the remained of the mature life. During the 1st wave of spermatogenesis, Sertoli cells are known to undergo gene expression changes which could contribute to varying degrees of BTB function, and thus have effects on the sperm DNA methylation profiles of such 1st wave sperm.)</p><p>- It is unclear why the aging-related DMRs between the 8 and 22-week-old wild-type mice vary so dramatically between the two wild-type groups derived from the mTORC1 and the mTORC2 breeding (Fig. S4). If the main difference was due to mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity, both wildtype groups should behave very similarly. Changes seen in a truly &quot;old&quot; mouse (e.g. 20 weeks to 56 weeks), changes in &quot;young mTORC1&quot; and in &quot;old mTORC2&quot; are missing.

Unfortunately, we completely disagree with the evaluation provided by the reviewer. Research on sperm DNA methylation experienced a significant rise of interest in the current century and by now more than 2000 papers have been published. Although it was demonstrated that the sperm DNA methylome may be affected by almost every factor analyzed, no study was published to identify molecular mechanisms that may link these factors with the sperm epigenome. Our study is the FIRST to identify such a mechanism (mTOR complexes balance in Sertoli cells). More so, we demonstrated experimentally that manipulations of this mechanism allow regulation of the rates of epigenetic aging of sperm in both directions (accelerate aging or rejuvenate). Thus, our study provides a mechanistic background for the development of therapeutic interventions that may target sperm epigenome.</p><p>We acknowledge that our study does not provide the full cascade of events linking the balance of mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells with the sperm DNA methylome. It suggests, however, the most plausible event next in a cascade (BTB permeability changes). Our group is working on this question now and we hope to provide the answer soon in a separate study. Even after that, we will be far from understanding the complete chain of molecular events that links mTOR and sperm methylome. It may take many years and significant effort of many research groups to dissect the whole cascade. It is worth mentioning that understanding of a complete cascade involved in pathology is not needed to develop efficient therapies if the critical nodes are known. For many common drugs (e.g. metformin) we do not know the full chain of molecular mechanisms but use them successfully.</p><p>Thus, we believe that our study is mechanistic as it identified a critical mechanism manipulation of which allows experimental aging and rejuvenation of the sperm methylome. Additionally, it generates new mechanistic questions and hypotheses to be answered in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary and Strength:</p><p>The manuscript by Amir et al. describes that Sertoli-specific inactivation of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complex by KO of either Raptor or Rictor, respectively, resulted in progressive changes in blood-testis-barrier (BTB) function, testis weight, and sperm parameters, including counts, morphology, mtDNA content and sperm DNA methylation.</p><p>The described studies are based on the hypothesis that a decline of BTB function with increasing chronological age of a male contributes to the DNA methylation changes that are known to occur in sperm DNA of old males when compared to sperm DNA from isogenic young males.

We disagree with the evaluation provided by the reviewer, however.</p><p>First, the reviewer misinterpreted the hypothesis of the study, although it is formulated in the last sentence of the Introduction: “ … we hypothesized that the balance of mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells may also play a significant role in age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome.” Instead, the reviewer assigned a different hypothesis to our study (that BTB integrity changes are responsible for age-dependent changes in sperm DNA methylation) and criticized us for not providing clear testing of this hypothesis.</p><p>To clarify, we believe that our study provides high-quality testing of OUR hypothesis as we demonstrated experimentally that manipulations of mTOR complexes balance in Sertoli allow acceleration and deceleration of epigenetic aging of sperm. Additionally, our study generated a hypothesis that BTB permeability may mediate the effects of the mTOR pathway on sperm methylome. This second hypothesis is to be tested in the future research.</p><p>We also disagree with the reviewer's interpretation of the aging process as an abrupt transition from a young, healthy, and undamaged state to an old, moribund, and damaged state. The whole body of biogerontological knowledge suggests instead steady accumulation of damage over lasting periods of time. For example, this understanding of steady change at the molecular level allowed the development and successful use of epigenetic clock and other molecular clock models, including several variants of sperm epigenetic clocks. These models clearly demonstrate linear or semi-linear accumulation in DNA-methylation changes in various tissues and biological species across the whole lifespan. It is reasonable to assume that BTB permeability decreases with age steadily as well and that in younger animals this decrease may be not easily detected by existing analytical methods. Experimental data showing the dynamics of the BTB deterioration over age do not exist to our knowledge although it was demonstrated that older animals have loose BTB as compared with young. We agree with the reviewer that future studies testing the role of BTB deterioration for sperm methylome aging will need to provide such evidence. It was not the subject of the current study, however.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in Sertoli cells regulates age-dependent changes in sperm DNA methylation&quot;, the authors proposed to test if the balance of mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells may play a significant role in age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome.

The authors specifically state: &quot; The young adult group should be at least 3 months old because, although mice are sexually mature by 35 days, relatively rapid maturational growth continues for most biologic processes and structures until about 3 months. The upper age range for the young adult group is typically about 6 months. ... For the middleaged group, 10 months is typically the lower limit.... The upper age limit for the middleaged group is typically 14-15 months, because at this age, most biomarkers still have not changed to their full extent, and some have not yet started changing. For the old group, the lower age limit is 18 months because age-related change for almost all biomarkers of aging can be detected by then. The upper limit is 22-26 months, depending on the genotype.&quot; According to this reference, mice up to 6 months of age are generally considered &quot;mature adults&quot; (equivalent to humans 20-30 yrs), mice of 10-14 month are &quot;middle-aged adults&quot; (equivalent to ~38-47 human years) and 18-24 month mice are &quot;old&quot; (equivalent to human of 56-69 yrs.).</p><p>Going on these commonly used age ranges, it is unclear why the authors used 8-week-old mice (generally considered pubertal to late adolescent age) as young mice and 5-month-old mice as &quot;old mice&quot;.</p><p>Differences seen between these cohorts most likely do not reflect aging, but more likely reflect changes associated with normal developmental maturation, since testis and epididymides continue to grow until about 10-11 weeks of age.</p><p>- The DMRs identified between 8 and 22-week-old animals could represent DMRs that are dependent on developmental maturation more than being changed in an &quot;age-dependent&quot; manner (in the sense of increased chronological age). This interpretation is congruent with the fact that those DMRs are enriched for developmental categories.</p></disp-quote><p>- We are thankful to the reviewer for a detailed explanation of their disagreement with the ages of mice used in this study. In short, the reviewer suggests that our older group (22 weeks) is not old enough to represent aged animals and our young group (8 weeks) may still have spermatozoa from the first wave of spermatogenesis, and as such the observed differences between the 2 ages cannot be considered as aging-related but rather may represent different stages of maturation of the reproductive system. At the first glance this criticism looks valid.</p><p>However, to design our experiments we used our data that was not included to this manuscript initially. These data demonstrated that age dependent changes in sperm DNA are linearly or semi linearly associated with age in the age range from 56 to 334 days. Thus, within this interval any 2 ages, distant enough to register the difference in DNA methylation, can be used to assess age dependent changes in DNA methylation and changes in the rates of epigenetic aging of sperm in response to genetic manipulations. We have added these results now, - see “Identification of agedependent patterns in sperm DNA methylation” section in Material and Methods and “Patterns of age-dependent changes in sperm DNA methylation” in Results. We also consider that the reviewer’s suggestion that sperm from 8-week-old mice represents the first wave of spermatogenesis does not have ground. Indeed, C57BL/6 mice first have fertile sperm in cauda epididymis at 37 days of age [1], 19 days earlier than the age of 56 days (8 weeks) at which sperm was collected in our study in the youngest group of mice. Given that young C57BL/6 mice ejaculate spontaneously around 3 times per 5 days [2], 8 weeks old mice have ejaculated &gt; 10 times since the first wave of spermatogenesis before the sperm was collected for our study, making negligibly small the chances of survival of any first wave sperm in their cauda epididymides to the age of 8 weeks. We have added this information to the text.</p><p>(1) Mochida, K.; Hasegawa, A.; Ogonuki, N.; Inoue, K.; Ogura, A.
