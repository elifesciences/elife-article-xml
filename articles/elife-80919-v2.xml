The mechanisms underlying tissue-specific phenotypes are not understood. Complex I (cI) is classically considered the entry point for electrons into the ETC, and in vitro experiments indicate that cI is required for basal respiration and maintenance of the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, an indicator of cellular redox status. This finding has largely not been tested in vivo. Here, we report that mitochondrial complex I is dispensable for homeostasis of the adult mouse liver; animals with hepatocyte-specific loss of cI function display no overt phenotypes or signs of liver damage, and maintain liver function, redox and oxygen status. Further analysis of cI-deficient livers did not reveal significant proteomic or metabolic changes, indicating little to no compensation is required in the setting of complex I loss. In contrast, complex IV (cIV) dysfunction in adult hepatocytes results in decreased liver function, impaired oxygen handling, steatosis, and liver damage, accompanied by significant metabolomic and proteomic perturbations. Our results support a model whereby complex I loss is tolerated in the mouse liver because hepatocytes use alternative electron donors to fuel the mitochondrial ETC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mitochondria are specialised structures inside cells that help to convert nutrients into energy. They take electrons from nutrients and use them to power biochemical reactions that supply chemical fuel. Previous studies of cells grown in the laboratory have found that electrons enter this process via a large assembly of proteins in mitochondria called complex I.</p><p>Understanding the mechanism of energy production is important, as issues with mitochondria can lead to a variety of metabolic diseases. However, it is still unclear how complex I acts in living animals.</p><p>Lesner et al. addressed this knowledge gap by genetically removing a key protein from complex I in the liver of mice. Surprisingly, the animals did not develop any detectable symptoms and maintained healthy liver function. Mice did not seem to compensate by making energy in a different way, suggesting that complex I is not normally used by the mouse liver for this process.</p><p>This research suggests that biologists should reconsider the mechanism that mitochondria use to power cells in animals. While the role of Complex I in electron transfer is well established in laboratory-grown cells and some organs, like the brain, it cannot be assumed this applies to the whole body. Understanding energy production in specific organs could help researchers to develop nutrient-based therapies for metabolic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>liver</kwd><kwd>Complex I</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009282</institution-id><institution>United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Prashant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2ES030449-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Prashant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AR073217-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Prashant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F31-DK122676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lesner</surname><given-names>Nicholas P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Moody Medical Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Prashant</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP 2019281210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shelton</surname><given-names>Spencer D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Animal models reveal that mitochondrial complex I is dispensable for homeostatic functions of the mouse liver.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondrial ETC disease in humans exhibits a striking tissue specificity, whereby mutations in distinct ETC components are causative for specific and non-overlapping syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorman et al., 2016</xref>). As an example, genetic dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I (cI) is associated with neurological disease including Leigh syndrome (characterized by severe loss of motor abilities, necrotizing brain lesions and early death) and Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (characterized by bilateral loss of vision in early adulthood due to degeneration of the optic nerve) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodenburg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MartÃ­n et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Distelmaier et al., 2009</xref>). The mechanisms underlying sensitivity of the nervous system, with sparing of other organ systems, in the setting of complex I loss is not understood. In contrast, mutations in other mitochondrial ETC components have been associated with multi-organ diseases, and the basis for tissue specificity in those diseases is also unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Liver involvement is a common component of mitochondrial diseases, present in approximately 20% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Sokol, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahman, 2013</xref>), as well as being associated with specific syndromes caused by mutations in distinct ETC-related components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valnot et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and Sokol, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morris et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koh et al., 2018</xref>). Common findings in affected patients include hepatomegaly, steatosis, cholestasis and additional metabolic abnormalities associated with liver failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Molleston et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cloots et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinnery and DiMauro, 2005</xref>). Genetic analysis of patients has revealed mutations in genes which influence multiple components of the ETC (e.g. <italic>POLG</italic>, <italic>LARS</italic>, <italic>DGUOK</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee and Sokol, 2007a</xref>). With respect to single-complex diseases, mutations in <italic>SCO1</italic>, an assembly protein for mitochondrial complex IV (cIV), and mutations in <italic>BCS1L</italic>, a chaperone protein for mitochondrial complex III, have been associated with liver failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valnot et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Meirleir et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Lonlay et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, single-complex diseases associated with other components of the ETC (complex I and complex II) do not typically present with liver failure, despite their placement directly upstream of cIV.</p><p>The ETC functions to transfer electrons (from the oxidation of nutrients) to O<sub>2</sub>, as a final electron acceptor; this process is coupled to the formation of an electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane and the production of ATP. Mitochondrial complex I is the largest protein complex of the ETC, and is commonly considered the primary entry point for electrons into the ETC: In cultured cells, cI is required for maintenance of cellular redox status (assessed by the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio) via its role in NADH oxidation, and subsequent electron transfer to ubiquinone (CoQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Complex I is composed of 14 core subunits, plus an additional 31 accessory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2009</xref>). Published mouse models of complex I deficiency have largely focused on accessory subunits, including deletion of <italic>Ndufs4</italic>, <italic>Ndufs6</italic>, and <italic>Ndufa5</italic>, which result in neurological and cardiac phenotypes associated with partial loss of complex I function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kruse et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peralta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ke et al., 2012</xref>); no liver phenotypes or metabolic perturbations were reported in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). A recent report conditionally deleted <italic>Ndufs3</italic>, a core subunit of cI, in skeletal muscle, resulting in progressive myopathy associated with significant reduction of cI activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, to date, mouse models have supported an essential role for cI in vivo in the central nervous system and muscle.</p><p>Here, we report that deletion of the core subunit, <italic>Ndufa9</italic>, results in complete loss of cI function, but is well-tolerated in the adult mouse liver. Further analysis reveals intact liver function and oxygen status in <italic>Ndufa9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals, which is not accompanied by significant metabolic alterations or changes in redox status. This is in contrast with hepatocyte-specific deletion of the complex IV assembly factor <italic>Cox10,</italic> which results in altered redox status and impaired liver function. In complex IV-depleted livers, we observe the accumulation of long chain acyl-carnitine species, without significant alterations in other potential electron donors, suggesting that fatty acids are an electron donor to the hepatic ETC. These results support a model in which cI is not an essential upstream component of the ETC in adult mammalian liver, in contrast to the conventional view of cI function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitochondrial complex I function is dispensable for homeostasis of adult murine hepatocytes</title><p>To understand how liver cells respond to loss of complex I, we made use of a conditional allele of the core subunit <italic>Ndufa9.

At 4 weeks post-AAV, our proteomics analysis detected 3001 proteins with high confidence; however, only 11 proteins were significantly upregulated (log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)&gt;1, p-val &lt;0.05), and 23 proteins were significantly downregulated (log<sub>2</sub>(fold change) &lt; â1; p-val &lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was unable to distinguish proteomes from <italic>Ndufa9<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and <italic>Ndufa9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Of the downregulated proteins, the majority were components of complex I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), consistent with destabilization of cI in the setting of <italic>Ndufa9</italic> subunit loss. We did not observe loss of components from other ETC complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Among upregulated proteins, there were a small number of mitochondrial proteins impacting translation (Mrpl52, Mrpl42), electron transport (Cox6a1), and metabolism (Shmt2, Ldhd, Dlat) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The small number of abundance changes (outside of complex I components) suggests that the proteome is not drastically changing in response to complex I loss; however, our analysis is only sampling a portion of the total cellular proteome, and it is possible that we are missing some key regulatory proteins in reaction to complex I loss. To further profile the response in <italic>Ndufa9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers, we enriched liver lysates for mitochondrial fractions followed by proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Complex I subunits tended to be decreased in abundance, and we did not observe significant changes in most subunits of the other complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

We therefore assessed glucose contribution to glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolites via steady-state euglycemic infusions of [U-<sup>13</sup>C]glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In these experiments, glucose can contribute to TCA cycle metabolites via glycolysis, PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase), and PC (pyruvate carboxylase) activity; in addition, extrahepatic production of lactate can be metabolized by the liver and contribute to both TCA cycle metabolites and glycolytic intermediates via gluconeogenic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Infusion of <sup>13</sup>C uniformly labeled glucose allows us to assess the contribution of glucose-derived carbons to liver metabolites by measuring the fraction of unlabeled (m+0) metabolite, as well as the fraction of each possible labeled species (m+1, m+2, m+3, â¦) in which one or more carbons were derived from the labeled glucose molecule.

In cultured cells, complex I is the major route of electron entry into the ETC, and inhibition of complex I dramatically lowers cellular oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Our above results suggest this scenario may not be true during hepatic homeostasis. We therefore made use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess blood and tissue oxygenation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3EâK</xref>). Oxygen-sensitive MRI measurements provide a non-invasive method to interrogate changes in oxygen levels in vivo in the absence of a reporter agent. Specifically, the paramagnetic properties of dissolved oxygen within tissue accelerate the decay of longitudinal magnetization of water protons, termed the TOLD (Tissue-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent) effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hallac et al., 2014</xref>). The decay of longitudinal magnetization is characterized by the decay constant (or longitudinal relaxation time) T1. Thus, increased tissue oxygen levels result in decreased T1 values. Similarly, the unpaired electrons of iron in deoxyhemoglobin allow it to act as a strong paramagnetic agent which accelerates the decay of transverse magnetization in the blood (characterized by the transverse relaxation time T2*), termed the BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent) effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wengler et al., 2019</xref>). In this manner, relative increases in T2* values are indicative of decreased deoxyhemoglobin concentration (i.e., an increased blood oxygenation state). We reasoned that by following hepatic T1 levels in response to increased blood oxygen delivery, we could assess the mitochondriaâs ability to process this excess oxygen. In these experiments, we controlled for differences in tissue perfusion by measuring tissue perfusion using an arterial spin labeling (ASL) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim and Tsekos, 1997</xref>). Here, the magnetization of water protons flowing through the slice of interest is labeled by a radio frequency pulse in such a way that they can be distinguished from that of the stationary tissue. The difference in magnetization between the stationary and flowing water protons is related to blood perfusion through a simple two compartment model of tissue, by which the perfusion is quantified (see Materials and methods).</p><p><italic>Ndufa9<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and <italic>Ndufa9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> littermates were challenged with room air, followed by 100% oxygen, and T1 and T2* relaxation parameters were sequentially assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Based on arterial spin labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim and Tsekos, 1997</xref>), we did not observe changes in liver perfusion between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). BOLD (Blood-oxygen-level dependent) measurements (T2*) are dependent on the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wengler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barash et al., 2007</xref>), and we observed significant increases in T2* in both <italic>Ndufa9<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and <italic>Ndufa9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals, indicating increased blood oxygen in the setting of 100% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). TOLD (Tissue-oxygen-level dependent) measurements (based on T1 relaxation) are dependent on the dissolved oxygen concentration; with increased tissue oxygen content, T1 parameters are expected to decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hallac et al., 2014</xref>). In wild-type livers, we observed no significant decreases in the average hepatic T1 in response to 100% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I, J</xref>), consistent with previous measurements in human livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tadamura et al., 1997</xref>). This suggests that when challenged with increased blood O<sub>2</sub> delivery, wild-type mouse liver is able to compensate and maintain steady state O<sub>2</sub> levels, potentially through increased tissue oxygen consumption. Similar to <italic>Ndufa9<sup>f/f</sup></italic> livers, <italic>Ndufa9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers also did not exhibit significant decreases in the average T1 parameter, indicating that tissue oxygen levels are maintained in the absence of complex I function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3HâJ</xref>). We also assessed T1 changes locally by aligning images (ÎT1); as above, we did not observe significant decreases in the average ÎT1 in either <italic>Ndufa9<sup>f/f</sup></italic> or <italic>Ndufa9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus, based on tissue oxygen levels in response to a hyperoxic challenge, <italic>Ndufa9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers do not have a measurable change in oxygen consumption as compared with wild-type livers. Altogether, the above results indicate that complex I is largely dispensable for oxygen status and homeostatic function in the adult mouse liver, without signs of significant metabolic or proteomic compensation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mitochondrial complex IV is required in adult hepatocytes</title><p>To further explore a role for the mitochondrial ETC in hepatic function, we examined the requirement for complex IV, making use of a <italic>Cox10<sup>flox</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diaz et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Cox10</italic> is an assembly factor of complex IV, and <italic>Cox10</italic> deletion in skeletal muscle is associated with diminished cIV activity accompanied by myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diaz et al., 2005</xref>).

We did not observe significant decreases in components from other ETC complexes, suggesting an isolated effect of <italic>Cox10</italic> loss on complex IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Consistent with this, gene ontology analysis of all downregulated proteins identified complex IV as the only Cellular Components pathway enriched among the downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).

Thus, proteomic changes in response to hepatic complex IV deficiency largely center around increased mitochondrial constituents, downregulation of complex IV, as well as decreased enzyme abundance for a number of metabolic pathways.</p><p>To further characterize the compensatory response in the absence of complex IV, we performed label-free proteomics on enriched mitochondrial fractions from <italic>Cox10<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers, which was able to identify 721 mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Complex IV subunits tended to be decreased in abundance, and we did not observe significant changes in most subunits of the other complexes although they tended to be upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). We observed statistically significant downregulation of some select components of fatty acid metabolism (FABP1, ACAD11) as well as upregulation of some components regulating ubiquinol homeostasis (DHODH, UQCC1, UQCC2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>Steady-state metabolomic analysis of hepatic tissue revealed a number of metabolites altered in response to complex IV loss, and unsupervised hierarchical clustering was sufficient to separate <italic>Cox10<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L and M</xref>). Mitochondrial TCA cycle metabolites were largely maintained, although we observed a significant increase in 2-hydroxyglutarate levels, which has been previously observed in the setting of mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunt et al., 2019</xref>). We observed significant upregulation in a number of cholate species, consistent with cholestasis and hepatomegaly in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). Upregulated metabolites were also highly enriched for long-chain acylcarnitine fatty acid species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). We hypothesize that the accumulation of acylcarnitine species is related to a fatty oxidation defect secondary to loss of mitochondrial complex IV; however, this finding may also be related to the proteomic changes in <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers discussed above. We therefore assessed proteomic changes in annotated GO pathways related to fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5</xref>).

However, we did not observe overall enrichment or depletion of the fatty acid synthesis pathway by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5A</xref>), and we did not detect significant changes in ACACA and ACACB, which catalyze rate-limiting steps for fatty acid synthesis. Conversely, genes involved in fatty acid oxidation tended to be upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5B</xref>,C), although the overall enrichment of this pathway did not reach statistical significance, and we did not observe significant changes in the rate-limiting enzyme CPT1A. As a whole, the trends towards downregulation of fatty acid synthesis enzymes and upregulation of fatty acid oxidation enzymes are not consistent with being causal for the large accumulation of acyl-carnitine species, and instead suggest that the proteome responds in a compensatory manner to limit the accumulation of acyl-carnitine species.</p><p>We similarly examined proteomic changes in genes involved in bile acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5âfigure supplement 6</xref>), and their relation to the large increases in levels of cholate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). Abundance of these family members tended to be decreased in <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers, although the overall pathway depletion did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5âfigure supplement 6A</xref>). Unfortunately, our proteomic analysis did not detect most bile acid metabolic enzymes, including the rate-limiting enzyme CYP7A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5âfigure supplement 6B</xref>).</p><p>Downregulated metabolites were enriched for several electron carriers, including pyruvate, ascorbate and tetrahydrobiopterin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). Pyruvate can exchange electrons with NAD(H), while ascorbate and THBP are potent antioxidants which can exchange electrons with metal ions and hydroxyradical species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Traber and Stevens, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kojima et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, inhibition of the mitochondrial ETC via <italic>Cox10</italic> removal may influence redox balance in multiple species. To assess related proteomic changes, we investigated alterations in genes of the oxidoreductase family, a large family related to transfer of electrons between many potential substrates (GO: 0016491; 787 members). Overall, oxidoreductase enzymes trended to be upregulated in <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers, largely driven by mitochondrial-localized proteins, and we did identify a number of enzymes related to pyruvate, ascorbate and THBP metabolism as significantly altered in response to hepatic complex IV loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7A</xref>). The overall pathway enrichment did not reach statistical significance. Focusing on each electron carrier in isolation did reveal some interesting trends. Pyruvate has a number of potential metabolic fates, and we did observe upregulation of components of the PDH complex (PDHA1, PDHB, PDHX, DLAT, DLD) which could potentially deplete pyruvate via conversion into acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7B</xref>). Similarly, we observed significant upregulation of BCKDHA and BCKDHB, which potentially serve to deplete the electron carrier Î±-hydroxybutyrate; in addition, the rate-limiting enzyme of this transsulfuration pathway (CBS) was significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7C</xref>). The ketone metabolites acetoacetate and Î²-hydroxybutyrate were significantly depleted in <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers; however, we did not observe significant changes in the ketone body-related enzymes detected in our dataset, including the rate-limiting synthesis enzymes HMGCS1 and HMGCS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7D</xref>). With respect to ascorbate metabolism, the majority of related enzymes were not detected in our experiment, including the rate-limiting synthesis enzyme GULO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5âfigure supplement 7E</xref>). Lastly, we detected a significant decrease in the BH4 (tetrahydrobiopterin) recycling enzyme QDPR, consistent with the downregulation of BH4 levels. The rate-limiting synthesis enzyme, GCH1, was not detected. To summarize, the precise reasons for changes in the levels of these electron carriers is not clear at this stage; however, it is possible that proteome changes in response to complex IV loss may be contributing to these alterations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Complex IV inhibition blocks electron entry from the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex</title><p>In cultured cells, Complex IV is the major source of oxygen consumption.

These alternate routes bypass complex I by donating electrons directly to ubiquinone. Complex IV dysfunction is expected to impact all of these routes; however, we would only expect to see significant metabolic alterations in pathways with high flux. In culture, ETC inhibition is commonly associated with elevated succinate levels; however, we did not observe this result in <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). Similarly, we did not observed elevations in glycerol 3-phosphate or dihydroorotate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>), suggesting that GPD2 and DHODH activities are not a major electron source in murine livers.</p><p>Lastly, we examined whether the ETF complex constitutes a significant electron source to the hepatic ETC. The ETF complex is made up of three proteins (ETFA, ETFB and ETFDH), which transfers electrons from FADH<sub>2</sub> to ubiquinone. Significant sources of FADH<sub>2</sub> are thought to include fatty acids (via beta-oxidation), as well as amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). In <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers, we observed significant elevations in medium/long chain acyl-carnitines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>), as well as a decrease in Î²-hydroxybutyrate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>), consistent with a fatty acid oxidation defect. In addition, we observed a striking increase in glutarate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>), consistent with a selective defect in amino acid metabolism linked to FADH<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the metabolic abnormalities observed in <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> livers are most consistent with a buildup of ETFDH substrates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The dispensability of complex I for homeostatic function in the adult murine liver is not consistent with a key role for cI in electron entry to the ETC in this tissue; in particular, we observed no alterations in mitochondrial or cytosolic redox status in cI-deficient liver, or evidence of significant metabolic, histologic or functional alterations. It is possible that cI-related defects are minor and not detectable by our assays. The mouse liver is known to have relatively low flux through PDH, the major entry point of carbons to the TCA cycle which generates NADH for cI function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cappel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merritt et al., 2011</xref>); thus, our data is consistent with a model in which the hepatic TCA cycle does not play a prominent role in nutrient oxidation via the generation of mitochondrial NADH under homeostatic conditions. The impact of cIV deficiency on cellular redox status indicates that the mitochondrial ETC is critical for removing electrons via transfer to oxygen, and thus, alternative electron donors are likely to fuel the ETC. However, the lack of a survival deficit in <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals in this study calls into question the absolute requirement for an intact mitochondrial ETC in mouse liver.</p><p>A precise measurement of the source of electrons for the ETC is challenging due to an inability to directly track electrons after incorporation into the redox-sensitive cofactors used by the mitochondrial ETC complexes. Our results from complex IV dysfunctional livers reveal a buildup of substrates that normally feed into the ETF complex, including elevations in multiple acyl-carnitine species, as well as glutarate, a byproduct of lysine and tryptophan metabolism. In principle, the buildup of acyl-carnitines could be due to increased rates of fatty acid synthesis (FAS); however, we observed that a number of FAS enzymes were downregulated. In addition, the reduction in Î²-hydroxybutyrate (a terminal product of fatty acid oxidation) levels combined with the large increases in fatty acid species is consistent with a defect in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), although these steady state measurements do not directly inform on flux through FAO pathways, and experiments to directly trace flux through the ETF complex will be necessary.</p><p>In humans, mutations in proteins of the ETF complex are causative for glutaric acidemia type II disease (also known as multiply acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency), which has similar biochemical abnormalities as our <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frerman and Goodman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">GrÃ¼nert, 2014</xref>). The clinical progression of these patients can be variable; however, patients with hepatic involvement exhibit hepatic steatosis, elevated ALT/AST levels and periodic hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siano et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, mice carrying a knock-in ETFDH mutation displayed diet-dependent phenotypes, including hepatic steatosis and elevated levels of acyl-carnitine species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Lastly, patients with SCO1 mutations (impacting complex IV assembly) display hepatic steatosis and elevated acyl-carnitines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valnot et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stiburek et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting a clinical overlap between mitochondrial ETC inhibition and ETF complex deficiency.</p><p>Our results therefore indicate the complex I is dispensable in the adult murine liver. A limitation of our study is that we have focused on steady state analysis of homeostatic functions in the mouse liver of the C57BL/6 J background, and it is possible that complex I does have a required role in alternative genetic backgrounds, or in the setting of hepatic stressors or alternative diets. Indeed, it has been reported that C57BL/6 J animals contain a mutation which prevents the incorporation of multimeric complex IV into supercomplexes, and so the major contributing sources of electrons for the ETC may be different in this background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jha et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is possible that cI is required in other genetic backgrounds and it will be important to assess these scenarios in future work. Indeed, the relevant and high flux modes of electron entry into the ETC may be different among distinct tissues and backgrounds, and this provides a plausible hypothesis for the non-overlapping syndromes present in mitochondrial ETC diseases affecting different components. As an upstream component of the ETC, cI mutations from the mitochondrial or nuclear genome may manifest in a narrow set of tissues systems which rely on mitochondrial NADH to fuel respiration. In contrast, complex IV, the terminal component of the ETC which feeds electrons to oxygen as a final electron acceptor, might be predicted to have effects in a wider variety of tissues, particularly those which do not have alternative pathways to remove excess electrons. Understanding the key ETC fuel sources in both normal and stressed tissue systems will therefore provide insight into the pathophysiological processes which occur downstream of specific mitochondrial mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

No statistical tests were used to predetermine sample size. Animals were randomly allocated into experimental groups. No blinding or masking of samples was performed. Data sets for each group of measurement was tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the data was not normally distributed, the data was log-transformed and retested for normality. For normally-distributed data, groups were compared using the two-tailed Studentâs t-test (for two groups), or one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA (&gt;2 groups), followed by Tukeyâs or Dunnettâs test for multiple comparisons. For data that was not normally distributed, we used non-parametric testing (Mann-Whitney or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for two groups and Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple groups), followed by Dunnâs multiple comparisons adjustment. For metabolomics and proteomics data sets, abundances were compared by multiple t-tests, followed by Bonferroni correction of p-values. Proteomics and metabolomics analysis were performed once using biological replicates (individual mice); for other experiments, multiple (two to four) independent experiments with biological replicates (individual mice) were performed for reported data, and the number of biological replicates are indicated in the figures. No data were excluded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is an advisor to Agios Pharmaceuticals</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mouse experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (protocol 102654).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Excel spreadsheet containing raw data and statistical analysis of proteomics and metabolomics data for <italic>Ndufa9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> vs. <italic>Ndufa9<sup>f/f</sup></italic> livers at 4 weeks post-AAV administration.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80919-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Excel spreadsheet containing raw data and statistical analysis of proteomics and metabolomics data for <italic>Cox10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> vs. <italic>Cox10<sup>f/f</sup></italic> livers at 8 weeks post-AAV administration.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80919-supp2-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Excel spreadsheet containing raw data for panels presented in the figures and figure supplements.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-80919-supp3-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-80919-transrepform1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Proteomics datasets have been deposited into the PRIDE database (identifier PXD031685), and metabolomics datasets have been deposited into Metabolomics Workbench (identifier PR001484).

The study includes compelling data of proteomics and metabolomic tracer analyses representing a resource for a broad community with interest in biochemistry and metabolism of the cell as well as biomedical research.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Differential requirements for mitochondrial electron transport chain components in the adult murine liver&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your initial submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with members of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers find the topic and findings potentially interesting and significant. The reviewers have brought up serious criticism (comments appended below), which precludes invitation to revise at this stage. However, they encourage you to resubmit. and new manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> with a more full picture including a mechanistic evidence requested in their comments.</p><p>Specifically, the evidence for the involvement of DHODH is not sufficient. Thus, this interesting and important conclusion remains not fully proven. Furthermore, the proteomic and metabolic analyses are of insufficient depth and/or not analysed thoroughly to its maximum potential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this work, Lesner and colleagues study the effects of mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction at the level of mitochondrial complex I in comparison to complex IV in mouse liver. They report no adverse effects on liver functions in a complex I-deficient mouse model, whereas complex IV deficiency results in decreased liver function. To provide further insight into the mechanisms underlying these different phenotypic outcomes, the authors collect experimental data for alterations in the redox status as well as the proteome and metabolome in complex I- and complex IV-deficient mouse liver. These data generally support the notion that complex I activity is dispensable for liver function. The authors explain this finding by providing evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase as an alternative electron donor to maintain respiratory chain activity. These data add to the field of mitochondrial diseases associated with the dysfunction of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and tissue-specific phenotypes.</p><p>The authors generally present their data in a clear and logical way, which makes the story easy to follow. However, the description of proteomics experiments including LC-MS analysis in Materials and methods is largely incomplete and needs to be fully revised to provide detailed information about sample preparation, protein identification and quantification. In addition, Supplemental Tables for proteomic (and metabolomics) data are insufficient lacking information about gene names, identified peptides per replicate, ratios, calculated p-values etc. Proteomics data should also be deposited to a public database (e.g. PRIDE).</p><p>The authors performed label-free proteomics to investigate changes in the proteome of ndufa9-/- and cox10-/- mice vs. control mice. It should be noted that only less than 1/3 of the proteome was covered and thus they likely missed also some further regulated proteins in their analysis. Since they focus on mitochondrial processes, it is suggested to also analyze mitochondria-enriched fractions. Furthermore, the authors should improve their data presentation. For example, it would be informative to prepare additional plots showing the distribution of individual OXPHOS complexes in ndufa9-/- and cox10-/- liver samples. Do they generally shift to more positive or negative log2 values? In addition, the analysis of OXPHOS complexes by blue native PAGE is recommended to reveal changes in supercomplex formation or assembly states.</p><p>To provide further insight into compensatory effects in cox10-/- livers, GO term (BP, CC, MP) overrepresentation analysis of both downregulated and upregulated proteins should be performed. More specifically, the authors should provide information about the down-regulated proteins other than only complex IV components and upregulated proteins other than mitochondrial components. They should analyze the proteomic data in more detail, including the annotation of upregulated non-mitochondrial and mitochondrial proteins in Figures 2E and 4E. Furthermore, how do the authors explain the more than 2-fold increase in mitochondrial content in cox10-/- livers? It might be of interest to acquire EM or immunofluorescence images on these mouse liver samples.</p><p>Based on GO term enrichment analysis, the authors state that several metabolic pathways were enriched in cox10-/- livers. However, what is missing is a correlation between the observed changes in the proteome and metabolome. Do changes in the levels of specific metabolites result from the up- or down-regulation of proteins of the respective pathways?</p><p>In Figure 5B, quantification of Western blots should be performed and further replicates might likely be needed to make conclusions whether the levels of DHODH do not change in ndufa9-/- mice. In the reviewer's point of view, DHODH levels are slightly increased in liver from ndufa9-/- mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Strengths of the manuscript.</p><p>The fundamental data pillars supporting the authors top-line conclusion are solid â i.e. that liver damage is only apparent in complex IV, but not complex I, knockout adult mice.</p><p>After complex IV knockout the circulating clinical-biomarkers of liver injury (AST/ALT/Bilirubin) are elevated with statistical significance. In agreement, the complex IV knockout livers exhibits marked damage in the pathology assessment. Furthermore, the authors confirm robust changes in the liver proteome and metabolome following complex IV knockout; these effects are commensurate with mitochondrial dysfunction and adaptive stress signalling. Effects of complex I deletion on liver homeostasis are either minor or not detectable within the parameters assessed here; the difference between the effect of deleting complex IV versus complex I is clear and justified by data presented in the manuscript.</p><p>In the context of mitochondrial biology there is general lack of conditional knockout studies in adult mice. Accordingly, this study offers novel and unexpected insights into the relationship between respiratory chain components and hepatic function â the observation that adult mouse liver exhibit greater dependence on complex IV is of notable conceptual advance.</p><p>Weakness of the manuscript.</p><p>The key weakness of the manuscript is the lack of convincing mechanistic rationale for the differential effects of complex IV and complex I knockout on adult mouse liver.</p><p>The authors show that complex I knockout ~fully suppresses respiration (OCR) in freshly isolated hepatocytes (Figure 1C). Because the NADH/NAD+ ratio is unaffected in complex I-knockout livers the authors infer that another enzyme in the respiratory chain (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH)) is catalysing NADH oxidation (to stop NADH accumulation/build-up) â however NADH oxidation by DHODH drives respiration (as depicted in Figure 5A) but Figure 1C shows very clearly that respiration rates are negligible in hepatocytes devoid of complex I activity/expression. Therefore, the authors explicitly show in their own data that respiratory activity is not maintained by DHODH in the absence of complex I.</p><p>Furthermore the authors do not present respiration/OCR data in hepatocytes isolated from complex IV knockout livers; there we cannot assess if hepatic respiration is differentially affected by complex I versus complex IV knockout- if the respiration rates are equivalently affected this would show that liver damage following complex IV deletion are not ascribable to low respiration rates/activity.</p><p>Next, the authors attempt to present data to support their model that DHODH is central to maintaining liver homeostasis in livers devoid of complex I, and treat mice with a small-molecule-inhibitor BRQ (an inhibitor of DHODH). The authors observe changes in the hepatic NADH/NAD+ ratio and interpret this data to support the DHODH model. However, the data is inadequate to support the authors conclusion;</p><p>1) There is already scant respiration in the complex I knockout hepatocytes (DHODH is not compensating for complex I deletion); 2) the authors do not show if BRQ effects respiration in control hepatocytes nor the remnant respiration in hepatocytes from complex I or complex IV livers; 3) whilst BRQ suppresses liver NADH /NAD+ its' impossible to ascribe this pharmacological effect to DHODH-specific inhibition ( it could be an alternative enzyme/target). The authors are not in a position to determine specificity of BRQ to DHODH and to make credible robust mechanistic interpretation; complementary genetic approaches would be required (i.e. showing DHODH knockout in the complex I knockout mouse liver recapitulates the complex IV knockout effect); 4) the authors present no in vivo evidence that BRQ treatment recapitulates the complex IV knockout phenotype â neither circulating markers (ALT/AST/bilirubin) nor pathology are presented.</p><p>Taken together the current model ascribing the lack of liver damage following complex I deletion to DHODH is not justified with existing data.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1) For reasons outlined above the model ascribing the lack of liver damage following complex I deletion to DHODH is not justified with existing data. My recommendation is the data should be withdrawn from the manuscript â otherwise many months of experiments are required to support the possible role of DHODH. However, even without mechanistic insight into why complex IV deletion, but not complex I, exerts liver damage the finding in-itself is of sufficient novelty to justify publication.</p><p>2) Respiration/OCR data from the complex IV knockout hepatocytes is critical to aid data interpretation and provide mechanistic insight â it must be included and contrasted to the OCR in complex I knockout hepatocytes.</p><p>3) Whilst complex IV clearly exerts liver damage (~4x elevation in ALT and AST and histological staining) the level of damage (4-8 weeks after the knockout) is not overly severe and the animals do not undergo acute liver failure. The text and discussion need to better reflect this. Isn't the story here that mouse liver is not absolutely dependent on respiration to maintain function â otherwise we would expect rapid liver failure soon after the complex IV deletion?</p><p>4) Do the authors have data on hepatic ATP levels in absence of complex I and complex IV â both from liver tissue as well as the isolated hepatocytes? Are hepatic ATP levels maintained in both knockout models or is glycolysis maintaining ATP to ~homeostatic levels â the authors have shown respiration is essentially abolished upon complex I deletion, so how is ATP production supported? What is the ECAR in the complex I and complex IV knockout hepatocytes (the authors must have the ECAR data for complex I knockout because the OCR data is presented in figure 1). More generally the text doesn't address or discuss the concept of glycolytic adaptive capability in the absence of respiration.</p><p>5) In places the text is too assertive and not reflective of the data â more nuance and precision is required as to not over-interpret data, for example;</p><p>Page11 â 'The phenotype of cox10-/- livers noted above indicates that the mitochondrial ETC is required for liver homeostasis'.</p><p>How is this justified when the authors have already shown in figure 1 that the complex I knockout hepatocytes exhibit little respiration but liver homeostasis is not measurably effected? Furthermore, the authors do not show the respiration/OCR data in complex IV knockout hepatocytes.</p><p>'Together, these results indicate that complex I is largely dispensable for homeostatic function in the adult mouse liver, without significant metabolic or proteomic compensation'</p><p>Disagree. Respiration is dramatically reduced in complex I knockout hepatocytes â if no major adaption is ongoing how are hepatic ATP levels supported? There is presumably significant adaption to glycolysis and the PPP pathway to preserve ATP levels?</p><p>'Together, these results indicate that complex I is largely dispensable for homeostatic function in the adult mouse liver, without significant metabolic or proteomic compensation'</p><p>The authors have assessed liver health 4 and 8 weeks after complex I (and complex 4) deletion. The text needs to explicitly reflect these two sampling time points. Perhaps complex I knockout would affect hepatic function over a longer period?</p><p>Is 4 weeks knockout the shortest time point the authors have assessed? Maybe there is a transient stress/death response to complex I deletion (liver stress/death (ALT/AST rises)) but the liver is able to adapt to complex I loss and restore homeostasis before the initial 4 week sampling.</p><p>Therefore general statements regarding dispensability of complex I in liver need much greater refinement and nuance.</p><p>6) Complex I knockout livers (Supp figure 1D_ â 'Histological analysis of liver sections revealed no significant pathology, including no evidence of steatosis (Oil Red O staining) or glycogen loss (PAS staining)'.</p><p>They authors say 'significant', would they agree that are some changes in liver pathology (HandE and the Oil red O staining in particular) albeit they are far less severe compared to the cx4 knockout? If they agree the text needs to better reflect this.</p><p>7) Metabolomics for complex I knockout in figure 2 â is this data from 4 or 8 weeks? If its 4 weeks can the authors also show the 8 week data?</p><p>8) It will be helpful to label the charts for metabolites as' liver' or 'circulating' to make data interpretation clearer for reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Lesner and colleagues address the tissue specific phenotype seen in mitochondrial complex I deficiency, the most common cause of paediatric mitochondrial disease. Understanding this problem may lead to more personalised treatment strategies for patients with the disease. The authors leverage mouse models featuring liver specific knockout of complex I subunit Ndufa9 and complex IV assembly factor COX10, previously shown to result in loss of complex I and IV activity respectively. Using a range of classical biochemistry, pathology, proteomics and metabolomic approaches, the authors show that while loss of complex IV leads to severe impacts on cellular redox systems and metabolic compensation as expected, the most telling readout being NAD+/NADH ratio, complex I is not required to maintain metabolically normal mitochondria and livers from these animals are phenotypically similar to controls. Based on accumulation of metabolites in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway in complex IV deficient animals, the authors build a hypothesis that liver mitochondria preferentially utilise DHODH as a primary source of electrons for mitochondrial respiration. DHODH is a key enzyme in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway and an alternate source of electrons for the respiratory chain, effectively bypassing complex I by donating electrons directly to coenzyme Q which are then utilised by complex III (and subsequently passed to complex IV). Using the DHODH inhibitor brequinar the authors are able to generate a severe metabolic defect (the primary readout again NAD+/NADH ratio) in complex I deficient liver, but not controls. The main conclusion is that under normal conditions complex I is not the main entry point of electrons into the mitochondrial respiratory chain in liver, but rather pyrimidine synthesis, possibly supplemented by other sources. It is important to note that the main conclusion of preferential utilisation of pyrimidine synthesis derived electrons is drawn from a single experiment measuring the NAD+/NADH ratio. Additional metabolomic tracer studies using glutamine (and possibly other carbon sources aimed at delineating the other electron sources hinted at by the authors in the discussion) could be used to confirm if there is increased flux through pyrimidine synthesis.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, succinct and experiments are all of the highest quality. I have no major concerns in respect to the first conclusion that complex I deficient livers are phenotypically normal, and the resulting suggestion that complex I is not the major source of electrons for the ETC in liver. My concern is the conclusion that the main source is DHODH. This is drawn from a single (but apparently well controlled, though I'm not an expert on liver physiology) experiment using brequinar, with the NAD+/NADH ratio being the key readout. Increased flux doesn't always equate to changes in enzyme protein level or metabolite pool size, thus it not surprising that DHODH protein and metabolites in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway are not increased in abundance in ndufa9-/- livers. Indeed, except for dihydroorotate and orotate even in the extreme of BRQ treated animals you don't see accumulation of pyrimidine pathway metabolites. The authors should consider ways to measure flux directly, for example tracer studies using 13C-glutamine (or possibly H13CO3) could be used on primary hepatocytes from both knockouts. Inclusion of 13C-glucose would also go some way to addressing the possible increased flux through other pathways, e.g. complex II/TCA suggested by the authors in the discussion.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Differential requirements for mitochondrial electron transport chain components in the adult murine liver&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and agree that the manuscript has significantly improved and is on track to publication after you complete a set of requested modifications to the text mostly for clarity of data presentation and its broad availability for the community.

This is mainly based on the elevation of related proteins and metabolites identified in proteomics and metabolomics data. The evidence for ETFDH is thus still circumstantial so conclusions should be cautious. Based on the tone of the authors in the main text I think they agree, however some of the statements could be softened in the abstract and discussion.</p><p>2) The authors should carefully describe the underpinnings of some of the less common techniques being used within the text narrative. Eg., this is the first time I've seen MR imaging and I felt I was just thrown into the deep end of what it measures. Likewise, the authors don't provide non-experts with sufficient background to understand tracer metabolomics. I also didn't find the schematic in Figure 3A particularly helpful as the use of dots to describe isotopologues doesn't really help the reader interpret the associated bar plots. This could probably be solved by a more detailed figure legend.</p><p>3) Additional points concerning metabolomics:</p><p>â Tracer metabolomics data should be included in the supplement.</p><p>â All metabolomics data should be made available in a public repository (e.g. Metabolomics workbench).</p><p>4) Data has been deposited in PRIDE as requested, however, the methods section in the manuscript requires some further work.</p><p>a) The authors wrote &quot;50 ug per sample of protein homogenate from livers or enriched mitochondria (prepared as described above)&quot;, yet is it not clear which sample preparation steps described above they refer to. The authors should clearly state the steps they performed before they solubilized proteins in SDS/Tris.</p><p>b) The descriptions in the methods section still lack basic information.</p><p>Please add the following parameters to the LC-MS/MS data acquisition section:</p><p>AGC target for MS1 and MS2</p><p>Max IT for MS1 and MS2</p><p>Resolution for MS2</p><p>Isolation window for MS2</p><p>Intensity threshold</p><p>c) The authors wrote, &quot;Fragment and precursor tolerances of 10 ppm and 0.6 Da were specified, and three missed cleavages were allowed&quot;.

Please correct it.</p><p>f) The authors wrote, &quot;Protein abundance was quantitated based on the total ion count for all identified peptides in each sample, and normalized after log transform according to previously published protocols (60)&quot;. The authors should state in the methods section how the normalization was performed (rather than just referring to a paper).</p><p>g) The tables containing proteomics data look better, my additional suggestion would be to:</p><p>1) Add a unique peptide count per replicate (this parameter is more informative than peptide count).</p><p>2) Add a score parameter for protein identification.</p><p>5) Since the proteome coverage in the WCL samples was rather low (2.6-3k proteins, of which only 396-407 are annotated as mitochondrial in MitoCarta3.0), the authors were asked to analyze proteins in isolated mitochondrial fractions. The authors followed the recommendation only for ndufa9-/-, however, they did not do it for cox10-/-.</p><p>The additional analysis they performed yielded quantification data for 738 mitochondrial proteins in isolated mitochondria compared to 396 mitochondrial proteins in WCL samples, which clearly shows an improvement. As the proteomic analysis of isolated mitochondria ndufa9-/- vs ndufa9f/f in fact nearly doubled the number of quantified mitochondrial proteins reported, the authors should also include a similar analysis for the isolated mitochondria cox10-/- vs cox10f/f.</p><p>6) They were asked to perform GO term enrichment analysis for the cox10-/- vs cox10f/f WCL dataset. The authors performed the GO term enrichment analyses separately for mitochondrial and other than mitochondrial proteins, however, both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins may be associated with certain GO terms. The authors should add an additional term enrichment analysis for all the proteins upregulated or downregulated in the cox10-/- vs cox10f/f WCL dataset.</p><p>7) The authors were asked to provide a correlation between the observed changes in the proteome and metabolome in cox10-/- livers. Specifically, they were asked to examine whether changes in the levels of specific metabolites result from the up- or down-regulation of proteins of the respective pathways.</p><p>In response, the authors added Figure 5 âfigure supplement 4 and included a short description in the manuscript. However, no specific examples were presented, e.g. up- or down-regulated level of enzyme A possibly contributed to up- or down-regulated level of metabolite X. Rather than (or in addition to) Figure 5 âfigure supplement 4, another figure or a table linking specific enzymatic activities with metabolites should be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80919.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

They report no adverse effects on liver functions in a complex I-deficient mouse model, whereas complex IV deficiency results in decreased liver function. To provide further insight into the mechanisms underlying these different phenotypic outcomes, the authors collect experimental data for alterations in the redox status as well as the proteome and metabolome in complex I- and complex IV-deficient mouse liver. These data generally support the notion that complex I activity is dispensable for liver function. The authors explain this finding by providing evidence for the involvement of mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase as an alternative electron donor to maintain respiratory chain activity. These data add to the field of mitochondrial diseases associated with the dysfunction of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and tissue-specific phenotypes.</p><p>The authors generally present their data in a clear and logical way, which makes the story easy to follow. However, the description of proteomics experiments including LC-MS analysis in Materials and methods is largely incomplete and needs to be fully revised to provide detailed information about sample preparation, protein identification and quantification. In addition, Supplemental Tables for proteomic (and metabolomics) data are insufficient lacking information about gene names, identified peptides per replicate, ratios, calculated p-values etc. Proteomics data should also be deposited to a public database (e.g. PRIDE).</p></disp-quote><p>Proteomics data is now deposited into PRIDE (identified PXD031716; reviewer account details provided in manuscript). Supplemental Tables have been updated to include the requested information (gene names, peptides per replicate, fold change and p-values). The Methods section has been updated and includes details on sample preparation, details on LCMS instrumentation and peptide identification/quantitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors performed label-free proteomics to investigate changes in the proteome of ndufa9-/- and cox10-/- mice vs. control mice. It should be noted that only less than 1/3 of the proteome was covered and thus they likely missed also some further regulated proteins in their analysis. Since they focus on mitochondrial processes, it is suggested to also analyze mitochondria-enriched fractions. Furthermore, the authors should improve their data presentation. For example, it would be informative to prepare additional plots showing the distribution of individual OXPHOS complexes in ndufa9-/- and cox10-/- liver samples. Do they generally shift to more positive or negative log2 values? In addition, the analysis of OXPHOS complexes by blue native PAGE is recommended to reveal changes in supercomplex formation or assembly states.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions, and have accordingly enhanced our analysis and discussion of the proteomics data. We agree that our analysis is not comprehensive of the complete proteome, and it possible some regulated proteins were missed. We have updated the text to discuss this caveat (lines 174-178). Our goal was not to complete characterize the proteome changes in response to complex I or IV loss, but to examine if the genetically modified livers exhibited signs of adaptation to loss of each mitochondrial ETC component.</p><p>As suggested, we performed proteomics on enriched mitochondrial samples in ndufa9<sup>/-</sup> livers to potentially capture additional regulatory proteins; this analysis is presented in figure 2 âfigure supplement 1, and Table S1. We identified and quantified 738 mitochondrial proteins, which represents ~64% of the mitochondrial proteome. Similar to our whole cell data, we do not observe a large number of changes, complex I components are downregulated, while other complexes are largely maintained (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1, Table S1).</p><p>As suggested, additional plots focusing on individual components of each OXPHOS complex are now provided in Figures 2H, Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1B, and Figure 5H. In ndufa9<sup>-/-</sup> livers, we observe isolated reduction of complex I components, with sparing of protein components from other complexes. In cox10<sup>-/-</sup> livers, we observe isolated reduction of complex IV components, with a general increase in components from other complexes. Thus, it appears that each individual knockout allele specifically affects the abundance of components in the respective complex, without major declines in other complex components.</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion regarding BN-PAGE analysis. The relevance of supercomplex formation in C57BL6 mice is complicated: a mutation in the SCAF1 gene in this genetic background results in reduced assembly of multimeric cIV-containing supercomplexes (PMID 26928661, 23812712). As a result, it has been proposed that there are fewer supercomplexes and/or cIV-containing supercomplexes in this background. Weâve done some preliminary BN-PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) which is consistent with this interpretation: Loss of cox10 or ndufa9 results in loss of the individual respective complexes, loss of the I+III<sub>2</sub>+IV<sub>1</sub> supercomplex; while cox10<sup>-/-</sup> livers retain a I+III<sub>2</sub>+II<sub>n</sub> supercomplex.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>BN-PAGE analysis to analyze ETC complexes and supercomplexes from murine liver lysate.</title><p>(A) BN-PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining, of isolated mitochondria extracted with 5g/g digitonin/protein ratio. 50mg of protein per lane were assessed by BN-PAGE, and bands are annotated based on previously published data (PMID 26928661).

Specifically, by not participating in supercomplexes, cIV may be âfreedâ and therefore available to accept electrons from alternative donors (e.g., succinate, fatty acids/ETF, dihydroorotate, etc.). A detailed analysis of cIV-containing supercomplexes in this genetic background and others, combined with an analysis of the requirement for hepatic ndufa9 in the setting of modulating SCAF1 status would be required to fully address this question. We propose that this be addressed in future work. We have amended our discussion to address this caveat (lines 456-467).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To provide further insight into compensatory effects in cox10-/- livers, GO term (BP, CC, MP) overrepresentation analysis of both downregulated and upregulated proteins should be performed. More specifically, the authors should provide information about the down-regulated proteins other than only complex IV components and upregulated proteins other than mitochondrial components. They should analyze the proteomic data in more detail, including the annotation of upregulated non-mitochondrial and mitochondrial proteins in Figures 2E and 4E.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the manuscript to included additional analysis and discussion of our proteomic data according to these suggestions. All significant non-mitochondrial and mitochondrial proteins are annotated in Figure 2G; and we have annotated a number of nonmitochondrial and mitochondrial proteins in Figure 5G.

We have included immunofluorescence analysis by staining for the mitochondrial protein Tomm20 (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2; Figure 5 âfigure supplement 5) which did not reveal significant alterations in ndufa9-depeleted livers, but increased mitochondrial content in cox10-depleted livers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on GO term enrichment analysis, the authors state that several metabolic pathways were enriched in cox10-/- livers.

In agreement, the complex IV knockout livers exhibits marked damage in the pathology assessment. Furthermore, the authors confirm robust changes in the liver proteome and metabolome following complex IV knockout; these effects are commensurate with mitochondrial dysfunction and adaptive stress signalling. Effects of complex I deletion on liver homeostasis are either minor or not detectable within the parameters assessed here; the difference between the effect of deleting complex IV versus complex I is clear and justified by data presented in the manuscript.</p><p>In the context of mitochondrial biology there is general lack of conditional knockout studies in adult mice. Accordingly, this study offers novel and unexpected insights into the relationship between respiratory chain components and hepatic function â the observation that adult mouse liver exhibit greater dependence on complex IV is of notable conceptual advance.</p><p>Weakness of the manuscript.</p><p>The key weakness of the manuscript is the lack of convincing mechanistic rationale for the differential effects of complex IV and complex I knockout on adult mouse liver.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our manuscript does not completely reconcile the differential effects between complex I and complex IV, and have expanded our discussion to comment on this point. Complex I serves as a single potential entry point into the ETC, while complex IV is expected to accept electrons from all potential electron donors. Thus, our findings are most consistent with a model in which cI is not the major source of electrons in the hepatic ETC. As suggested below, weâve simplified our analysis and discussion to reflect this, and removed data reflecting DHODH activity. At this point, our data suggests the hypothesis that ETFDH is a significant electron donor to the hepatic ETC. This is based on the buildup of glutarate and acyl-carnitines, as well as the similarities in phenotypes between animals/patients with cIV defects and animals/patients with ETFDH defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that complex I knockout ~fully suppresses respiration (OCR) in freshly isolated hepatocytes (Figure 1C). Because the NADH/NAD+ ratio is unaffected in complex I-knockout livers the authors infer that another enzyme in the respiratory chain (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH)) is catalysing NADH oxidation (to stop NADH accumulation/build-up) â however NADH oxidation by DHODH drives respiration (as depicted in Figure 5A) but Figure 1C shows very clearly that respiration rates are negligible in hepatocytes devoid of complex I activity/expression. Therefore, the authors explicitly show in their own data that respiratory activity is not maintained by DHODH in the absence of complex I.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. In our initial manuscript, the oxygen consumption measurements from in vitro cultured hepatocytes was meant as a corollary for measuring complex I function. We have now replaced this data with direct measurements of complex I activity in liver lysates (Figure 1C). The major conclusion is that removal of ndufa9 does remove complex I activity in vivo.</p><p>More generally, when hepatocytes (or most cell lines) are cultured in high glucose media (as in our previous Figure 1C), the observed respiration is primarily driven by complex I. Whether this represents the âin vivoâ scenario is the major investigative point of this study. To avoid further confusion, we have removed all primary hepatocyte data from this manuscript and focuse on in vivo investigations.</p><p>Assessing hepatic respiratory function in vivo would allow us to assess the relevance of complex I or complex IV to oxygen consumption â however, O2 flux measurements in vivo are not developed. To address this, we have added new experiments and data in which we perform in vivo MR imaging in the livers of mice in order to assess oxygen status. Ndufa9-/- livers are indistinguishable from wild-type livers in these experiments (Figure 3E-K), indicating no significant deficit in oxygen consumption when complex I is removed. In contrast, we observe elevated oxygen levels in complex IV-deficient livers (Figure 6A-F), indicating that oxygen consumption is impaired in cox10-/- livers. Together, these data indicate that the mitochondrial ETC is required to maintaining oxygen levels in vivo; however, complex I is not required, suggesting that an alternative electron donor is feeding the mitochondrial ETC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore the authors do not present respiration/OCR data in hepatocytes isolated from complex IV knockout livers; there we cannot assess if hepatic respiration is differentially affected by complex I versus complex IV knockout- if the respiration rates are equivalently affected this would show that liver damage following complex IV deletion are not ascribable to low respiration rates/activity.</p></disp-quote><p>See comments above for more detail. Briefly, we have removed cultured hepatocyte data to remove confusion between the in vitro and in vivo situation. We now provide an assessment of oxygen status in cox10-/- livers (Figure 6A-F), to assess the role of complex IV in oxygen consumption in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, the authors attempt to present data to support their model that DHODH is central to maintaining liver homeostasis in livers devoid of complex I, and treat mice with a small-molecule-inhibitor BRQ (an inhibitor of DHODH). The authors observe changes in the hepatic NADH/NAD+ ratio and interpret this data to support the DHODH model. However, the data is inadequate to support the authors conclusion;</p><p>1) There is already scant respiration in the complex I knockout hepatocytes (DHODH is not compensating for complex I deletion); 2) the authors do not show if BRQ effects respiration in control hepatocytes nor the remnant respiration in hepatocytes from complex I or complex IV livers; 3) whilst BRQ suppresses liver NADH /NAD+ its' impossible to ascribe this pharmacological effect to DHODH-specific inhibition ( it could be an alternative enzyme/target). The authors are not in a position to determine specificity of BRQ to DHODH and to make credible robust mechanistic interpretation; complementary genetic approaches would be required (i.e. showing DHODH knockout in the complex I knockout mouse liver recapitulates the complex IV knockout effect); 4) the authors present no in vivo evidence that BRQ treatment recapitulates the complex IV knockout phenotype â neither circulating markers (ALT/AST/bilirubin) nor pathology are presented.</p><p>Taken together the current model ascribing the lack of liver damage following complex I deletion to DHODH is not justified with existing data.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with these comments, and as suggested below, we have revised the manuscript to remove the emphasis on DHODH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1) For reasons outlined above the model ascribing the lack of liver damage following complex I deletion to DHODH is not justified with existing data. My recommendation is the data should be withdrawn from the manuscript â otherwise many months of experiments are required to support the possible role of DHODH. However, even without mechanistic insight into why complex IV deletion, but not complex I, exerts liver damage the finding in-itself is of sufficient novelty to justify publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have removed this data from the manuscript.

Isn't the story here that mouse liver is not absolutely dependent on respiration to maintain function â otherwise we would expect rapid liver failure soon after the complex IV deletion?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree; it is surprising that these mice are not dependent on either complex I or complex IV for survival. We have amended our text to discuss this point (lines 429-431).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do the authors have data on hepatic ATP levels in absence of complex I and complex IV â both from liver tissue as well as the isolated hepatocytes? Are hepatic ATP levels maintained in both knockout models or is glycolysis maintaining ATP to ~homeostatic levels â the authors have shown respiration is essentially abolished upon complex I deletion, so how is ATP production supported? What is the ECAR in the complex I and complex IV knockout hepatocytes (the authors must have the ECAR data for complex I knockout because the OCR data is presented in figure 1). More generally the text doesn't address or discuss the concept of glycolytic adaptive capability in the absence of respiration.</p></disp-quote><p>We have examined hepatic ATP levels, and find no significant differences in complex I or complex IV livers (provided in Figure 2A and Figure 5A), suggesting that the mitochondrial ETC is not absolutely required to maintain steady state energy levels.

In addition, we do not observe upregulation of the glycolytic pathway in response to ndufa9 or cox10 removal based on gene ontology analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In places the text is too assertive and not reflective of the data â more nuance and precision is required as to not over-interpret data, for example;</p><p>Page11 â 'The phenotype of cox10-/- livers noted above indicates that the mitochondrial ETC is required for liver homeostasis'.</p><p>How is this justified when the authors have already shown in figure 1 that the complex I knockout hepatocytes exhibit little respiration but liver homeostasis is not measurably effected? Furthermore, the authors do not show the respiration/OCR data in complex IV knockout hepatocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>See comments above for clarification with respect to hepatocyte data, and we have adjusted the text accordingly to point out caveats in our interpretation.

Understanding this problem may lead to more personalised treatment strategies for patients with the disease. The authors leverage mouse models featuring liver specific knockout of complex I subunit Ndufa9 and complex IV assembly factor COX10, previously shown to result in loss of complex I and IV activity respectively. Using a range of classical biochemistry, pathology, proteomics and metabolomic approaches, the authors show that while loss of complex IV leads to severe impacts on cellular redox systems and metabolic compensation as expected, the most telling readout being NAD+/NADH ratio, complex I is not required to maintain metabolically normal mitochondria and livers from these animals are phenotypically similar to controls. Based on accumulation of metabolites in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway in complex IV deficient animals, the authors build a hypothesis that liver mitochondria preferentially utilise DHODH as a primary source of electrons for mitochondrial respiration. DHODH is a key enzyme in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway and an alternate source of electrons for the respiratory chain, effectively bypassing complex I by donating electrons directly to coenzyme Q which are then utilised by complex III (and subsequently passed to complex IV). Using the DHODH inhibitor brequinar the authors are able to generate a severe metabolic defect (the primary readout again NAD+/NADH ratio) in complex I deficient liver, but not controls. The main conclusion is that under normal conditions complex I is not the main entry point of electrons into the mitochondrial respiratory chain in liver, but rather pyrimidine synthesis, possibly supplemented by other sources. It is important to note that the main conclusion of preferential utilisation of pyrimidine synthesis derived electrons is drawn from a single experiment measuring the NAD+/NADH ratio. Additional metabolomic tracer studies using glutamine (and possibly other carbon sources aimed at delineating the other electron sources hinted at by the authors in the discussion) could be used to confirm if there is increased flux through pyrimidine synthesis.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, succinct and experiments are all of the highest quality. I have no major concerns in respect to the first conclusion that complex I deficient livers are phenotypically normal, and the resulting suggestion that complex I is not the major source of electrons for the ETC in liver. My concern is the conclusion that the main source is DHODH. This is drawn from a single (but apparently well controlled, though I'm not an expert on liver physiology) experiment using brequinar, with the NAD+/NADH ratio being the key readout. Increased flux doesn't always equate to changes in enzyme protein level or metabolite pool size, thus it not surprising that DHODH protein and metabolites in the pyrimidine synthesis pathway are not increased in abundance in ndufa9-/- livers. Indeed, except for dihydroorotate and orotate even in the extreme of BRQ treated animals you don't see accumulation of pyrimidine pathway metabolites. The authors should consider ways to measure flux directly, for example tracer studies using 13C-glutamine (or possibly H13CO3) could be used on primary hepatocytes from both knockouts. Inclusion of 13C-glucose would also go some way to addressing the possible increased flux through other pathways, e.g. complex II/TCA suggested by the authors in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment and agree that our experiments do not indicate DHODH is the major electron source. Based on comments from all 3 reviewers, we have removed this data, and clarified our interpretation. In particular, we hypothesize that fatty acids and ETFDH may be a major electron source, via contributions from fatty acids and amino acids. This is because in complex IV-deficient livers, we do not observe a buildup of succinate or dihydo-orotate or glycerol-3-phosphate, and we do not observe changes in glucose handling based on [U-13C]glucose tracing (Figure 6G-K). However, we do observe a significant increase in long chain acyl-carnitine species, suggesting a significant defect in fatty acid oxidation. Consistent with this interpretation, we observe decreased Î±-hydroxybutyrate levels and significant increases in glutarate levels. Interestingly, mice and humans suffering from ETF deficiency exhibit similar metabolic, histological and functional deficits in the liver. Thus, we propose that ETF serves as a major electron source to the mitochondrial ETC, which alleviates a dependence on complex I. Future experiments to trace flux through ETF will be necessary to examine this model in depth, and we have amended our discussion to include this point (lines 437-443).</p><p>As discussed above, we have removed experiments with cultured hepatocytes to avoid confusion between the in vivo and in vitro scenarios. Briefly, we find that culturing hepatocytes in high glucose results in their dependence on complex I for respiratory function. To avoid this potential discrepancy between experimental setups, we have added data assessing oxygen consumption by MR imaging (Figure 3E-K, Figure 6A-F) in vivo, as well as in vivo [U-13C]glucose tracing (Figure 3B-D, Figure 6G-I).</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the revised manuscript the authors hypothesize that ETFDH is the major electron donor in the liver. This is mainly based on the elevation of related proteins and metabolites identified in proteomics and metabolomics data. The evidence for ETFDH is thus still circumstantial so conclusions should be cautious. Based on the tone of the authors in the main text I think they agree, however some of the statements could be softened in the abstract and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the role of ETFDH as the major electron donor is still circumstantial, as it is difficult to directly determine the flux of electrons into the ETC in an in vivo context. As suggested, we have modified the text in the abstract and discussion, please see lines 45-46 (sentence removed) and lines 525-526 (sentence removed). In the discussion, we have stated that our steady-state measurements do not directly inform on flux through fatty acid oxidation / ETFDH pathways, and future experiments will be necessary (lines 512-514).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should carefully describe the underpinnings of some of the less common techniques being used within the text narrative. Eg., this is the first time I've seen MR imaging and I felt I was just thrown into the deep end of what it measures. Likewise, the authors don't provide non-experts with sufficient background to understand tracer metabolomics. I also didn't find the schematic in Figure 3A particularly helpful as the use of dots to describe isotopologues doesn't really help the reader interpret the associated bar plots. This could probably be solved by a more detailed figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have modified the text to include an additional description of the MR imaging experiments, geared towards non-experts; please see lines 229-249. In addition, we have updated our description of the tracer experiments to provide additional clarity for non-experts (lines 207-215).</p><p>We apologize for the confusion with respect to figure 3A. In our original figure, the colored (red) dots referred to the fate of heavy label atoms from [U-<sup>13</sup>C]glucose labeling. However, considering the significant amount of scrambling of labels that occurs in vivo, we chose to plot the total labeled fraction in Figure 3D, which sums the contributions from all individual isotopologues with at least one labeled carbon. We have modified the figure 3A to remove indicators of heavy labeled carbons, and it now simply summarizes some of the potential fates of glucose and lactate as they enter a hepatocyte.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional points concerning metabolomics:</p><p>â Tracer metabolomics data should be included in the supplement.</p><p>â All metabolomics data should be made available in a public repository (e.g. Metabolomics workbench).</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Supplementary files 1 and 2 to include tracer metabolomics data.</p><p>All metabolomics data has been deposited into Metabolomics workbench; accession codes are provided within the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Data has been deposited in PRIDE as requested, however, the methods section in the manuscript requires some further work.</p><p>a) The authors wrote &quot;50 ug per sample of protein homogenate from livers or enriched mitochondria (prepared as described above)&quot;, yet is it not clear which sample preparation steps described above they refer to.

We note that several components of complex IV are downregulated in cox10-/- livers, consistent with destabilization of complex IV. Components of other ETC components are spared or slightly unregulated. We note that there are a number of other changes in the mitochondrial proteome of cox10-/- livers, including downregulation of some fatty acid related proteins, and upregulation of proteins related to ubiquinol homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) They were asked to perform GO term enrichment analysis for the cox10-/- vs cox10f/f WCL dataset. The authors performed the GO term enrichment analyses separately for mitochondrial and other than mitochondrial proteins, however, both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins may be associated with certain GO terms. The authors should add an additional term enrichment analysis for all the proteins upregulated or downregulated in the cox10-/- vs cox10f/f WCL dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. In the previous version of the manuscript, we did perform GO term enrichment analysis for all up or down-regulated proteins, as well as non-mitochondrial proteins separately.

Specifically, they were asked to examine whether changes in the levels of specific metabolites result from the up- or down-regulation of proteins of the respective pathways.</p><p>In response, the authors added Figure 5 âfigure supplement 4 and included a short description in the manuscript. However, no specific examples were presented, e.g. up- or down-regulated level of enzyme A possibly contributed to up- or down-regulated level of metabolite X. Rather than (or in addition to) Figure 5 âfigure supplement 4, another figure or a table linking specific enzymatic activities with metabolites should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have supplemented the previous analysis with a pathway specific analysis focusing on metabolic enzymes and the metabolites they produce/consume. These diagrams are provided now in Figure 5 âfigure supplement 5,6,7. We have expanded our text to include a discussion of these results (lines 371-427).</p><p>To summarize briefly, we find that fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation enzymes are largely changing in the opposite directions as would be expected for an increase in acyl-carnitine species (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 5), and we suspect that the buildup of acyl-carnitine species is instead due to a direct inhibition of fatty acid oxidation secondary to loss of complex IV. For bile acid species, the majority of direct bile-acid metabolizing enzymes were not detectable in our dataset (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 6). For electron carriers, we did observe some interesting trends: While the precise reasons for decreases in electron carrier abundance is not clear at this stage, there were some instances were consuming enzymes were upregulated (e.g., for pyruvate, Î±-hydroxybutyrate), or synthesis / recycling enzymes were downregulated (e.g., for Î±-hydroxybutyrate, tetrahydrobiopterin).</p></body></sub-article></article>
