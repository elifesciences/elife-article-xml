Imprinted genes are highly expressed in the pituitary gland, among them, <italic>Dlk1</italic>, a paternally expressed gene whose membrane-bound and secreted protein products can regulate proliferation and differentiation of multiple stem cell populations. Dosage of circulating DLK1 has been previously implicated in the control of growth through unknown molecular mechanisms. Here we generate a series of mouse genetic models to modify levels of <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression in the pituitary gland and demonstrate that the dosage of DLK1 modulates the process of stem cell commitment with lifelong impact on pituitary gland size. We establish that stem cells are a critical source of DLK1, where embryonic disruption alters proliferation in the anterior pituitary, leading to long-lasting consequences on growth hormone secretion later in life.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>imprinting</kwd><kwd>pituitary gland</kwd><kwd>Dlk1</kwd><kwd>growth hormone</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>Sox2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L002345/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Charalambous</surname><given-names>Marika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R022836/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scagliotti</surname><given-names>Valeria</given-names></name><name><surname>Marinelli</surname><given-names>Eugenia</given-names></name><name><surname>Charalambous</surname><given-names>Marika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/T012153/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andoniadou</surname><given-names>Cynthia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Merck Healthcare KGaA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GGI 2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scagliotti</surname><given-names>Valeria</given-names></name><name><surname>Vignola</surname><given-names>Maria Lillina</given-names></name><name><surname>Charalambous</surname><given-names>Marika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000382</institution-id><institution>Society for Endocrinology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ECR Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004941</institution-id><institution>Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BRC-NIHR PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vignola</surname><given-names>Maria Lillina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009360</institution-id><institution>King's College London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>&quot;Cell Therapies and Regenerative Medicine&quot;

This process is complex and depends on the balance of proliferation/differentiation and apoptosis during development, during which the eventual size is attained. Following this, stem cells must repopulate the differentiated cells to maintain a stereotypical number. In some cases, organ size and cell composition can change dependent upon the life-cycle stage of the organism, or in response to the environment. The mammalian anterior pituitary gland (AP) is a master endocrine organ that integrates hypothalamic and peripheral cues to drive the release of circulating hormones. Life events such as stress, puberty, and pregnancy-lactation cause remodelling of the AP to allow appropriate levels of hormone production, and changes in cell number and gland size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perez-Castro et al., 2012</xref>). Since the stem cell capacity of SRY-related HMG-box 2 expressing (SOX2+) tissue-resident pituitary stem cells (PSCs) was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andoniadou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rizzoti et al., 2013</xref>), many teams have integrated knowledge of developmental signalling pathways with information about their determination and maintenance (reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Russell et al., 2018</xref>]). Importantly, the SOX2+ compartment acts not only as a source of cellular progenitors, but also in postnatal life directs the expansion of more committed cells by the production of paracrine signals, including WNT ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Russell et al., 2021</xref>). Due to these recent advances, the AP is an excellent system in which to study the fundamental process of organ size determination and homeostasis.</p><p>Imprinted genes are key determinants of body size in mammals, acting during early life to modulate growth and differentiation pathways (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tucci et al., 2019</xref>]). They represent ~100 transcripts in mammalian species that are epigenetically regulated such that only a single parental copy is expressed and the other silenced by a mechanism utilising DNA methylation. Imprinted gene functions converge on a small number of biological processes – neurobiology, placentation, and growth (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tucci et al., 2019</xref>]). We and others have shown that maintaining imprinted gene expression dosage within a narrow range is key to attaining the balance of growth to organ maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charalambous et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plagge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsai et al., 2002</xref>). We recently noted that imprinted gene expression is enriched in the developing and postnatal pituitary gland, and we proposed that mis-regulation of gene dosage may underlie many of the endocrine features of human imprinting disorders including Silver Russell and Prader Willi Syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scagliotti et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, a previously identified co-regulated subset of these genes, known as the imprinted gene network (IGN, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Varrault et al., 2006</xref>]), are co-expressed and represent some of the most abundant transcripts in the developing pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scagliotti et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Delta-like homologue 1 (<italic>Dlk1</italic>), a paternally expressed imprinted gene on mouse chromosome 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmidt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takada et al., 2000</xref>), is a member of the IGN. The syntenic area on human chromosome 14 is the critical region for Temple Syndrome, and loss of <italic>DLK1</italic> expression is thought to cause phenotypes associated with this disorder; pre-and postnatal growth restriction with increased truncal obesity and precocious puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ioannides et al., 2014</xref>). Alternative splicing of <italic>Dlk1</italic> results in several protein variants that have important functional differences. Full-length <italic>Dlk1</italic> encodes an ~60 kD protein that may be cleaved by the TACE protease ADAM17 at the extracellular cell surface to release soluble DLK1 into the circulation. Alternative splicing events skip the ADAM17 recognition site, resulting in a transmembrane form of DLK1 which cannot be cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smas et al., 1997</xref>). The signalling pathway by which DLK1 acts has yet to be elucidated. <italic>Dlk1</italic> encodes a protein with high sequence similarity to the NOTCH ligand Delta, but it lacks the DSL domain critically required for NOTCH interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smas and Sul, 1993</xref>).</p><p>DLK1 is expressed in several progenitor cell populations where its expression is associated with the self-renewal to differentiation transition (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sul, 2009</xref>]). For example, addition of soluble DLK1 to cultured preadipocytes results in failure of these cells to differentiate into adipocytes whereas deletion of this gene causes premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smas and Sul, 1993</xref>). In the context of the postnatal neurogenic niche, the expression dosage of both membrane-bound and secreted DLK1 regulates the rate of self-renewal of the SOX2+ neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferrón et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In mice, <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression is first detected from mid-gestation in a variety of mesodermal and neuroendocrine cell types, including the developing pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">da Rocha et al., 2007</xref>). After birth <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression is rapidly reduced, serum levels fall, and expression becomes restricted to a limited number of cell types including some neurons, adrenal and AP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sul, 2009</xref>). In adult humans, <italic>DLK1</italic> is expressed in Growth Hormone (GH)-producing somatotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsen et al., 1996</xref>). We and others have shown that <italic>Dlk1</italic> knockout mice are small with reduced GH production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puertas-Avendaño et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cleaton et al., 2016</xref>). However, <italic>Gh</italic> mRNA is not reduced following a conditional ablation of <italic>Dlk1</italic> in mature somatotrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Appelbe et al., 2013</xref>). We previously demonstrated that serum GH levels are elevated in mice that overexpress <italic>Dlk1</italic> from endogenous control elements at 6 months of age and that their GH levels fall less markedly following high-fat diet feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charalambous et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, pregnant dams lacking circulating DLK1 in pregnancy have a blunted increase in pregnancy-associated GH production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cleaton et al., 2016</xref>). These data led us to hypothesise that DLK1 dosage modulates the size of the GH reserve at critical life stages, and prompted us to investigate the molecular mechanism further.</p><p>Here, we manipulate <italic>Dlk1</italic> gene dosage in mice using both knock out and overexpression models. We show that <italic>Dlk1</italic> dosage regulates AP size independently of whole body weight, suggesting an autocrine/paracrine role for the product of this gene. Loss of <italic>Dlk1</italic> function leads to reduced AP volume by acting in a discrete developmental window to shift the balance of stem cell replication/commitment, by mediating the sensitivity of progenitor cells to the WNT pathway. Finally, increased <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression dosage increases the SOX2+ stem cell compartment, influencing organ expansion throughout the life course and increases the rate of postnatal replication in committed cells. This indicates that DLK1 may act postnatally to mediate paracrine signals between the stem and committed cell compartment of the AP. Overall, we conclude that <italic>Dlk1</italic> dosage determines pituitary size and postnatal stem cell homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increasing the expression dosage of Dlk1 causes pituitary volume expansion without tumorigenesis</title><p>We previously demonstrated that adult GH was elevated in a transgenic model where extra copies of the <italic>Dlk1</italic> gene are introduced in the context of a 70 kb bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC, TG<sup>Dlk1-70C</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charalambous et al., 2014</xref>). This transgene drives gene expression in a similar temporal and tissue-specific pattern to the endogenous gene, but imprinting is not maintained due to lack of inclusion of the imprinting control region for the chromosome 12 cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">da Rocha et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

There was a concomitant increase in the proportion of cells expressing the lineage marker POU1F1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and G</xref>). Several molecular signalling pathways have been proposed to regulate the emergence of the POU1F1 lineage including NOTCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>) and WNT pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Potok et al., 2008</xref>;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olson et al., 2006</xref>).

These data suggested that DLK1 produced by marginal zone stem cells and parenchymal cells, might act in concert to promote postnatal proliferation. We consistently observed that WT-TG mice have elevated parenchymal proliferation at P14, the time of maximal expansion of the committed cells prior to puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taniguchi et al., 2001</xref>). This increase in proliferation was not observed in the PAT-TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>).

The increase in the GH reserve can be explained by data presented in this study, since adult TG<sup>Dlk1-70C</sup> mice have a hyperplastic pituitary gland associated with a~40% increase in the size of the somatotroph population. We did not observe an increase in linear growth in the WT-TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This may be explained by the timing of AP volume expansion, which occurs in the third postnatal week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In mice, the majority of GH action on linear growth occurs prior to P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lupu et al., 2001</xref>). While we did observe increased circulating GH in WT-TG animals at P21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), this may have been too late to promote the pre-pubertal growth spurt. Moreover, growth signalling by GH requires regulated pulsatile secretion of the hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), generated by the homotypic somatotroph cell network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnefont et al., 2005</xref>). Future work could investigate how DLK1 dosage-mediated alterations in cell number influences the integrity of this network. In contrast to a role in growth, we have observed that <italic>Dlk1</italic> dosage is elevated during life periods when enhanced peripheral lipid oxidation is beneficial for survival; during suckling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charalambous et al., 2012</xref>) and in the mother during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cleaton et al., 2016</xref>). These are periods of life when lipogenesis may be inhibited and tissue fatty acid (FA) oxidation promoted to spare scarce glucose for growth. We speculate that imprinting may be acting on DLK1 dosage to modulate the GH axis and shift the metabolic mode of the organism toward peripheral FA oxidation and away from lipid storage. Therefore, disruption of DLK1 dosage has important consequences for energy homeostasis and metabolic disease.</p><p><italic>Dlk1</italic> imprinting is maintained in several embryonic cell populations that take part in the formation of the mature anterior pituitary gland. The endogenous gene is expressed exclusively from the paternally-inherited allele in the ventral diencephalon and in developing Rathke’s pouch at E10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), then in the SOX2+ progenitor populations in mid-late gestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As development proceeds, the proportion of DLK1+ SOX2+ cells decreases to approximately 10% of all stem cells in the mature gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Concomitantly, expression of <italic>Dlk1</italic> initiates in committed cells of the parenchyma from their appearance at ~E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and is maintained in hormone producing cells, being particularly abundant in cells of the POU1F1 lineage, somatotrophs (GH+/DLK1+=93% of all GH+), lactotrophs (PRL+/DLK1+=37% of all PRL+), and thyrotrophs (TSH+/DLK1+=40% of all TSH+, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Indeed, DLK1 shares considerable overlap with POU1F1 in late gestation and may be a direct target of this transcription factor, since three experimentally validated POU1F1 binding sites are located within 120 kb of the <italic>Dlk1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skowronska-Krawczyk et al., 2014</xref>). Additional experiments, such as measurement of <italic>Dlk1</italic> levels in <italic>Pou1f1</italic>-deleted mice, or targeted deletion of the putative POU1F1 binding sites at the <italic>Dlk1</italic> locus would be required to definitively establish this finding. <italic>Dlk1</italic> may be part of an autoregulatory feedback loop since, at least in vitro, expression of <italic>Dlk1</italic> represses the action of POU1F1 on the <italic>Gh</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ansell et al., 2007</xref>). The expression pattern of <italic>Dlk1</italic> in the progenitor compartment mirrors that of other imprinted genes in the ‘Imprinted Growth Network, IGN’, such as <italic>Igf2</italic>, <italic>Cdkn1c,</italic> and <italic>Grb10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scagliotti et al., 2021</xref>). These genes have been suggested to comprise the hub of a core pathway that regulates embryonic growth and is progressively deactivated in the perinatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Varrault et al., 2006</xref>). The retention of <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression in a small proportion of SOX2+ stem cells in adults suggests heterogeneity of this population, and that a small number of cells retain an embryonic progenitor cell-like phenotype. Well powered analysis of single-cell sequencing datasets of the PSC population over the life course will be required to validate this assertion.</p><p>We observed a profound reduction in the volume of the anterior pituitary gland (40–50%) of <italic>Dlk1</italic>-deficient animals at E13.5, before we observed any change in overall body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic>Dlk1</italic> is expressed at very high levels in the developing AP compared to other embryonic tissues (compare for example the AP expression with cartilage at E15.5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The relative volume of the <italic>Dlk1</italic>-deficient AP is maintained at ~40–50% WT levels until the third postnatal week, when there appears to be some catch-up in volume. Importantly and in contrast to the total body weight, addition of the TG<sup>Dlk1-70C</sup> transgene does not consistently rescue pituitary volume in <italic>Dlk1</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data indicate that loss of <italic>Dlk1</italic> in the SOX2+ progenitors in the early RP causes a persistent reduction to AP volume. Consistently, we observed a transient reduction in proliferation of the RP progenitor population at E13.5. This was associated with an increase in the size of the nascent POU1F1+population, cells which have recently left the dorsal proliferative zone and started along the lineage commitment pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and G</xref>). Consistently, the expression of a terminal hormonal marker of the POU1F1 lineage, GH, was observed earlier in <italic>Dlk1</italic>-deficient animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). SOX2+ progenitor cell cycle exit is regulated by multiple signalling pathways including the NOTCH and WNT/β-catenin pathways. HES1 is a major downstream transcriptional target of NOTCH in the developing pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goto et al., 2015</xref>). Despite robust nuclear expression of HES1 in the RP at E13.5, we saw no difference in the proportion of HES1+ cells between genotypes, suggesting that NOTCH signalling perturbation at this stage is not responsible for pituitary volume reduction in <italic>Dlk1</italic>-deleted embryos. Whether DLK1 is a direct inhibitor of NOTCH signalling is still unresolved, since while some have reported biochemical interactions between DLK1 and NOTCH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baladrón et al., 2005</xref>), others have failed to co-immunoprecipitate the two proteins in a biologically relevant context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We observed that the expression downstream targets of WNT/β-catenin signalling, <italic>Lef1</italic> and <italic>Axin2</italic>, were increased in expression domain and intensity in PATs. Exit from the proliferating progenitor pool for commitment to the POU1F1 lineage is regulated by an interplay between the transcription factor Prophet of PIT1 (PROP1) and β-catenin binding to and activating the POU1F1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olson et al., 2006</xref>). Increased activation of β-catenin targets in <italic>Dlk1</italic>-depleted embryos suggests that the normal function of DLK1 may be to act to either reduce WNT production or reduce the sensitivity of cells to the WNT pathway.</p><p>The expression of <italic>Dlk1</italic> in both the stem cell and mature hormone-producing compartment of the pituitary gland is perplexing, since it suggests an interaction between DLK1 expression in the progenitor compartment and in the niche. A precedent for this lies in the postnatal neuronal subventricular zone, where DLK1 expression is required in both the stem cells and in niche astrocytes to maintain adult stem cell potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferrón et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we observed that the postnatal WT-TG AP was expanded in volume compared to WT littermates, driven by increased proliferation of the parenchymal cells in the second postnatal week. A similar volume expansion was not observed when PAT-TG animals were compared to PAT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). These data suggest that excess <italic>Dlk1</italic> can promote pituitary hypertrophy, but only if DLK1 is expressed in the SOX2+ compartment when dosage is increased in the parenchyma. Intriguingly, the increase in cell division mediated by excess DLK1 at P14 is in the parenchyma, and therefore DLK1 is not acting cell autonomously in stem cells to promote proliferation, yet SOX2+ DLK1+ cells are required for volume expansion. This suggests that the SOX2+ DLK1+ cells may produce a signal that promotes parenchymal proliferation, analogous to previous data where we demonstrated that the postnatal stem cells promote committed cell proliferation by a WNT-mediated pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Russell et al., 2021</xref>). We speculate that DLK1 production from stem cells might comprise part of this paracrine signalling system that is required for the size regulation of the mature pituitary gland. In concert, increased expression of DLK1 in the parenchyma might alter the sensitivity of cells to proliferative signals.</p><p>Finally, we observed that the SOX2+ stem cell compartment was expanded in the WT-TG but not PAT-TG postnatal and adult pituitary gland. This increase in stem cell number may be a result of ‘sparing’ of stem cell proliferation earlier in development, since WT-TG pituitaries have significantly fewer dividing cells in the marginal zone at P7. Regardless, the overall effect of increased DLK1 dosage is to increase overall AP volume and increase the size of the stem cell population.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that DLK1 is an important determinant of anterior pituitary size, and acts at multiple stages of development to modulate proliferative populations.

Briefly, the pituitary was exhaustively sectioned then sections were collected at regular, non-overlapping intervals throughout the gland from a random starting point and stained with H&amp;E. Images of each H&amp;E-stained section were acquired using a NanoZoomer HT (Hamamatsu) and processed using NDP.view2 software (Hamamatsu) to calculate the pituitary cross sectional area (CSA) at least 20 times per pituitary, which was then converted to volume. Samples were blinded prior to counting. Estimating total cell number: For each animal the maximal CSA was determined from the volumetric analysis above. At this level 3 independent sections were used to measure anterior pituitary CSA and count haemotoxylin-stained nuclei (using the cell detection tool in QuPath v0.3.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bankhead et al., 2017</xref>], standard Hematoxylin OD settings except with threshold intensity set to 0.05), giving a mean cells/CSA measurement per individual.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Edward Morrisey as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Leonard Cheung (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarification of hyperplasia or hypertrophy contributing to enlarged pituitary size. Cell number representations, particularly in GH, PRL and TSH populations.</p><p>2) Data presented in Figure 3 needs to be explained with regard to Dlk1 expression in the MZ compartment.</p><p>3) Pituitary size in PatTg mice at later time points in adulthood needs to be determined.</p><p>4) Details about the contribution of Dlk1 in the diencephalon/hypothalamus to pituitary organ size.</p><p>5) Role of Wnt signaling in Pat and which pathways are involved.</p><p>6) Clarity about GH action in postnatal growth.</p><p>7) Sex differences are not considered for adult time points. The authors may include data from males.</p><p>8) Include missing Details on methods and other aspects directly in the main text.</p><p>9) Include details on PRL immunostaining protocol-antigen retrieval conditions.</p><p>10) Timing of Pou1f1 and Gh1 expression needs to be described.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I had a question about the expression of Dlk1 in the MZ <italic>sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> compartment as shown in Figure 3A. The expression in the WT (inset) shows strong staining along the marginal zone/basal membrane, and this is clearly not detected in the Pat and Pat-Tg. At the same time, I noticed that Figure 3E and 2E may not show the same (basal) pattern, although the magnifications are different. In Cheung 2013 JNE there appeared to be little Dlk1 immunostaining in cells along the MZ, although that was a single panel. Could you elaborate on the expression pattern of Dlk1 in the MZ compartment? I agree that Figure 3E (WT inset) shows intercellular membranous Dlk1 staining in contrast to the cytoplasmic staining seen in Pou1f1+ cells and that this appears to be missing in the Pat-Tg inset.</p><p>I believe some caution may be considered in using single-cell data in Figure 3C/D. Since Dlk1 is expressed in many Gh cells and somatotropes commonly lyse and contaminate other cell types in sc data, at least part of that Dlk1 detected in stem cells may be caused by cell-free RNA. In Figure 3C, you can see some Dlk1 detected in the endothelia (presumably EC) and connective tissue (presumed CT) in the P49 data. At the same time, I recognize that the P4 data do not show Dlk1 in the corresponding cells, suggesting contamination may be limited.</p><p>In the context of Figure S1, you could reference Ansell 2007 Mol Cell Endo, which studied Dlk1 regulation of the GH promoter and expression, finding that Dlk1 in vitro represses Gh expression and its promoter and that it also represses Pou1f1 action when cotransfected.</p><p>I had a question about the reduced pituitary size of Pat and Pat-Tg animals. While they are clearly reduced before P21, both are recovering (non-sig) by P21. Do you know if the pituitary continues to be smaller in later adulthood? If not, could the reduced size in early life be a developmental delay rather than a permanent reduction in organ size? Puertas-Avendano 2011 studied 4-month-old mice and did not study pituitary size (but did not report it). Cheung 2013 used P14-P100 mice and looked at total pituitary protein at P42 as a measure of the pituitary size and did not find a difference (size was also not measured).</p><p>I was wondering about the contribution of Dlk1 in the diencephalon/hypothalamus to pituitary organ size in your models. You and others (Allen Brain Atlas, Villanueva 2011 PLOS One, Persson-Augner 2014 Neuroendo) show strong expression of Dlk1 in the diencephalon and arcuate nucleus. While you show in Figure S3 that signals in the developing ventral diencephalon are normal, I am unfamiliar with the data regarding the effects of Dlk1 loss/overexpression on these cells postnatally. GHRH-overexpressing transgenic mice (Stefaneanu 1989 Endo) have GH and PRL cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia and did not appear to cause adenoma by 8 months, which are partially similar phenotypes to your WT-Tg. Do you know if GHRH or other pituitary-regulating hormone neurons are normal postnatally in the WT-Tg?

This point has now been clarified throughout and new data added in Figure 4E. Here we used stereological estimation of total cell number in the adult anterior pituitary of all 4 study genotypes (WT, WT-TG, PAT, PAT-TG). WT-TG animals had increased AP cell number compared to WT littermates (p = 0.0443), and both PAT and PAT-TG animals had reduced cell number (p = 0.0212, 0.0193 respectively).</p><p>Regarding the apparent discrepancy in hormone cell proportions of cells highlighted by reviewer 1, we apologise for the confusion. We believe that the volume occupied by all hormone producing cells is increased in the WT-TG animals, consistent with the maintenance of cells proportions shown in Figure 1D. We think that the reason that only the GH population shows a volume expansion in Figure 1G is a problem of power. Please see our comment to reviewer 1 below. However, we have now performed 2-Way ANOVA on the data in Figure 1G, and this test clearly indicated that hormone cell volumes between groups significantly differ by genotype (p = 0.0009).

Looking closely at the P21 WT image in Figure 2E it is clear that there is more DLK1 in the medial MZ compared to the lateral part. The images in Figure 3B are all in the lateral part of the MZ. This may reflect important differences between stem cell populations that are currently a focus of the Andoniadou lab, but are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Pituitary size in PatTg mice at later time points in adulthood needs to be determined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now bred a new cohort of male and female animals from all 4 genotypes and sacrificed at 8 weeks to address the long-term influence of <italic>Dlk1</italic> ablation and the ability of the <italic>Dlk1-70C</italic> transgene to rescue the pituitary volume phenotype. These new data are shown in Figure 4D and E. Consistent with the data shown in Figure 4C, adult WT-TG animals of both sexes have increased AP volume and cell number. PAT males have a significant reduction in AP volume, but the female gland has reached WT volume. The volume of the AP in PAT-TG in both sexes is similar to PAT, confirming that both stem cell- and parenchymal-derived <italic>Dlk1</italic> is required for postnatal hyperplasia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Details about the contribution of Dlk1 in the diencephalon/hypothalamus to pituitary organ size.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested levels of <italic>Dlk1</italic>, <italic>Ghrh</italic> and <italic>Sst</italic> in the hypothalamus of all 4 genotypes of adult mice. <italic>Dlk1</italic> is not expressed from the transgene in this tissue (also seen in Figure 2D) therefore a direct action for <italic>Dlk1</italic> in the hypothalamus of WT-TG mice to mediate pituitary volume expansion is less likely.

They carefully measured growth rates in mice that were lacking components of the GH-IGF system, including the GH receptor (Ghr). In 2001 Lupu et al. showed that the majority of the body mass difference between WT and Ghr-/- mice occurs due to a reduction in growth rate prior to P21 (about 80% of the overall effect). By P30 Ghr-/- mice reach ~50% WT mass and remain at this relative mass until at least P110 (PMID: 11133160). From this we conclude that the normal period of growth promoting action by GH in mice is in the first 4 postnatal weeks. We stated in the discussion “while we did observe increased circulating GH in WT-TG animals at P21 (Figure S2), this may have been too late to promote the pre-pubertal growth spurt.” We stand by this statement. For clarity we have added the following line to the discussion “In mice, the majority of GH action on linear growth occurs prior to P21 (Lupu et al. 2001)”.</p><p>However, it must be noted that elevated GH administration to rodents can increase postnatal growth rates. This topic, with its caveats (human GH can act on PRLR, for example) is ably covered by Kopchick et. al (PMID: 24035867) in a 2014 review. From this it is clear that GH dosage has a major impact on its ability to stimulate growth. Indeed an early paper from Palmiter et. al (PMID: 6958982), where a rat GH transgene was introduced into mice by pronuclear injection, developed an allelic series where increased transgene copy number resulted in higher GH circulating levels and impact on growth. Importantly, a robust effect on growth was only observed when GH levels exceeded 100x normal circulating levels. From this we conclude (as have others, including Huang et. al 2019 -cited in discussion) that it is the pattern of GH secretion at near-physiological levels, rather than the dosage alone, that is crucial for the growth promoting effects of this hormone. This requirement can be overcome by extremely high GH dosage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Sex differences are not considered for adult time points.

The expression in the WT (inset) shows strong staining along the marginal zone/basal membrane, and this is clearly not detected in the Pat and Pat-Tg. At the same time, I noticed that Figure 3E and 2E may not show the same (basal) pattern, although the magnifications are different. In Cheung 2013 JNE there appeared to be little Dlk1 immunostaining in cells along the MZ, although that was a single panel. Could you elaborate on the expression pattern of Dlk1 in the MZ compartment? I agree that Figure 3E (WT inset) shows intercellular membranous Dlk1 staining in contrast to the cytoplasmic staining seen in Pou1f1+ cells and that this appears to be missing in the Pat-Tg inset.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there appears to be some heterogeneity in the postnatal MZ staining for DLK1. See point 2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I believe some caution may be considered in using single-cell data in Figure 3C/D. Since Dlk1 is expressed in many Gh cells and somatotropes commonly lyse and contaminate other cell types in sc data, at least part of that Dlk1 detected in stem cells may be caused by cell-free RNA. In Figure 3C, you can see some Dlk1 detected in the endothelia (presumably EC) and connective tissue (presumed CT) in the P49 data. At the same time, I recognize that the P4 data do not show Dlk1 in the corresponding cells, suggesting contamination may be limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that any single data source has limitations.

While they are clearly reduced before P21, both are recovering (non-sig) by P21. Do you know if the pituitary continues to be smaller in later adulthood? If not, could the reduced size in early life be a developmental delay rather than a permanent reduction in organ size? Puertas-Avendano 2011 studied 4-month-old mice and did not study pituitary size (but did not report it). Cheung 2013 used P14-P100 mice and looked at total pituitary protein at P42 as a measure of the pituitary size and did not find a difference (size was also not measured).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included these data, see point 3 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was wondering about the contribution of Dlk1 in the diencephalon/hypothalamus to pituitary organ size in your models. You and others (Allen Brain Atlas, Villanueva 2011 PLOS One, Persson-Augner 2014 Neuroendo) show strong expression of Dlk1 in the diencephalon and arcuate nucleus. While you show in Figure S3 that signals in the developing ventral diencephalon are normal, I am unfamiliar with the data regarding the effects of Dlk1 loss/overexpression on these cells postnatally. GHRH-overexpressing transgenic mice (Stefaneanu 1989 Endo) have GH and PRL cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia and did not appear to cause adenoma by 8 months, which are partially similar phenotypes to your WT-Tg. Do you know if GHRH or other pituitary-regulating hormone neurons are normal postnatally in the WT-Tg? I wonder if increased GHRH action could in part cause the increased serum GH found in Wt-Tg in Charalambous 2014 and be partially causative of increased pituitary size in WT-Tg in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that alterations for hypothalamic production of GH-modifying neuropeptides such as GHRH and SST could potentially explain the GH overproduction in WT-TG mice, especially since DLK1 is normally expressed in the hypothalamic neurons that produce these signals. However, we had previously disregarded this possibility since we know that the <italic>Dlk1-70C</italic> transgene lacks the enhancer sequences necessary for hypothalamic gene expression (see the PAT-TG in Figure 2D for example). To more robustly test this hypothesis we performed RT-qPCR on hypothalamus samples from our new adult cohort. As expected, <italic>Dlk1</italic> expression was not modified by the transgene – WT == WT-TG and PAT == PAT-TG. Moreover, <italic>Ghrh</italic> and <italic>Sst</italic> gene expression was not significantly different between genotypes. We conclude that WT-TG animals do not appear to have a defect in GH-modifying neurohormone production, at least at the transcriptional level (which would also likely reflect a change in the size of the neuronal population). These data have been added as Figure 4F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5E/G, you observe that there are more Pou1f1+ cells at e13.5 in the Pat.

Do you think any of these pathways may be activated in the Pat as a result of increased Wnt signals? Why might increased Wnt cause different size phenotypes in the two models?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting observation, and we believe that the spatial, temporal and dosage parameters for WNT activation may lead to varied phenotypes. The WNT activation presented here in the Pat, is not as pronounced as in the Apc deletion model. The mild hyperplasia in the Apc deletion model is largely due to cell-autonomous activation of WNT signalling (in the absence of WNT ligand), which leads to over-proliferation of embryonic progenitors at early stages (from RP specification). Additional pathway elevation in the Apc deletion model is linked specifically to the SASP (oncogene-induced SASP), for which we have no evidence that it is taking place in the Pat. In the Pat we see reduced proliferation, which is not consistent with a SASP phenotype and associated pathway elevation, which would induce proliferation in non-senescent cells. In other WNT-activation models (e.g. Ctnnb1lox(ex3)/+), pituitary stem/progenitor cells enter SASP and express pathogenic levels of pathways (higher than in the Apc deletion), leading to cell non-autonomous tumours due to these SASP-related activities. On the other hand, WNT signalling that is either very high or very low, can both lead to defects in cell lineage commitment e.g. Ctnnb1-lox(ex3) expression paradoxically leads to complete absence of Pou1f1-lineage commitment (Andoniadou et al. 2013), just like a reduction in WNT signalling. In future, we would like to carry out (i) transcriptomic analyses in the Pat and other genotypes, and (ii) lineage-specific Dlk1 deletions, which together would help us resolve the downstream mechanisms and delineate additional pathway involvement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On line 448, please verify whether later postnatal GH action can induce growth.
