For example, failure of neural fold fusion during neurulation leads to open neural tube defects including spina bifida. Using mouse embryos, we show that cell protrusions emanating from the apposed neural fold tips, at the interface between the neuroepithelium and the surface ectoderm, are required for completion of neural tube closure. By genetically ablating the cytoskeletal regulators Rac1 or Cdc42 in the dorsal neuroepithelium, or in the surface ectoderm, we show that these protrusions originate from surface ectodermal cells and that Rac1 is necessary for the formation of membrane ruffles which typify late closure stages, whereas Cdc42 is required for the predominance of filopodia in early neurulation. This study provides evidence for the essential role and molecular regulation of membrane protrusions prior to fusion of a key organ primordium in mammalian development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13273.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13273.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13273.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The neural tube is an embryonic structure that gives rise to the brain and spinal cord. It originates from a flat sheet of cells – the neural plate – that rolls up and fuses to form a tube during development. If this closure fails, it leads to birth defects such as spina bifida, a condition that causes severe disability because babies are born with an exposed and damaged spinal cord.</p><p>As the edges of the neural plate meet, they need to fuse together to produce a closed tube. It was known that cells at these edges extend protrusions. However, it was unclear how these protrusions are regulated, whether they arise from neural or non-neural cells and whether or not they are required for the neural tube to close fully.</p><p>By studying mutant mouse embryos, Rolo et al. found that cellular protrusions are indeed required for the neural tube to close completely. These protrusions proved to be regulated by proteins called Rac1 and Cdc42, which control the filaments inside the cell that are responsible for cell shape and movement. Rolo et al. also found that the cells that give rise to the protrusions are not part of the neural plate itself. Instead, these cells are neighboring cells from the layer that later forms the epidermis of the skin (the surface ectoderm).</p><p>Future studies will need to investigate which signals instruct those precise cells to make protrusions and to discover what happens to the protrusions after contact is made with cells on the opposite side. It will also be important to determine whether spina bifida may arise in humans if the protrusions are defective or absent.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13273.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13273.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neurulation</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>cell protrusions</kwd><kwd>rac1</kwd><kwd>cdc42</kwd><kwd>scanning electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>087525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Copp</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0801124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Copp</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0802163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greene</surname><given-names>Nicholas DE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The completion of neural tube closure requires small GTPase-regulated membrane protrusions from non-neural ectoderm cells at the tips of the neural folds.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fusion of apposed epithelial sheets is an essential process in the completion of many morphogenetic events including closure of the neural tube, optic fissure, palatal shelves, and cardiac septa. Failure of these fusion events leads to clinically important congenital malformations including neural tube defects (NTDs: anencephaly and open spina bifida), coloboma, cleft palate, and cardiac septal defects, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ray and Niswander, 2012</xref>).</p><p>NTDs are among the commonest human birth defects, affecting 0.5–2 per 1000 pregnancies worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Copp et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms by which the vertebrate neural plate folds up and fuses to form a closed neural tube is thus of paramount importance for gaining insight into the embryonic pathogenesis of NTDs, and for developing improved methods for their prevention. In recent years, some of the molecular mechanisms underlying different morphogenetic aspects of neural tube closure have been unravelled. For example, the initial convergence and extension movements that narrow and elongate the neural plate were found to be regulated by the non-canonical Wnt-planar cell polarity pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wallingford and Harland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007b</xref>), whereas the subsequent bending of the mammalian neural plate at discrete medial and dorsolateral hinge points was shown to be regulated by Shh and BMP signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007a</xref>). Much less is known, however, about the final steps of neurulation, involving fusion and remodelling of the neural folds at the dorsal midline.</p><p>During epithelial ‘fusion’, individual cells do not actually fuse with one another, but rather cells at the leading edges of apposed tissues form de novo adhesions to create a continuous epithelium. Neural tube closure involves a particular kind of epithelial fusion, in which two distinct tissues need to fuse and remodel: the pseudostratified neuroepithelium (NE) and the squamous surface ectoderm (SE). Initially, these two tissues form a continuous ectodermal layer; however, during neural fold fusion, the continuity of this epithelium is disrupted at the bilateral NE/SE junctions, and new adhesions form between concurring epithelia from each side. Remodelling then generates the closed neural tube covered by the future epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Cellular protrusions are often observed prior to apposition at the onset of epithelial fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pai et al., 2012</xref>). It has long been known that membrane ruffles are present at the edges of apposed neural folds during neural tube closure in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mak, 1978</xref>), birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bancroft and Bellairs, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoenwolf, 1979</xref>), and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geelen and Langman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waterman, 1976</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Recently, filopodia have been observed at the neural fold tips in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Massarwa and Niswander, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pyrgaki et al., 2010</xref>) and in ascidians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ogura et al., 2011</xref>), together with F-actin enrichment along the NE/SE boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hashimoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ogura et al., 2011</xref>). Early morphological studies in mice found that the initial contact between neural folds in the midbrain and hindbrain regions is made by SE cells, from which cellular protrusions emanate, whereas at the forebrain level initial contact is made by NE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geelen and Langman, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">1979</xref>). In chick, during cranial neurulation the SE and NE layers contact at the same time, but in the spinal region this first contact is made by SE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoenwolf, 1979</xref>), and in frog neurulation the SE closes first, and this closure is actually uncoupled from NE closure, which occurs later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidson and Keller, 1999</xref>). In mouse spinal neural tube closure, however, the cell type of origin of the protrusive cells and initial contact point have not been previously identified. Moreover, whether these protrusions are required for vertebrate neural tube closure at any level of the body axis is unknown.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13273.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the final events of neurulation in the spinal region of the mouse embryo.</title><p>The apposing neural folds exhibit cell protrusions from their tips (left), the neural folds then undergo fusion (middle), and the two epithelia remodel to generate a closed neural tube covered by SE (right).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13273.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13273.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13273-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Small GTPases of the Rho family are ubiquitously expressed molecular switches that cycle between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) states and have a pivotal role in linking extracellular signals with several specific downstream effectors. In particular, Rac1 and Cdc42 are well-known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton that drives cellular protrusion. Rac1 induces the formation of the branched actin networks that underlie lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, and Cdc42 drives the assembly of unbranched actin bundles that form filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heasman and Ridley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ridley, 2011</xref>). Even though the specific roles of the different Rho-GTPases were initially described using constitutively active and/or dominant negative forms, as well as pharmacological approaches, these techniques were later recognised to create limitations, owing to issues with specificity and dosage control. Conditional gene targeting has subsequently become the preferred method for studying Rho GTPase function in vivo in mammals, particularly mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang and Zheng, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe the formation of different types of protrusions at the edges of the mouse spinal neural folds immediately prior to fusion. Using conditional targeting of Rac1 or Cdc42 in the NE and/or the SE, we show that these protrusions originate from SE, rather than NE cells. Furthermore, we show that Rac1 regulates the formation of ruffles, without which neurulation fails leading to open spina bifida, whereas Cdc42 is implicated in the formation of filopodia during earlier stages of neurulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Varying morphology of cell protrusions as spinal neural tube closure progresses</title><p>Membrane protrusions at the tips of the mouse neural folds have been described using both transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geelen and Langman, 1979</xref>) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waterman, 1976</xref>). TEM provides very detailed imaging of both the cellular protrusions and the cells they emanate from. However, the sectional views obtained with TEM do not allow for a three-dimensional analysis of protrusive morphology. We therefore initially chose to describe the protrusive activity in the mouse spinal neural folds using SEM. We observed elaborate membrane protrusions at the point of fold apposition throughout spinal neurulation, and these protrusions were found to vary qualitatively as neurulation progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). At the onset of neural tube closure (somite-stage (ss)7), protrusions consisted mainly of long, finger-like filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As neurulation progressed (e.g. ss12), we observed a mixture of filopodia and ruffles at the spinal fusion point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By late spinal neurulation stages (from ss24 onwards), membrane ruffles only were observed, devoid of filopodial extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In some cases, cell protrusions were seen not only at the fold apposition point, but also along the edges of both open neural folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For consistency in the analysis between different embryos, we have focussed our analysis of protrusion types solely on the activity seen at the fold apposition point (for further details of protrusive analysis, see 'Materials and methods' section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13273.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cell protrusions emanate from the interface between the NE and the SE of apposing neural folds during spinal neurulation.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) SEMs of ss7 (<bold>A</bold>), ss12 (<bold>B</bold>), and ss24 (<bold>C</bold>) embryos.

As expected, YFP was expressed in the dorsal NE from E8.5 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), with some YFP-expressing cells also detected ventral to the Pax3 expression domain, consistent with recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, however, at neurulation stages later than ss20, we also detected YFP expression in cells of the dorsal SE, mainly those directly in contact with the NE of the open neural folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In confirmation of their SE identity, we found that these cells robustly express E-cadherin, whereas Pax3 was expressed only at very low intensity, or not at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13273.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Pax3Cre-Rac1 mutants display late failure of PNP closure, with absence of ruffles.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Pax3Cre-driven recombination in the dorsal neural folds and neural tube, detected from E8.5 by direct YFP-reporter expression (<bold>A</bold>), and by immunofluorescence in transverse sections of the closing neural tube at E9.5 (<bold>B</bold>).

Other embryos displayed a curled tail but no open lesion (not shown) which, in other mouse mutants, can result from delayed spinal neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Copp, 1985</xref>). To assess closure directly, we measured the length of the posterior neuropore (PNP), the region of open spinal neural folds, in embryos between ss16 and ss31. PNP length diminished progressively in control embryos as neurulation proceeded along the spinal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Comparing Pax3Cre-Rac1 and Pax3Cre-Con embryos, before ss23 there was no detectable difference in PNP length but, from ss24 onwards, the PNP lengths of Pax3Cre-Rac1 embryos were significantly greater than those of Pax3Cre-Con embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), consistent with a late failure of PNP closure and consequent relatively mild spinal neurulation defects.</p><p>At ss20-23, we also detected a significant difference in PNP length between Non-Cre and Pax3Cre-Con embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Comparing the types of protrusions formed by Non-Cre and Pax3Cre-Con embryos did not reveal a difference between the two groups (p=0.44).

In contrast to control embryos at these late neurulation stages, Pax3Cre-Rac1 embryos never formed ruffles only: they either exhibited both ruffles and filopodia (60% of cases), or had absent or incipient protrusions (40%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These observations are consistent with the failure or delay in PNP closure seen in Pax3Cre-Rac1 embryos resulting from a defect in cell protrusive activity at late neurulation stages. In particular, Pax3Cre-Rac1 embryos are impaired in the formation of membrane ruffles devoid of filopodia.</p><p>While it seemed most likely that the neural tube closure defect in Pax3Cre-Rac1 resulted from faulty formation of membrane ruffles, we considered whether conditional deletion of Rac1 might also lead to an earlier defect in neural tube closure, such as NE bending. Failure of dorsolateral bending can cause spina bifida in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ybot-Gonzalez et al., 2007a</xref>). Transverse sections through the PNP of these embryos at E9.5 confirmed the presence of normal-appearing hinge points at both midline and dorsolateral positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), arguing against a mechanism of spina bifida in Pax3Cre-Rac1 embryos based on NE bending defects. Nevertheless, because Rac1 is required for the formation of adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehrlich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kovacs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</xref>), we analysed the localisation of F-actin and β-catenin in the NE of Pax3Cre-Rac1 mutants, as well as E-cadherin in the SE. The distribution of these proteins was found to be closely similar in control and mutant embryos, as well as in both the targeted and non-targeted regions of the NE in mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), thus ruling out an effect of Rac1 knock-out on epithelial stability, which could impair neural tube closure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Failure of PNP closure does not lead to defects in protrusive activity</title><p>To address the question of whether the protrusion defects observed in Pax3Cre-Rac1 embryos are indeed a cause of failure of PNP closure, rather than a consequence of that failure, we chose to analyse the cell protrusive activity in a different mouse mutant with spina bifida.

Rac1 might be required for the formation of ruffles that are devoid of filopodia, but not for the combined appearance of ruffles and filopodia. These ruffles without filopodia might be needed only for late spinal NT closure. Alternatively, it is possible that Rac1 is required for neural fold protrusions along the whole spinal axis throughout all NT closure stages, but these protrusions arise on SE cells, and so Rac1-dependency is seen only at late neurulation stages, when the Pax3 lineage becomes targeted in the SE as well as the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To address the first hypothesis, and to test a possible candidate for the formation of filopodia, we generated conditional Cdc42 mutants in the Pax3 cell lineage (Pax3Cre-Cdc42). None of the Pax3Cre-Cdc42 embryos showed NTDs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, Pax3Cre-Cdc42 embryos collected during neurulation between ss16 and ss27 resembled control litter mates in PNP length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The present work is, to our knowledge, the first to provide evidence that these protrusions are required for successful neural tube closure. Moreover, we show that as spinal neurulation progresses these cell protrusions change, both qualitatively and in their genetic regulation. At the onset of neurulation, the protrusions are predominantly filopodial, requiring Cdc42 function, whereas later stages are characterised by either a mixture of ruffles and filopodia, or by membrane ruffles alone, and these require Rac1. Additionally, using both genetic experiments and morphological analysis, we show that the protrusions originate from SE cells rather than NE cells.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Roles of cell protrusions in epithelial fusion</title><p>Besides neural tube closure, other morphogenetic events involve epithelial tissue fusions accompanied by cellular protrusive activity. For example, during palatal shelf fusion in mice, filopodia are present at the medial edge epithelial cells just before fusion, and <italic>TGF</italic>-β<italic>3</italic> knock-out mice that lack such protrusions display cleft palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Taya et al., 1999</xref>). Similarly, during eyelid closure, filopodia extend from the leading edge epithelia and are reduced in number and length in <italic>c-jun</italic> mutants that display defective eyelid closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zenz et al., 2003</xref>). But perhaps the best studied case of cell protrusive activity in epithelial fusion during development is the process of dorsal closure in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In this system, the leading edge cells of the lateral epidermis extend cell protrusions as they advance over the amnioserosa layer. When Rac or Cdc42 functions are perturbed, using dominant-negative proteins or loss-of-function mutations, this leads to defects of lamellipodia or filopodia, respectively, accompanied by failed dorsal closure, as well as misalignment of any segments that manage to close (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harden et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacinto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Woolner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> these protrusions may have a dual role, both in terms of mechanically participating in the closure process, and as exploratory structures that assure proper matching of fusing segments. However, because Rac is also involved in contraction of the underlying amnioserosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harden et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2002</xref>), it is possible that its role in the leading edge cells is mainly exploratory.</p><p>Unlike the lateral epidermis leading edge cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which are moving over the amnioserosa, the protrusions that emanate from the mouse neural folds are not crawling on top of other cells or on extracellular matrix; rather, they extend into a fluid-filled space, and therefore could not be exerting any type of traction force to drive fusion. Moreover, in the segmented epidermis of the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, exact alignment of A-P segments appears vital and is sub-served by the epithelial protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Millard and Martin, 2008</xref>). In contrast, the mouse developing spinal cord is not overtly segmented and it would appear that the role of neural fold protrusions is more likely to involve cell-cell recognition and/or signalling across the midline, to initiate epithelial fusion and ensure robust closure of the neural tube.</p><p>Cell-cell recognition is likely a key step in triggering fusion, and many epithelial fusions involve cell recognition through Eph-ephrin interactions, including palatal shelf development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compagni et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Risley et al., 2009</xref>), optic fissure closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noh et al., 2016</xref>), and neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Aziz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holmberg et al., 2000</xref>). The EphA2 receptor is present on the mouse spinal neural folds just before fusion, and its expression can be detected by TEM on the protrusions themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Aziz et al., 2009</xref>), raising the possibility that Eph-ephrin signalling may initiate upon contact between cell protrusions from apposing cells.</p><p>Epithelial cell protrusions may also be involved in initiation of de novo cell adhesions. In cultured MDCK cells, E-cadherin accumulation is induced by contacts between Rac1-driven exploratory lamellipodia from opposing cells. The initial contact then spreads, driven by actomyosin contraction, while Rac1 activity and lamellipodial extension cease, and new junctions are formed between the two cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</xref>).</p><p>What drives the formation of protrusions in the first place? Recent studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that during dorsal closure the epithelial leading edge cells undergo an incomplete epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, caused by loss of apico-basal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pickering et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of polarity in these cells results in a reduction of PTEN phosphatase, which in turn causes an increase in PIP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pickering et al., 2013</xref>), a known activator of Rac. As the cells meet in the midline, they switch back to ‘full’ epithelial character and restore cell-cell adhesion, an event mediated by Pak, an effector of both Rac and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahri et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Different requirements for Rac1 and Cdc42 throughout spinal neurulation</title><p>Our results with Pax3Cre-Rac1 mutants show a clear requirement for Rac1 and ruffle formation on SE cells during the final stages of primary neurulation, from ss24 onwards. However, Rac1 is required in the SE earlier on, as Grhl3Cre-Rac1 mutants show delayed PNP closure from ss20, and a lack of ruffles alone in these mutants is detected at ss15-22, despite no overall statistical significance. This argues for a requirement of ruffles from at least mid-neurulation, and perhaps a gradual transition between protrusive types, with a balance of different protrusions needed.</p><p>Despite the lack of ruffles, the shift towards excessive filopodia formation in Grhl3Cre-Rac1 mutants was unexpected given that, in cultured fibroblasts, expression of a dominant-negative form of Rac1 leads to inhibition of filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnston et al., 2008</xref>). Fibroblasts genetically deficient for Rac1, on the other hand, are able to spread and move by extending filopodia, possibly through an Arp2/3-independent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steffen et al., 2013</xref>). Filopodial initiation can be driven by either Arp2/3 (branched nucleation) or by formins (unbranched nucleation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang and Svitkina, 2011</xref>). Moreover, Rac1 can both activate and inhibit the Arp2/3 complex, through either the Scar/WAVE complex or the Arpin protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dang et al., 2013</xref>). If filopodium formation on the leading edge SE cells occurs through an Arp2/3-dependent process, then in the absence of Rac1 perhaps initiation of filopodial extension can be driven by other activators of the Arp2/3 complex. The occurrence of filopodia initiation would then be enhanced if Rac1 activates an Arp2/3 inhibitor such as Arpin in these cells. On the other hand, if initiation of these filopodia is driven independently of Arp2/3, then the absence of Rac1 might shift the balance from branched to unbranched actin nucleation, resulting in more actin filaments being incorporated into filopodium-forming cross linked bundles.</p><p>Our results show that Cdc42 is not needed in mid and late spinal neurulation, as the Pax3Cre-Cdc42 mutants have no defects in PNP closure or protrusive activity. But Cdc42 does play a role in early neurulation, as Grhl3Cre-Cdc42 mutants show a shift towards the extension of ruffles at the expense of filopodia. Whether or not this would impair progression of neural tube closure past ss10 could not be determined, given the early lethality of these embryos. It is possible that, in the absence/reduction of filopodia, membrane ruffles could take over their role and closure would progress.

The mounted samples were then coated with a thin layer of Au/Pd (approximately 2 nm thick) using a Gatan ion beam coater and imaged with a JEOL 7401 FEGSEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Embryos were fixed for 12–36 hr in 3% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.08 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and then <italic>en bloc</italic> stained with osmium ferricyanide-thiocarbohydrazide-osmium, uranyl acetate, and Walton’s lead citrate as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">West et al., 2010</xref>) with two modifications. First, the osmium concentration was reduced to 1% and, second, graded alcohols (50, 70, 90, 3 x 100%) and propylene oxide were used instead of acetone to dehydrate specimens for infiltration and curing overnight at 60°C in Durcupan ACM resin. Specimens were then superglued to aluminium pins and trimmed to place the region of interest within a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 mm mesa and sputter coated with 5 nm gold palladium. Stacks of backscatter electron micrographs were automatically acquired using a Gatan 3 view system in conjunction with a Zeiss Sigma field emission scanning electron microscope working in variable pressure mode at a chamber pressure of 9 Pa and 4 kV. At a standard magnification of x1000 and a pixel resolution of 4096 x 4096, the total area sampled measured 255.4 µm<sup>2</sup> on x and y and, depending on the number of 100-nm-thick sections sampled, between 67 and 150 µm on z. The resulting stacks were normalised for contrast and brightness and then converted to TIFF images in Digital Micrograph prior to importation into Amira 5.3.3 software for semi-automated segmentation and presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Protrusion analysis</title><p>Protrusions were scored based on SEM images of the PNP fusion point taken at 2000x magnification, and categorised in four different classes: <bold><underline>R</underline>uffles</bold> (comprised predominantly or solely of membrane ruffles), <bold><underline>R</underline>uffles and <underline>F</underline>ilopodia</bold> (either a mixture of both types of protrusions, filopodia that emanate from ruffles, or ruffles with microspikes), <bold><underline>F</underline>ilopodia</bold> (comprised predominantly or solely of filopodial protrusions), <bold><underline>A</underline>bsent</bold> (total absence of protrusions, or just one or two incipient protrusions). Examples of these types of protrusions can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, and the full dataset of protrusion images can be found in the Dryad Digital Repository (doi:10.5061/dryad.rm660).</p><p>Scoring was done blind to embryonic stage and genotype by two different persons. In the minority of cases where the two scorings did not concur, a final decision was made by consensus.</p><p>Where analysed, filopodial density was measured by counting the number of individual filopodia in an area of 2000 µm<sup>2</sup> around the point of neural fold fusion, and filopodial length was measured in the same area using Fiji software. Only filopodia that measured above 1 µm were considered for these analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks was used for comparison of PNP size between different groups within each stage range. Fisher exact test was used for comparison of proportions of different types of protrusions and Chi-square test was used for comparison of phenotype frequencies in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; when more than two groups were compared in multiple tests, the alpha-level was protected manually. Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test was used to compare filopodial number and filopodial length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Kate Storey for sharing unpublished reagents (<italic>Nkx1-2<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> line), Mark Turmaine for assistance with SEM, Alix Palmer for providing <italic>Sp<sup>2H </sup></italic>embryos, and Maddy Parsons and Juan-Pedro Martinez-Barbera for helpful comments on the manuscript.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>AR, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>DS, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>SE, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>SCdC, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>HEJA, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>PMGM, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>MAM, Acquisition of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>NDEG, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>AJC, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: Animal studies were performed according to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and the Medical Research Council's Responsibility in the Use of Animals for Medical Research (July 1993), under Project Licence number PPL 70/7469 held by A.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Regulation of Cell Protrusions by Small GTPases during Fusion of the Neural Folds&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt as Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Marianne Bronner, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an elegant paper that uses a series of mouse mutants to understand the regulation of cell protrusion during fusion of the neural plate. While we have some understanding of the genetics underlying neural tube defects, the cell biological events are not well described. This is in large part due to the difficulties studying extremely dynamic interactions during embryonic stages that are not readily accessible.</p><p>The authors demonstrate a role for membrane ruffles in the surface ectodermal cells which requires Rac1, as well as role for Cdc42 in filopodia in the neural folds. While it is unsurprising that these molecules are important in neural tube fusion, the identification of the key cells (surface ectodermal cells) is important and significant. Furthermore, their analysis suggests that these protrusions are necessary during particular stages of neurulation and that the nature of the protrusions changes during development (from predominantly filopodial early to later ruffles and filopodia.</p><p>The characterisation of cell protrusions in different neurulation stages, as well as the contribution of Rho GTPases to different protrusions has been carried out carefully and has developmental significance. Many of the observations are novel and interesting. However, several essential controls are missing. Once corrected, this paper would be highly appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Regarding the observation that cranial neural tube closure in Rac1/Cdc42 mutants is not as affected as the posterior neural tube, this would be better supported with some comparative data. However, we appreciate that may be beyond the scope of this paper. Therefore, we suggest that the Discussion not close with this section.</p><p>2) While the section on epithelial closure is useful and informative, we would have liked a summary of similarities and differences of NTD etiology and membrane ruffling/filopodial dynamics in different organisms (e.g., mouse vs. chick vs. frog).</p><p>3) The Pax3<sup>cre</sup> allele is a heterozygous mutation of <italic>Pax3</italic>, which has a phenotype. The genetics tables are helpful in allaying worries about genetic interactions; however, the authors should still discuss any possible Pax3-dependent cytoskeletal regulation – e.g., Wiggan et al., Cell Signal. 2006 and subsequent papers.</p><p>4) Although in Pax3cre-Rac1 and Grhl3cre-Rac1 embryos, the decrease of ruffles is accompanied with posterior neural tube closure defects, it is not certain that loss of ruffles is the cause of the neural tube closure defects. Another important possibility is that Rac1 knockdown results in instability of the actin-Adherens Junctions complex, which is involved in force transmission between adjacent cells to accomplish cell elongation and tissue movement and it is this that impairs active neural tube closure. The authors need to examine the localisation of F-actin and adherens junction components in Rac1 conditional knockouts, before they can reach a conclusion about the role of protrusions in neural tube closure.</p><p>5) The mRNA and proteins of Rac1 and Cdc42 are usually stored at a high level in different cell types since they are important for fundamental cellular activities. Therefore, it is arguable if the conditional knockouts, which are driven by the promoters activated in the early or late neurulation stages, can effectively knockdown the proteins immediately. The authors should provide assessment of protein knockdown in the different conditional knockouts and in the different neurulation stages.</p><p>6) The authors observed that the protrusive cells have a SE cell like shape and thus concluded that the protrusions come from SE cells. This is not necessary the case as, if NE cells undergo the EMT process, they could also transform into protrusive cells exemplified in neural crest migration. To fully verify cell identify, it would be better to examine cell lineage markers or cell-type specific junction markers. Since surface ectoderm and presumptive neural crest are in such close proximity and neural crest cells do expression some E-cadherin, the distinction seems a bit semantic. The authors should better explain how to distinguish these cell types or be more cautious in their interpretation.</p><p>7) This paper is really about cellular protrusions during neurulation, rather than epithelial adhesion and fusion. This does not detract from the work, but it might help the Introduction and Discussion to clarify that point, since the authors never actually look at the &quot;fusion&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13273.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) Regarding the observation that cranial neural tube closure in Rac1/cdc42 mutants is not as affected as the posterior neural tube, this would be better supported with some comparative data.

The data and discussion of this new work are in the last paragraph of the subsection “Rac1 is required for the formation of ruffles during late stages of neural tube closure”, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>. We saw no differences between the distribution of these proteins between Pax3Cre-Rac1 mutant and control embryos, in either the SE or NE cells. Also, the protein distribution in cells of the targeted and untargeted regions of mutant embryos looks similar. These results reinforce the idea that the NTDs observed are very likely the result of the protrusive defect, rather than any epithelial instability, which we cannot detect.</p><p> <italic>5) The mRNA and proteins of Rac1 and Cdc42 are usually stored at a high level in different cell types since they are important for fundamental cellular activities. Therefore, it is arguable if the conditional knockouts, which are driven by the promoters activated in the early or late neurulation stages, can effectively knockdown the proteins immediately. The authors should provide assessment of protein knockdown in the different conditional knockouts and in the different neurulation stages.</italic> </p><p>We accept this possibility, however we feel it is very likely we achieved sufficient protein knockdown in our study, because:</p><p>a) Rac1 protein is actively degraded by cells via the ubiquitin-proteasome – see (Nethe and Hordijk, 2010) for a review with several examples – and the half-life of active Rac1 is of ~3hours (Kovacic et al., 2001), indicating a fast turnover of protein;</p><p>b) “Immediate” knockdown of the protein would not be required as long as the promoters driving Cre recombination are activated early enough in development;</p><p>c) In Wnt1Cre-Rac1 embryos, Rac1 protein is completely absent from the first pharyngeal arch (almost completely derived from neural crest cells, which express Wnt1Cre) from at least E10.0, possibly earlier (Thomas et al., 2010). Wnt1Cre-driven reporter expression is first detected in the cells that will form the first pharyngeal arch from ss11 (Jacques-Fricke et al., 2012), whereas Pax3Cre-driven expression can be detected in our lines from at least ss5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which is about 12 hours earlier than ss11, meaning that by at least E9.5 the protein should be absent from the targeted tissues in our study;</p><p>d) We found effective mRNA knock-down of Rac1 in the targeted tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>);</p><p>e) Pax3Cre-Rac1 and Pax3Cre-Cdc42 embryos both develop fully penetrant neural crest-derivative phenotypes later in development (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), including at hindlimb levels correspondent to the point of NT closure at E9.5. This reinforces that the proteins were successfully targeted at all the rostro-caudal levels.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have made several attempts at detecting Rac1 protein by immunofluorescence in PNP sections of E9.5 embryos. However, after being unable to find in the literature any convincing examples of such detection at stages earlier than E11, and in view of the insensitivity of the antibodies we have tried, we concluded that this approach would be unfeasible and that protein reduction could probably only be shown by western blotting. Given that we are dealing with conditional KOs, not all cells in an embryonic structure (e.g. caudal embryonic region) would be expected to show protein knockdown. Moreover, it would be unfeasible to precisely dissect out cells of the Pax3Cre domain. In a previous study using qRT-PCR on dissected PNP regions of E9.5 embryos (the same region we would analyse) (Zhao et al., 2014), conditional KO of β-catenin using the Pax3Cre driver led to a reduction of only about 20% of mRNA levels. Therefore, an approach to this question using western blotting would suffer from the need to detect knockdown of Rac1 in a minority of cells within the dissected samples. We consider that the large number of embryos required to have a chance of detecting such small levels of protein reduction in the different conditional knockouts, and at the different neurulation stages, would be prohibitive in terms of cost and time.</p><p>Erickson, C.A., and Weston, J.A.

We would like to point out, however, that the prospective neural crest region, at the axial level we have analysed, is pre-migratory. Neural crest cells do not migrate out of the spinal region until at least 12 hours after neural tube closure is completed (Erickson and Weston, 1983), therefore making it unlikely that cells at the point of neural tube closure have yet begun to undergo EMT. Nonetheless, we accept that these could be highly modified NE cells and have now changed our interpretation accordingly at the end of the Results section.</p><p>Erickson, C.A., and Weston, J.A.

We have clarified this point by changing the text in the Abstract and Introduction (third and fifth paragraphs), emphasizing that cell protrusions occur just prior to neural fold fusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
