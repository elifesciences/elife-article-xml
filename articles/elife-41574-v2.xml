hypoglycemic shock in its prey. We recently showed that this venom insulin, Con-Ins G1, has unique characteristics relevant to the design of new insulin therapeutics. Here, we show that fish-hunting cone snails provide a rich source of minimized ligands of the vertebrate insulin receptor. Insulins from <italic>C. geographus</italic>, <italic>Conus tulipa</italic> and <italic>Conus kinoshitai</italic> exhibit diverse sequences, yet all bind to and activate the human insulin receptor. Molecular dynamics reveal unique modes of action that are distinct from any other insulins known in nature. When tested in zebrafish and mice, venom insulins significantly lower blood glucose in the streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes. Our findings suggest that cone snails have evolved diverse strategies to activate the vertebrate insulin receptor and provide unique insight into the design of novel drugs for the treatment of diabetes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Insulin is a hormone critical for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels in humans. When the insulin system becomes faulty, blood sugar levels become too high, which can lead to diabetes. At the moment, the only effective treatment for one of the major types of diabetes are daily insulin injections. However, designing fast-acting insulin drugs has remained a challenge. Insulin molecules form clusters (so-called hexamers) that first have to dissolve in the body to activate the insulin receptor, which plays a key role in regulating the blood sugar levels throughout the body. This can take time and can therefore delay the blood-sugar control.</p><p>In 2015, researchers discovered that the fish-hunting cone snail <italic>Conus geographus</italic> uses a specific type of insulin to capture its prey – fish. The cone snail releases insulin into the surrounding water and then engulfs its victim with its mouth. This induces dangerously low blood sugar levels in the fish and so makes them an easy target. Unlike the human version, the snail insulin does not cluster, and despite structural differences, can bind to the human insulin receptor.</p><p>Now, Ahorukomeye, Disotuar et al. – including some of the authors involved in the previous study – wanted to find out whether other fish-hunting cone snails also make insulins and if they differed from the one previously discovered in <italic>C. geographus</italic>. The insulin molecules were extracted and analyzed, and the results showed that the three cone snail species had different versions of insulin – but none of them formed clusters. Ahorukomeye, Disotuar et al. further revealed that the snail insulins could bind to the human insulin receptors and could also reverse high blood sugar levels in fish and mouse models of the disease.</p><p>This research may help guide future studies looking into developing fast-acting insulin drugs for diabetic patients. A next step will be to fully understand how snail insulins can be active at the human receptor without forming clusters. Cone snails solved this problem millions of years ago and by understanding how they have done this, researchers are hoping to redesign current diabetic therapeutics. Since the snail insulins do not form clusters and should act faster than currently available insulin drugs, they may lead to better or new diabetes treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cone snail</kwd><kwd>venom</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd><kwd>hypoglycemic shock</kwd><kwd>prey capture</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1RO1GM122869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Safavi-Hemami</surname><given-names>Helena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008871</institution-id><institution>Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation United States of America</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-INO-2017-441-A-N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Safavi-Hemami</surname><given-names>Helena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Margolis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Safavi-Hemami</surname><given-names>Helena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Government Research Training Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Nicholas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007201</institution-id><institution>Utah Science Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hung-Chieh Chou</surname><given-names>Danny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The unique modus operandi of cone snail venom insulins provides new insight into insulin receptor activation and informs on the design of insulin analogs for the treatment of diabetes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insulin is a pancreatic hormone that is critical for glucose homeostasis. Secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells triggers the uptake of blood glucose into a variety of tissues, including the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose cells. Impairment of insulin secretion and/or insensitivity to the insulin produced can lead to the disease diabetes mellitus. To date, three major types of diabetes have been recognized: Type one diabetes (T1D) or autoimmune diabetes, Type two diabetes (T2D) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Daily insulin injections are the only effective treatment for patients with T1D, late-stage T2D and some with GDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mack and Tomich, 2017</xref>). A major limitation of insulin therapy is its delayed action. The native hormone (consisting of an A and B chain connected by disulfide bonds) oligomerizes into a stable hexamer comprising three insulin dimers held together by two central zinc ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 1969</xref>). Following subcutaneous injection, the hexamer has to dissociate into the dimer, then monomer, in order to activate the insulin receptor. Hexamer-to-monomer conversion is a slow process that can lead to a significant delay in glucose control. This limitation has spurred efforts to design insulin analogues with reduced dimerization (and thus oligomerization) rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owens, 2002</xref>). However, despite decades of research the best fast-acting insulin formulations are not truly monomeric and still require 15–90 min to effectively lower blood glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elleri et al., 2011</xref>); this is because the region involved in dimerization of the insulin molecule, the <italic>C</italic>-terminus of the insulin B chain, is also of critical importance for receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Menting et al., 2013</xref>). Until now, removing this region of the B chain in order to generate a fast-acting analog could not be achieved without a near complete loss of biological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Meyts et al., 1978</xref>). Novel insights for potentially solving this long-standing problem recently came from our discovery of an insulin peptide found in the venom of the fish-hunting cone snail, <italic>Conus geographus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Safavi-Hemami et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>C. geographus</italic> belongs to a large genus of predatory marine snails that use their complex venoms for prey capture, defense and competitive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olivera, 1997</xref>).</p><p><italic>C. geographus</italic> insulin (Con-Ins G1) was shown to rapidly induce insulin shock (dangerously low blood sugar) in its fish prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Safavi-Hemami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robinson and Safavi-Hemami, 2016</xref>). Remarkably, Con-Ins G1 lacks the region of the B chain that is critical for both, dimerization and receptor engagement in human insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Safavi-Hemami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Menting et al., 2016</xref>). Despite this, Con-Ins G1 is a potent agonist of the human insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Menting et al., 2016</xref>). Structure-function studies provided a rationale for this conundrum: two residues within the B chain of Con-Ins G1 act as surrogates for the missing <italic>C</italic>-terminus of the B chain of human insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Menting et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that fish-hunting cone snails have evolved a diverse set of B chain minimized insulins as part of their complex predation strategy. Remarkably, these insulins activate the vertebrate insulin receptor (in fish, mouse and human) but residues previously identified to serve as surrogates for the loss of the B region in Con-Ins G1 are variable. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the <italic>modus operandi</italic> of these unique molecules. Our findings suggest the evolution of diverse molecular mechanisms of insulin receptor activation, providing a set of solutions to potentially solve a long-standing problem of designing truly monomeric, fast-acting insulin analogs for the treatment of diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification and analysis of venom insulin sequences</title><p>We investigated three species of fish-hunting cone snails native to the Central Philippines: <italic>C. geographus</italic> and <italic>C. tulipa</italic> from the Gastridium clade and <italic>C. kinoshitai</italic> from the Afonsoconus clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) combined with whole transcriptome sequencing led to the identification of several distinct insulin sequences in the two cone snail species <italic>C. geographus</italic> and <italic>C. tulipa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Safavi-Hemami et al., 2015</xref>). Of these sequences, the venom insulin Con-Ins G1 shared highest similarity with fish insulin and was previously selected for functional and structural characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Safavi-Hemami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Menting et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we synthesized and functionally characterized four additional venom insulins from these species with various degrees of sequence divergence: Con-Ins G3 from <italic>C. geographus</italic> and Con-Ins T1A, T1B and T2 from <italic>C. tulipa</italic>. Con-Ins G1 and G3 differ by 32 residues across the entire precursor (22 residues within the A and B chain, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and likely represent paralogs originated by gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Safavi-Hemami et al., 2016</xref>). Con-Ins T1A and T1B only differ by three residues across their entire precursor sequence and likely represent allelic variants of the same gene locus. Con-Ins T2 differs at 15 positions across the precursor (13 positions within the A and B chain) and likely originates from a distinct gene locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to these sequences, we performed RT-PCR and whole transcriptome sequencing of the venom gland of <italic>C. kinoshitai</italic> leading to the identification of two new insulin sequences, named Con-Ins K1 and Con-Ins K2. The two <italic>C. kinoshitai</italic> insulin sequences differ at 24 positions, 22 of which fall within the A and B chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compared to insulins from <italic>C. geographus</italic> and <italic>C. tulipa</italic>, the C-peptide regions of Con-Ins K1 and Con-Ins K2 are shorter suggesting an insertion/deletion event of 14 amino acids (14 codons, 42 nucleotides) during the evolution of these peptides.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Species and insulin sequences analysed in this study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cone snail species analyzed in this study and their collection sites in the Philippines. (<bold>B</bold>) Alignment of the A and B chains of venom insulins with insulin from human and zebrafish.

Unlike the endogenous insulins used by cone snails for insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Safavi-Hemami et al., 2016</xref>), all seven venom insulins exhibit the cysteine framework of vertebrate insulin (with 4 and 2 cysteines in the A and B chain, respectively).

This is also evident by the presence of a distinct signal sequence (and distinct 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions) between the venom insulin gene family and their endogenous homologs (data not shown). All sequences were deposited to GenBank (see Material and methods section for accession numbers).</p><p>Overall, venom insulin sequences exhibit pronounced sequence divergence with very few conserved amino acids. The few relatively well conserved amino acids include the first four residues in the A chain, Gly8, Ser9 and Leu18 in the B chain and all six cysteines (see Sequence Logo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Strikingly, the two residues (TyrB15 and TyrB20) previously identified to serve as surrogates in Con-Ins G1 for the missing B chain C-terminus of human insulin are only moderately conserved (TyrB15) or hypervariable (TyrB20).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Peptide synthesis</title><p>Since its first chemical synthesis in 1963 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meienhofer et al., 1963</xref>), insulin has remained challenging to synthesize with the correct intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds. Here, all novel insulin sequences were successfully synthesized using Fmoc peptide chemistry. Con-Ins G3 and Con-Ins T2 were synthesized using procedures similar to those previously applied to Con-Ins G1 (11). To simplify peptide synthesis for Con-Ins T1A, Con-Ins T1B, Con-Ins K1 and Con-Ins K2, these peptides were synthesized using a selenocysteine replacement strategy in which the intra-molecular disulfide bond in the A-chain is substituted by a diselenide (Sec-Sec) bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Safavi-Hemami et al., 2015</xref>). We previously reported that there is no difference in activity between Con-Ins G1 containing a diselenide bond and native Con-Ins G1 (11) and similar observations have been made for other peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walewska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muttenthaler et al., 2010</xref>). Several different methods were applied for the formation of the first inter-molecular disulfide bridge (<italic>i.e.</italic>, using DMSO, Cu ions and pre-activation of the B-chain with DTNP as recently described by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2014</xref>)). These methods allowed the accumulation of the desired intermediate product containing the first intermolecular disulfide bond in yields of up to 50%. When forming the second intermolecular disulfide bridge between the A and B chain in the presence of iodine we observed the formation of a small amount of an additional disulfide isomer for some venom insulins. This was most pronounced for Con-Ins K1, where two products with the same mass were isolated in almost equimolar ratio. When synthesized with a disulfide instead of a diselenide bond only one final product was observed that was selected for subsequent functional analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Venom insulins reduce blood glucose in a zebrafish model of diabetes</title><p>The presence of insulins with structural similarity to vertebrate insulin in the venoms of these fish-hunting species strongly suggested that these compounds are used to induce hypoglycemic shock in fish prey.

Fish- and snail-hunting behaviors are believed to have only evolved in very few clades within this large genus. Within fish-hunters, only a small subset of species expresses insulins that mimic fish insulins (<italic>C. geographus</italic> and <italic>C. tulipa</italic> from the Gastridium clade). These species are known to use other specialized toxins to sedate and disorient their prey prior to capture.

While it remains to be experimentally determined how much venom is released into the water during each predation event, if all venom were injected, 2 mg of venom insulin would be sufficient to effectively lower blood glucose in ~85,500 zebrafish at the concentration used in this study (65 ng insulin/g body weight;~23 ng venom insulin per fish).</p><p>We further show that three of these insulins (Con-Ins G1, Con-Ins T1A and Con-Ins K1) are capable of lowering blood glucose in a mouse model of T1D demonstrating their in vivo activity in a mammalian model system of the disease.</p><p>Notably, each species expresses at least two different insulins with varying sequence divergence. The most pronounced sequence differences within the same species are observed between Con-Ins G1 and Con-Ins G3 from <italic>C. geographus</italic> (11 and 10 residues differ in the A and B chain, respectively). Both insulins lower blood glucose in zebrafish with comparable potencies. However, Con-Ins G3 is more than one order of magnitude less potent against the human IR-B than Con-Ins G1. Similar observations were made for Con-Ins K1 and K2 from <italic>C. kinoshitai</italic> with Con-Ins K2 being ~10 times less active against the human IR-B than Con-Ins K1. These species-specific differences may suggest that cone snails have evolved different insulins to target the insulin receptor in different species of prey. Fish insulin receptors share between ~75–96% identity (for example, zebrafish IR is 96% and 75% identical to the receptor found in the grass carp <italic>Ctenopharyngodon idella and the green spotted puffer fish Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>, respectively). Little is known about the specific diets of fish-hunting cone snails but aquarium observations suggest that they are not restricted to preying on a single fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruz and Corpuz, 1978</xref>). Thus, divergent venom insulins may have evolved to allow most efficient capture of different species of prey.</p><p>Alternatively, venom insulins may target different isoforms of the insulin receptor within the same prey species. Zebrafish, and other fish species for which genome sequencing data is available, express at least two different isoforms of the insulin receptor (insra and insrb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toyoshima et al., 2008</xref>) that share 75% identity and are differentially expressed in a variety of tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tseng et al., 2013</xref>). Humans and other mammals also express two isoforms of the insulin receptor (IR-A and IR-B). However, the mammalian isoforms represent different splice variants of the same gene and their evolutionary origin is distinct from the two isoforms expressed in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Salam and Irwin, 2017</xref>). Testing all venom insulins against different isoforms of the human and fish IR in the future could reveal isoform-specific activity profiles and lead to the generation of isoform-specific insulin receptor probes.</p><p>The human and fish insulin receptors are ~65–75% identical and the fish hormone is known to potently activate the mammalian receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conlon, 2000</xref>). Thus, a venom insulin that evolved to target the insulin receptor in fish has a high chance of also being active at the human receptor. However, activation of the fish and human receptor (and likely all vertebrate insulin receptors) requires a region of the C-terminus of the B chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Menting et al., 2014</xref>), particularly the conserved aromatic triplet FFY in position 24–26 (PheB24-PheB25-TyrB26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Menting et al., 2014</xref>) that is missing in all venom insulins identified here. Removal of this region from human insulin nearly abolishes its biological activity (<italic>i.e.</italic>, an analog of human insulin missing the eight C-terminal residues of the B chain (DOI) retains less than 0.1% of native insulin bioactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 1997</xref>)). Despite lacking this region, all seven venom insulins bind to and activate the hIR-B and are capable of lowering blood glucose in a zebrafish model of T1D. Besides its role in receptor activation, the C-terminal segment functions in oligomerization of two insulin molecules into a homodimer. Three homodimers form a stable hexamer and insulin is stored and secreted from the β-cells of the pancreas in its hexameric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 1969</xref>). Self-association into insulin dimers is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions in a short antiparallel <italic>β</italic>-sheet of the B-chain C-terminus. Hexamer formation is stabilized by two central zinc ions that form interactions with a histidine at position 10 of the B chains (HisB10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rc et al., 1984</xref>). Removal of the C-terminus of the B chain to prevent dimerization and thus hexamerization have led to fully monomeric insulin analogs (<italic>e.g.,</italic> DOI), however, as mentioned above, these have low receptor binding activities and are poor drug leads.</p><p>Of the seven venom insulins tested, five show higher activity at the hIR-B than the B-chain truncated human insulin analog DOI, suggesting the presence of structural motifs that enable receptor activation despite the molecules’ lack of the B-chain C-terminus. Identifying these motifs is of significant interest for the design of novel B-chain truncated (thus monomeric) analogs of human insulin that may retain activity at the hIR.</p><p>To identify these motifs, we interrogated the mode of binding of Con-Ins T1A and Con-Ins K1 to the human insulin micro-receptor (μIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Menting et al., 2013</xref>). Con-Ins T1A was chosen because of its superior activity profile over DOI and Con-Ins G1 in all in vitro and in vivo activity assays performed here. Con-Ins K1 was selected based on its higher activity over DOI and its very divergent primary structure compared to other venom insulins and the fish and human hormone. Models of these venom insulins that were stable over 100ns of MD indicated that they contain structural elements that act as surrogates for the B chain aromatic triplet of hIns; inclusive of the key hIR αCT residue Phe714. These residues, Tyr B15 and PheB20 of Con-Ins T1A and, LeuB15, LeuB20 and LeuA23 of Con-Ins K1 occupy space which is otherwise occupied by PheB24 in hIns. Notably, in these models these residues adopt similar rotated conformations as those represented within the model of Con-Ins G1 bound to the same elements of the hIR<sup>3</sup>, consistent with the high degree of sequence and modelled structural similarity between Con-Ins T1A and G1, but surprising given the sequence dissimilarity between Con-Ins K1 and G1. However, Con-Ins K1 is significantly less potent than Con-Ins G1 and Con-Ins T1A suggesting that loss of aromatic side chains at positions B15 and B20 results in lower binding affinity and potency at the hIR.</p><p>Comparative sequence alignment of a diverse set of venom insulin sequences allows for the interrogation of other residues that may play a role for vertebrate receptor activation but that may not easily identifiable by homology modeling. Amino acids that are conserved in the most potent venom insulins (<italic>i.e.</italic>, Con-Ins T1A, T1B, T2 and G1) and different from the cone snail’s own signaling insulin include Glu4 (modified to γ-carboxylated Glu), Lys/Arg9, Ser12 in the A chain and Ser9, Glu/Asp10 (Glu modified to γ-carboxylated Glu), Glu/Asp17 (Glu may be modified to γ-carboxylated Glu) in the B chain. Four of these six residues have previously been shown to play a role for receptor activation by human insulin (GluA4, SerA12, HisB10, LeuB17 in human insulin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Meyts, 2015</xref>). Most notably, mutation of HisB10 to Asp in human insulin leads to a dramatic increase in hIR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwartz et al., 1987</xref>). An analog carrying this mutation, insulin X10, was developed as a rapid-acting drug lead for diabetes but was ultimately halted due to its mitogenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>). Cone snails appear to have evolved this strategy of introducing a (double)-negatively charged residue at position B10 to enhance vertebrate receptor activation millions of years ago. It seems likely that additional strategies remain to be uncovered. This could include Lys/Arg9 and γ-carboxylated Glu4 in the A chain and Glu/Asp17 in the B chain.</p><p>Molecular modeling was performed using the human μIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Menting et al., 2013</xref>) that includes structural elements of one of the two known ligand interaction sites on the insulin receptor (site 1 and site 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Meyts, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Whittaker et al., 2008</xref>). Recently published cryo-EM structures of insulin in complex with the human insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scapin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weis et al., 2018</xref>) may provide opportunities to fully investigate the mode of binding of venom insulins with the hIR and inform on additional structural motifs important for receptor activation. Ultimately, incorporating these structural motifs into DOI or other B chain-truncated analogs of human insulin is likely to lead to the generation of new classes of monomeric insulin analogs for the treatment of diabetes.</p><p>Given their streamlined role in prey capture venom insulins may exhibit other advantageous properties that, if uncovered, could inform current drug design efforts. For example, venom insulins may have altered off-rates from the receptor, which would affect the ERK signaling properties and resultant mitogenic activities, or may be more stable in extracellular environments, such as blood. Additionally, it would be interesting to determine if venom insulins lack the negative cooperativity observed for human insulin upon receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Meyts et al., 1978</xref>).</p><p>By investigating the venoms of three fish-hunting cone snail species this study characterized seven unique insulin sequences with pronounced sequence divergence and identified key structural elements for hIR activation. Given the large number of species found in the genus <italic>Conus</italic> (~800 species of which ~ 140 species prey on fish) it is likely that additional insulins with unique <italic>modus operandi</italic> at the hIR will be identified from these venoms in the future providing a continuous resource for the design of new insulin analogs inspired by nature.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Specimen collection, RNA preparation and sequencing</title><p>All studied specimens were collected in the central Philippines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The cleavage mixture was filtered and precipitated with 10 mL of cold methyl-<italic>tert</italic>-butyl ether (MTBE; Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ). The crude peptide was precipitated by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 6 min and washed once with 10 mL cold MTBE. To induce the intramolecular diselenide bond formation (Sec<sup>A6</sup> to Sec<sup>A11</sup>), the washed peptide pellet was dissolved in 50% acetonitrile (ACN, Fisher Scientific; Fair Lawn, NJ) (vol/vol) in water and 2 mL of 100 mM dithiotreitol (DTT, EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) in 1 mL 0.2 M Tris·HCl (Sigma, St Louis, MO) containing 2 mM EDTA (Mallinckrodt, St. Louis, MO), pH 7.5, 1 mL of water was added and vortexed gently, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 hr. It was then quenched with 8% formic acid (vol/vol) (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), diluted with 0.1% TFA (vol/vol) in water, and purified by reversed-phase (RP) HPLC using a semi-preparative C18 Vydac column (218TP510, 250 × 10 mm, 5 μm particle size; Grace, Columbia, MD) eluted with a linear gradient ranging from 10% to 40% solvent B in 30 min at a flow rate 4 mL/min. The HPLC solvents were 0.1% (vol/vol) TFA in water (solvent A) and 0.1% TFA (vol/vol) in 90% aqueous ACN (vol/vol) (solvent B). The eluent was monitored by measuring absorbance at 220 and 280 nm. Purity of the peptide was assessed by analytical C18 Vydac RP-HPLC (218TP54, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size, Grace, Columbia, MD) using a linear gradient ranging from 15% to 45% of solvent B in 30 min with a flow rate 1 mL/min.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Pierre De Meyts as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ken Siddle (Reviewer #2); Jiri Jiracek (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a very interesting study building on the expertise of this group on the biology of venoms from fish hunting cone snails, including the previous demonstration of a shortened insulin-like peptide with unexpectedly high affinity for the fish and human insulin receptors. It has been a tenet in insulin's structural biology (including from this reviewer) that the C-terminal octapeptide of insulin's B-chain is essential for insulin receptor binding and activation. Yet an insulin-like peptide from <italic>Conus Geographus</italic> entirely lacking the end of the B-chain was able to bind to and activate the human insulin receptor. Crystal structure revealed a structural rearrangement where other side chains filled up for the missing key residues. In this paper, the authors report on finding more shortened insulin-like peptides in three <italic>Conus</italic> species with shortened B-chains and great sequence variability, still able to activate the fish and human insulin receptors and cause hypoglycaemia in fish and mice models.</p><p>New snail insulins lower blood glucose in zebrafish with potencies comparable to human insulin. Cone insulins bind to human IR-B with potencies ranging between 15-35% of binding potency of human insulin and they also activate Akt phosphorylation by this receptor and reduce blood glucose in mice in vivo. MD simulations revealed that the mode of binding to human insulin mini-receptor construct is similar to previously published complex of the same receptor with Con-Ins G1. Briefly, the interactions of crucial B-chain C-terminus of insulin, which is lacking in snail insulin, are mimicked by aromatic or aliphatic residues from the central B-chain helix of snail insulin. These residues point to the same binding pocket as PheB24 and help to rescue binding affinity. The authors propose that cone snail insulins with their alternative modes of binding to human receptor could represent a new platform for design of new fast acting insulin for treatment of diabetes.</p><p>The paper is solid, well conceived and well written, we have no major issues with it and think it will be of great interest to scientists involved in the structural biology and evolution of insulin-like peptides. The experimental work has been very well done and the results are presented very clearly and provide a coherent story of considerable interest on several levels, not least the therapeutic implications.</p><p>We have only comments requiring minor modifications.</p><p>1) It would be of interest to include in Figure 1 the sequences of endogenous Cone snail insulins, where available, in addition to human and Zebrafish insulins.</p><p>2) It would be helpful in Figure 1 to annotate in some way key residues in human insulin that have been implicated in receptor binding (including the B-chain FFY motif). The Discussion section, which focusses very much on the role of the FFY motif, might usefully comment on the conservation or otherwise in cone snail venom insulins of other residues implicated in binding of vertebrate insulins to their receptors.</p><p>3) In Figures 3 and 4, the authors should plot on the horizontal axis, and discuss in the text, the actual nM values for ligand concentrations, and nM values for IC50 rather than Log IC50 (they use nM for EC50), to facilitate comparisons.</p><p>4) It is noted (subsection “Binding of venom insulins to the hIR induces downstream insulin signalling”) that there is a broad correlation between potencies for receptor binding and activation 'with some differences'. Those differences appear to be that T2 and K1 have significantly higher and G3 significantly lower activation potency than would be expected from their receptor binding (when compared to human insulin). These differences should be highlighted and discussed in relation to the respective sequences.</p><p>5) It is noted (subsection “Binding of venom insulins to the hIR induces downstream insulin signalling”) that all but K2 and G3 have significantly higher activation potency than hDOI, although all venom insulins lack the FFY motif. Is it possible to say that K2 and G3 lack surrogates for the FFY motif that are used by other venom insulins to enhance receptor binding?</p><p>6) The experiment to test glucose lowering in Zebrafish utilises injections of 65ng venom insulin per g body wt. In terms of the potential role of venom insulins in inducing hypoglycaemic shock to facilitate prey capture (Discussion section), it would be interesting to know the total amount of venom insulin present in cone snails, and the maximum local concentration that might be achieved by release of venom insulin under natural conditions.</p><p>7) How did the authors create the sequence logo in Figure 1? Just by drawing in Corel or using some specific software taking into account the real distribution of amino acids at specific positions? In fact, I have some doubts if the figure is correct; e.g. A8 His is present four-times but is small etc.</p><p>8) Have the authors some data about cone insulin stabilities in human plasma compared with human insulin? It is not excluded that these venom insulins could be substantially more stable.</p><p>9) Add the data for human insulin to Figure 2.</p><p>10) The comparison of receptor binding data (Figure 3) with abilities to activate Akt phosphorylation (Figure 4) could indicate some discrepancy. Binding affinities are 15-36% of human insulin but Akt phosphorylation abilities are 0.5-12% of human insulin. This could show on a partial antagonism. Do the authors think that this disproportion is relevant? In our experience, measuring of phosphorylated Akt is sometimes tricky and can be affected by other factors than only by binding of the ligand to the receptor. I would recommend measuring direct IR autophosphorylation as well and comparing the data.</p><p>11) If possible, I would appreciate if Figure 6 was bigger e.g. could each panel be one column large? I have problems seeing tiny differences between structures in the printed version.</p><p>12) Discussion section: &quot;occupied by the aforementioned aromatic triplet&quot; is not correct. TyrB15 mimics position of human insulin PheB24 only but not PheB25-TyrB26.</p><p>13) Appendix, subsection “PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS”: provide synthetic yields as well.</p><p>14) Appendix, subsection “First intermolecular disulfide bridge formation”. Individual reactions in Methods 1-3 were done at 100 nmolar scale. It means that roughly 0.3 mg of single chain was used. It is very small scale. Why? The reaction does not proceed well in bigger quantities? How many times was it necessary to repeat the reactions to get sufficient amount of material?</p><p>15) Appendix, subsection “Second intermolecular disulfide bridge formation: Iodine (I2) assisted formation of fully folded Con-Ins T1 and Con-Ins K”. The information about peptide quantity in the reaction is missing.</p><p>16) In further work the authors may want to study in more detail the kinetics of receptor binding of these peptides and for example if they trigger the negative cooperativity upon receptor binding or instead antagonize it, which may have interesting functional implications. Also, to investigate other biological effects than hypoglycaemia, e.g. mitogenic signalling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41574.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] 1) It would be of interest to include in Figure 1 the sequences of endogenous Cone snail insulins, where available, in addition to human and Zebrafish insulins.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the sequence of the endogenous signaling insulin from <italic>C. geographus</italic> to the bottom of the sequence alignment and added a sentence to the manuscript highlighting distinct differences between the signaling and venom insulin (subsection “Identification and analysis of venom insulin sequences”: “Notably, venom insulins are distinct from the endogenous signaling insulin expressed in the circumoesophageal nerve ring of cone snails (Figure 1C) (Safavi-Hemami et al., 2016).

In principle, it is possible that Con-Ins G3 and K2 lack surrogates for the FFY motif which would explain their low activation potencies at the hIR. However, there is another likely possibility; these venom insulins may potently activate a member of the insulin receptor family in fish or perhaps even in a specific species of fish, although we are yet to test this directly. We believe that this is a likely scenario since <italic>Conus geographus</italic> and <italic>Conus kinoshitai</italic> are both fish-hunting species and venom insulins specifically evolve to facilitate prey capture (see Safavi-Hemami et al., 2016). Also, when tested in the STZ model in zebrafish, both venom insulins were capable of lowering blood glucose in diabetic fish. Thus, we believe that their low potencies at the hIR may be due to a species-effect rather than a general lack of activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The experiment to test glucose lowering in Zebrafish utilises injections of 65ng venom insulin per g body wt. In terms of the potential role of venom insulins in inducing hypoglycaemic shock to facilitate prey capture (Discussion section), it would be interesting to know the total amount of venom insulin present in cone snails, and the maximum local concentration that might be achieved by release of venom insulin under natural conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that there is currently no reliable method to accurately measure how much insulin is released into the water. However, we agree with the reviewer that this would be of interest to the reader and have tried to provide an estimate of how much venom might be released.</p><p>We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion section: “<italic>Conus geographus</italic> is one of the largest fish-hunting cone snail species (shell length of ~15 cm) that can produce approximately 50 mg of venom in its long and convoluted venom gland. We have previously determined that venom insulins constitute ~ 1/25 of the total venom of this species, corresponding to ~ 2 mg (Safavi-Hemami, Gajewiak et al. 2015). While it remains to be experimentally determined how much venom is released into the water during each predation event, if all venom were injected, 2 mg of venom insulin would be sufficient to effectively lower blood glucose in ~85,500 zebrafish at the concentration used in this study (65 ng insulin/g body weight; ~23 ng per fish).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) How did the authors create the sequence logo in Figure 1? Just by drawing in Corel or using some specific software taking into account the real distribution of amino acids at specific positions? In fact, I have some doubts if the figure is correct; e.g. A8 His is present four-times but is small etc.</p></disp-quote><p>The sequence logo was generated using Geneious software. Only venom insulin sequences were used for the logo (the human and zebrafish sequence were excluded, <italic>i.e.</italic>, HisA8 is only present 3 times). We have added the following sentence to the Figure 1 caption: “The sequence logo shows conservation/variability at each position in venom insulins (generated using Geneious vs 11.1.2 software).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Have the authors some data about cone insulin stabilities in human plasma compared with human insulin? It is not excluded that these venom insulins could be substantially more stable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not determined serum or plasma stability for these venom insulins yet but would predict that they are prone to proteolytic cleavage due to the presence of several predicted proteolytic cleavage sites in all venom insulins tested here. However, given their streamlined role in envenomation and their minimized structure, venom insulin may indeed be more stable than native human insulin, and it would be interesting to measure their serum stability in the future. We have added the following sentence to the Discussion section: “Given their streamlined role in prey capture venom insulins may exhibit other advantageous properties that, if uncovered, could inform current drug design efforts. For example, venom insulins may have altered off-rates from the receptor, which would affect the ERK signaling properties and resultant mitogenic activities, or may be more stable in extracellular environments, such as blood. Additionally, it would be interesting to determine if venom insulins lack the negative cooperativity observed for human insulin upon receptor binding (De Meyts et al., 1978)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Add the data for human insulin to Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously established that injection of 65 ng/g of human insulin lowers blood glucose to 92.0 ± 17.4 mg/dL. We have replotted these values in Figure 2 but emphasize that these were taken from our previous study (subsection “Venom insulins reduce blood glucose in a zebrafish model of diabetes”): “For comparison, 65 ng of human insulin (hIns) /g body weight reduces blood glucose to 92.0 ± 17.4 mg/dL (Safavi-Hemami, Gajewiak et al. 2015).”, and Figure 2 caption: “Data for human Ins (65 ng/g, n=6) was replotted from (Safavi-Hemami, Gajewiak et al. 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The comparison of receptor binding data (Figure 3) with abilities to activate Akt phosphorylation (Figure 4) could indicate some discrepancy. Binding affinities are 15-36% of human insulin but Akt phosphorylation abilities are 0.5-12% of human insulin. This could show on a partial antagonism. Do the authors think that this disproportion is relevant? In our experience, measuring of phosphorylated Akt is sometimes tricky and can be affected by other factors than only by binding of the ligand to the receptor. I would recommend measuring direct IR autophosphorylation as well and comparing the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be advantageous to investigate receptor activation in a more holistic manner and, following the reviewer’s comment, we set out to determine direct IR autophosphorylation for the most potent insulins, Con-Ins G1 and Con-Ins T1A (using the HTRF Phospho-IR β (Tyr1150/1151) kit from Cisbio, see revised Materials and methods section). We have included this data in the Supporting information (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). For these two venom insulins IR phosphorylation appears to follow Akt signaling potencies, where venom insulins are ~ 10-15 times less potent than hIns (EC50 hIns: 9.01 nM; Con-Ins G1: 135.5 nM and Con-Ins T1A: 89.4 nM, 95% CI values provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>However, we found this assay difficult to perform as it was very sensitive to ligand treatment times (very low signal after 20 min and very high signal variability when treatment was shorter than 15 min). Even at the optimized ligand treatment time of 15 min there was high signal variability and the signal for hIns plateaued at the 3 highest concentrations used (black arrows in Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We would therefore like to keep this data in the Supporting Information. An explanation of the limitations of the assay (as experienced in our hands) is described in the Figure caption.</p><p>We do not think that venom insulins partially antagonize the receptor but do not have data to support this yet. In future studies we would like to more thoroughly investigate the time course of Akt phosphorylation. Preliminary observations suggest that Akt phosphorylation is more similar to that of human insulin at earlier time points (quenching at 10-15 min post insulin exposure versus 30 min as used in the current study and in Menting et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) If possible, I would appreciate if Figure 6 was bigger e.g. could each panel be one column large? I have problems seeing tiny differences between structures in the printed version.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the panel size for Figure 6 to allow easier visibility of the structure and labels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Discussion section: &quot;occupied by the aforementioned aromatic triplet&quot; is not correct. TyrB15 mimics position of human insulin PheB24 only but not PheB25-TyrB26.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected to read “occupy space which is otherwise occupied by PheB24 in hIns”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Appendix, subsection “PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS”, provide synthetic yields as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Synthetic yields are now provided in the revised Appendix (Tables in subsection “PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Appendix, subsection “First intermolecular disulfide bridge formation”. Individual reactions in Methods 1-3 were done at 100 nmolar scale. It means that roughly 0.3 mg of single chain was used. It is very small scale. Why? The reaction does not proceed well in bigger quantities? How many times was it necessary to repeat the reactions to get sufficient amount of material?</p></disp-quote><p>Individual A and B chains of each insulin were prepared on different days and aliquoted at 100 nmol. For sheer practical reasons, several parallel reactions each containing 100 nmol of A and B chain were mixed to form heterodimers. These were then pooled and purified together. We anticipate this method to work on larger than 100 nmol scale but have not tested this in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Appendix, subsection “Second intermolecular disulfide bridge formation: Iodine (I2) assisted formation of fully folded Con-Ins T1 and Con-Ins K”. The information about peptide quantity in the reaction is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>This information is now provided in the revised Appendix (subsection “Second intermolecular disulfide bridge formation: Iodine (I2) assisted formation of fully folded Con-Ins T1 and Con-Ins K”):” 250 μL of the iodine mixture was added to 100 nmol insulin-dimer dissolved in 250 μL of 0.1% TFA (final peptide concentration: 200 μM for Con-Ins T1A, Con-Ins T1B and Con-Ins K1; and 500 μM for Con-Ins K2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) In further work the authors may want to study in more detail the kinetics of receptor binding of these peptides and for example if they trigger the negative cooperativity upon receptor binding or instead antagonize it, which may have interesting functional implications. Also, to investigate other biological effects than hypoglycaemia, e.g. mitogenic signalling.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that these would be interesting aspects to explore in future studies and have added a sentence to the end of our Discussion section (see response to comment 8 above).</p></body></sub-article></article>
