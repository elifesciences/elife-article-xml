It is unknown whether growth in utero, as indexed by birth weight (BW), relates consistently to lifespan brain characteristics and changes, and to what extent these influences are of a genetic or environmental nature. Here we show remarkably stable and lifelong positive associations between BW and cortical surface area and volume across and within developmental, aging and lifespan longitudinal samples (N = 5794, 4–82 y of age, w/386 monozygotic twins, followed for up to 8.3 y w/12,088 brain MRIs). In contrast, no consistent effect of BW on brain changes was observed. Partly environmental effects were indicated by analysis of twin BW discordance. In conclusion, the influence of prenatal growth on cortical topography is stable and reliable through the lifespan. This early-life factor appears to influence the brain by association of brain reserve, rather than brain maintenance. Thus, fetal influences appear omnipresent in the spacetime of the human brain throughout the human lifespan. Optimizing fetal growth may increase brain reserve for life, also in aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>birth weight</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>771375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walhovd</surname><given-names>Kristine B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>313440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walhovd</surname><given-names>Kristine B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>283634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fjell</surname><given-names>Anders Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>725025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fjell</surname><given-names>Anders Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>732592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walhovd</surname><given-names>Kristine B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norwegian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>324882</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vidal-Pineiro</surname><given-names>Didac</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Greater early developmental growth, as indexed by birth weight, relates to greater cortical volume and area in a stable way through the human lifespan.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is established that a substantial portion of functional variation through the lifespan, including in older age, is of neurodevelopmental origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovacs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fjell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bale, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muller et al., 2014</xref>). Evidence converges on early-life factors being important for normal individual differences in brain, mental health, and cognition across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walhovd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vidal-Pineiro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dooley et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elliott et al., 2021</xref>), as well as risk of psychiatric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>) and neurodegenerative disease in older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tuovinen et al., 2013</xref>). Obtaining reliable indicators of individual early-life factors is a major challenge. In this regard, birth weight (BW) stands out as a solid available measure. BW reflects fetal and maternal genetic, but also other in utero environmental factors affecting fetal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaumont et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willis et al., 2022</xref>), including brain growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walhovd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raznahan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halevy et al., 2021</xref>). By now, a series of studies have established that BW relates positively to mental health, cognitive function, and brain characteristics, including neuroanatomical volumes and cortical surface area as measured in different age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walhovd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raznahan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wheater et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eriksson et al., 2000</xref>). However, it is unknown whether and how BW relates to brain characteristics through the lifespan, how consistent effects are within and across samples, whether BW is associated with lifespan brain changes, and to what extent lifespan effects of BW on the brain are of an environmental, rather than genetic nature. We address these questions, which are critical to understand how and when the human brain can be influenced through the lifespan, in the present study. On an overarching level, this study also addresses current debates in the field of lifespan cognitive neuroscience, namely (1) whether consistent, reproducible relationships between phenotypes relevant for mental health and function and inter-individual differences in brain characteristics can be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marek et al., 2022</xref>), and (2) to what extent the effects found in and ascribed to brain aging may actually reflect early-life influences, rather than longitudinal changes in older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vidal-Pineiro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walhovd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walhovd et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>There are at least two different ways by which the effects of fetal growth, as indexed by BW, could work to produce the brain effects observed so far. (1) In line with a brain reserve model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katzman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schofield et al., 1997</xref>), higher BW could be associated with greater brain growth before birth. This seems likely, given that the effects are seen also in young populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walhovd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raznahan et al., 2012</xref>). However, from the so far largely cross-sectional, or mixed models, several questions remain unanswered: Is this a fixed effect at the time of birth? Does higher BW also have carry-over effects to greater development in childhood and adolescence? In line with a brain maintenance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nyberg et al., 2012</xref>), is higher BW associated with better maintenance of brain volumes in the face of age-related changes in older adulthood? While effects are found in young populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walhovd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raznahan et al., 2012</xref>), reduced atrophy in aging is a possible additional effect of higher BW that should be investigated, given the known relationships between birth size and brain volumes also in older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muller et al., 2014</xref>). The possible effects of BW on later brain development and brain maintenance in adulthood can only be investigated by longitudinal brain imaging spanning all stages of human life. Furthermore, as BW normally reflects both genetic and prenatal environmental factors, and an environmental BW contribution to brain differences has been shown in young monozygotic (MZ) twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raznahan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halevy et al., 2021</xref>), we need to study brain effects of BW discordance in MZ twins in this context to disentangle possible non-genetic contributions of BW through the lifespan.</p><p>We hypothesized that there are persistent effects of BW on brain characteristics through the lifespan, and hence, that these would be consistent within and across samples of varying age and origin. We test this in a Norwegian sample covering the lifespan (Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition [LCBC]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walhovd et al., 2020</xref>), the US developmental sample Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garavan et al., 2018</xref>), and the older adult UK Biobank (UKB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nobis et al., 2019</xref>) sample. The associations of BW and cortical surface, thickness, volume, and their change were investigated vertex-wise in a total of 5794 persons (of whom 5718 with repeated scans and 386 MZ twins) with 12,088 longitudinal observations, 4–82 y of age at baseline, followed for up to ~8.3 y. Based on previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walhovd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raznahan et al., 2012</xref>), we hypothesized such effects to be driven primarily by positive associations between BW and cortical area, with lesser, if any, effects on cortical thickness. We expected positive effects on cortical volume corresponding to positive effects on cortical area. We hypothesized that effects would be stable, so that BW mainly affects the brain ‘intercept’ and does not relate much to brain changes. That is, we hypothesize a threshold model, whereby higher BW yields greater cortical area, and hence cortical volume, to begin with, rather than a maintenance model, whereby higher BW serves to protect against atrophy in aging. Moreover, we hypothesized that effects could not be explained solely by genetics, so that BW discordance in a subsample of MZ twins would also result in differences in brain characteristics through the lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Cortical surfaces were reconstructed from T1-weighted anatomical MRIs by use of FreeSurfer v6.0 (LCBC and UKB) and 7.1.

Vertex-wise analyses were run with spatiotemporal linear mixed effects modeling (FreeSurfer v6.0.0 ST-MLE package) to assess regional variation in the relationships between BW and cortical structure and its change. All analyses were run with baseline age, sex, scanner site, and time (scan interval) as covariates. For ABCD specifically, ethnicity was also included as a covariate. For consistency of multiple comparison corrections across analyses, the results were thresholded at a cluster-forming threshold of 2.0, p&lt;0.01, with a cluster-wise probability of p&lt;0.0.25 (p&lt;.05/2 hemispheres).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The lifespan relationship of BW and cortical volume, surface area, and thickness</title><p>Associations of BW and cortical characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (for the right hemisphere) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> (for both hemispheres). Across all cohorts, widespread positive associations were observed between BW and cortical area. These were highly consistent across lifespan (LCBC), developmental (ABCD), and aging (UKB) cohorts, and there were bilateral overlapping effects across most of the cortical mantle. As expected, BW had, in general, lesser effects on cortical thickness and no significant effects on thickness were observed in the UKB. There were, however, some lateral-positive and medial-negative effects in the LCBC and ABCD cohorts. We note that corresponding effects with increased medial frontal and occipital cortical thickness have been found associated with white matter alterations (reduced FA) in young adults born preterm with very low BW compared to term-born controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rimol et al., 2019</xref>).

Importantly, this information was lacking for the older participants, that is, this information is not available in detail for UKB, and since this information for the LCBC was drawn from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN), only established in 1967, this was not available for the older part of the LCBC sample either. The majority of the LCBC sample and the ABCD sample had information on gestational length, however (LCBC: n = 514; gestational length in weeks: M = 40.0 wk, SD = 1.9, range = 25–44; ABCD: n = 3306; weeks premature: M = 1.0 weeks premature, SD = 2.1, range = 0.0–13.0). Controlling for gestational age in these subsamples had relatively little effect on results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, as expected with reduced power in the LCBC sample, the effects in this analysis were somewhat narrower. Effects in ABCD, where almost all participants were retained for analysis, showed no sign of decrease with control for gestational length. When restricting all samples to participants with BW between 2.5 and 5.0 kg, results were also very similar (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

In plots of LCBC data, where the number of follow-ups varied, and a select portion had longer follow-up, it appeared that the effect of BW was reduced over time in these restricted regions.

Since the UKB and ABCD samples here consisted of samples having two time points only, whereas LCBC consisted of a mix of number of follow-ups over a longer time period, there might be sample-specific selection effects also regarding other characteristics than BW that can influence these effects in LCBC.

The effect of 1 SD lower BW on cortical volume was 6708 mm<sup>3</sup>, 8466 mm<sup>3</sup>, and 5980 mm<sup>3</sup> in LCBC, UKB, and ABCD, respectively. This was equal to 1.2, 1.6, and 1.1% lesser cortex with 600–700 g lower BW for each sample, respectively. In the context of brain aging, this would be a substantial effect, higher than most risk/protective factors for dementia outlined by the Lancet Commission on dementia prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Livingston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Livingston et al., 2017</xref>), which include smoking, education, obesity, and alcohol among others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walhovd et al., 2023</xref> for a summary of the different effect sizes).

Especially, BW was associated with cortical area and volume in an age and time-invariant fashion. The robustness of this effect is quite remarkable, given the wealth of different influences individuals meet after birth, which are repeatedly assumed and reported to have a major impact on the brain through the protracted human lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Livingston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Livingston et al., 2017</xref>). It is also in quantitative terms outstanding compared to the consistency of cortical topographies reported for other phenotypical factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marek et al., 2022</xref>). This is also special for a phenotype known to be environmentally influenced, unlike biologically hardcoded phenotypes such as sex or age, for which there are known brain-wide association studies (BWAS) patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kharabian Masouleh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Typically, other factors relating to later socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and health get the most attention in adult and aging brain research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Livingston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Livingston et al., 2017</xref>). Such factors, which are then targeted for prevention and intervention at different stages of the life course, often do not show consistent relationships to brain characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walhovd et al., 2022</xref>), may not actually be causal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walhovd et al., 2022</xref>), and may themselves be related to prenatal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eriksson et al., 2000</xref>). Another phenotype that obviously, like BW, reflects both genetic and environmental influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaumont et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willis et al., 2022</xref>) is body mass index (BMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Couto Alves et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent BWAS patterns have been reported for BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kharabian Masouleh et al., 2019</xref>). BW stands out as the single chronological earliest phenotype, and besides BMI, BW appears to have the most replicable and consistent relations to cortical morphology, as shown here both across and within samples. It has been claimed that smaller-than-expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread replication failures for BWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marek et al., 2022</xref>). However, this is necessarily a question of which phenotypes are the most relevant to relate to brain characteristics. Also, the temporal order of factors needs to be considered if causal interpretations are to be made. Chronologically later factors necessarily do not cause earlier ones. While we cannot claim that BW itself causes the cortical characteristics observed in aging, the cortical variance explained by BW after one decade, and seven or eight decades of life alike, is unlikely to be explained by influences only present at some point in adulthood or aging. BW, as further discussed below, depends on genetic, as well as prenatal environmental influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaumont et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willis et al., 2022</xref>), which likely have causal effects on early brain morphological features. Here we find that these effects are substantial also in the aging brain.</p><p>We calculated that a BW difference of 1 SD (about 600 g) equaled a difference in cortical volume on the order of 1.1–1.6% in these cohorts. This is a quite big effect of a magnitude relevant for explaining a substantial portion of the differences typically seen between patients with neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases and healthy controls. As noted, BW differences have been reported for neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactovity disorder (ADHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Momany et al., 2018</xref>), and also other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia or more general psychopathology, with the cortical effects detected not invariably being very large in absolute terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2022</xref>). There is a limit to the range of variation that can apply to human cortical volumes, in general, (e.g., virtually none have cortical volumes below 0.45 or above 0.65 l). In terms of sample representativity, one may assume that there can be a restriction relative to the actual range of human cortical volume variation as the present samples specifically are largely healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carretta and Ree, 2022</xref>). Much of the differences within this limited range of variation are explained by the factors we controlled for, such as age and sex. With the present effect, on the restricted range of variation, combined with big samples, it is obvious that BW differences of much less than our example magnitude (600 g) may be detectable in the cortical morphology of patients versus controls. In the context of aging and neurodegenerative change, the estimated cortical effect of ≈600 g difference in BW is of a magnitude many times the annual cortical reduction estimated to take place from, for example, 50–60 y in the adult cohorts. This is a substantial effect in brain imaging and may illuminate why metrics such as ‘brain age’, assumed to index aging-related processes, may rather largely capture variance already determined at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vidal-Pineiro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wagen et al., 2022</xref>). Neglecting this especially consistent and early factor is likely to lead to a substantial portion of human brain variance being either erroneously ascribed to factors only present at later life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vidal-Pineiro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walhovd et al., 2023</xref>) or left unaccounted for.</p><p>The solidity, replicability, and universality of effects as shown here for a partly environmentally influenced metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaumont et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willis et al., 2022</xref>) appear exceptional in human brain imaging. The within-sample replicability results are not fully comparable to other studies assessing the replicability of brain–phenotype associations due to analytical differences (e.g., sample size, multiple-comparison correction method) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kharabian Masouleh et al., 2019</xref>). Still, these results too clearly show that the rate of replicability of BW associations with cortical area and volume is comparable to benchmark brain–phenotype associations such as age and BMI with brain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kharabian Masouleh et al., 2019</xref>). The BW–cortical volume and area associations may be among the topographically broadest and most consistent effects so far seen as stable across the lifespan of the human brain. The three cohorts studies differ on a range of features known to be highly and reliably related to cortical characteristics, first and foremost age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fjell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kharabian Masouleh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kharabian Masouleh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schnack, 2019</xref>), but also country of origin and representativity of the populations from which they are drawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garavan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stamatakis et al., 2021</xref>). Yet there is a comparable topography of BW effects across the samples. This is so despite the samples collectively spanning the entire human age range, within which there are always substantial age-related changes in cortical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fjell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mills et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Storsve et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tamnes et al., 2010</xref>). The present results thus indicate that fetal growth influences an offset of brain reserve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katzman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schofield et al., 1997</xref>) and that this brain reserve effect is persistent and stable through the lifespan.</p><p>In contrast, the cortical maps capturing <italic>change</italic> in cortical structure associated with BW were not robust across datasets; that is, the most positive and negative association with BW on cortical change did not overlap at all between the different cohorts. While there was evidence from ABCD that BW affected regional cortical development in the narrow age range covered, there were limited and no consistent effects of BW on cortical change across cohorts. Importantly, there was no indication whatsoever that BW could be associated with better brain maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nyberg et al., 2012</xref>) in the face of age-related changes in older adulthood. Thus, the data seem to indicate that any effect of BW on cortical <italic>change</italic> may be of relatively more temporary nature. The ‘offset effect’ of BW, on the other hand, appears persistent and consistent, especially in terms of stable and widespread effects on cortical area and volume across the lifespan.</p><p>The sensitivity analyses indicate that the associations between BW and cortical characteristics are seen irrespective of not only sex and age, but also education, head size (ICV), and cases of abnormal BW. Such patterns could point to an underlying genetic pleiotropy of BW and brain characteristics. Interestingly, however, recent findings indicate that the effects of exposure to environmental adversity on epigenetic programming in aging may be localized to the in utero period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmitz and Duque, 2022</xref>). The effects of BW discordance in MZ twins in this context align with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halevy et al., 2021</xref>) pointing to also non-genetic, that is, environmental, influences in the womb, associated with the pattern observed for cortical area effects. These analyses also account for multiple possibly confounding variables that could represent a mix of genetic-environmental effects, such as parental socioeconomic status, parity, or prenatal exposures shared between twins in the same womb such as maternal smoking or use of alcohol.</p><p>The neural basis for the observed association cannot readily be ascertained from human imaging studies tracking change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walhovd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walhovd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raznahan et al., 2012</xref>). While the ‘fetal origins hypothesis’, proposing that cardiovascular disease in adulthood is related to undernourishment in utero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barker, 1995</xref>), is well known, there has been focus on ‘brain-sparing’ adaptations under such conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eriksson et al., 2000</xref>). However, our finding that early human development in utero appears to be associated with a persistent and stable brain reserve effect is largely in correspondence with what is known of human nervous system development and change through the lifespan: while synaptogenesis, synaptic remodeling, and myelination are known to be protracted processes long after infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greenough et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huttenlocher, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petanjek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yeung et al., 2014</xref>), numerous processes in brain development appear to be exclusively or almost exclusively happening before birth. For instance, neurogenesis takes place almost only in fetal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rakic, 1988</xref>). Even if controversies remain, evidence suggests that any adult human neurogenesis must be severely restricted in location and amount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhardwaj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paredes et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, human beings appear to be born with almost all cortical neurons they will have through life, and neuronal migration and differentiation are also defined early, by the place and time the neuron is born during fetal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rakic, 1988</xref>). Factors that affect placental function and uterine and/or umbilical blood flow on a chronic basis may lead to restricted fetal growth, including brain growth, and given the timing of brain development, it may not be surprising that effects would be stable across years. Animal studies of chronic placental insufficiency have shown effects on brain development that persist with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rehn et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, the relationship between BW and cortical characteristics in the normal population could likely have a twofold etiology: it is likely to in part be based on normal variation in genetically determined body and brain size, but it also may be based on variations in environmental prenatal conditions, yielding differences in optimality of early brain development persisting through the lifespan.</p><p>These results indicate that there is potential to increase brain reserve throughout the lifespan, also in aging, by combating factors affecting fetal growth negatively. While it is unknown to what extent results from these specific US and European samples can be generalized to other populations, the current potential to improve prenatal factors may be especially high in low- and middle-income countries, where the demographic changes will also be more marked in terms of the aging population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">WHO, 2019</xref>). About 200 million children in developing countries are not meeting their growth potential, and improving the prenatal environment is likely important to help children reach their full potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGovern, 2019</xref>) – and ultimately also to help them stay above a functional threshold into older age. Also in industrialized countries, including the United States, environmental factors are associated with BW. The opioid epidemic is increasingly affecting pregnant women, and in utero opioid exposure is associated with higher risk of fetal growth restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azuine et al., 2019</xref>). Among highly common exposures, air pollution may, for instance, be of relevance. Recently, local traffic congestion-pollution exposure during pregnancy, independently of a series of maternal sociodemographic characteristics, was associated with reductions in term BW in a large US sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Willis et al., 2022</xref>). Programs and policies to limit such environmental factors reducing fetal growth may thus enhance brain reserve and ultimately prevent more people from falling below a functional threshold even in advanced age.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>Some limitations should be noted. First, for most of the participants, only self-reported or parent-reported BW was available. While there was a very high correlation between registry and self-reported BW in LCBC, this is a possible source of noise. Second, pregnancy-related information of possible relevance, such as gestational age at birth, complications, method of delivery, maternal disorders, smoking, and alcohol and drug intake, was not available across all participants of the different samples, and was thus not analyzed here or, as for gestational age at birth, could only in part be controlled for. Some of these factors may be systematically related to BW and may thus represent confounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knickmeyer et al., 2017</xref>). There were some premature and very low BW participants in the samples, and these conditions are associated with known reductions in cortical volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thompson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>). However, the analyses controlling for gestational age, as well as on the restricted range of BW – excluding very preterm and very/extremely low BW children – and the analysis controlling for education, which may again relate to some of these factors, showed very similar results. It is unknown to what extent the BW of participants reflect their individual fetal growth potential as a fetus with normal BW can be growth restricted and a fetus with low BW can have appropriate growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). We believe, however, that possible differences in such factors would likely serve to decrease consistency of results and not lead to inflated estimates of consistency.</p><p>Finally, it is beyond the scope of the present study to relate BW and cortical characteristics through the lifespan with cognitive functional differences. While all the cohorts included here also have some measures of cognitive function, they vary across samples. Furthermore, tests of cognitive function are, relative to brain imaging metrics, much more prone to test-specific test–retest effects. Thus, assessing the stability of effects across cohorts would be challenging. We note that, for example, in twins, even though there are data to suggest a relationship between BW differences and neuroanatomical features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raznahan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halevy et al., 2021</xref>), and BW differences and differences in cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strohmaier et al., 2015</xref>), twins discordant for BW and neuroanatomical features may not show significant differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Halevy et al., 2021</xref>). There are many factors that influence cortical volume that have nothing to do with either age or differences in general brain function, including sex or overall differences in height. From the present data, we cannot draw conclusions about the effects on individual differences in cognitive function or its change across the lifespan. Indeed, part of BW effects on brain structure can be explained by overall somatic growth. This study does not provide one specific mechanism by which BW is associated with brain structure. Indeed, variance explained by different mechanisms may vary across samples. Further studies are needed to illuminate such questions; the present study is primarily designed to answer the question of whether associations of BW and cortical structure are consistently found throughout the lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current results show that a simple congenital marker of early developmental growth, BW, is consistently associated with lifespan brain characteristics. While some significant effects of BW on cortical change patterns were also observed, these were regionally smaller and showed no consistency across cohorts. In conclusion, while greater early human developmental growth does not appear to promote brain maintenance in aging, it does, in terms of greater cortical volume and area, relate positively to brain reserve through the lifespan. Thus, there appears to be an omnipresence of fetal factors in the spacetime of the human brain through the lifespan. This indicates a potential to increase brain reserve at all ages, including in aging, by combating factors affecting fetal growth negatively. Given the exceptional consistency and broadness of this cortical topographical effect, it should be taken into account in studies of brain research on individual differences, whether the brains studied are those of 8- or 80-year-olds.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Samples</title><p>In total, longitudinal data for 5718 persons with 12,088 MRI scans from the LCBC, ABCD, and UKB studies were included in the analyses. For UKB, the dataset released in February 2020 was used. For ABCD, the Data Release 3.0 was used (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.15154/1528313">http://dx.doi.org/10.15154/1528313</ext-link> for this NDA (National Institutes if Health (NIH) Data Archive) study).

We ran vertex-wise analyses to assess regional variation in the relationships between BW and cortical structure; area, thickness, and volume at baseline and longitudinally. In all models, we included baseline age, sex, and scanner site, as well as time (scan interval) as covariates. For ABCD specifically, ethnicity was also included as a covariate as this sample is recruited to have and has ethnic variation, whereas the other samples entered in the present analyses had little ethnic variation (i.e., in UKB, &gt;98% of participants included in the present sample defined themselves as British/Irish/Any other white background; in LCBC, this information was unfortunately not encoded for all, but the sample was mainly of white background). In further models, we additionally included education as a covariate. General linear models were run in turn using as predictors: BW, the interaction term birth weight × scan interval, and the interaction term of baseline age × time (scan interval) × BW. When analyses were run with baseline age × scan interval × BW as predictor, the interaction terms of baseline age × scan interval, scan interval × BW, and BW × baseline age were included as additional covariates. Standardized values were used in analyses for age, scan interval, BW, BW discordance, and education. For consistency of multiple comparison corrections across analyses, the results were thresholded at a cluster-forming threshold of 2.0, p&lt;0.01, with a cluster-wise probability of p&lt;0.0.25 (p&lt;0.05/2 hemispheres). Finally, models were rerun only including participants with BWs between 2.5 and 5.0 kg to assess whether relationships were upheld also when excluding low and high BWs.

Beyond sample selection, all parameters remained identical as described in the main analysis. Vertex-wise replicability was determined by the proportion of multiple comparison-corrected results across the different subsamples. In the confirmatory analysis, we assessed the proportion of significant vertices obtained in each exploratory (train) analysis that was also deemed significant – and in the same direction – in the remaining (test; 50%) subsample (p&lt;0.05 uncorrected). Subsamples without significant results were not considered (no results only in cortical thickness analyses).

However, the registry data on birth weight connected to this sample are not shareable by the authors, as these data are owned by the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fhi.no/en/hn/health-registries/medical-birth-registry-of-norway/medical-birth-registry-of-norway/">https://www.fhi.no/en/hn/health-registries/medical-birth-registry-of-norway/medical-birth-registry-of-norway/</ext-link>, the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/">https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/</ext-link>, and the Norwegian Twin Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fhi.no/en/more/health-studies/norwegian-twin-registry/">https://www.fhi.no/en/more/health-studies/norwegian-twin-registry/</ext-link> so that any access to data must be approved by them.

Registry (MBRN) of Norway, the Norwegian Twin Registry (NTR), and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). MoBa is supported by the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services and the Ministry of Education and Research. We are grateful to all the participating families in Norway who take part in this ongoing cohort study. Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://abcdstudy.org">https://abcdstudy.org</ext-link>), held in the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). This is a multisite, longitudinal study designed to recruit more than 10,000 children aged 9–10 y and follow them over 10 y into early adulthood. A listing of participating sites and a complete listing of the study investigators can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://abcdstudy.org/consortium_members/">https://abcdstudy.org/consortium_members/</ext-link>. ABCD consortium investigators designed and implemented the study and/or provided data but did not necessarily participate in the analysis or writing of this report. This article reflects the views of the authors and may not reflect the opinions or views of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or ABCD consortium investigators. The ABCD data used in this report came from doi:10.15154/1504041 and 10.15154/1520591.

The authors separately consider BW associations with the &quot;height&quot; of cortical anatomy trajectories (intercept effects) vs. BW associations with trajectory shape. They authors also distinguish between BW associations with cortical surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT), which together determine cortical volume (CV). Prior studies have firmly established robust positive associations between BW and cortical SA, but this study adds evidence for the protracted lifespan persistence of these associations, and the degree to which BW associations with cortical change over time are much weaker.</p><p>The study has several strengths including: clearly motivation of this work in the Introduction and contextualization of the results in Discussion; use of three large neuroimaging datasets; inclusion of sensible sensitivity analyses; disambiguation of SA and CT findings; and use of formal spatial analysis to quantify the reproducibility of effects across cohorts.</p><p>The primary way in which this work seeks to extend beyond established findings is to determine if BW is associated with differences in cortical change over time. The results presented clearly establish that such BW-change associations are much more localized and less consistent across cohorts that BW-intercept associations. The authors use multiple complementary approaches to verify the robustness of this inference to dataset subsampling and variation in statistical methods.</p><p>Overall, this work provides a valuable new data point in our understanding of the profound and protracted influences that prenatal developmental features can have on postnatal outcomes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86812.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study focuses on the association between weight at birth and area, volume and thickness of the cerebral cortex measured at timepoints throughout the lifespan.

Analyses are performed separately in three cohorts: ABCD, UKBB and LCBC and the pattern of associations compared by means of spatial correlations. They find that BW is positively associated with cortical area (and, as a consequence, cortical volume) across most of the cortex, with effect sizes greatest in frontal and temporal regions. These associations remain largely unchanged when accounting for age, sex, length of gestation and (in one cohort) ethnicity. Variations due to MRI scanner and site are accounted for statistically. Measures are taken to determine within sample replicability through split-half analyses.</p><p>The authors conclude that BW, as a marker of early development, is associated with brain characteristics throughout the lifespan.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1’s main concerns revolved around the evidential strength of the study’s conclusion that age-specific effects of birth weight on brain structure are more localized and less consistent across cohorts than age-uniform, stable effects. Specifically, the reviewer points out the evidence (or lack of such) for age-specific effects. We have rearticulated as a “bullet-point summarization” the reviewer’s concerns for a better response (please, see the original reviewer’s response in the annexed document). We thank the reviewer for his/her comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concern #1: No direct statistical comparisons are conducted between samples (beyond the spin-tests).</p></disp-quote><p>In the initial version of the manuscript, the spin-tests represented a key test since they compared the spatial distribution of birth weight effects across samples. In the revised manuscript, we additionally perform a replicability analysis across samples both for birth weight effects on brain characteristics and on brain change in a similar fashion as described for the within-sample analysis. The results of these analyses provide complementary evidence of robust associations of birth weight effects on cortical characteristics (for area and volume, less so for thickness) and of unreliable associations of birth weight on cortical change. These analyses are briefly mentioned in the main document and fully described as supplementary information. Briefly, the effects of birth weight on cortical area and cortical volume showed high (exploratory and confirmatory) replicability while replicability was almost nonexistent for the effects of birth weight on cortical change. See below, under Reviewer #1, concern #2, for a description of the changes in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concern #2: The differential composition of samples in terms of age distribution leads to the possibility that lack of results is explained by methodological differences.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised version of the manuscript provides now a within-sample replicability analysis of the birth weight effects on cortical change. This analysis addresses the reviewer’s concern as the lack of replicability in this analysis cannot be attributed to sample or methodological differences. We thank the reviewer for suggesting this analysis which provides further quantification of the (lack of) robustness of the birth weight effects on cortical change. See below for changes in the revised version of the manuscript concerning additional replicability analyses which were carried out as a response to reviewer #1 concerns #1 and #2.</p><p>pp. 12-3. “Additionally, we performed replicability analyses both across and within samples to further investigate the robustness of the effects of birth weight on cortical characteristics and cortical change. Split-half analyses within datasets were performed, to investigate the replicability of significant effects 36,37 of BW on cortical characteristics within samples (refer to Figure 1). These analyses further confirmed that the significant effects were largely replicable for volume and area, but not for thickness (see Supplementary Figure 11). Split-half analyses of BW on cortical change (refer to Figure 2) showed, in general, a very low degree of replicability on the three different cortical measures. See Supplementary Table 3. Replicability across datasets showed a similar pattern, that is, replicability was high for the effect of brain weight on cortical characteristics but very low for the effects of cortical change. See Supplementary Table 4 for stats. See Supplementary statistical methods for a full description of the analyses. These analyses provide complementary evidence of robust associations of BW with cortical area and volume – but not cortical change - across and within samples.”</p><p>p. 41. “For each dataset and cortical measure, we assessed the effects of birth weight on cortical structure and cortical change (…)”</p><p>p. 42. “Across samples replicability was performed as described in the within-sample replicability analysis (i.e., we assessed the exploratory and confirmatory replicability) except that split-half was not performed - the three datasets were compared with each other - and the analyses were performed in the original fsaverage space.”</p><p>pp. 54-55. “The exploratory replicability of birth weight on cortical change was negligible across datasets and measures [.00 (.00), .00 (.00), .00 (.00) for area, .02 (.09), .00 (.02), .01 (.03) for volume, and .01 (.05), .01 (.14), .00 (.01) for thickness] while confirmatory replicability was generally poor, except for the ABCD dataset [.02 (.05), .68 (.35), .00 (.00) for area, .08 (.14), .56 (.25), .00 (.02) for volume, and .37 (.26), .60 (.27), .01 (.03) for thickness] (see Supplementary Table 3).</p><p>These results are not fully comparable to other studies assessing the replicability of brain phenotype associations due to analytical differences (e.g. sample size, multiple-comparison correction method)20,36, yet clearly show that the rate of replicability of BW associations with cortical area and volume are comparable to benchmark brain-phenotype associations such as body-mass index and age68. Lower levels of replicability in the LCBC subsample are likely attributable to higher sample variability (e.g. increased age span). Kinship may lead to inflated patterns of replicability within the ABCD cohort. Confirmatory replicability is, also, to some degree, affected by sample size, and thus the estimates of confirmatory replicability may be somewhat inflated in the ABCD dataset.</p><p>Finally, the degree of across-sample replicability was high for the effects of birth weight on cortical area and volume (average confirmatory replicability = .96 and .93), low for thickness (.27), and negligible for the effects of birth weight on cortical change (.03, .06, and .06). See further information in Supplementary Table 4.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concern #3: Some datasets have a narrow age range precluding the detection of age-related effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe concern #3 is a major problem since timebirth weight refers to a within subject contrast, e.g., longitudinal-only-based contrast. Birth weight, even when self reported, is a highly reliable measure and the sample sizes are relatively large (n = 635, 1759, and 3324 unique individuals). Note that the smaller dataset does have longer follow-up times and more observations per participant, increasing the reliability of estimations in individual change. Structural MRI measures have very high reliability. Clearly, longitudinal brain change is less reliable, yet the present sample size and the high reliability of birth weight should provide enough statistical power to capture even small time-varying effects of birth weight on brain structure. Note as well that in each model age is treated as a covariate. Rather, the consistency of timebirth weight (that is, the effects of birth weight on cortical change) is assessed with split-half replications within and across samples. In this methodological pipeline, a narrow age range for a given dataset, if anything, may constitute an advantage. We have clarified the statistical model (see changes in the revised manuscript, referred to in response to reviewer #1, concern #5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concern #4 The modeling strategy does not allow for non-linear interaction between age and BW suggesting the use of spline models instead in a mega-analytical fashion.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we agree that some - if not most - brain structures follow non-linear trajectories throughout life. In the present study, age regressors are used only for accounting for variance in the data rather than capturing any effect of interest. Rather, it is the time*birth weight regressor that captures age-varying changes in brain structure. Time reflects within-subject follow-up time. We believe non-linear modeling of age will only account for additional variance (compared to linear models) in the LCBC dataset given the dataset’s wider age range, while it will not have any consequential effect in the ABCD and UKB datasets (as predicted in the provisional response). In any case, we recognize it as a valid concern. Consequently, we have rerun the main models in an ROI-based fashion using or not using spline models to fit age. Specifically, we have fitted the models in each of Desikan-Killiany’s ROIs using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM with age as a smooth term) or linear mixed models (LME with age as a linear regressor). The results are shown in Supplementary Figures 13 and 14. The Beta regressors are nearly identical. As expected, the differences are noticeable in the LCBC dataset while the effect of using - or not using- splines to fit age is almost null in the other two datasets. See also FDR-corrected maps below for both birth weight effects on brain structure and brain change (we opted to show Beta-maps as supplementary material as the multiple-comparisons correction in the ROI-based analysis is not fully comparable with the one used in the vertex-wise approach).</p><p>p. 9: “Both birth weight effects on cortical characteristics and cortical change were rerun (ROIwise) using spline models that accounted for possible non-linear effects of age on cortical structure. The results were comparable to those reported above in Figures 1 and 2. See Supplementary Figures 13 and 14 for birth weight effects on cortical characteristics and cortical change, respectively.”</p><p>Caption to Supplementary Figure 13. “Comparison between spline (GAMM) and linear (LME) models on the effect of birth weight on cortical characteristics.
