of raw materials. Self-organized smoothening guides cell and tissue morphogenesis and is relevant to advanced manufacturing. Across the syncytial <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo surface, smooth interfaces form between expanding Arp2/3-based actin caps and surrounding actomyosin networks, demarcating the circumferences of nascent dome-like compartments used for pseudocleavage. We found that forming a smooth and circular boundary of the surrounding actomyosin domain requires Arp2/3 in vivo. To dissect the physical basis of this requirement, we reconstituted the interacting networks using node-based models. In simulations of actomyosin networks with local clearances in place of Arp2/3 domains, rough boundaries persisted when myosin contractility was low. With addition of expanding Arp2/3 network domains, myosin domain boundaries failed to smoothen, but accumulated myosin nodes and tension. After incorporating actomyosin mechanosensitivity, Arp2/3 network growth locally induced a surrounding contractile actomyosin ring that smoothened the interface between the cytoskeletal domains, an effect also evident in vivo. In this way, a smooth structure can emerge from the lateral interaction of irregular active materials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell cortex</kwd><kwd>actomyosin</kwd><kwd>Arp2/3</kwd><kwd>mechanosensitivity</kwd><kwd>pattern formation</kwd><kwd><italic>drosophila</italic> embryo pseudo-cleavage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2016-05617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Tony J C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A smooth and circular interface can form between domains of the cell cortex from local induction of a contractile actomyosin ring by centrifugal pushing forces of an expanding Arp2/3 actin network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Smooth components are integral to the assembly and function of human-made structures and devices. Smooth surfaces dominate our inside and urban environments and are formed by refinement of rough starting materials. In conventional industries, starting materials are smoothened by tools. Smooth structures also convey important functions in living systems, but their formation relies on self-assembly and self-organization. Fuller understanding of these mechanisms will aid advanced manufacturing with smart materials for a broad range of applications; from sensors and data processing, to filters and self-cleaning surfaces, to medical devices and robotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Begley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holmes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Living and synthetic systems face a challenge: how can small and roughly distributed components form large and smooth structures that convey function? One solution is stereospecific self-assembly of components into a structure with mechanical properties that convey smoothness. For example, tubulin subunits assemble microtubules with relatively high rigidity, allowing microtubules to act as smooth tracks for molecular transport through the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawkins et al., 2010</xref>). Individual actin polymers have lower rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>), but cross-linking by actin-binding proteins can bundle multiple polymers into straight structures that support cell protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). In more complex scenarios, solutions involve an initial step of rough patterning followed by refinement through mechanical self-organization. One example is the establishment of a compartment boundary across an epithelial tissue. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc, gene expression patterns define the cells of specific compartments, but non-muscle myosin II (myosin hereafter) is then required to pull actin networks into straight cables integrated via cell-cell junctions to form smooth compartment boundaries that define the architecture of the mature wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Dahmann, 2020</xref>). Another example comes from mesenchymal cell migration. Here, a leader cell’s initial path through the extracellular matrix is smoothened by follower cells as reciprocal mechanical effects co-align cellular actomyosin cables with extracellular matrix fibers via focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Livne and Geiger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Helvert et al., 2018</xref>). A purely subcellular example occurs during cytokinesis, when spindle-derived cues roughly organize actomyosin assemblies around the cell equator, and myosin activity then contributes to smoothening of the contractile cytokinetic ring that divides the cell in two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwayer et al., 2016</xref>). ‘Two-step’ refinement strategies are also relevant to hierarchical design principles important for transcending scales in advanced manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Begley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holmes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition to specialized structures, such as junction-associated cables or cytokinetic rings, actin networks also form the cell cortex, a thin, sheet-like material underlying the cell’s plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chugh and Paluch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Svitkina, 2020</xref>). Smooth structures can form across the cell cortex, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Two properties of the cortex are relevant: (i) it can gain an asymmetric distribution across the cell and (ii) it is a composite material. Cortical asymmetry can elicit cortical flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Munro, 2006</xref>), with resulting compressive forces promoting mesoscale alignment of actin filaments perpendicular to the flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reymann et al., 2016</xref>). The cortex’s composite structure involves distinct actin-based networks: formin-induced networks, with or without myosin, and Arp2/3-induced networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chugh and Paluch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Svitkina, 2020</xref>). These networks can be closely interwoven, but signaling events can induce mesoscale cortical domains enriched with a particular network. For example, the budding of a polar body from a much larger oocyte involves induction of an Arp2/3-enriched domain surrounded by a smooth ring of actomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yi and Li, 2012</xref>). The Arp2/3-enriched domain prevents full contraction of the actomyosin ring, and the actomyosin ring delineates the boundary of budding polar body, but how a smooth interface forms between such networks remains unclear.</p><p>The cortex of the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo is patterned into subdomains that engage each other to organize embryo pseudocleavage. Centrosomes provide local spatial cues that induce an Arp2/3-enriched actin cap above each nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raff and Glover, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stevenson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stevenson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zallen et al., 2002</xref>), and each cap is surrounded by an actomyosin border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foe et al., 2000</xref>). Since the early embryo is a syncytium, the cortical actomyosin network is embryo-wide and becomes embedded with numerous, evenly spaced caps. At the onset of each synchronous mitotic cycle, the caps and borders assemble anew, and expand as cortical domains with rough boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). As the caps and borders meet, they form a smooth, circular interface that demarcates the circumference of a nascent dome-like compartment. Each cap grows into a full dome-like compartment that houses the mitotic spindle, and the cap-border interface becomes the basal rim of the dome. The networks grow, meet, form a circular interface, and locally re-shape the cortex within minutes. Associated cortical patterning involves a two-step refinement process. Initial assembly of each domain is induced by signaling of distinct small G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blake-Hedges and Megraw, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lv et al., 2021</xref>). Subsequently, the interface between the domains seems to be refined through physical mechanisms. For example, with experimental depletion of one network, the other network expands its domain laterally due to an apparent loss of physical restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Each network also contributes to the structure of the dome-like compartment. The Arp2/3 network is necessary for compartment formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stevenson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zallen et al., 2002</xref>), and when myosin levels or activity are experimentally reduced, growth and buckling of the actin cap appears sufficient to form a compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Royou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). With myosin depletion, however, the actin cap grows with an irregular shape, and the dome-like compartment is abnormally lop-sided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, lateral engagement of a growing Arp2/3 cap with its surrounding actomyosin border seems required for precise re-shaping of the cell cortex into a dome-like compartment, but physical explanations remain unclear. We sought to understand the interface between these materials. Specifically, we pursued how the initially rough-edged networks interact to increase the smoothness and circularity of their interface. We considered smoothening in relative terms: an increase to the alignment of cytoskeletal elements at the boundary of a network. Functionally, this alignment forms a mesoscale circular structure where the cell surface folds during <italic>Drosophila</italic> pseudocleavage.</p><p>Here, we provide in vivo evidence that Arp2/3 is required for forming a smooth, circular interface between an actin cap and its actomyosin border, and for myosin accumulation at the network-network interface. To study the networks in isolation, we turned to node-based simulations. Individually reconstituted actomyosin and Arp2/3 networks mimicked mesoscale properties reported for each network in vitro. The node-based design of the networks allowed them to be combined in the same simulations, in which they were distributed as segregated domains and were capable of displacing each other laterally. Without simulated Arp2/3 networks, high myosin activity produced smooth, circular boundaries with empty caps, whereas low myosin activity resulted in persistent rough boundaries, mimicking the in vivo effect of <italic>Arp3</italic> RNAi. Added Arp2/3 caps displaced the myosin borders, but the resulting interfaces were wavy and non-circular, despite local increases to myosin node density and tension. By encoding a mechanosensitive activation mechanism into the actomyosin network, growth of an Arp2/3 cap induced myosin activations around the interface, an actomyosin ring formed, and a smooth and circular interface emerged. Our findings show how an interface can smoothen from the interaction of roughly distributed active materials in a 2D plane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Actomyosin and Arp2/3 networks have been individually simulated as continuum or agent-based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berro, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mogilner and Manhart, 2016</xref>). Our investigation of roughly distributed elements rearranging into a smooth structure required an agent-based approach. We formulated 2D node-based models in which actomyosin network nodes displace each other with the contractile force of myosin, and Arp2/3 network nodes are displaced by the polymerization force of actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lecuit et al., 2011</xref>). The initial actomyosin network pattern was laid out by distributing myosin nodes across a 2D plane. In local search areas, each node then randomly established a limited number of permanent connections with surrounding nodes. To mimic the thickness of the cell cortex, connections were allowed to cross each other. Myosin nodes affected each other by applying contractile force along their connections, and connections experienced elastic force above their resting length (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for schematics; see Model Formulation for full details and references). Arp2/3 networks were seeded with clusters of actin nucleation points, and a plus end node moved from each of these sites in random directions within the 2D plane. At a specific time, a new actin nucleation point formed halfway along the plus end node’s trajectory, and a new plus end node grew from this site at a 70° angle. Plus end nodes stopped their movement at a specified distance from their coupled actin nucleation points, and were eliminated at later times with a specific probability. Actin nucleation points were only used to initiate plus end node movements, and to determine their trajectories. Plus end nodes affected myosin nodes with polymerization force (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> for schematics; see Model Formulation for full details and references). A common node-based construction of the networks facilitated modelling of their lateral interface. Segregation of the networks was maintained at the network-network interface, where the forces of one network’s nodes could displace the nodes of the other based on local force balance (see Model Formulation for full details). Our model is based on relatively simple physical rules applied to individual nodes, and we used it to investigate the emergence of mesoscale structure by simulating, visualizing, and quantifying large networks of nodes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> provides a full list of model parameters and estimates of in vivo and in vitro equivalencies. Before investigating network-network interactions, we first validated the in silico properties of the actomyosin network alone, the Arp2/3 network alone, and the network-network interface.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Individual simulations of actomyosin and Arp2/3 networks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics show major aspects of the node-based actomyosin network: (top) the connections randomly made by one node within a search radius, (middle) the actomyosin and elastic forces along node-node connections, (bottom) the organization of nodes and connections mimicking a broad cortical network with a small thickness.

By inducing myosin motor activity in specific geometric patterns within a larger non-contractile network in vitro, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schuppler et al., 2016</xref> showed that re-shaping of the embedded contractile actomyosin network is influenced by the boundary pattern of its initial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schuppler et al., 2016</xref>). As a simple example, an activated circle of actomyosin contracted into a smaller circle. More interestingly, the edges of an activated square became concave, whereas the edges of an activated outline of a square became convex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schuppler et al., 2016</xref>). Remarkably, optogenetic activation of actomyosin in the complex environment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo ectoderm had a similar effect: the edges of an activated square became concave as the square contracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Izquierdo et al., 2018</xref>).

Not surprisingly, an activated circle displayed isotropic contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

For a hollow square with a thick boundary of activation, the outer sides of the boundary became concave and the inner edges bent in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), as also seen in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schuppler et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the patterned activation of myosin, these realistic responses also required the entire simulated network to contain elastic connections that prevented excessive stretching of connections between the inner contractile region and the outer non-contractile region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The Arp2/3 network model mimics properties of Arp2/3 networks reported in vitro</title><p>When simulated individually, a centrally induced Arp2/3 network grows centrifugally with an outer perimeter of non-aligned actin plus end nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), a behavior resembling initial in vivo growth of an actin cap in the embryo surface plane (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Next, we compared the simulated network to an Arp2/3 actin network reconstituted in vitro and grown against a solid object. By combining light and atomic force microscopy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bieling et al., 2016</xref> found that Arp2/3 network growth against a cantilever lead to an increased density of F-actin plus ends at the interface, without an accumulation of elastic energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bieling et al., 2016</xref>). We tested our model for these properties by placing a circular wall around a centrifugally growing network. With network growth into the immovable wall, the density of plus end nodes within 20 pixels of the network circumference increased 1.57-fold from the start of the simulation to step 3000 (calculated from four simulations with distinct starting conditions; see images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). For networks growing without a wall, the equivalent value decreased 0.77-fold by simulation step 3000 (see example images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To test for stored elastic energy, we removed the wall after local accumulation of plus end nodes had occurred. If elastic energy accumulated with compression, then an increased network growth rate upon removal of the load was expected. However, network area growth rates after removal of the wall were indistinguishable from those of networks that never experienced a wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Thus, like an in vitro Arp2/3 network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bieling et al., 2016</xref>), when the simulated network grew against a solid object it accumulated plus end numbers at the interface with the object but did not accumulate elastic energy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Simulation of the network-network interface maintains network segregation and allows the networks to displace each other</title><p>To test the mesoscale effects of our internetwork displacement and segregation rules, we distributed myosin nodes as a broad ring and examined behavior of the ring with and without a growing Arp2/3 network at its hollow center. In the absence of a central Arp2/3 network, the ring was re-shaped by myosin activity alone. Without myosin activity (0.0), the broad ring maintained its structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). With full myosin activity (1.0), the broad ring of dispersed nodes initially constricted into a narrow ring of nodes, and after thinning, the ring constricted centripetally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), a sequence of events consistent with in vitro observations of a myosin network activated in a rectangular shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schuppler et al., 2016</xref>). A moderate level of myosin activity (0.4) had an intermediate effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Adding a growing Arp2/3 network to the center of a broad ring with zero or moderate myosin activity led to centrifugal displacement of myosin nodes and a thinning of the ring, but no ring constriction was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). As the Arp2/3 network grew, the thinned ring of myosin nodes was displaced outward and displayed diminished circularity that resembled the rough outer edge of the segregated Arp2/3 network. During this displacement, the two networks remained segregated, confirming the effectiveness of the node-based rules, and myosin nodes aggregated at the network-network interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>, arrows). With full myosin node activity, the actomyosin ring counteracted the expansion of the central Arp2/3 network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The ring narrowed and then contracted centripetally, but the central Arp2/3 network restrained its centripetal contraction relative to an actomyosin ring lacking a central Arp2/3 network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Quantifications of inner clearance area changes across myosin node activities with or with Arp2/3 networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) further demonstrated that the rules for the network-network interface allowed the two segregated networks to counteract each other’s physical effects. For example, without myosin activity, the inner clearance area was maintained over the simulation, but adding an Arp2/3 network to inner clearance expanded its area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, compare black lines with and without Arp2/3). With full myosin activity, the effect of the Arp2/3 network was counteracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, compare black and red lines in right graph), but the Arp2/3 network also hindered the contractility of the myosin ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, compare red lines with and without Arp2/3).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Simulation of the network-network interface allows the networks to displace each other and remain segregated.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Actomyosin networks (white) with zero (<bold>A–B</bold>), moderate (0.4) (<bold>C–D</bold>), or full (1.0) (<bold>E–F</bold>) myosin activity.

These and other data suggest that the two networks physically engage to control each other’s distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). A physical interaction should be evident at the interface between the laterally segregated networks. To investigate the effect of Arp2/3 on myosin organization at this interface, we imaged GFP-tagged myosin heavy chain (Zipper (Zip)-GFP) in embryos depleted of Arp3 by RNAi. In control RNAi embryos during the transition from mitotic cycle 10 to 11, the actomyosin network initially assembled a rough, non-circular interface around each myosin-devoid cap, but within minutes, smooth and circular boundaries formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; the transition was most obvious for completely new networks formed between sister nuclei, solid black arrows). In contrast, Arp3 RNAi embryos assembled actomyosin networks that failed to form smooth boundaries and instead retained a variable distribution of puncta at the interface with the myosin-devoid cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, solid red arrows). In control embryos, the formation of a smooth interface was often accompanied by an accumulation of Zip-GFP along the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, solid and hollow black arrows), and both demarked the site of initial pseudo-cleavage furrow ingression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, 143s, side view, blue arrowheads).

This organization was simulated by generating a large circle of active myosin nodes with 13 evenly spaced clearances for the growth of 13 Arp2/3 networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Within the large circle, the myosin nodes were activatable in addition to their elastic interactions. Outside of the large circle, a border of inactive but elastic myosin nodes was generated to restrain the contraction of the central circle, thereby mimicking the effect of an actomyosin network distributed around the full embryo circumference. To avoid distortions due to the surrounding inactive border, we restricted our quantifications to the central clearance of the 13-clearance array.</p><p>To understand the effects of actomyosin alone, we first varied properties of the myosin nodes in the absence of Arp2/3 networks. The density of nodes was varied over a fivefold range, and the activity of nodes was varied over a 10-fold range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Within each simulation, all nodes had homogenous activity. The lowest density of nodes (0.05; 5% of pixels containing a node) resulted in fragmentation of the network at all myosin activity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; bottom row), consistent with in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schuppler et al., 2016</xref>). At node densities that retained connectivity (0.1–0.25), higher myosin activities (0.2–1.0) produced smooth and circular boundaries with the clearances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, yellow arrows). This result is consistent with the sufficiency of myosin activity to produce extended, smooth structures in vivo, such as cell junction-associated actomyosin cables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Livne and Geiger, 2016</xref>) or the cytokinetic ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwayer et al., 2016</xref>).

This result resembled the myosin distribution in Arp3 RNAi embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

However, Arp2/3 network growth did induce an aggregation of myosin nodes at the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, arrows). Also, myosin node connections became substantially longer than their resting length specifically at the interface, and only with Arp2/3 network growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

This approach did not explicitly link myosin node modification to the Arp2/3 networks, as the displacement of a myosin node for any reason could induce the activity elevation. However, comparison of myosin node activity elevation events with and without Arp2/3 networks revealed that the elevations occurred predominantly at interfaces between the actomyosin and Arp2/3 networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, arrows), and that they required the Arp2/3 network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Strikingly, the elevations significantly enhanced the smoothness and circularity of the interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), compared to simulations without the elevations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The areas of the clearances were also reduced. Quantifications of clearance smoothness, circularity, and area showed the importance of a combination of Arp2/3 network growth and mechanosensitivity of the actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Sensitivity analyses showed that the smooth and circular interfaces arose upon inclusion of mechanosensitivity over a wide range of parameter values affecting the myosin network, the Arp2/3 network, and their interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>).

To test this idea, we first examined the behavior of an isolated single ring of myosin nodes with uniform activity equal to the activity induced by Arp2/3 network growth in the two-network simulations. The isolated network was initiated as a thick, rough-edged ring of randomly positioned myosin nodes containing a central clearance instead of an Arp2/3 network (similar to the single ring in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Since the movement of a node is directly linked to the net forces applied to it by surrounding nodes, we traced node movements to map forces within the network. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> traces the movements of myosin nodes at the inner boundary of the rough ring. Consistent with our single ring analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, the inner boundary nodes initially moved centrifugally as the ring thinned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and then moved centripetally as the thin and smooth ring constricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To determine the directions of net forces experienced by all individual nodes during the process, we calculated angles of node displacement relative to the circular network’s radii at each node’s position at each simulation step. At the beginning of the simulation, a broad distribution of node displacement angles was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), but during the transition from thinning to constricting, the distribution became biased toward 0° and 180° relative to local radii of the circular network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). To understand this bimodal distribution, we examined individual node displacements at full temporal and spatial resolution during the final stages of the simulation. Strikingly, nodes mostly displayed back-and-forth displacements closely aligned with the radii (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The angles of these oscillations are partly what would be expected for centripetal normal forces of a contractile circle, but with additional centrifugal counterforces arising from the network’s interconnected nodes. Although the in vivo relevance of these extremely rapid oscillations is unclear, the oriented oscillations provided a signature of contractile actomyosin ring formation in our simulations.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Myosin nodes activated by Arp2/3 network growth behave as a contractile ring during smoothening of the network-network interface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tracings of the displacements of individual myosin nodes selected around the inner circumference of a single actomyosin ring that started with a rough configuration, thinned, and constricted over 2500 simulation steps, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.

Arp2/3 network growth displaced the myosin nodes centrifugally throughout the simulation, including stages of elevated myosin node activity and when the network-network interface became smooth and circular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To map the directions of net forces applied to individual nodes, we determined angles of node displacement relative to radii from the clearance center throughout the simulation. Initially, a broad distribution of local displacement angles occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In contrast, the phase of smoothening and circularization was accompanied by a bimodal distribution dominated by angles near 0° and 180° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–J</xref>). Full resolution tracing of nodes during the second phase showed that these angles were due to back-and-forth displacements that mainly had close alignment with local radii but occasionally occurred at other angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Overall, we conclude that the mechanical elevation of myosin node activity by the pushing forces of Arp2/3 network growth produces a contractile actomyosin ring around the network-network interface, and that contractility of this ring smoothens and circularizes the interface.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>With relatively simple design principles, our node-based simulations of actomyosin and Arp2/3 networks individually mimicked the mesoscale behaviors of their respective networks reconstituted in vitro. The node-based structure common to each simulated network allowed straight-forward construction of two-network simulations that combined the actomyosin and Arp2/3 networks as segregated materials able to impact each other laterally through local interactions between their constituent nodes. Our simulations revealed that a myosin network with relatively low contractility is insufficient for generating smooth boundaries, and abnormally persistent rough boundaries mimicked those of myosin networks in embryos depleted of Arp3. In silico, the simple addition of growing Arp2/3 networks resulted in wavy, non-circular interfaces. However, local activation of an otherwise weakly contractile actomyosin network by the pushing forces of Arp2/3 network growth resulted in smooth, circular interfaces resembling those of wild-type embryos. Indicating robustness of the simulations, the effects of Arp2/3 network growth occurred over a substantial range of parameter values affecting the actomyosin network, the Arp2/3 network, and the network-network interface. Arp2/3-induced myosin node activations occurred around the initially rough network-network interface, and the activated myosin nodes locally formed a contractile ring to smoothen and circularize the interface (see schematic model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic model of how a smooth interface forms from growth of an Arp2/3 network against a mechanosensitive actomyosin network.</title><p>Half of a clearance is shown at three stages of the rough-to-smooth transition of the network-network interface.

Tensile forces can align polymers, but the two ends of the network must be anchored. Since a network can anchor to itself, as in the case of a cytokinetic ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwayer et al., 2016</xref>), intra-network anchorage may explain the formation of smooth boundaries within a multiply fenestrated myosin network with high contractility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, low contractility networks cannot form smooth boundaries on their own. Low contractility is important for maintaining the syncytial state of the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Harris, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mason et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), arrays of podosomes at the base of invasive mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rafiq et al., 2017</xref>), and the polar body bud during meiosis II arrest of mouse oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yi and Li, 2012</xref>). Widespread contractility of a synthetic material would also hinder fabrication of a multi-component structure. Our simulations indicate that disruptive effects of widespread contractility can be avoided by the local induction of contractility in one material in response to pushing forces from a neighboring material, and that this induction can produce a contractile ring to smoothen the interface between such materials. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, the smooth and circular interface demarcates where the plasma membrane folds to form a dome-like compartment. Without sufficient growth of the actin cap, the interface remains rough and membrane folding fails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stevenson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zallen et al., 2002</xref>). With weakening of the myosin border, the actin cap grows with an irregular shape and the plasma membrane invagination is lop-sided around the cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our simulations of network-network interactions at the surface of the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo show how a smooth and circular structure can emerge from the local interactions of roughly distributed components. This example of refinement by mechanical self-organization is relevant to other cell biological processes, such as mammalian polar body budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yi and Li, 2012</xref>) and podosome protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van den Dries et al., 2019</xref>). It is also relevant to the refinement of smart materials, including nanocomposites and metamaterials, after an initial printing step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Begley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holmes, 2019</xref>). Biological composite materials can exhibit complex behaviors due to their multiple mechanical properties, and are thus top candidates in advanced manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, reconstituted actin networks can be coated with inorganic materials to fabricate specific 3D structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galland et al., 2013</xref>). Although the in vitro reconstitution of Arp2/3 and actomyosin networks as neighboring domains remains a technical challenge, the patterned induction, mechanical self-organization, and inorganic coating of such composites holds exciting promise. Node-based modelling is also applicable to a range of materials, and could identify various roles for mechanical self-organization in device fabrication.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>maternal-GAL4-VP16</td><td>Mark Peifer</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UASp-Arp3-shRNA</td><td>Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (BDSC)</td><td>BDSC #53972 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_53972">BDSC_53972</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UASp-mCherry-shRNA</td><td>BDSC</td><td>BDSC #35785 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_35785">BDSC_35785</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Zipper-GFP</td><td>Flytrap</td><td>BDSC #51564 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_51564">BDSC_51564</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB</td><td>MathWorks</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Volocity</td><td>Quorum Technologies Inc</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Image J</td><td>NIH</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Excel</td><td>Microsoft</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>PowerPoint</td><td>Microsoft</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Photoshop</td><td>Adobe</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Model formulation</title><p>MATLAB code is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/medha7575/sharma-et-al-ELIFE2021">https://github.com/medha7575/sharma-et-al-ELIFE2021 </ext-link> (copy archived at swh:1:rev:7e64a1ebff4e56bc056bb27b0675be09d53fb8f8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharma, 2021</xref>).

Each node represents a myosin mini-filament. Interconnecting actin filaments are not explicitly modeled, but would be cross-linked in anti-parallel orientations to allow plus-end directed myosin activity to pull nodes together. Each myosin motor domain binds an actin filament, uses ATP-derived energy to displace the filament, and then dissociates from the filament. Since a mini-filament contains multiple motor domains, this cycle can be repeated by separate motor domains, allowing processive displacement of an actin filament by a myosin mini-filament. The activity of a motor domain can be regulated, and the number of motor domains in a mini-filament can vary. We incorporated these properties into our model by assuming that actin-based connections between nodes are never lost, and that the pulling force between two connected myosin nodes is proportional to the product of an adjustable myosin activity at each node. Considering only two myosin nodes (n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub>) with equal myosin activities (M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub>), pulling between n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> would displace both nodes by the same distance toward each other.

Nodes at the lattice boundary maintain their positions even when a force is applied on them (a fixed boundary condition). Each node is visualized as a single pixel. However, node connection angles, node connection distances, force angles, and node displacements are defined at 1/100th of a pixel. Since the cell cortex is 50–400 nm thick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chugh and Paluch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Svitkina, 2020</xref>), the positioning of nodes above and below each other in 3D space is represented in the 2D simulation by allowing a maximum of 20 nodes to occupy the same pixel (with no information encoding the third dimension) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for a full list of parameters). Incorporating this allowance avoided jamming of nodes into a non-dynamic state, but to mimic local steric hindrance within the cell cortex the upper limit to the number of nodes per pixel was implemented. If a node attempts to move to a fully occupied pixel, then the move is disallowed and the node maintains its original location leading to a configuration akin to a mini-filament stack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>After the myosin nodes are positioned across 2D space they are linked by permanent connections.

Since the Arp2/3 complex nucleates actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pollard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Svitkina, 2018</xref>) and centrosomes act as spatial landmarks for the induction of Arp2/3-enirched actin caps in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raff and Glover, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stevenson et al., 2001</xref>), an Arp2/3 network is initiated by randomly positioning the nucleation points in a dense inner circle (20 pixel radius with 10% of pixels containing a nucleation point) and a sparse, larger and overlapping circle (50 pixel radius with 1% of pixels containing a nucleation point). The outer circle of sparse nucleation sites is expected from graded diminishment of a centrosome-based signal, and was needed to generate an Arp2/3 network that grew with an irregular shape, as occurs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Actin polymerization is simulated by displacing a plus end node away from its corresponding nucleation point. The nucleation point is only used to define the filament position, length, and angle, in combination with the positional information of the plus end node. The polymerization and associated pushing force is modeled by the plus end node only. At the simulation start, plus end nodes move from their nucleation points in random directions.

In vitro, branching can occur from either side of the mother filament, anywhere along the mother filament (with a preference toward the barbed end), and the mother and daughter filaments polymerize at the same rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amann and Pollard, 2001</xref>). To implement branched polymerization from an existing filament, the age of the plus end node is monitored, and after nine simulation steps a new nucleation point is created halfway between the pre-existing nucleation point and the plus end node. From the new nucleation point, a new plus end node extends with an angle of ±70° (randomized) relative to the mother filament and its plus end node. One actin filament is limited to forming one branch.</p><p>Two major effects regulate the growth and structure of Arp2/3 networks. Capping of actin plus ends promotes shorter filament lengths that resist buckling and exert more effective pushing forces, whereas depolymerization of older filaments by actin depolymerization factors allows network turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pollard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Svitkina, 2018</xref>). To simulate inhibition of polymerization by a capping protein, the polymerization force of a plus end node is set to zero after it extends 20 pixels from its nucleation point. To model actin filament depolymerization, a plus end node is removed with a probability of 0.7 after it exists for 20 simulation steps. After the deletion of a plus end node, the previously coupled nucleation point becomes dormant, but a branch formed between the pair remains in place, can continue growing, and can induce its own branch. By linking depolymerization to the lifetime of a filament, filament turnover occurs even when growth is prevented by an obstruction. At the start of the simulation, it was necessary to randomly assign a range of initial filament lengths and ages to prevent filament capping and removal from occurring in an unnaturally rhythmic way.</p><p>The Arp2/3 network simulation is considered to be a broad 2D array with a 50–400 nm thickness in 3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chugh and Paluch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salbreux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Svitkina, 2020</xref>). Like the actomyosin model, this organization is implemented by positioning nodes on an off-lattice model to avoid steric hindrance, with close positioning of two nodes in 2D representing their occupancy of different levels of the same vertical column in 3D. Unlike the actomyosin network, there was no need to create an upper limit to the number of nodes at a pixel because nodes of the Arp2/3 network continually expand away from each other.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Simulation of the network-network interface</title><p>To enable study of the lateral interaction between two segregated cytoskeletal networks, we combined the actomyosin and Arp2/3 networks into a single lattice. Although actomyosin networks and Arp2/3 networks form segregated domains with close neighbor relationships during <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo pseudocleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), mammalian oocytes polar body budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yi and Li, 2012</xref>), and mammalian cell podosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van den Dries et al., 2019</xref>), we are unaware of in vivo or in vitro studies addressing the structural properties of the lateral interface between the neighboring networks. In lieu of experimental data, we reasoned that displacement of a node at the interface would be dictated by a balance of local forces on the node from nodes of its own network and from nodes of the neighboring network. In the two-network model, the constituent actomyosin and Arp2/3 networks have the same individual properties described in the previous sections, but all nodes of each network additionally perform two searches that indicate if a node is in proximity to a network-network interface. If so, the searches trigger mechanisms of internetwork displacement and segregation. Each node searches for nodes of the other network in a five-pixel radius. If a node of the distinct network is detected, then displacement of the searching node is dictated by both the rules of its own network and by effects of the neighboring network (as described in the following paragraphs). However, a potential displacement can be overridden. To maintain the network segregation apparent in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mavrakis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), each node searches a two-pixel radius around its potential displacement position for nodes of the other network. If a node of the other network is detected in this area, then the searching node aborts the move and maintains its position during the simulation step. Although the mechanistic basis of the in vivo network segregation is unclear, we assume involvement of steric hindrance and immiscibility of branched networks and bundled networks.</p><p>The displacement of an interface myosin node is determined by the aforementioned rules of the actomyosin network, and additionally by the pushing forces of actin plus end nodes within the five-pixel search radius.

If the move is prevented, then the myosin node maintains its old position.</p><p>The displacement of an interface actin plus end node is determined by the aforementioned rules of the Arp2/3 network, and by additional forces exerted by myosin nodes within the plus end node’s five-pixel sensing radius. The networks are assumed to lack an interconnection for conveying pulling forces, and thus the myosin nodes can only impact the plus end node through pushing forces associated with myosin node displacement. At each simulation step, the contribution of the myosin-based pushing force to the displacement of the plus end node is based on the anticipated displacement of the myosin node directed toward the plus end node.

For each simulation step, the tool used a swarm-based approach to detect the boundary of the clearance and then calculated the area of the clearance. Each input image of the myosin nodes was preprocessed by conversion to grayscale, application of a 2x2 pixel median filter, and conversion to binary black and white. The tool then released 180 swarms from a central position and the swarms moved outward along straight trajectories each separated by two degrees (spanning 360 degrees in total). As each swarm moved, it collected pixel intensity values and coordinate values. The boundary pixel was determined as the pixel where the detected intensity became greater than the mean intensity. However, two occasional errors occurred: (i) swarms passed through the region of myosin nodes without encountering a node or (ii) stray myosin nodes were detected. To remove these errors, the data was divided into six 60 degree segments, the median of the clearance boundary distance measurements was calculated for each segment, and detections of the boundary beyond ±5 pixels of the median were then deleted. The detection of the clearance boundary by the swarms was first used to correct a manually estimated center of the clearance. To maximize the accuracy of the clearance area calculation, each clearance boundary was determined 50 times with swarms emanating from randomized central positions in each case. Clearance area was calculated from the detected boundary coordinates using the surveyor's formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braden, 1986</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Interface smoothness, circularity and area</title><p>For quantifications of interface properties in the multi-ring simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), the boundary of the central clearance of myosin was first manually traced in Image J using the polygon selection tool and the following steps: (1) from a starting boundary myosin node subsequent boundary myosin nodes were traced around the clearance circumference until the starting node was reached again; (2) if two subsequent nodes were the same distance away, the node closer to the clearance center was chosen; and (3) after tracing the full boundary, it was corrected by comparing the tracing with the distribution of boundary myosin nodes at earlier simulation steps. The traced polygon was subjected a two pixel-radius Gaussian blur and was then converted into a binary black and white mask. The area and circularity of the mask was calculated in Image J, with circularity having a maximum value of one. To calculate the smoothness parameter, we first employed the swarms tool to determine the coordinates of the mask boundary using 180 swarms. The swarm-derived data was divided into six segments of 60 degrees each. For each segment, the standard deviation (σ) of the derivatives of the radii was calculated. The derivatives of the radii were calculated by dividing the difference between consecutive swarm radii by half the angle between the two points. Smoothness, <italic>S</italic>, of the entire boundary of the central clearance was calculated as the inverse of the mean of the standard deviations, σ, over the six segments, as follows:<disp-formula id="equ12"><label>(12)</label><mml:math id="m12"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi/><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The calculated smoothness approaches infinity for perfectly smooth shapes, but the pixelated images generated by MATLAB are not perfectly smooth, and we calculated <italic>S</italic> close to ~nine from MATLAB-generated circular plots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> work</title><p>Animals were maintained under standard conditions.

This is an interesting question in the context of how actin networks are organized. To understand interface smoothing, the authors perform &quot;node-based&quot; simulations of the two actin networks. The simulation methods of the two networks follows previously published methods and are validated through comparisons with previous work. For the interface between these networks, the authors invoke some ad hoc rules that are poorly justified form a physical point of view. It is not clear, how much their results depend on this choice of interfacial dynamics. Whereas the simulation results are quantitatively analyzed, there is essentially no quantification of the experiments, and the comparison between experiment and theory remains qualitative. Eventually, the authors propose a set of ingredients that are sufficient to yield smooth interfaces in their simulations. However, a thorough understanding in terms of the physical mechanism underlying the simulation results remains elusive. For these reasons, in its current state, this works seems of limited use for the community.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Sharma et al., aim to better understand the mechanical mechanisms underlying the organization of the syncytium, the cortical meshworks of actin and myosin under the surface of the fly embryo during early embryo development. This meshwork is composed of two networks that self-organize into circular caps containing branched actin filaments and surrounded by an acto-myosin constrictive network. Using a model based on nodes that follow simple mechanical rules, the authors demonstrate that one can start with roughly defined zones where each meshwork is defined, and only in certain conditions these zones will become clearly defined with a smooth border as seen in the fly embryo. They show that clear and smooth boundaries appear only when a branched actin meshwork expands in the caps and when there the surrounding acto-myosin network exerts enough contractile forces especially at the interface between both meshworks.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The modeling of the actin and myosin meshworks is performed using phenomelogical rules at a meso-scale, which allow the authors to focus on general mechanical properties of the meshworks and limit the number of free parameters.</p><p>The authors nicely demonstrate what mechanisms cannot lead to smooth boundaries and which one can.</p><p>The authors systematically compare their simulations with experimental data in wild-type and in knock-down flies that have been published before or that they generate for this study.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The parameters are discussed in the text in arbitrary non-physical units (e.g. pixels, steps, etc.).

Our first submission showed that centrifugal expansion of a rough Arp2/3 network against a surrounding and rough actomyosin network is insufficient for forming a smooth interface between them, but that Arp2/3 growth did displace myosin nodes and increase strain between them. Based on mechanosensitive strengthening of actomyosin networks reported in the literature, we allowed myosin nodes to increase their activity with a specific degree of displacement. As a result, myosin nodes gained activity in a ring around the interface of the Arp2/3 network and the surrounding actomyosin network, specifically in response to Arp2/3 network growth, and the interface became smooth and circular. Our assumption/hypothesis was that formation of the smooth and circular interface occurred through contractility of the induced actomyosin ring. However, we agree that we only identified ingredients responsible for forming the smooth and circular interface, and that a physical explanation was lacking. To test the idea that the induced myosin nodes form a contractile ring within an otherwise weakly contractile actomyosin network, we compared simulations of an isolated actomyosin ring with the behaviours of myosin nodes activated by Arp2/3 in an otherwise low contractility network. All nodes of the isolated ring had activity equal to that induced by Arp2/3 in the two-network simulations and were initially arranged as a wide and rough-edged ring. With contractile activity of the nodes, the ring first thinned and smoothened and then the ring constricted centripetally. In the initial rough configuration, the net forces applied to individual nodes occurred at a broad range of angles, but as the ring thinned and constricted, these angles became locally aligned with radii of the contractile ring. We considered this alignment to be a signature of a contractile ring in our simulations. Myosin nodes activated around the circumference of a growing Arp2/3 network displayed a similar signature. Thus, we conclude that the smoothening behaviour is based upon the local induction and activity of a contractile actomyosin ring.</p><p>These observations are described in detail in an added Results section (starting at line 350) and shown in added Figure 5. We also added a schematic model as Figure 6 to explain the steps of the smoothening process, and refer to this figure in the first paragraph of the Discussion section (starting at line 410).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Test how sensitive the main results are to initial conditions, and to different parameter values by performing a sensitivity analysis (especially on the wild-type like cases).</p></disp-quote><p>Sensitivity analyses were also important to add. We performed these analyses to confirm the robustness of our two main findings: (1) that centrifugal expansion of a rough Arp2/3 network against a surrounding and rough actomyosin network is insufficient for forming a smooth interface between them, and (2) that the smoothening occurs through the pushing forces of the Arp2/3 network elevating myosin activity around the interface to form a contractile ring. We conducted these analyses by varying the values of all major parameters of the actomyosin network, the Arp2/3 network, and the network-network interface. Parameters were varied pairwise to create phase diagrams of parameter space. We previously submitted, and continue to include, a phase diagram comparing different values of myosin node activity and myosin node density (Figure 3C). The added phase diagrams investigate all other key parameters in the parameter table (Table 1). These analyses indicate that our two main findings are robust to changes in parameters: (1) Arp2/3 expansion is incapable of inducing a smooth and circular interface with a non-mechanosensitive actomyosin network, except with parameter values producing a network-wide increase to actomyosin contractility, and (2) Arp2/3 expansion induces a smooth and circular interface with a mechanosensitive actomyosin network, except under specific and explainable conditions (e.g. with values that excessively weaken Arp2/3 network growth and would thus elicit insufficient myosin activation).</p><p>Please see added Figure 4—figure supplements 1-6 and further explanation in the associated figure legends.
