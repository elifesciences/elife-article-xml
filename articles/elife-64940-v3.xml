intervertebral disc (IVD) underpins its integrity and function. We present DIPPER, a deep and comprehensive IVD proteomic resource comprising 94 genome-wide profiles from 17 individuals. To begin with, protein modules defining key directional trends spanning the lateral and anteroposterior axes were derived from high-resolution spatial proteomes of intact young cadaveric lumbar IVDs. They revealed novel region-specific profiles of regulatory activities and displayed potential paths of deconstruction in the level- and location-matched aged cadaveric discs. Machine learning methods predicted a ‘hydration matrisome’ that connects extracellular matrix with MRI intensity. Importantly, the static proteome used as point-references can be integrated with dynamic proteome (SILAC/degradome) and transcriptome data from multiple clinical samples, enhancing robustness and clinical relevance. The data, findings, and methodology, available on a web interface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sbms.hku.hk/dclab/DIPPER/">http://www.sbms.hku.hk/dclab/DIPPER/</ext-link>), will be valuable references in the field of IVD biology and proteomic analytics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The backbone of vertebrate animals consists of a series of bones called vertebrae that are joined together by disc-like structures that allow the back to move and distribute forces to protect it during daily activities. It is common for these intervertebral discs to degenerate with age, resulting in back pain and severely reducing quality of life.</p><p>The mechanical features of intervertebral discs are the result of their proteins. These include extracellular matrix proteins, which form the external scaffolding that binds cells together in a tissue, and signaling proteins, which allow cells to communicate. However, how the levels of different proteins in each region of the disc vary with time has not been fully examined.</p><p>To establish how protein composition changes with age, Tam, Chen et al. quantified the protein levels and gene activity (which leads to protein production) of intervertebral discs from young and old deceased individuals. They found that the position of different mixtures of proteins in the intervertebral disc changes with age, and that young people have high levels of extracellular matrix proteins and signaling proteins. Levels of these proteins decreased as people got older, as did the amount of proteins produced.</p><p>To determine which region of the intervertebral disc different proteins were in, Tam, Chen et al. also performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the samples to correlate image intensity (which represents water content) with the corresponding protein signature. The data obtained provides a high-quality map of how the location of different proteins changes with age, and is available online under the name DIPPER. This database is an informative resource for research into skeletal biology, and it will likely advance the understanding of intervertebral disc degeneration in humans and animals, potentially leading to the development of new treatment strategies for this condition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intervertebral disc</kwd><kwd>nucleus pulposus</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>SILAC</kwd><kwd>degradome</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>E-HKU703/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Danny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T12-708/12N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheah</surname><given-names>Kathryn Song Eng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AoE/M-04/04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheah</surname><given-names>Kathryn Song Eng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(&quot;973&quot;) (2014CB942900)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Danny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-148408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Overall</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep and comprehensive proteomic resource of human intervertebral disc at high spatial resolution with a methodological flow reveals new insights in disc homeostasis and degeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 23 intervertebral discs (IVDs) in the human spine provide stability, mobility, and flexibility. IVD degeneration (IDD), most common in the lumbar region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saleem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Teraguchi et al., 2014</xref>), is associated with a decline in function and a major cause of back pain, affecting up to 80% of the world’s population at some point in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rubin, 2007</xref>), presenting significant socioeconomic burdens. Multiple interacting factors such as genetics, influenced by ageing, mechanical and other stress factors, contribute to the pathobiology, onset, severity, and progression of IDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munir et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>IVDs are large, avascular, extracellular matrix (ECM)-rich structures comprising three compartments: a hydrated nucleus pulposus (NP) at the centre, surrounded by a tough annulus fibrosus (AF) at the periphery, and cartilaginous endplates of the adjoining vertebral bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Humzah and Soames, 1988</xref>). The early adolescent NP is populated with vacuolated notochordal-like cells, which are gradually replaced by small chondrocyte-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Risbud et al., 2015</xref>). Blood vessels terminate at the endplates, nourishing and oxygenating the NP via diffusion, whose limited capacity mean that NP cells are constantly subject to hypoxic, metabolic, and mechanical stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Urban et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>With ageing and degeneration, there is an overall decline in cell ‘health’ and numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sakai et al., 2012</xref>), disrupting homeostasis of the disc proteome. The ECM has key roles in biomechanical function and disc hydration. Indeed, a hallmark of IDD is reduced hydration in the NP, diminishing the disc’s capacity to dissipate mechanical loads. Clinically, T-2 weighted MRI is the gold standard for assessing IDD, that uses disc hydration and structural features such as bulging or annular tears to measure severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfirrmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schneiderman et al., 1987</xref>). The hydration and mechanical properties of the IVD are dictated by the ECM composition, which is produced and maintained by the IVD cells.</p><p>To meet specific biomechanical needs, cells in the IVD compartments synthesise different compositions of ECM proteins. Defined as the ‘matrisome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Naba et al., 2012</xref>), the ECM houses the cells and facilitates their inter-communication by regulation of the availability and presentation of signalling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taha and Naba, 2019</xref>). With ageing or degeneration, the NP becomes more fibrotic and less compliant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yee et al., 2016</xref>), ultimately affecting disc biomechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Newell et al., 2017</xref>). Changes in matrix stiffness can have a profound impact on cell-matrix interactions and downstream transcriptional regulation, signalling activity, and cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The resulting alterations in the matrisome lead to vicious feedback cycles that reinforce cellular degeneration and ECM changes. Notably, many of the associated IDD genetic risk factors, such as <italic>COL9A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jim et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>ASPN</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Song et al., 2008</xref>), and <italic>CHST3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Song et al., 2013</xref>), are variants in genes encoding matrisome proteins, highlighting their importance for disc function. Therefore, knowledge of the cellular and extracellular proteome and their spatial distribution in the IVD is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of IDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Current knowledge of IVD biology is inferred from a limited number of transcriptomic studies on human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Minogue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Riester et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rutges et al., 2010</xref>) and animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Veras et al., 2020</xref>) discs. Studies showed that cells in young healthy NP express markers including CD24, KRT8, KRT19, and T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Minogue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rutges et al., 2010</xref>), whereas NP cells in aged or degenerated discs have different and variable molecular signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rodrigues-Pinto et al., 2016</xref>), such as genes involved in TGFβ signalling (TGFA, INHA, INHBA, BMP2/6). The healthy AF expresses genes including collagens (COL1A1 and COL12A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van den Akker et al., 2017</xref>), growth factors (PDGFB, FGF9, VEGFC), and signalling molecules (NOTCH and WNT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Riester et al., 2018</xref>). Although transcriptomic data provides valuable cellular information, it does not faithfully reflect the molecular composition. Cells represent only a small fraction of the disc volume, transcriptome-proteome discordance does not enable accurate predictions of protein levels from mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fortelny et al., 2017</xref>), and the disc matrisome accumulates and remodels over time.</p><p>Proteomic studies on animal models of IDD, including murine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCann et al., 2015</xref>), canine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erwin et al., 2015</xref>), and bovine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldeira et al., 2017</xref>), have been reported. Nevertheless, human-animal differences in cellular phenotypes and mechanical loading physiologies mean that these findings might not translate to the human scenario. So far, human proteomic studies have compared IVDs with other cartilaginous tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Önnerfjord et al., 2012</xref>) and have shown increases in fibrotic changes in aging and degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yee et al., 2016</xref>), a role for inflammation in degenerated discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rajasekaran et al., 2020</xref>), the presence of haemoglobins and immunoglobulins in discs with spondylolisthesis and herniation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maseda et al., 2016</xref>), and changes in proteins related to cell adhesion and migration in IDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sarath Babu et al., 2016</xref>). The reported human disc proteomes were limited in the numbers of proteins identified and finer compartmentalisation within the IVD, and disc levels along the lumbar spine have yet to be studied. Nor have the proteome dynamics in term of ECM remodelling (synthesis and degradation) in young human IVDs and changes in ageing and degeneration been described.</p><p>In this study, we presented DIPPER (the Big Dipper are point-reference stars for guiding nautical voyages), a comprehensive disc proteomic resource, comprising static spatial proteome, dynamic proteome and transcriptome, and a methodological flow, for studying the human IVD in youth, ageing, and degeneration. First, we established a high-resolution point-reference map of static spatial proteomes along the lateral and anteroposterior directions of IVDs at three lumbar levels, contributed by a young (16M) and an aged (59M) cadavers with no reported scoliosis or degeneration. We evaluated variations among the disc compartments and levels by principal component analysis (PCA), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and identification of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). We discovered modules containing specific sets of proteins that describe the directional trends of a young IVD, and the deconstruction of these modules with ageing and degeneration. Using a LASSO regression model, we identified proteins (the hydration matrisome) predictive of tissue hydration as indicated by high-resolution MRI of the aged discs. Finally, we showed how the point-reference proteomes can be utilised, to integrate with other independent transcriptome and dynamic proteome (SILAC and degradome) datasets from 15 additional clinical disc specimens, elevating the robustness of the proteomic findings. An explorable web interface hosting the data and findings is presented, serving as a useful resource for the scientific community.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disc samples and their phenotypes</title><p>DIPPER comprises 94 genome-wide measurements from lumbar disc components of 17 individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), with data types ranging from label-free proteomics, transcriptomics, SILAC to degradome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">López-Otín and Overall, 2002</xref>). High-resolution static spatial proteomes were generated from multiple intact disc segments of young trauma-induced (16 M) and aged (57 M) cadaveric spines. T1- and T2-weighted MRI (3T) showed the young discs (L3/4, L4/5, L5/S1) were non-degenerated, with a Schneiderman score of 1 from T2 images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The NP of young IVD were well hydrated (white) with no disc bulging, endplate changes, or observable inter-level variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with healthy discs and were deemed fit to serve as a benchmarking point-reference. To investigate structural changes associated with ageing, high-resolution (7T) MRI was taken for the aged discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). All discs had irregular endplates, and annular tears were present (green arrowheads) adjacent to the lower endplate and extending towards the posterior region at L3/4 and L4/5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The NP exhibited regional variations in hydration in both sagittal and transverse images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Morphologically, the aged discs were less hydrated and the NP and AF structures less distinct, consistent with gross observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We subdivided each lumbar disc into 11 key regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), spanning the outer-most (outer AF; OAF) to the central-most (NP) region of the disc, traversing both anteroposterior and lateral axes, adding valuable spatial information to our proteomic dataset. Since the disc is an oval shape, an inner AF (IAF) region was assigned in the lateral directions. A ‘mixed’ compartment between the NP and IAF with undefined boundary was designated as the NP/IAF in all four (anteroposterior and lateral) directions. In all, this amounted to 66 specimens with different compartments, ages, directions and levels, which then underwent LC-MS/MS profiling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Of the 3100 proteins detected in total, 418 were matrisome proteins (40.7% of all known matrisome proteins) and 2682 non-matrisome proteins (~14% of genome-wide non-matrisome genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and 983 were common to all four major compartments, namely the OAF, IAF, NP/IAF, and NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, upper panel). A total of 1883 proteins were identified in young discs, of which 690 (36%) were common to all regions. Additionally, 45 proteins (2.4%) were unique to NP, whilst NP/IAF, IAF, and OAF had 86 (4.6%), 54 (2.9%), and 536 (28%) unique proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, middle panel). For the aged discs, 2791 proteins were identified, of which 803 (28.8%) were common to all regions.

Despite the large range of total numbers of proteins detected (419 to 1920) across the 66 profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), all six subcategories of the matrisome contained similar numbers of ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The non-core matrisome proteins were significantly more abundant in aged than in young discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Specifically, the expression levels of core-matrisome were the highest, with an average log<sub>2</sub>(LFQ) of 30.65, followed by non-core matrisome at 28.56, and then non-matrisome at 27.28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Within the core-matrisome, the expression was higher (p=6.4 × 10<sup>−21</sup>) in young (median 30.74) than aged (median 29.72) discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C &amp; D</xref>). This difference between young and aged discs is consistent within the subcategories of core and non-core matrisome, with the exception of the ECM regulator category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The non-core matrisome and non-matrisome, however, exhibited smaller cross-compartment and cross-age differences in terms of expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–H</xref>). That is, the levels of ECM proteins in each compartment of the disc declines with ageing and possibly changes in the relative composition, while the numbers of proteins detected per matrisome subcategory remain similar. This agrees with the concept that with ageing, ECM synthesis is not sufficient to counterbalance degradation, as exemplified in a proteoglycan study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silagi et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cellular activities inferred from non-matrisome proteins</title><p>Although 86.5% (2682) of the detected proteins were non-matrisome, their expression levels were considerably lower than matrisome proteins across all sample profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Quantitation of histones can reflect the relative cellular content of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wiśniewski et al., 2014</xref>). We detected 10 histones, including subunits of histone 1 (HIST1H1B/C/D/E, HIST1H2BL, HIST1H3A, HIST1H4A) and histone 2 (HIST2H2AC, HIST2H2BE, HIST2H3A), with four subunits identified in over 60 sample profiles that are mutually co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Interestingly, histone concentrations, and thus cellularity, increased from the inner to the outer compartments of the disc, and showed a highly significant decrease in aged discs compared to young discs across all compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, Wilcoxon p=5.6 × 10<sup>−4</sup> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>GAPDH and ACTA2 are two commonly used reference proteins, involved in the metabolic process and the cytoskeletal organisation of cells, respectively.

They were detected in all 66 profiles. GAPDH and ACTA2 amounts were significantly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.794 (p=9.3 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>), and they were both significantly co-expressed with the detected histone subunits, with PCCs of 0.785 and 0.636, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>).

Thus, cellularity information can be obtained from proteomic information, and the histone quantification showing reduced cellularity in the aged IVD is consistent with the reported changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sakai et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PCA captures the information content distinguishing age and tissue types</title><p>To gain a global overview of the data, we performed PCA on a set of 507 proteins selected computationally, allowing maximal capture of valid values, while incurring minimal missing values, followed by imputations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; Materials and methods).

For the negatively correlated proteins, the matrisome proteins contributed to PC1 in distinguishing young disc samples, as well as to PC2 for sample location within the disc, but less so for disc level in PC3. Further, the relative composition of the core and non-core matrisome proteins varied between the three PCs, depicting the dynamic ECM requirement and its relevance in aging (PC1), tissue composition within the disc (PC2) and mechanical loading (PC3).</p><p>PC1 of young discs identified known chondrocyte markers, CLEC3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lau et al., 2018</xref>) and LECT1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), hedgehog signalling proteins, HHIPL2, HHIP, and SCUBE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>), and xylosyltransferase-1 (XYLT1), a key enzyme for initiating the attachment of glycosaminoglycan side chains to proteoglycan core proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silagi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Most of the proteins that were positively correlated in PC1 were coagulation factors or coagulation related, suggesting enhanced blood infiltration in aged discs. PC2 implicated key changes in molecular signalling proteins (hedgehog, WNT and Nodal) in the differences between the inner and outer disc regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Notably, PC2 contains heat shock proteins (HSPA1B, HSPA8, HSP90AA1, HSPB1) which are more strongly expressed in the OAF than in inner disc, indicating the OAF is under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takao and Iwaki, 2002</xref>).

In the young discs, the dominant phenotype explaining the variances for all protein categories was disc compartment. It is crucial that each disc compartment (NP, IAF, and OAF) has the appropriate protein composition to function correctly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). This also fits the understanding that young healthy discs are axially symmetric and do not vary across disc levels. In aged discs, compartment is still relevant for non-matrisome proteins and collagen, but disc level and directions become influential for other protein categories, which is consistent with variations in mechanical loading occurring in the discs with ageing and degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>). In the combined (young and aged) disc samples, age was the dominant phenotype across major matrisome categories, while compartment best explained the variance in non-matrisome, reflecting the expected changes in cellular (non-matrisome) and structural (matrisome) functions of the discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

We detected 85 significantly correlated ECM proteins, hereby referred to as the hydration matrisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). We found no collagen to be positively correlated with brighter MRI, which fits current understanding as collagens contribute to fibrosis and dehydration. Other classes of matrisome proteins were either positively or negatively correlated, with differential components for each class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Positively correlated proteoglycans included EPYC, PRG4 and VCAN, consistent with their normal expression in a young disc and hydration properties. Negatively correlated proteins included OAF (TNC, SLRPs) and fibrotic (POSTN) markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>Given this MRI-proteome link and the greater dynamic ranges of MRI in the aged discs enabled by the higher resolution 7T MRIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), we hypothesised that the hydration matrisome might be used to provide information about MRI intensities and thus disc hydration. To test this, we trained a LASSO regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tibshirani, 1996</xref>) of the aged MRIs using the hydration matrisome (85 proteins), and applied the model to predict the intensity of the MRIs of the young discs, based on the young proteome of the same 85 proteins. Remarkably, we obtained a PCC of 0.689 (p=8.9 × 10<sup>−6</sup>; Spearman = 0.776) between the actual and predicted MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The predicted MRI intensities of the young disc exhibited a smooth monotonic decrease from the NP towards IAF, then dropped suddenly towards the OAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, right panel), with an ROC AUC (receiver operating characteristics, area under the curve) of 0.996 between IAF and OAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In comparison, actual MRIs exhibited a linear decrease from NP to OAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, left panel). On reviewing these two patterns, we argue that the predicted intensities may be a more faithful representation of the young discs’ water contents than the actual MRI, as it reflects the gross images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and Y1 modular trend in the young discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

The discovery dataset was established from intact lumbar discs of a young cadaver with no history of skeletal abnormalities (e.g. scoliosis), and an aged cadaver with reduced IVD MRI intensity and annular tears. Although these two individuals may not be representative of their respective age-groups, this is the first known attempt to achieve high spatial resolution profiles in the discs, adding a critical and much needed dimension to the current available IVD proteomic datasets. We showed that our spatiotemporal proteomes integrate well with the dynamic proteome and transcriptome of clinical samples, demonstrating their application values with other datasets.</p><p>In creating the point-references, we use a well-established protein extraction protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Önnerfjord et al., 2012</xref>), and chromatographic fractionation of the peptides prior to mass spectrometry, we produced a dataset of the human IVD comprising 3,100 proteins, encompassing ~400 matrisome and 2,700 non-matrisome proteins, with 1,769 proteins detected in three or more profiles, considerably higher than recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maseda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rajasekaran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranjani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sarath Babu et al., 2016</xref>). The high quality of our data enabled the application of unbiased approaches including PCA and ANOVA to reveal the relative importance of the phenotypic factors. Particularly, age was found to be the dominant factor influencing proteome profiles.</p><p>Comparisons between different compartments of the young disc produced a reference landscape containing known (KRT8/19 for the NP; COL1A1, CILP and COMP for the AF) and novel (FRZB, CHRD, CHRDL2 for the NP; TNMD, SLRPs, and SOD1 for the AF) markers. The young healthy discs were enriched for matrisome components consistent with a healthy functional young IVD. Despite morphological differences between NP and IAF, the inner disc compartments (NP, NP/IAF, and IAF) display high similarities, in contrast to the large differences between IAF and OAF, which was consistent for discs from all lumbar disc levels. This morphological-molecular discrepancy might be accounted for by subtle differences in the ECM organisation, such as differences in GAG moieties on proteoglycans, or levels of glycosylation or other modifications of ECM that diversify function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silagi et al., 2018</xref>). Nonetheless, we partitioned the detected proteins into a variable set that captures the diversity, and a constant set that lays the common foundation of all young compartments, which work in synergy to achieve disc function.</p><p>Clustering analysis of the 671 DEPs of the variable set identified four key modules (Y1-Y4). Visually, Y1 and Y2 mapped across the lateral and anteroposterior axes with opposing trends. Molecularly, module Y1 (NP) contained proteins promoting regulation of matrix remodelling, such as matrix degradation inhibitor MATN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jayasuriya et al., 2012</xref>) and MMP inhibitor TIMP1. Inhibitors of WNT and BMP signalling were also present. Module Y2 (OAF) included COL1A1, THBS1/2/3, CILP1/CILP2, and TNMD, consistent with the OAF’s tendon-like features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakamichi et al., 2018</xref>). It also included a set of SLRPs that might play roles in regulation of collagen assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Taye et al., 2020</xref>), fibril alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>), maturation and crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kalamajski et al., 2016</xref>), while others are known to inhibit or promote TGFβ signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markmann et al., 2000</xref>). Notably, the composition of the IAF appeared to be a transition zone between NP and OAF rather than an independent compartment, as few proteins can distinguish it from adjacent compartments. Classes of proteins in both Y3 (smooth muscle feature) and Y4 (immune and blood) resemble Y2, which reflects the contractile property of the AF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakai et al., 2016</xref>) and the capillaries infiltrating or present at the superficial outer surface of the IVD.</p><p>In the aged disc, the DEPs between the inner and outer regions of the discs suggests extensive changes in the inner compartment(s). Mapping the aged data onto modules Y1-Y4 allowed a visualisation of the changes. The flattening of the Y1 and Y2 modules along both the lateral and anteroposterior axes indicated a convergence of the inner and outer disc. This is supported by the observed rapid decline of NP proteins and increase of AF proteins in the inner region. Fewer changes were seen in the aged OAF, which concurs with the notion that degenerative changes originate from the NP and radiate outwards; however, infringement of IAF into the NP cannot be excluded. The most marked change was seen in module Y4 (blood), where the pattern was inverted, characterised by high expression in the NP but low in OAF. While contamination cannot be excluded and there are reports that capillaries do not infiltrate the NP even in degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nerlich et al., 2007</xref>), our finding is consistent with other proteomic studies showing enrichment of blood proteins in pathological NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maseda et al., 2016</xref>). The route of infiltration can be from the fissured AF or cartilage endplates. Calcified endplates are more susceptible to microfractures, which can lead to blood infiltration into the NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Of interest is the involvement of an immune response within the inner disc. This corroborates reports of inflammatory processes in ageing and degenerative discs, with the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and presence of inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molinos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wuertz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The SILAC and degradome studies provided important insights into age-related differences in the biosynthetic and turnover activity in the IVD. The SILAC data indicated that protein synthesis is significantly impaired in aged degenerated discs. These findings correlate with reports of reduced cellularity in ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>), which we have also ascertained by leveraging the relationship of histones and housekeeping genes with cell numbers. From the TAILS degradome analysis, we observed more cleaved protein fragments in aged compartments, particularly for structural proteins important for tissue integrity such as COMP and those involved in cell-matrix interactions such as FN1, which was coupled with the enrichment of the proteolytic process GO terms in the aged static proteome. Collectively, this reveals a systematic modification and replacement of the primary proteomic architecture of the young IVD with age that is associated with diminished or failure in functional properties in ageing or degeneration.</p><p>Despite known transcriptome-proteome discordance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fortelny et al., 2017</xref>), our identification of their concordance allows insights into active changes in the young and aged discs. For example, inhibitors of the WNT pathway and antagonists of BMP/TGFβ signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leijten et al., 2013</xref>) were down-regulated in the aged discs in both the proteome and transcriptome. Interestingly, the activation of these pathways is known to promote chondrocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2006</xref>), and hypertrophy has been noted in IDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rutges et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests a model whereby the regulatory environment suppressing cellular hypertrophy changes with ageing or degeneration, resulting in conditions such as cellular senescence and tissue mineralisation that are part of the pathological process. In support, S100A1, a known inhibitor of chondrocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saito et al., 2007</xref>) is downregulated, while chondrocyte hypertrophy markers <italic>COL10A1</italic> and <italic>IBSP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Komori, 2010</xref>) are upregulated in the aged disc. Similar changes have been observed in ageing mouse NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Veras et al., 2020</xref>) as well as in osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>) where chondrocyte hypertrophy is thought to be involved in its aetiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van der Kraan and van den Berg, 2012</xref>). Given that WNT inhibitors are already in clinical trials for osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>), this may point to a prospective therapeutic strategy for IDD.</p><p>A key finding of our study is the direct demonstration, within a single individual, of association between the hydration status of the disc as revealed by MRI, and the matrisome composition of the disc proteome. The remarkable correlation between predicted hydration states inferred from the spatial proteomic data and the high-definition phenotyping of the aged disc afforded by 7T MRI has enormous potential for understanding the molecular processes underlying IDD.</p><p>In conclusion, we have generated point-reference datasets of the young and aged disc proteome, at a significantly higher spatial resolution than previous works. By means of a methodological framework, we revealed compartmentalised information on the ECM composition and cellular activities, and their changes with ageing. Integration of this point-reference with additional age- and protein-specific information of synthesis/degradation helps gain insights into the underlying molecular pathology of degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>).

Andromeda search parameters for protein identification were set to a tolerance of 6 ppm for the parental peptide, and 20 ppm for fragmentation spectra and trypsin specificity allowing up to two miscleaved sites. Oxidation of methionine, carboxyamidomethylation of cysteines was specified as a fixed modification. Minimal required peptide length was specified at seven amino acids. Peptides and proteins detected by at least two LFQ ion counts for each peptide in one of the samples were accepted, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. Proteins were quantified by normalised summed peptide intensities computed in MaxQuant with the LFQ option enabled. A total of 66 profiles were obtained: 11 locations × 3 disc levels × 2 individuals; with a median of 665 proteins (minimum 419, maximum 1920) per profile.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data processing for SILAC samples</title><p>The high-resolution, high mass accuracy mass spectrometry (MS) data obtained were processed using Proteome Discoverer (Ver 2.1), wherein data were searched using Sequest algorithm against Human UniProt database (29,900 entries, May 2016), supplemented with sequences of contaminant proteins, using the following search parameters settings: oxidised methionine (M), acetylation (Protein N-term), heavy Arginine (R6) and Lysine (K4) were selected as dynamic modifications, carboxyamidomethylation of cysteines was specified as a fixed modification, minimum peptide length of 7 amino acids was enabled, tolerance of 10 ppm for the parental peptide, and 20 ppm for fragmentation spectra, and trypsin specificity allowing up to two miscleaved sites. Confident proteins were identified using a target-decoy approach with a reversed database, strict FDR 1% at peptide and PSM level. Newly synthesised proteins were heavy labelled with Arg6- and Lys4, and the data was expressed as the normalised protein abundance obtained from heavy (labelled)/light (un-labelled) ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Degradome sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and data processing</title><p>Degradome analyses was performed on NP and AF from three non-degenerated and three degenerated individuals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Frozen tissues were pulverised as described above and prepared for TAILS as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kleifeld et al., 2010</xref>). After extraction with SDS buffer (1% SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 1X protease inhibitor in deionised water) and sonication (three cycles, 15 s/cycle), the supernatant (soluble fraction) underwent reduction at 37°C and alkylation with a final concentration of 15 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at RT. Samples were precipitated using chloroform/methanol, and the protein pellet air dried. Samples were re-suspended in 1M NaOH, quantified by nanodrop, diluted to 100 mM HEPES and 4M GnHCl and pH adjusted (pH6.5–7.5) prior to 6-plex TMT labelling as per manufacturer’s instructions (Sixplex TMT, Cat# 90061, ThermoFisher Scientific). Equal ratios of TMT-labelled samples were pooled and methanol/chloroform precipitated. Protein pellets were air-dried and re-suspended in 200 mM HEPES (pH8), and digested with trypsin (1:100 ratio) for 16 hr at 37°C, pH 6.5 and a sample was taken for pre-TAILS. High-molecular-weight dendritic polyglycerol aldehyde polymer (ratio of 5:1 w/w polymer to sample) and NaBH<sub>3</sub>CN (to a final concentration of 80 mM) was added, incubated at 37°C for 16 hr, followed by quenching with 100 mM ethanolamine (30 min at 37°C) and underwent ultrafiltration (MWCO of 10,000). Collected samples were desalted, acidified to 0.1% formic acid and dried, prior to MS analysis.</p><p>Samples were analysed on a Thermo Scientific Easy nLC-1000 coupled online to a Bruker Daltonics Impact II UHR QTOF. Briefly, peptides were loaded onto a 20 cm x 75 µm I.D. analytical column packed with 1.8 µm C18 material (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany) in 100% buffer A (99.9% H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.1% formic acid) at 800 bar followed by a linear gradient elution in buffer B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to a final 30% buffer B for a total 180 min including washing with 95% buffer B. Eluted peptides were ionised by ESI and peptide ions were subjected to tandem MS analysis using a data-dependent acquisition method. A top17 method was employed, where the top 17 most intense multiply charged precursor ions were isolated for MS/MS using collision-induced-dissociation, and actively excluded for 30 s.</p><p>MGF files were extracted and searched using Mascot against the UniProt <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> database, with semi-ArgC specificity, TMT6plex quantification, variable oxidation of methionine, variable acetylation of N termini, 20 ppm MS1 error tolerance, 0.05 Da MS2 error tolerance and two missed cleavages. Mascot. dat files were imported into Scaffold Q+S v4.4.3 for peptide identification processing to a final FDR of 1%. Quantitative values were calculated through Scaffold and used for subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Transcriptomic samples: isolation, RNA extraction, and data processing</title><p>AF and NP tissues from four individuals were cut into approximately 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> pieces, and put into the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 20 mM HEPES (USB), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) and 0.4% fungizone (Gibco). The tissues were digested with 0.2% pronase (Roche) for 1 hr, and centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min to remove supernatant. AF and NP were then digested by 0.1% type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical) for 14 hr and 0.05% type II collagenase for 8 hr, respectively. Cell suspension was filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer (BD Falcon) and centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again to remove the supernatant. RNA was then extracted from the isolated disc cells using Absolutely RNA Nanoprep Kit (Stratagene), following manufacturer’s protocol, and stored at −80°C until further processing.</p><p>The quality and quantity of total RNA were assessed on the Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using the RNA 6000 Nano total RNA assay. cDNA was generated using Affymetrix GeneChip Two-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit, followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription to produce biotin-labelled cRNA. The sample was then hybridised onto the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The array image, CEL file and other related files were generated using Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console. The experiment was conducted as a service at the Centre for PanorOmic Sciences of the University of Hong Kong.</p><p>CEL and other files were loaded into GeneSpring GX 10 (Agilent) software. The RMA algorithm was used for probe summation. Data were normalised with baseline transformed to median of all samples. A loose filtering based on the raw intensity values was then applied to remove background noise. Consequently, transcriptomic data with a total of 54,675 probes (corresponding to 20,887 genes) and eight profiles were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Bioinformatics and functional analyses</title><p>The detected proteins were compared against the transcription factor (TF) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vaquerizas et al., 2009</xref>) and the human genome nomenclature consortium database for cell surface markers (CDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braschi et al., 2019</xref>), where 77 TFs and 83 CDs were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Excluding missing values, the LFQ levels among the data-points range from 15.6 to 41.1, with a Gaussian-like empirical distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The numbers of valid values per protein were found to decline rapidly when they were sorted in descending order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, upper panel). To perform PCAs, only a subset of genes with sufficiently large numbers of valid values (i.e. non-missing values) were used. The cutoff for this was chosen based on a point corresponding to the steepest slope of descending order of valid protein numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, second panel), such that the increase of valid values is slower than the increase of missing values beyond that point. Subsequently, the top 507 genes were picked representing 59.8% of all valid values. This new subset includes 12.4% of all missing values. Since the subset of data still contains some missing values, an imputation strategy was adopted employing the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) method and package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011</xref>), with a max iteration set at 50 and the default PMM method (predictive mean matching). To further ensure normality, Winsorisation was applied such that genes whose average is below 5% or above 95% of all genes were also excluded from PCA. The data was then profile-wise standardised (zero-mean and one standard deviation) before PCA was applied on the R platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">R Development Core Team, 2013</xref>).</p><p>To assess the impact of the spatiotemporal factors on the proteomic profiles, we performed Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), correlating each protein to the age, compartments, level, and directionality. To draw the soft boundaries on the PCA plot between groups of samples, support vector machines with polynomial (degree of 2) kernel were applied using the LIBSVM package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>) and the PCA coordinates as inputs for training. A meshed grid covering the whole PCA field was created to make prediction and draw probability contours for −0.5, 0, and 0.5 from the fitted model. Hierarchical clustering was performed with (1- correlation coefficient) as the distance metrics unless otherwise specified.</p><p>To address the problem of ‘dropout’ effects while avoiding extra inter-dependency introduced due to imputations, we adopted three strategies in calculating the DEPs, namely, by statistical testing, exclusively detected, and fold-change cutoff approaches. First, for the proteins that have over half valid values in both groups under comparison, we performed t-testing with p-values adjusted for multiple testing by the false discovery rate (FDR). Those with FDR below 0.05 were considered statistical DEPs. Second, for the proteins where one group has some valid values while the other group is completely not detected, we considered the ones with over half valid values in one group to be exclusive DEPs. For those proteins that were expressed in &lt;50% in both groups, the ones with fold-change greater than two were also considered to be DEPs.</p><p>To fit the lateral and anteroposterior trends for the modules of genes identified in the young samples, a Gaussian Process Estimation (GPE) model was trained using the GauPro package in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">R Development Core Team, 2013</xref>. Pathway analyses was conducted on the GSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). Signalling proteins was compiled based on 25 Signal transduction pathways listed on KEGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanehisa et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For transcriptomic data, we used a thresholding approach to detect DEGs (differentially expressed genes), whereby a gene was considered a DEG if the log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) is greater than three and the average expression (logarithmic scale) is greater than 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>).</p><p>The LASSO model between MRI and proteome was trained using the R package ‘glmnet’, wherein the 85 ECMs were first imputed for missing values in them using MICE. Nine ECMs were not imputed for too many missing values, leaving 76 for training and testing. The best value for λ was determined by cross-validations. A model was then trained on the aged MRIs (dependent variable) and aged proteome of the 76 genes (independent variable). The fitted model was then applied to the young proteome to predict MRIs of the young discs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Software availability</title><p>The custom scripts for processing and analysing the data were housed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hkudclab/DIPPER">github.com/hkudclab/DIPPER</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tam, 2021</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:48aa545b7d49a45e1fb2e8f1ac92f07ed38d95e9;origin=https://github.com/hkudclab/DIPPER;visit=swh:1:snp:ae2d5e4ab6a839da8bbf84579f451eb9f2c06277;anchor=swh:1:rev:49e4da79786de1dfa496d7c7472343f3b865696c/">swh:1:rev:49e4da79786de1dfa496d7c7472343f3b865696c</ext-link>.

degeneration is associated with low back pain and significantly affects patient's quality of life. The pathophysiology of IVD disease is poorly understood and currently no treatments are available to restore disc structure and function. The spatial-temporal proteomic and transcriptomic data presented in this manuscript on lumbar discs of healthy young and old cadavers provide an important resource for researchers in this field that will facilitate future identification of therapeutic targets for this debilitating disease.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The spatial proteome of the human intervertebral disc reveals architectural changes in health, ageing and degeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While all three reviewers complemented on the comprehensive computational analyses of the proteomics data, there was a major concern that all of the analyses were done using data derived from a single young and old IVD disc. Furthermore, the IVD from a scoliosis patient may not be a good control to represent normal young IVD because of the known effect of scoliosis on cell behavior and gene expression. In general, the study is considered descriptive and correlative in nature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper explores at the proteomic and transcriptomic level, the profile shifts that occur with ageing/degeneration particularly focusing on different intervertebral disc compartments and on distinct segmental levels.</p><p>It is a new and extremely detailed study that provides an immense amount of data on intervertebral disc spatial proteomics which is foreseen to have an important contribute for the field with an expected impact in the development of novel therapeutic alternatives.</p><p>Despite the exhaustive analysis of the obtained data (from different levels and areas of the disc), for most of the comparisons, conclusions are inferred from a single individual per group, with its own genetic background and biological particularities. My major concern regards the fact that many extrapolations might differ in samples from other individuals. In Figure 7B, for instance, simply by comparing 2 individuals it is clear that the profile of NP_YND151 is very different from that of NP_YND152, as stated by the authors, which corroborates this issue of biological variability and how it may impact on the conclusions taken.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript using dynamic proteomic analysis of SILAC and TAILS degradome, established the reference spatial proteome of young healthy human IVDs by profiling the 11 different regions of disc. Additionally, aging associated changes in IVD proteomic landscape was reported with emphasis on core and core-associated matrisome. Using series of valid computational analyses, authors have evaluated the similarities and differences in the young and aged disc compartments. This will be a valuable resource in IDD research specifically by providing an interactive web interface to comprehend the proteome data. Study design is good and logical and experiments were well performed and organized. Conclusion drawn from experiment was convincing with data presented. There are few concerns for the author that need to be addressed:</p><p>It is not clear why author chose to use only one lumber disc to establish the reference proteome, when there is availability of 17 individual lumber discs. Adding more samples in establishing the new reference proteome would certainly add rigor to data.</p><p>It would be interesting to see the “LASSO regression model” to provide association between MRI and disc hydration is also valid in young disc. Is this regression specific to degenerated aged disc?</p><p>How did author ensure the validity of imputation analysis for the missing data? What was the iteration value used? How was the data normalized?</p><p>Did author identify any transcription factor associated module in expression module Y analysis of young and aged disc. Since transcription factors define the cellular identity, it would be interesting to see the compartments specific the key transcript factors in these IVDs.</p><p>In DEG analysis, why did author see only 88 gene between young and aged disc, considering huge transcriptomic changes during disc degeneration, this number is relatively low. What was significant cutoff used for DEG? Was multiple correction testing applied?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work employs a sophisticated proteomic analysis with SILAC and TAILS methods to provide changes in proteomic landscape in young and aging human disc. Technical aspects of the study are interesting although the information generated is more or less been known for a while including a proteomic study done by this group in 2016. While 33 samples were analyzed each for young and old discs, they all are derived from a single donor. It is known that there are individual to individual changes which are therefore not accounted for in proteomic analysis. One of the major issues in this study is the use of scoliotic tissue specimens used for transcriptomic, SILAC and TAILS analyses. It is abundantly clear that scoliosis and other spinal deformities alter cell behavior and gene expression profiles due to long term altered mechanical loading on discs and while MRI analysis could show &quot;white&quot; discs, they cannot be regarded normal young discs. Consequently, the profiles and information that is generated with such tissues also needs to carefully interpreted. Study is also descriptive in nature and mostly correlative. So, while methodologically interesting analyses is presented the amount of new biological insights generated are limited, most confirmatory to what is largely known e.g. fibrotic changes of NP and acquisition of AF like profiles, changes in signaling pathways SHH, WNT and TGF.

In general, the study is considered descriptive and correlative in nature.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) This paper explores at the proteomic and transcriptomic level, the profile shifts that occur with ageing/degeneration particularly focusing on different intervertebral disc compartments and on distinct segmental levels.</p><p>It is a new and extremely detailed study that provides an immense amount of data on intervertebral disc spatial proteomics which is foreseen to have an important contribute for the field with an expected impact in the development of novel therapeutic alternatives.</p><p>Despite the exhaustive analysis of the obtained data (from different levels and areas of the disc), for most of the comparisons, conclusions are inferred from a single individual per group, with its own genetic background and biological particularities. My major concern regards the fact that many extrapolations might differ in samples from other individuals. In Figure 7B, for instance, simply by comparing 2 individuals it is clear that the profile of NP_YND151 is very different from that of NP_YND152, as stated by the authors, which corroborates this issue of biological variability and how it may impact on the conclusions taken.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments, particularly for the affirmative comments on the overall design, methodology and potential contribution to the field.</p><p>With regards to the comment on the single individual per group in our static proteome data, we agree that it is the limitation of the design. However, we would like to clarify a few points. First, the young individual is a trauma-induced sample (not reported to have degeneration or scoliosis) and the aged sample is not known to have a diagnosis of degeneration, although its MRI does show features typical of his age (Figure 1C). These samples are incredibly rare to obtain, and it is even rarer to obtain multiple intact discs from the same individual (Figure 1BC). Second, we obtained multiple disc levels and directions, amounting to 33 profiles per individual (Figure 1D). These 33 profiles are not simply just technical replicates of each other, but are separate measurements for samples with different location information (levels, directions, compartment). Taking the analogy of single cell transcriptome analysis, one can imagine that this study design lies halfway between bulk and single-cell proteomics, but with additional locational information. Thus, they present much more information than a single bulk profile per individual. Third, we also have another 15 individuals (clinical samples) for the dynamic proteome (SILAC and degradome) and transcriptome (Figure 1A). Despite slight clinical variations and different measuring variables or quantities, they demonstrate consistent behaviour with the static proteome (Figure 6 and Figure 7), which adds a further dimension of robustness to the findings in the static proteome. Finally, in recognising the sample size limitation, we do not claim these samples are representative of the general population, but it is hoped that the data are highly valuable as point references for the disc proteome. This is clarified in the text in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>The lower number of proteins in the heavy SILAC profile of NP_YND152 is likely a result of a technical issue during sample preparation, evidenced by the less dramatic reduction in its light SILAC profile (middle panel, Figure 7B). Despite its lower quality, NP_YND152 still behaves biologically more similar to NP_YND151 than to both AF_YND and AGD (AF and NP) samples (as illustrated in Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). Thus, it is still representative of a young disc. This is the only technically compromised sample (Figure 7B) whereas the AF_YND samples are more technically stable with lower observed variance (Figure 7B). We have clarified this in the text (subsection “Aged or degenerated discs synthesise fewer proteins”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) This manuscript using dynamic proteomic analysis of SILAC and TAILS degradome, established the reference spatial proteome of young healthy human IVDs by profiling the 11 different regions of disc. Additionally, aging associated changes in IVD proteomic landscape was reported with emphasis on core and core-associated matrisome. Using series of valid computational analyses, authors have evaluated the similarities and differences in the young and aged disc compartments. This will be a valuable resource in IDD research specifically by providing an interactive web interface to comprehend the proteome data. Study design is good and logical and experiments were well performed and organized. Conclusion drawn from experiment was convincing with data presented. There are few concerns for the author that need to be addressed:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments on our approaches and analytical framework, and for agreeing that this is a valuable resource in IVD research. In light of this, we are presenting the current version as a resource paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear why author chose to use only one lumber disc to establish the reference proteome, when there is availability of 17 individual lumber discs. Adding more samples in establishing the new reference proteome would certainly add rigor to data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment on the sample size issue. We would like to clarify a few points. First, the 17 individuals actually comprise two groups (Table 1 and Materials and methods), one that was from cadaveric samples (n=2; not reported to have scoliosis or degeneration, now clarified in our current texts at multiple locations, including the Introduction, Results, and Discussion), and the other that consists of clinical samples (n=15; young samples are scoliotic, and aged samples mostly have degeneration). For the cadaveric samples, multiple intact levels can be available up to our design and choice, whereas the disc levels of the clinical samples available to us depend on the surgery performed on each individual. As such, the clinical samples are usually from one level, which differed from patient to patient. They also tend to not be a whole intact disc. Therefore, it is neither highly valuable nor suitable to perform spatial proteome on them.</p><p>In practice, we profiled 11 localities per disc level for each of the respective three lumbar levels, for both cadaveric spines (Figure 1D). This amounts to 66 static spatial proteome profiles, wherein neither scoliosis nor degeneration is a known factor. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at profiling the disc proteome at such high spatial resolution. The levels, directions and compartments are directly matched between the two cadavers, which makes the comparisons highly meaningful.</p><p>We are fully aware and agree that having one subject per age-group in our static proteome is not ideal to extrapolate situations in the general population. However, obtaining a sizeable number of intact cadaveric spines per age-group may be dauntingly challenging. We argue that in spite of the potential under-representation of these two cadaveric spines, the multi-level, multi-locality proteomic profiles thus obtained and the derived results, can still serve as critical point references for gaining insights on spatial changes occurring during normal ageing, especially as no such data is known to exist.</p><p>Additionally, the clinical samples (n=15) afforded us to probe other aspects of molecular dynamics (protein turnover and transcriptome) for samples that are directly relevant to disc degeneration. The concordant results among these integrative multi-omics data (Figure 6 and Figure 7) also paint a coherent picture of the pathobiology under disc homeostasis and ageing/degeneration.</p><p>We added some explanation relating to these in subsection “Disc samples and their phenotypes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be interesting to see the “LASSO regression model” to provide association between MRI and disc hydration is also valid in young disc. Is this regression specific to degenerated aged disc?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their interest in the LASSO model. In short, we applied this only to the aged sample. The reasons are two-fold. First, the aged samples are naturally and biologically more variable. Second, the MRIs for aged samples have much higher resolution at 7T. These provide a larger dynamic range to afford a regression model to be practical. On the contrary, the young discs show a lower variability in both proteome and MRI intensity (3T), and thus may not afford sufficient dynamic ranges to perform such a regression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How did author ensure the validity of imputation analysis for the missing data? What was the iteration value used? How was the data normalized?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the interest in the technical aspect on data imputation. We used the “mice” package of R for performing imputation on a set of 507 genes selected based on an approach illustrated in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C. The parameter for the imputation is: [m=5,maxit=50,meth=“pmm”,seed=500], where m is the number of multiple imputations, “maxit” is the maximum number of iterations, “meth” is the imputation method, and “seed” is the seeding for random number. This was indeed mentioned specifically in subsection “Bioinformatics” and can also be checked on our scripts publicly available on github: https://github.com/hkudclab/DIPPER/blob/master/Figure2/PCA.R.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Did author identify any transcription factor associated module in expression module Y analysis of young and aged disc. Since transcription factors define the cellular identity, it would be interesting to see the compartments specific the key transcript factors in these IVDs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. We truly agree that transcription factors play a critical role in deciphering the regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular and tissue functions. In fact, we had a whole sub-section dedicated to reviewing the transcription factors and other key cellular proteins in the static proteome (subsection “Cellular activities inferred from non-matrisome proteins”).</p><p>In short, due to the nature of proteomic measurements, the bulk of materials came from the extracellular matrix, with much smaller contribution coming from intracellular proteins. This is especially relevant here as the IVD is much more enriched for matrix than for cells. Additionally, due to their regulatory roles, it is known that only small amounts of transcription factors are needed, making them even less detectable as compared with other intracellular proteins.</p><p>Nonetheless, we still detected a small number (82/3,100; Figure 1—figure supplement 3A) of transcription factors or DNA binding proteins. But many of these are histones, which leaves us with very few regulatory transcription factors.</p><p>We reviewed the genes in the four Y modules (Figure 3—figure supplement 3) and found that only two DNA binding proteins (MECP2 and HIST1H1B) were present in Y1 and Y2 modules, which we have now highlighted red, but otherwise there is no classical transcription factors in these modules. This is in contrast to the many well-known notochordal or NP markers, or AF markers that were in them.</p><p>Notwithstanding, we did detect some transcription factors through our transcriptome data, which measured mostly cellular materials. For example, we detected ZNF207, ZNF638, and HOPX to be down-regulated in aged or degenerated NP (versus young NP) (Figure 6B), whereby HOPX is reported to be differentially expressed in mouse NP as compared to AF (Veras et al., 2020), and reported to be expressed in mouse notochordal NP cells (Lam, 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In DEG analysis, why did author see only 88 gene between young and aged disc, considering huge transcriptomic changes during disc degeneration, this number is relatively low. What was significant cutoff used for DEG? Was multiple correction testing applied?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment on DEG results of subsection “Transcriptome shows AF-like characteristics of the aged/degenerated NP” and Figure 6—figure supplement 1E-H.</p><p>We would like to clarify that the 88 DEGs were not reported as comparison results between young and aged discs, but are that between young NP and young AF (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E). 39 of these 88 are expressed higher in young NP and 49 are higher in young AF.</p><p>For the comparisons between young and aged NP, there are 216 DEGs (Figure 6—figure supplement 1H), which is considerably more than 88, and fits what the reviewer says: “huge transcriptomic changes during disc degeneration”. There is also an elaboration on the larger number of AF-vsNP DEGs in aged samples than in young samples in subsection “Transcriptome shows AF-like characteristics of the aged/degenerated NP”.</p><p>Since there are only two samples per group in each of the comparisons in Figure 6—figure supplement 1E-H, we used a thresholding approach to detect DEGs, whereby a gene was considered a DEG if the log2(fold-change) is greater than 3 and the average expression (log scale) is greater than 10 (Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) This work employs a sophisticated proteomic analysis with SILAC and TAILS methods to provide changes in proteomic landscape in young and aging human disc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating the intricate designs in our approaches. The level of sophistication was needed to integrate multiple data types, and to de-convolute the effects of multiple factors on the disc proteome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Technical aspects of the study are interesting although the information generated is more or less been known for a while including a proteomic study done by this group in 2016.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s interest in the technical aspects of our study, and recognition of our group’s previous work in 2016.</p><p>However, we believe this study adds a much higher level of insights that were not able to be addressed in our previous 2016 paper (Yee et al., 2016), and other relevant papers (Babu et al. 2016; Rajasekaran et al., 2020). For example, we provide spatial information on the static proteome that covers levels, directions and compartments in aged and young disc (Figure 1A) that have not been addressed previously in any single publication.</p><p>Furthermore, considering the static proteome is an accumulation of the life-time of the protein turnover, the amounts of synthesis and turnover are likely to be different in young and aged discs, thus we also addressed this by the dynamic proteome (synthesis of new proteins – SILAC, and degradome, Figure 7).</p><p>Our dataset also included transcriptome of young and aged disc (Figure 6) which complemented our proteomic data to give further depth into the understanding of the cell states, as the proteome mostly measure the extracellular materials where the transcriptome measures the cellular materials.</p><p>From our data and high-resolution MRI images of aged disc, we were also able to identify a “hydration matrisome” and modelled this back to young MRI (Figure 8), which has the potential to serve as diagnostic markers for clinical application. It is rare that multiple aspects (static, dynamic proteome, transcriptome, MRI) can be unified within a single study. Although some of these findings were previously reported, they were disconnected or weakly implicated. Whereas in our study, multiple datasets and integrative analyses point in the same directions, which reinforced the robustness of the findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While 33 samples were analyzed each for young and old discs, they all are derived from a single donor. It is known that there are individual to individual changes which are therefore not accounted for in proteomic analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and we understand the concern. We would like to refer you to our response to reviewer 1, question 1 and our response to reviewer 2 question 2 for a thorough explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One of the major issues in this study is the use of scoliotic tissue specimens used for transcriptomic, SILAC and TAILS analyses. It is abundantly clear that scoliosis and other spinal deformities alter cell behavior and gene expression profiles due to long term altered mechanical loading on discs and while MRI analysis could show &quot;white&quot; discs, they cannot be regarded normal young discs. Consequently, the profiles and information that is generated with such tissues also needs to carefully interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and we understand the concern. We agree that (except in static proteome) the young non-degenerated samples used in transcriptomics, SILAC and TAILS are indeed scoliotic. We are aware there are recent reports on comparing non-degenerated and scoliotic NP with indication of some molecular differences (PMID: 32945197).</p><p>However, we would like to emphasise that the static spatial proteome (used as a “discovery set” here) was indeed performed on young disc that had no reported scoliotic diagnosis or degeneration, which can also be confirmed by MRI (Figure 1B). We have also clarified this in our texts at multiple locations, including the Introduction, Discussion, and subsection “Disc samples and their phenotypes”.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that scoliosis is not “normal”. In fact, we never claimed that the scoliotic samples used in our non-spatial data were “normal”. Instead, we referred to them as “young non-degenerated (YND)”.</p><p>Actually, results of non-spatial proteome data were primarily for cross-comparison and validation purposes (Figure 1A).</p><p>Strikingly, despite the technological differences between microarray and proteomics and known RNA-protein discrepancy, the results yielded by cross-age comparisons in the static proteome (where scoliotic samples were not involved) was mutually supportive with that yielded by the transcriptome (Figure 6). For example, the notochordal markers KRT8, KRT19 and CHRD (Figure 6C) are consistently expressed at higher levels in both proteome and transcriptome of young NP, with or without scoliosis. Likewise, in outer AF, markers such as COL1A1, THBS1/2/4, and COL12A1 is consistently expressed higher in both transcriptome and proteome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Study is also descriptive in nature and mostly correlative. So, while methodologically interesting analyses is presented the amount of new biological insights generated are limited, most confirmatory to what is largely known e.g. fibrotic changes of NP and acquisition of AF like profiles, changes in signaling pathways SHH, WNT and TGF. I do not think this manuscript warrants publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this work is based on observatory and exploratory data, which is typical of clinical data, as in our case. However, such studies are not without merits. One advantage is that our findings are based on human <italic>in vivo</italic> data, and are thus directly relevant to the clinical setting.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the recognition of our methodology. We agree some of the results (including processes and pathways) described and reported here may had been implicated previously by us and others. However, we argue that such consistence in turn confirms the strength and quality of our data in confirming known results and thus predicting novel outcomes. Also, previous findings were based on various other data types, or even different species and were loosely disconnected from literature to literature. In this study, through integrative data and analyses, we present a more coherent, unifying picture from the human proteome perspective. We are re-submitting this data, methodology, and findings, together with a user-friendly web interface, as a resource paper, hoping that they would find use in the skeletal field, with potential wider audience in the proteomics community.</p></body></sub-article></article>
