essential roles in mammalian neuronal axon guidance and in many other important mammalian biological processes. Plexin signaling depends on a semaphorin-induced dimerization mechanism and is modulated by small GTPases of the Rho family, of which RND1 serves as a plexin activator yet its close homolog RhoD an inhibitor. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we showed that RND1 reinforces the plexin dimerization interface, whereas RhoD destabilizes it due to their differential interaction with the cell membrane. Upon binding plexin at the Rho-GTPase-binding domain (RBD), RND1 and RhoD interact differently with the inner leaflet of the cell membrane and exert opposite effects on the dimerization interface via an allosteric network involving the RBD, RBD linkers, and a buttress segment adjacent to the dimerization interface. The differential membrane interaction is attributed to the fact that, unlike RND1, RhoD features a short C-terminal tail and a positively charged membrane interface.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plexin</kwd><kwd>small GTPases</kwd><kwd>membrane interaction</kwd><kwd>protein simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21806004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yanyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NSAF Joint Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U1430237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ke</surname><given-names>Pu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM130289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xuewu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xuewu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21873006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32071251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0500401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Small Rho GTPases confer up- and downregulation in mammalian plexin signaling by differential interactions with cell membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plexins are a family of nine single-pass transmembrane receptor proteins including plexin A1–4, B1–3, C1, and D1. Plexins are best known as the receptors of extracellular semaphorin ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nishide and Kumanogoh, 2018</xref>) that are guidance cues for neuronal axons. Plexins also help regulate other essential biological processes such as cell migration, angiogenesis, and immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sakurai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Takamatsu and Kumanogoh, 2012</xref>). Aberrant plexin activity is associated with a plethora of diseases including neurological disorders and cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gu and Giraudo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tamagnone, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yaron and Zheng, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Plexin architecture is conserved across the family. Plexin consists of a large multi-domain extracellular module including the ligand-binding Sema domain, a single-pass transmembrane helix, and an intracellular module that includes a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain and a Rho-family GTPase-binding domain (RBD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In plexin signaling, semaphorin binds at the extracellular module, which leads to activation of the GAP domain. Structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Janssen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nogi et al., 2010</xref>) showed that a semaphorin mediates plexin dimerization: a semaphorin dimer interacts with two plexins at the extracellular module, and this extracellular dimerization leads to dimerization at the intracellular module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and in turn activation of the GAP domain for the substrate Rap GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The dimerization stabilizes the active conformation of the so-called activation segments of the GAP domains, which otherwise adopts an inactive conformation that precludes Rap binding to the GAP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In plexin signaling, the GAP activity switches off the signaling of plexin substrate Rap by catalyzing its GTP hydrolysis and converting it from the GTP-bound state to the GDP-bound state. We will refer to GTPases such as Rap, which bind at the active site of the GAP domain, substrate GTPases.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Plexin architecture, dimerization, and GTPase binding of the RBD domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Components of a plexin molecule.

The RBD of plexin B1 has been shown to bind Rac1, Rac2, Rac3, Rnd1, Rnd2, Rnd3, and RhoD, but not RhoA, Cdc42, RhoG, or Rif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fansa et al., 2013</xref>). These Rho-family GTPases to various degrees serve as regulators in plexin activation. To distinguish them from the GAP-binding substrate GTPases such as Rap, we refer to these RBD-binding GTPases as regulatory GTPases.</p><p>The Rho-family regulatory GTPases play important roles in plexin regulation from the intracellular environment. Overexpression of Rac1 leads to higher cell surface expression of plexin and enhances plexin interaction with semaphorin, suggesting that Rac1 acts as an upstream activator of plexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vikis et al., 2002</xref>). Binding of overexpressed RND1 to plexin triggers cell collapse in the absence of semaphorin, suggesting that RND1 is a more potent activator than Rac1 for plexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zanata et al., 2002</xref>). Simultaneous extracellular binding of semaphorin and intracellular RBD binding of certain regulatory GTPases appear to be a prerequisite for full activation of at least some plexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell et al., 2011</xref>), but RBD binding with some other regulatory GTPases of the Rho family attenuates plexin activity. RhoD and RND1 are two such regulatory GTPases. RhoD binds plexin RBD with similar affinity as RND1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fansa et al., 2013</xref>), but it strongly inhibits plexin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zanata et al., 2002</xref>) rather than activates it.</p><p>The structural mechanism of the antithetic effects of RhoD and RND1 on plexin signaling, however, remains elusive. Activity assays in solution showed that the Rho-family GTPases do not alter the GAP activity of plexin either in the monomeric or the active dimer state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). RND1 is anchored to the membrane by a C-terminal amphipathic helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and RhoD by lipidation of a cysteine at the C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the membrane may play an important role in their plexin regulation. Resolved complex structures of plexin RBD with different Rho-family GTPases, such as RND1 (PDB 2REX and 3Q3J) and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), showed that the RBD binds with these GTPases in a similar mode. The structure of plexin RBD in complex with RhoD is not available, but data from NMR chemical shift analyses as well as binding assays with RhoD in different nucleotide states and mutants of plexin RBD together suggested that the binding mode is similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fansa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zanata et al., 2002</xref>). The crystal structures and other biophysical data all suggest that the RBD domain does not undergo substantial or global conformational changes upon binding with Rho-family GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Modulations of plexin activity from Rho-family GTPases thus are unlikely to be mediated by major conformational changes within the RBD domain.</p><p>To understand the apparent paradox regarding the antithetic effects of RND1 and RhoD on plexin activation, we determined the crystal structure of the RhoD/plexin B2-RBD complex, which confirmed that the RBD binding mode of RhoD is similar to that of other Rho-family regulatory GTPases. We then modeled and simulated plexin A4 complexed with RND1 or RhoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) to investigate the structural mechanisms underlying RND1 as an activator and RhoD as an inhibitor in plexin regulation. The simulations suggested that RND1 binding is compatible with the dimerization of plexin A4 while RhoD binding is likely disruptive to the dimerization. The simulations generated two distinct modes of interactions of RND1 and RhoD with the membrane: RND1 interacts with the membrane loosely and its long C-terminal tail serves as a flexible tether to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), whereas RhoD interacts with the membrane in a specific manner using a positively charged membrane interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which is absent in RND1. As a result, RND1 binding strengthens plexin dimerization by stabilizing the RBD position with respect to the GAP domain and in turn stabilizing the adjacent dimerization interfaces, while RhoD distorts the RBD position and hinders plexin dimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structure of the complex between RhoD and the plexin B2-RBD domain</title><p>Complex structures of the RBD domain with plexin activators such as RND1 or Rac1 have been previously resolved. To experimentally determine the binding mode between plexin and RhoD, a negative plexin regulator, we screened various combinations of RhoD and the intracellular region of plexin family members from different species for crystallization, which resulted in crystals of the complex of mouse plexin B2 and human RhoD bound to the GTP analogue GMP-PNP. Analyses of the diffraction data suggested that plexin B2 degraded during the incubation in crystallization drops, and the crystals only contained the complex between RhoD and the RBD of plexin B2. We solved the structure to 3.1 Å resolution by molecular replacement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; see Materials and methods for details). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two RhoD molecules, each of which binds to one plexin B2 RBD molecule. Surprisingly, the two RBD domains form a domain-swapped dimer in the structure, with the N-terminal portion of one molecule fold together with the C-terminal portion of the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This domain-swapped dimer is likely a crystallization artifact because it cannot form in the context of a plexin dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), in which the two RBD domains are far apart from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We therefore consider each RBD domain formed by the two halves of the two molecules as a representative of one intact, unswapped RBD as its conformation is very similar to the structures of other RBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of the RhoD/plexin B2-RBD complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall structure of the RhoD/plexin B2-RBD complex based on the domain-swapped dimeric structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The GTP analogue GMP-PNP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> together stabilize the ligand-binding switch I and switch II regions in the active conformation, which make an extensive interface with one side of the beta-sheet of the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). All the residues in RhoD involved in interacting with the RBD are identical between human and mouse RhoD, suggesting that the cross-species complex that we crystallized is a valid representative of the RhoD/plexin complex. Interestingly, a superimposition of the RhoD/plexin B2-RBD complex with the RND1/plexin B1-RBD complex based on the RBD domains shows that the orientation of RhoD and RND1 relative to the RBD domains is slightly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Compared with that in RND1, the switch II helix in RhoD is placed further away from the RBD. This appears to be required to accommodate Phe85, which is bulkier than Cys81, the corresponding RND1 residue. This difference leads to different pivots of the two GTPases relative to the RBD, which propagates to a larger difference in the opposite side of the molecule, where the insert helices (αI), a helical segment uniquely present in the catalytic domains of Rho-family GTPases, is located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the context of the active dimer of full-length plexin on the plasma membrane, the αI helix faces the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). This orientational difference of RhoD and RND1 relative to plexin therefore may affect their interactions with the membrane, although it is unclear whether and how that effect is related to the opposite roles of RND1 and RhoD in plexin signaling.</p><p>To investigate the conformational dynamics of RBD complexes with RND1 and RhoD, we simulated the RBD complexes with RND1 or RhoD, each for three 1-μs simulations. In these simulations, only the RBD domain of plexin A4 and the catalytic domain of RND1 or RhoD were included. These simulations showed that both complexes are overall stable, with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the Cα atoms of the catalytic domains with respect to their initial positions fluctuating around 4 Å when the RBD domain aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). By this metric, RND1 appears to be more flexible than RhoD relative to the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The αI helix of RND1 was also more flexible than RhoD with respect to the catalytic domain as a whole in the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). This analysis is consistent with our finding that the RhoD regulation of plexin activity requires a stable membrane interaction involving the αI helix, but the RND1 function involves little membrane interaction.

To investigate how the membrane might play a role in plexin regulation mediated by RND1 and RhoD, we simulated plexin A4 dimer in the membrane environment, respectively, bound with RND1 and RhoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We first constructed a structural model of the transmembrane and the intracellular modules of the plexin A4 dimer with a membrane, primarily using homology modeling based on the resolved structure of the intracellular module of plexin C1 dimer (PDB 4M8N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). We then added two GTP-bound RND1 molecules to the plexin dimer to bind the RBD domains; the RND1 C-terminal tails each forms an amphipathic helical tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thiyagarajan et al., 2004</xref>) and serves as a membrane anchor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). We similarly constructed a plexin dimer model in which each plexin RBD is bound with a (GTP-bound) RhoD, where Cys207 residue of the C-terminal tail is palmitoylated and anchored to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In cells, the membrane anchor of RhoD is more commonly the geranylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hodge and Ridley, 2016</xref>) Cys207, but this difference should not affect the results of the simulations. It is worth noting that the construction of these two models was essentially constrained by existing crystal structures. It involved piecing together the plexin dimer structure (in which the RBD domains are resolved) and the complex structures of RBD bound with RND1 or RhoD. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, the positioning of the plexin dimer with respect to the membrane is determined by symmetry, that is, the two halves of the plexin dimer are identical in terms of their positions relative to the membrane. With the exception of the C-terminal loops of RND1 and RhoD, these two models are highly similar prior to simulations.</p><p>We simulated the RND1-bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the RhoD-bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) plexin dimers, each for 1 μs three times. In the simulations of the RND1-bound dimer, the amphipathic helices at the C-termini of the RND1 molecules remained anchored to the membrane, and the RND1 linkers between the catalytic domains and the amphipathic helices (residues 189–200) are sufficiently long to not affect the position of the catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The contact area between the membrane and the catalytic domains remains relatively small, with a mean at approximately 200 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In contrast to the RND1-bound plexin dimer, in the simulations of the RhoD-bound plexin dimer, the membrane interactions of the RhoD catalytic domains developed extensive and stable interactions with the membrane in the courses of the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The contact area of the two RhoD domains with the membrane fluctuated but generally trended upwards. It is apparent that the extent of the membrane interaction is closely correlated with the positioning of the catalytic domains in both the RND1- and the RhoD-bound plexin dimers. With the increase of the membrane interactions, the two RhoD domains deviated substantially from their initial positions, as shown by the RMSD of Cα atoms with respect to their initial positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The RMSD fluctuation of the RhoD domains was larger than the RND1 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that the differential membrane interactions of RhoD and RND1 lead to their differential positioning and dynamics. Our analysis showed that, for RhoD more than for RND1, the membrane contact area is correlated with the RMSD of the GTPase domain with respect to its initial position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), in agreement with the notion that the membrane interaction modulates RhoD positioning.</p><p>Further analysis suggested that RhoD interacts with the membrane with a specific interface involving the αI helix and the α4 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>); Arg144, Arg145, His154, and Arg155 in this part of RhoD enjoyed stable interactions with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The RhoD membrane-anchoring interface features pronounced positive electrostatic potential that is favorable for membrane interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, the number of RhoD residues in membrane contact grew in the simulations, and the contact map showed that the membrane contact primarily involved the αI helix (residues 130–146) and its neighboring region. We also observed the development of enrichment of the negatively charged 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS) lipids among the lipids in contact with RhoD in the course of the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), in agreement with the electrostatic nature of the membrane interaction of RhoD. The trend of charged lipids becoming enriched in the membrane interfaces with RhoD molecules was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>) in similar simulations where phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) lipids were included in the membrane. In contrast, RND1 interaction with the membrane is much less stable, without a specific membrane interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and with fewer residues involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The positively charged residues in the RhoD membrane interface are almost all replaced in RND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), and hence the strong electrostatic feature of RhoD in that region is absent in RND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These observations combined suggest that the tight membrane interaction of RhoD may be attributed to the short C-terminal tail and to the positively charged surface patch, which distinguish RhoD from RND1.</p><p>The simulations of both the RND1-bound and the RhoD-bound plexin dimer were initiated from highly similar models that integrate structural information in existing crystal structures. In these simulations, the behavior of RND1 and RhoD molecules diverged in terms of their membrane interaction. To ensure that this finding is not associated with a feature of the particular initial models, we performed the following control simulations. We took a typical simulation-generated conformation of the RhoD-bound plexin dimer (in which the RhoD molecules bear extensive membrane interaction) and swapped the RhoD molecules for RND1. In the resulted RND1-bound plexin dimer, the RND1 molecules inherited the extensive membrane interaction. Similarly, we took a typical simulation-generated conformation of the RND1-bound plexin dimer (in which the RND1 molecules bear limited membrane interaction) and swapped the RND1 molecules for RhoD. In the resulting system, the RhoD molecules bear little membrane interaction. We then performed three 0.5-μs-long simulations for each of these two systems, hoping that the simulations will reinstall the previously observed pattern of membrane interaction for RND1 and RhoD in spite of the initial structures being of the opposite pattern (we added PIP2 lipids to the membrane in these simulations to better represent the cell membrane). Indeed, in the control simulations, the RND1 membrane contact area dwindled, while the RhoD membrane contact area grew steadily and gradually surpassed the RND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). We believe that these additional simulations provide important validation to the key observations we obtained with respect to the membrane interactions of RND1 and RhoD. While the trend is clear in these relatively short (0.5-μs-long each) simulations, most likely the simulations have not converged and the trend will become more pronounced if the simulations are extended.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The differential membrane interactions lead to different RBD position and dynamics</title><p>In the plexin dimer, each RhoD or RND1 molecule is located in a space confined by the membrane and the RBD domain and interacts with both simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). In the simulations, the RBD interacts with either RhoD or RND1 stably, although RhoD interacts with RBD with a slightly larger interface than RND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition to RND1- and RhoD-bound plexin dimers, we simulated plexin monomer and dimer with the RBD domains unoccupied, each for 500 ns. We analyzed the positions of the RBD domain with respect to the GAP domain in all our simulations. The RBD domain appeared to be inherently flexible with respect to the GAP domain as shown in the monomer simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is suggested by existing crystal structures of plexins, in which the RBD domain exhibited substantial flexibility with respect to the GAP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The interface between RBD and GAP appeared to be reduced by the presence of RhoD but not by the presence of RND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, E</xref>). The RBD RMSD with respect to its initial position was overall larger for the RhoD-bound than for the RND1-bound plexin dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that RhoD likely displaces the RBD from its native position while RND1 tends to stabilize RBD at that position. Since RBD binds stably with both RND1 and RhoD, the differential RBD positioning and dynamics may likely be attributable to the differential membrane interactions of RND1 and RhoD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>RND1- and RhoD-bound RBD domains are positioned differently with respect to their respective GAP domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RhoD-bound plexin dimer.

The interaction between two dimerization helices in the dimer, which resembles coiled-coil interactions, is reinforced by Helix 11 of the GAP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In crystal structures, Helix 11 is a stable helix, but the segment to its N-terminal is more variable structurally – it takes the form of a 3<sub>10</sub> or an α helix in some crystal structures, but in many other structures it is disordered. When it is a 3<sub>10</sub> or an α helix, it becomes an extension of Helix 11 and runs adjacent and in parallel to the dimerization helix, structurally reinforcing the interaction of the two dimerization helices in resemblance to a buttress.

Importantly, with RhoD binding at the RBD, the buttress interaction with the dimerization helix in the plexin dimer is much reduced compared to that in the RND1-bound dimer or in the dimer where the RBD domains are unoccupied, suggesting that RhoD weakens the buttress interaction with the dimerization helix and potentially destabilizes the plexin dimer.

In contrast, in simulations of the RND1-bound dimer both the helical structure and the interaction with the dimerization helices are much more stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

RhoD binding destabilizes the RBD with respect to the GAP domain, destabilizing the buttress segment with respect to the dimerization interface, and ultimately leads to destabilization of the dimer interface.

RND1 serves as a promoter of plexin signaling, while RhoD serves as an inhibitor. Our structural and molecular dynamics simulations and analyses suggest that the differential effects of RND1 and RhoD may arise from their differential interactions with the membrane. RND1 interacts with the membrane loosely and nonspecifically, while RhoD interacts with the membrane tightly with a specific interface. This difference gives rise to different positioning and dynamics of the RBD domain, which dictates the conformation of the buttress segment adjacent to the dimerization interface of plexin. We further showed that RhoD binding destabilizes the dimerization interface while RND1 binding helps stabilize the interface. In short, we propose an allosteric mechanism that regulates plexin dimerization involving cell membranes, the regulatory GTPases, the RBD domain, and the buttress segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>Our results on RND1 and RhoD offer a framework for the analysis of plexin regulation by Rho-family GTPases. We show that the antithetic roles of RND1 and RhoD result from two seemingly minor differences. First, RhoD furnishes a much shorter C-terminal tail than RND1, and consequently, RhoD is spatially more restrained to the membrane than RND1. Secondly, RhoD features a surface region that is rich in positively charged residue, which serves as the interface with membranes; these positively charged residues are not present in RND1. These two differences determine that RND1 and RhoD interact with the membrane differently and play different roles in plexin regulation. To experimentally validate or falsify this hypothesis, we suggest testing the effect of altering the C-terminal tails of RND1 and RhoD and the electrostatic properties of the putative membrane interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Specifically, mutating RND1 residues (e.g., Leu133, Glu138, Ser140, and Glu150) at the αI or α4 helices (the putative membrane-contacting region of RhoD) into positively charged arginines or lysines should impair the role of RND1 as a plexin activator, and conversely, mutating the lysines and arginines at these two helices of RhoD should impair the role of RhoD as a plexin inhibitor. By the same rationale, lengthening the C-terminal loop of RhoD should impair its inhibitory effect, while shortening the loop of RND1 should impair its activating effect. Likely, combinations of these two sets of modifications to RND1 and RhoD should confer a compound effect.</p><p>We analyzed the sequences of the Rho-family GTPases and, to our surprise, found that these two features are indeed correlated. The Rho GTPases with shorter C-terminal tails indeed tend to feature more positively charged residues at the putative membrane interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that, besides RND1 and RhoD, other Rho-family GTPases may also be involved in regulations of plexin signaling, and that the Rho-family GTPases with short C-terminal tails may likely be downregulators and the other with long C-terminal tails likely upregulators. In cell biology, similar to plexin regulation by Rho-family GTPases, there are many other cases in which similar proteins in the same family interact with their target proteins almost identically yet achieve opposite regulatory effects. Simulations are an expedient platform to gain insight into such mechanisms.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The charge distribution at the putative membrane interface of Rho-family GTPases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of Rho-family GTPases at the region of the putative membrane interface; red denotes negatively charged residues, and blue denotes positively charged residues.

Unlike A4, for those plexins for which better structural data are available, direct functional data of regulation by Rho-family GTPases are lacking. Plexin C1, which is arguably the best structurally characterized plexin in terms of the intracellular domains, is such an example. Even for C1, the structural information is incomplete as the structure of C1 complex with a Rho-family GTPase is not available. It is thus necessary to construct models from other plexin structures regardless of our choice of plexin system. We resorted to homology modeling (see Materials and methods) to construct A4 structures for simulations, considering the high level of sequence (35% or above overall) and structure similarly among the plexin family members, particularly in the dimer interface. The binding mode between class A plexins and Rho-family GTPases is particularly conserved, as shown by the numerous crystal structures, including that of plexin B2/RhoD presented in this paper. We therefore believe that the models of the plexin A4/RND1 and plexin A4/RhoD complexes are reliable. Moreover, our conclusion concerns mostly inter-domain interactions and thus is less likely to be sensitive to the structural details as the main driving force is the electrostatic interactions between the GTPases and membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), rather than any specific residue-residue interactions arising from a specific conformation. Reassuringly, our findings are supported by a recent study on plexin B1, which (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2021</xref>) identified the functional importance of the buttress segment (or ‘activation switch loop’ as is referred therein) based on analysis of plexin enzymatic turnover, and showed that the segment helps stabilize the dimerization helix when the plexin active site is occupied by Rap.</p><p>Our results suggest that similar to many other signaling proteins, for plexin the membrane also plays an important role in its regulation. In a membrane environment of a high composition of negatively charged lipids such as POPS, PIP2, and PIP3, plexin signaling is likely more susceptible to negative regulation by RhoD. There are reports that plexin signaling activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, upon which PIP2 lipids in the membrane are phosphorylated and converted to more negatively charged PIP3 lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Falkenburger et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings raise the question as to whether downregulation associated with RhoD binding may be a part of a negative feedback mechanism for plexin signaling involving the PI3K/AKT pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>1.

The process of the Modeller-generating structures and the selection standard was the same as that used in constructing plexin structure. We separately resolved the RhoD-RBD complex structure using crystallography. A Palmitoyl group was covalently linked to Cys207 of the C-terminal tail of RhoD to produce a palmitoylated cysteine.

The membrane in the simulation systems comprised heterogeneous lipids. There were 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) molecules in the upper leaflet and POPC and negatively charged POPS molecules with a ratio of 7:3 in the lower leaflet for the original dimer systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arkhipov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zachowski, 1993</xref>), and POPC and POPS and PIP2 molecules with a ratio of 70:25:5 in the lower leaflet in the control dimer systems, so there were negative charges in the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In order to ensure that the simulation results were not associated with the features of the initial models, we built two control simulation systems. We used the last snapshot of a 1-μs simulation of a RhoD-bound plexin dimer and swapped the RhoD molecules for RND1; similarly, we used the last snapshot of a 1-μs simulation of an RND1-bound plexin dimer and swapped the RND1 molecules for RhoD. 27 PIP2 molecules were added to the membrane, which constitute 5% of the lipids in the inner leaflet. We then performed three 0.5-μs-long simulations for each of these two systems.</p><p>The monomer system was a cubic box of 120 × 120 × 140 Å<sup>3</sup> that contained 198,176 atoms in total, including water molecules and Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions. The RBD-RND1 and RBD-RhoD systems take the form of a cubic box of 100 × 100 × 100 Å<sup>3</sup> that contained 110,932 atoms and 104,447 atoms in total, respectively. The plexin dimer system with the RBD domains unoccupied was a cubic box of 190 × 190 × 170 Å<sup>3</sup> that contained 639,794 atoms in total. The first RND1-bound plexin dimer system was a cubic box of 190 × 190 × 170 Å<sup>3</sup> that contained 679,235 atoms in total. The first RhoD-bound plexin dimer system was a cubic box of 190 × 190 × 170 Å<sup>3</sup> that contained 679,086 atoms in total. The control RND1-bound plexin dimer system was a cubic box of 180 × 180 × 170 Å<sup>3</sup> that contained 580,115 atoms in total. The control RhoD-bound plexin dimer system was a cubic box of 180 × 180 × 190 Å<sup>3</sup> that contained 648,627 atoms in total. The dimensions of the simulation boxes were chosen so that the minimum distance of any protein in a system was greater than 10 Å to the edge. Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions were added to maintain physiological salinity (150 mM) and to obtain a neutral charge for the system. All the components in the system including POPC, POPS, PIP2, and protein, as well as palmitoylated lipid, were parameterized using the CHARMM36 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) and TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>The above dimer system with the RBD domains unoccupied system was also used to set up the G-protein-bound dimer system. When the system of two plexin monomer inserted into the membrane was generated, the initial placement of the RND1 molecule bound to RBD of plexin was determined by first superimposing one monomer structure in the dimer on the complex of RBD bound with RND1 (PDB entry 3Q3J) with the RBD domains aligned, followed by superimposing one RND1 structure on the RND1 in the complex structure encoded 3Q3J. The RND1 structure was placed at the targeting position. Meanwhile, both the GTP molecule and magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) ion in the complex (PDB entry 3Q3J) were superimposed on the RND1 structure. For the other monomer, the RND1 structure as well as the GTP molecule and Mg<sup>2+</sup> were also placed at the corresponding positions in the same way. Finally, the whole system of the RND1-bound plexin dimer inserted into the membrane was setup. The RND1-bound dimer system was placed in a cubic box of 190 × 190 × 170 Å<sup>3</sup> and 679,235 atoms in total in the system. The RhoD-bound dimer system was a cubic box of 190 × 190 × 170 Å<sup>3</sup> that contained 679,086 atoms in total. Both RhoD and RND1 were GTP-bound in the systems with Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordinating the GTP binding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>2.

Protein expression and purification</title><p>The coding region of the intracellular region of mouse plexin B2 with the juxtamembrane region removed (residues 1274–1842) was cloned into a modified pET-28(a) vector (Novagen) that encodes an N-terminal His6-tag followed by a recognition site for human rhinovirus 3C protease. The plasmid was transformed into the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain ArcticExpress (DE3) (Stratagene). ArcticExpress (DE3) carrying the expression plasmid was cultured at 37°C in 100–120 mL LB medium in the presence of gentamycin overnight. Bacterial cells were scaled up at 30°C to reach OD600 2.0 in TB medium. Protein expression was induced by 0.2 mM IPTG at 10°C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in Buffer A containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), 20 mM imidazole, and 3 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were lysed with a Avestin C3 disruptor (Avestin) and subjected to centrifugation. The plexin protein in the supernatant was captured using a 1 mL HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare) and eluted by Buffer B containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), 250 mM imidazole, and 3 mM β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was treated with recombinant human rhinovirus 3C protease at 4°C overnight to remove the N-terminal His6-tag. The tag-removed protein was loaded to a Resource Q anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (10 mM to 300 mM). Fractions containing plexin B2 were pooled and subjected to size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 GL 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer C containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 2 mM DTT.

The protein purification procedure was similar to that for plexin B2, except that all the buffers contained 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The RhoD protein with the Hist6-tag removed was subjected to the final purification step with a Superdex 75 GL 10/30 column with Buffer D containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 mM DTT.</p><p>To load the protein with GMP-PNP (guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate) for crystallization, the purified RhoD protein was incubated with GMP-PNP at 20-fold molar ratio to the protein in the exchange buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol (v/v), 7.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT at RT for 2 hr.

Crystallization, X-ray data collection, and structure determination</title><p>Plexin B2 and GMP-PNP-loaded RhoD were mixed at 1:1 molar ratio in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM TCEP, and 100 μM GMP-PNP to form the complex. The total protein concentration of the complex for crystallization was 6 mg/mL. The complex was crystallized initially at 20℃ in 0.2 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 20% PEG3350 (w/v) in sitting-drop 96-well plates. Crystals large enough for data collection were grown for over a month with sitting-drop or hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 20℃ in 0.2 M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 22% PEG3350 (w/v), and 100 mM MIB (pH 6.8, sodium malonate, imidazole, and boric acid mixed at 2:3:3 molar ratio). Crystals were cryo-protected using the crystallization buffer supplemented with 25% glycerol and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the beamline 19ID at the advance photon source (Argonne, IL). Data were indexed, reduced, and scaled with the software HKL2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</xref>). Molecular replacement using RND1 (PDB ID: 2REX) as the search model with the program phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) found two copies of RhoD in the asymmetric unit. However, repeated search using various full-length intracellular region of plexin models failed to yield any solution. In the end, the RBD of plexin B1 (PDB ID: 2REX) as the search model led to the solution of two copies of plexin B2-RBD in the asymmetric unit. It is likely that the full-length intracellular region of plexin B2 was degraded during the prolonged incubation at 20℃ in the crystallization drops, which separated the RBD from the rest of the protein. The RBD formed the complex with RhoD, which crystallized at the end. The initial model from molecular replacement was manually modified in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and refined using Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liebschner et al., 2019</xref>). The density clearly showed that the two RBD domains formed a domain-swapped dimer, with the swap occurring between residues 1509 and 1510. As a result, the N-terminal segment (residues 1463–1509) from the first molecule and the C-terminal segment (residues 1510–1565) from the second molecule pack together to form one RBD, and vice versa. The conformation of the RBD formed in this manner is very similar to other RBD structures in the database, and its binding mode with RhoD is very similar to that in other RhoGTPase/RBD complexes. This domain-swapped dimer cannot form in the context of the intact plexin, and therefore is unlikely to have any biological significance. The refined structure was validated by using Molprobity as implemented in Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Williams et al., 2018</xref>).

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

Because plexin signaling regulates several critical biological processes and several diseases are associated with disrupted plexin signaling, understanding the basis of plexin inhibition and activation could provide key molecular insights into this plexin-mediated pathway; as a result, this work will have a broad audience. However, the reviewers have some reservations that the manuscript's strong claims are based on limited simulation data of a large multi-component molecular system whose structure was built using homology modeling. Therefore, aspects of the structure determination and modeling need to be clarified to fully support the authors' claims. The reviews have also suggested several improvements that could make the paper more readable and make the statistical analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations more rigorous.</p><p>The reviews' consensus was that the work presented here is potentially suitable for publication; the combination of X-ray crystallography with extensive modeling appears to provide new insights into the molecular basis for the interaction of plexin with each GTPase. However, as the structural effects described are quite subtle, additional analyses and modeling will be necessary to fully validate the mode of association of these two GTPases with both the membrane and the plexin dimer.</p><p>We request that the authors make a note of and respond to the following comments, in addition to the essential revisions listed below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The primary concern of the reviews is the quality and built-in uncertainties of the initial models. Currently, the manuscript lacks consideration and discussion of the sensitivity of the results presented to the initial models. As the authors are most likely aware, the effect of the initial structure on the observations made on an MD trajectory can extend beyond the trajectory itself, depending on its length and the type of observable considered. Based on the data provided, it is unclear whether the conclusions are insensitive to the assumptions made in the construction of the initial homolog model. As such, the reviewers request that the authors carry out additional simulations with alternative models that are similarly plausible and yet meaningfully different from the models used in current version of the manuscript.</p><p>2. On a related note, the authors should comment and include a discussion in the updated manuscript on the validity of the domain-swapped X-ray structure.</p><p>3. The simulations are short relative to the state of the art, which is especially important for such large systems. To achieve full convergence, longer simulations or enhanced sampling is techniques may be required. Is there a reason why enhanced sampling methods were not employed? What metrics were employed to ascertain the statistical significance of the results presented.</p><p>4. The conclusions are declarative, but simulation results can only make predictions, and they should be stated as such. For instance, the authors state in the last sentence of the first paragraph in the Discussion that: &quot;In short, we reveal an allosteric mechanism that regulates plexin dimerization involving cell membranes, the regulatory GTPases, the RBD domain, and the buttress segment (Figure 5F).&quot; At best, one can say that &quot;…we reveal a possible allosteric mechanism.&quot; Even if the additional modeling requested above demonstrates that the conclusions are robust to the initial models, the authors will need to soften their claims and update the title accordingly to reflect that these are just predictions. Otherwise, their simulation data on its own are not strong enough to support their claims.</p><p>5. As mentioned by the authors in the Discussion section, the inner leaflet of the membrane is constituted by different negatively charges lipids which are known to have a role in signaling. One can cite especially the PIP2/3 lipids. Here, the authors have used a membrane composed on 7:3 ratio of POPC:POPS. It would be useful for the reader to explain this choice and maybe to run new simulations to see the action of the PIP2/3 lipids on the plexin/GTPases complex. It would also be valuable for the reader to see if negatively charged lipids may be differently attracted by RhoD and RND1. This may reinforce the authors' hypothesis and also inform the readership on how protein may drive the formation of lipid nanoclusters, which may have consequences for GTPases signaling.</p><p>6. The system models were constructed with a membrane composed of POPC in the outer leaflet and of a ratio of 7:3 POPC:POPS for the inner leaflet. While POPS lipid can be seen as a proxy for negatively charged lipids, there are quite important negatively charged lipids missing, such as PIP2 and PIP3.

The primary concern of the reviews is the quality and built-in uncertainties of the initial models. Currently, the manuscript lacks consideration and discussion of the sensitivity of the results presented to the initial models. As the authors are most likely aware, the effect of the initial structure on the observations made on an MD trajectory can extend beyond the trajectory itself, depending on its length and the type of observable considered. Based on the data provided, it is unclear whether the conclusions are insensitive to the assumptions made in the construction of the initial homolog model. As such, the reviewers request that the authors carry out additional simulations with alternative models that are similarly plausible and yet meaningfully different from the models used in current version of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We should clarify that the construction of the initial models entailed little discretionary decision by the modeller. The construction was largely determined by existing crystal structures of plexin dimer and crystal structures of plexin RBD domain bound with Rho small GTPases. The plexin dimer was so placed relative to the membrane such that the two plexin molecules are symmetric in terms of their geometric positions to the membrane. We have added text to make this point explicit.</p><p>That said, we agree that additional simulations will be helpful to solidify our case. The key simulation result is that, starting from the initial models, our simulations generated RND1- and RhoD-bound plexin models in which RND1 interacts loosely while RhoD interacts extensively with the membrane. For the additional control simulations, we swapped RND1 and RhoD and produced new initial models that contradict the simulation results. In these new initial models RND1 interacts with the membrane extensively while RhoD interacts with the membrane loosely. We launched three additional simulations for each of the new models. Reassuringly, we observed that the previous simulation result was confirmed despite the new initial models. Steadily, the RND1 membrane interaction decreased and the RhoD membrane interaction increased and surpassed RND1 in the simulations. This is now reported in the revised manuscript (Figure 3I, Figure 3-supplement 1B and 1C). We hope these new simulations sufficiently addressed the reviewers’ concern that the simulation results may be dependent on the initial models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. On a related note, the authors should comment and include a discussion in the updated manuscript on the validity of the domain-swapped X-ray structure.</p></disp-quote><p>The domain-swapped dimer of the RBD in the X-ray structure is likely a crystallographic artifact, which happens relatively often in protein crystallization. We therefore do not assign any biological significance to it. Instead, we show in the manuscript the reconstructed un-swapped RBD monomer, which is very similar to previously published structures of the RBD from other plexin family members.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The simulations are short relative to the state of the art, which is especially important for such large systems. To achieve full convergence, longer simulations or enhanced sampling is techniques may be required. Is there a reason why enhanced sampling methods were not employed? What metrics were employed to ascertain the statistical significance of the results presented.</p></disp-quote><p>These simulation systems of plexin dimers are relatively large, each includes ~640,000 atoms, which constrained the lengths of our simulations. We were interested in applying enhanced sampling methods such as replica exchange. In fact, our original plan was to run plain MD simulations and gain insight into plexin conformational dynamics, before we determine an appropriate enhance sampling methods. It was fortunate and fortuitous that the plain MD simulations were enough to provide relatively robust data that led to a meaningful result. In retrospect, we believe this is because the convergence of the protein-membrane interaction is relatively fast compared to large protein conformational changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The conclusions are declarative, but simulation results can only make predictions, and they should be stated as such. For instance, the authors state in the last sentence of the first paragraph in the Discussion that: &quot;In short, we reveal an allosteric mechanism that regulates plexin dimerization involving cell membranes, the regulatory GTPases, the RBD domain, and the buttress segment (Figure 5F).&quot; At best, one can say that &quot;…we reveal a possible allosteric mechanism.&quot; Even if the additional modeling requested above demonstrates that the conclusions are robust to the initial models, the authors will need to soften their claims and update the title accordingly to reflect that these are just predictions. Otherwise, their simulation data on its own are not strong enough to support their claims.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is well taken. We now consistently recalibrated our statements. For example, the mentioned statement now reads “In short, we <italic>propose</italic> an allosteric mechanism that regulates plexin dimerization involving cell membranes, the regulatory GTPases, the RBD domain, and the buttress segment (Figure 5G).” We also revised the title to be “<italic>A putative</italic> structural mechanism underlying the antithetic effect of homologous RND1 and RhoD GTPases in plexin regulation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. As mentioned by the authors in the Discussion section, the inner leaflet of the membrane is constituted by different negatively charges lipids which are known to have a role in signaling. One can cite especially the PIP2/3 lipids. Here, the authors have used a membrane composed on 7:3 ratio of POPC:POPS. It would be useful for the reader to explain this choice and maybe to run new simulations to see the action of the PIP2/3 lipids on the plexin/GTPases complex. It would also be valuable for the reader to see if negatively charged lipids may be differently attracted by RhoD and RND1. This may reinforce the authors' hypothesis and also inform the readership on how protein may drive the formation of lipid nanoclusters, which may have consequences for GTPases signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>The 7:3 ratio of POPC:POPS for the inner membrane leaflet was chosen to mimic the abundance of anionic lipids in the mammalian plasma membrane (Zachowski, 1993; van Meer et al., 2008). This is to mimic ~20% of POPS and ~10% of PIP, PIP2, and PIP3 combined. This is now clarified in the manuscript. Following the reviewers’ suggestion, in the new simulations for this revision, in the inner leaflet we included 25% POPS and 5% PIP2. Our analysis showed that the charged lipids tend to concentrate at the membrane-RhoD interface (Figure 3-supplement 1E and 1F). This is consistent with the reviewer’s notion that the membrane environment may have consequences for Rho GTPase-mediated plexin regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The system models were constructed with a membrane composed of POPC in the outer leaflet and of a ratio of 7:3 POPC:POPS for the inner leaflet. While POPS lipid can be seen as a proxy for negatively charged lipids, there are quite important negatively charged lipids missing, such as PIP2 and PIP3. It is now quite clear that these lipids can play a role in cell signaling. Thus, adding PIP2/3 lipids into the model may further validate the authors' claims with a more biologically relevant membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included PIP2 lipids in the new simulations. Please see the reply to the previous comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The author claims that the movement of RhoD alpha helix αi is due to allosteric changes. Displaying the full unit cell shows crystal packing contacts, which may affect the position of this αi helix. Atomistic simulations may help to assess the stability of the structure of RhoD-RBD complex in solution and confirm the position of the αi helix.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this comment, we have now simulated RBD/RhoD and RBD/RND1 complexes in solution. The simulations showed that both RhoD and RND1 bind with the RBD stably, but RND1 conformation is slightly more flexible than RhoD in the complex, both in terms of the entire GTPase domain and in terms of the alpha-I helix (Figure 2C, 2D, and 2E). We suggest that the relative stability of the alpha-I helix of RhoD is consistent with the notion that in plexin regulation RhoD is engaged in stable membrane interaction involving this helix. This is reported in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It is unclear how the authors have chosen the orientation of RND1 and RhoD towards the membrane. Are there specific references mentioning the position of RND1 and RhoD – or other homologous GTPases – towards the membrane? Would it be possible to randomly position these structures away from the membrane and perform MD simulations (maybe using low-resolution representations such as CG models to save computing time) to assess the preferred positioning of the respective structures?</p></disp-quote><p>Please also refer to our reply to Comment 1 of this review. We believe there is a misunderstanding here as to how our models were constructed. We have made revisions to clarify this point. To be clear, the positioning of RND1 or RhoD with respect to the membrane was entirely determined by existing crystal structures and simple symmetry. There is no room for manipulation by the modeler. The pose of RND1 or RhoD with the RBD domain is defined by crystal structures, and the RBD poses with respect to the plexin dimer as a whole is defined by crystal structures of plexin dimers in which the RBD domains are resolved. Thus the position of RND1 or RhoD in the plexin dimer is defined by crystal structures. We placed the plexin dimer relative to the membrane by symmetry, so that the two plexin protomers and the two RND1 or RhoD molecules they respectively bind are positioned identically relative to the membrane. In simulation RBD binding with RND1 or RhoD was largely stable, and RBD moved with RND1 and RhoD essentially as a whole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Given the manuscript's bold claim, the authors must include a discussion about the testable hypotheses the emerge from their work and how they can be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now included some discussion as how what specific mutagenesis experiments should be considered to validate the hypothesis. In discussions we wrote that “To experimentally validate or falsify this hypothesis, we suggest testing the effect of altering the C-terminal tails of RND1 and RhoD and the electrostatic properties of the putative membrane interface (Figure 3G). […] By the same rationale, lengthening the C-terminal loop of RhoD should impair its inhibitory effect, while shortening the loop of RND1 should impair its activating effect. Likely, combinations of these two sets of modifications to RND1 and RhoD should confer a compound effect.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. A key point of this study is that what differentiates RND1 and RhoD are the lengths and the number of positively charged residue in the C-terminal tail, all of which the author could obtain from the bioinformatic analysis as presented in Figure 6, without requiring simulations. Could the reviewers comment on the value added by the simulations?</p></disp-quote><p>We think the labeling of our figure might have misled the reviewer. We have revised the figure (Figure 6). Instead of plotting the number of charged residues in the C tail, Figure 6B actually plotted the number of charged residues of the putative membrane interaction interfaces of RND1 and RhoD, which were inferred from the simulations. Without simulation, there would be no knowing of the putative membrane interface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.
