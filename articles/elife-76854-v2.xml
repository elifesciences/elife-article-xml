We combined epidemiological and genetic sequencing data using a Bayesian modelling framework, and reconstructed transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 involving patients and HCWs, to determine who infected whom. We evaluated general transmission patterns according to case type (HCWs working in dedicated Covid-19 cohorting wards: HCW<sub>covid</sub>; HCWs working in non-Covid-19 wards where outbreaks occurred: HCW<sub>outbreak</sub>; patients with nosocomial Covid-19: patient<sub>noso</sub>) by deriving the proportion of infections attributed to each case type across all posterior trees and comparing them to random expectations.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period (1 March to 7 May 2020), we included 180 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases: 127 HCWs (91 HCW<sub>covid</sub>, 36 HCW<sub>outbreak</sub>) and 53 patients. The attack rates ranged from 10% to 19% for patients, and 21% for HCWs. We estimated that 16 importation events occurred with high confidence (4 patients, 12 HCWs) that jointly led to up to 41 secondary cases; in six additional cases (5 HCWs, 1 patient), importation was possible with a posterior probability between 10% and 50%. Most patient-to-patient transmission events involved patients having shared a ward (95.2%, 95% credible interval [CrI] 84.2%–100%), in contrast to those having shared a room (19.7%, 95% CrI 6.7%–33.3%). Transmission events tended to cluster by case type: patient<sub>noso</sub> were almost twice as likely to be infected by other patient<sub>noso</sub> than expected (observed:expected ratio 2.16, 95% CrI 1.17–4.20, p=0.006); similarly, HCW<sub>outbreak</sub> were more than twice as likely to be infected by other HCW<sub>outbreak</sub> than expected (2.72, 95% CrI 0.87–9.00, p=0.06). The proportion of infectors being HCW<sub>covid</sub> was as expected as random. We found a trend towards a greater proportion of high transmitters (≥2 secondary cases) among HCW<sub>outbreak</sub> than patient<sub>noso</sub> in the late phases (28.6% vs. 11.8%) of the outbreak, although this was not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Most importation events were linked to HCW. Unexpectedly, transmission between HCW<sub>covid</sub> was more limited than transmission between patients and HCW<sub>outbreak</sub>. This finding highlights gaps in infection control and suggests the possible areas of improvements to limit the extent of nosocomial transmission.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This study was supported by a grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation under the NRP78 funding scheme (Grant no. 4078P0_198363).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>nosocomial outbreaks</kwd><kwd>transmission dynamics</kwd><kwd>geriatric hospitals</kwd><kwd>healthcare-associated infection</kwd><kwd>infection prevention</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4078P0_198363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abbas</surname><given-names>Mohamed</given-names></name><name><surname>Cordey</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Laubscher</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name><name><surname>Robalo Nunes</surname><given-names>Tomás</given-names></name><name><surname>Iten</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Harbarth</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name><name><surname>Cori</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018336</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIHR200908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abbas</surname><given-names>Mohamed</given-names></name><name><surname>Cori</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nosocomial transmission of SARS-Cov-2 in geriatric settings is complex, with different patterns between patients and healthcare workers working in Covid/non-Covid wards that should be taken into account when designing infection control strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nosocomial acquisition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in geriatric institutions and long-term care facilities (LTCFs) may account for large proportions of all declared coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases in many countries, and contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thiabaud et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharya et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">The Guardian, 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">The Guardian, 2021a</xref>). Because the reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare environments may contribute to amplifying the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knight et al., 2022</xref>), we need to better understand transmission dynamics in these settings.</p><p>The terms healthcare-associated, hospital-onset, and nosocomial Covid-19 reflect the uncertainty around defining and distinguishing community- versus healthcare-acquired Covid-19 cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abbas et al., 2021c</xref>). Nevertheless, in some settings, such as LTCFs and nursing homes, these definitions are relatively straightforward. In other settings, such as those with a high patient turnover, or where patients are admitted from the community and both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 cases are hospitalised in the same institution, defining, and more importantly detecting cases is crucial to avoid cross-contamination. Determining sources and transmission pathways of infection may thus help improve infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies.</p><p>The role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in nosocomial Covid-19 transmission dynamics is complex, as they can be victims and/or vectors of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and can acquire from or transmit to their peers and patients and the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbas et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellingford et al., 2021</xref>). There is ongoing controversy and uncertainty surrounding the role of HCWs in infecting patients during nosocomial outbreaks, and findings from acute-care hospitals cannot be applied directly to LTCFs and geriatric hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klompas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lucey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aggarwal et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to reconstruct transmission dynamics in several nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 involving patients and HCWs in a Swiss university-affiliated geriatric hospital that admitted both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients during the first pandemic wave in Spring 2020.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients with nosocomial Covid-19 in four outbreak-affected wards, and all SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive HCWs from 1 March to 7 May 2020.

During the same period, patients were also admitted for non-Covid-19 hospitalisations, and the rehabilitation beds were also open to patients convalescing from Covid-19. Beginning on 1 April 2020, we use RT-PCR to screen all patients on admission for SARS-CoV-2. Between 7 April 2020 and 30 May 2020, we screened patients in non-Covid wards. We encouraged HCWs from outbreak wards to undergo PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swabs between 9 and 16 April 2020, even if they were asymptomatic. We described additional IPC measures in Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Definitions</title><p>We defined healthcare-associated (HA) Covid-19 by an onset of symptoms ≥5 days after admission in conjunction with a strong suspicion of healthcare transmission, in accordance with Swissnoso guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Swissnoso, 2021</xref>). We classified patients with HA-Covid-19 as ‘patient<sub>noso</sub>’, the others were assumed to be community-acquired or ‘patient<sub>community</sub>’. An outbreak was declared when ≥3 cases of HA-Covid-19 (HCWs and patients) with a possible temporal-spatial link were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Swissnoso, 2021</xref>). HCWs were included in the outbreak investigation if they had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. We classified HCWs as ‘HCW<sub>covid</sub>’ if they worked in a Covid-19 cohorting ward admitting community-acquired cases, or ‘HCW<sub>outbreak</sub>’ if they worked in a ‘non-Covid’ ward (i.e., not admitting community-acquired Covid-19 cases) in which nosocomial outbreaks occurred. HCWs worked in either one or another type of ward, except for one HCW who worked in both Covid and non-Covid wards (although the proportion and/or days worked in each type of ward is unknown). Six HCWs worked across multiple wards (e.g., on-call) and were attributed to Covid-wards for the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Data sources</title><p>The data used for this study were from the sources described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2021a</xref>). First, we used prospectively collected data from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health-mandated surveillance of hospitalised Covid-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thiabaud et al., 2021</xref>). We also used prospectively collected data from HUG’s Department of Occupational Health for symptom-onset data and the Department of Human Resources (HR) for HCW shifts.

We performed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using an amplicon-based sequencing method to produce RNA sequences, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2021a</xref>) and summarised in Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>We performed sequence alignment with MUSCLE (v3.8.31).

Briefly, the model uses a Bayesian framework, combining information on the generation time (time between infections in an infector/infectee pair), and contact patterns, with a model of sequence evolution to probabilistically reconstruct the transmission tree (see Appendix 1).</p><p>Because formal contact tracing was limited during the study period, we constructed contact networks based on ward or room presence for patients based on their ward movements, and on HCW shifts obtained from HR. We defined a contact as simultaneous presence on the same ward on a given day (see Appendix 1). The manner by which <monospace>outbreaker2</monospace> handles these contacts is conservative in that it allows for non-infectious contacts to occur (false positives) and incomplete reporting of infectious contacts (false negatives). In addition, the model estimates the proportions of these contacts.</p><p>Using the reconstructed transmission trees, we determined the number of imported cases (with minimal posterior support of 10%), and the number of secondary cases generated by the imports. Imported caseswere defined as those that do not have apparent ancestors among the cases included in the outbreak. We also calculated the number of secondary (i.e., onward) infections for each case, that is, the individual reproductive number (<italic>R</italic>), which we stratified by epidemic phase (early or late with a cut-off on 9 April 2020) and case type (HCW<sub>covid</sub>, HCW<sub>outbreak</sub>, patient<sub>noso</sub>, and patient<sub>community</sub>, see Appendix 1).</p><p>We assessed the role of each case type in transmission by estimating the proportion of infections attributed to the case type (<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>case</italic></sub>), which we compared with the random expectation considering the prevalence of each case type (see Appendix 1). To better understand the transmission pathways between and within wards, we also estimated (for outbreak and non-outbreak wards), the proportion of infections attributed to infectors in the same ward. We also constructed a matrix representing ward-to-ward transmission. Patient movements between wards were constructed using the implementation of the vistime package (visualisation tool) as in the publication by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meredith et al., 2020</xref>.

Of the 53 included patients, post hoc epidemiological analysis showed that 4 of these likely acquired Covid-19 in the community (CA-Covid-19). The remaining 49 nosocomial cases represented 20.2% (49/242) of all patients hospitalised with Covid-19, and 81.7% (49/60) of nosocomial Covid-19 cases in the Geriatric Hospital. The ward-level attack rates ranged from 10% to 19% among patients. Moreover, 21% of all HCWs in the geriatric hospital had a PCR-positive test. The epidemic curve is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and ward-level epidemic curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Characteristics of patients and HCWs are summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>, respectively.

This was driven in particular by transmission from staff or patients to other staff or patients in outbreak wards (73%, 95% CrI 63%–82%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Within-ward transmission was more pronounced in outbreak wards (mean 48%; range: 20%–70% of all infections within a ward) than in non-outbreak wards (mean 14%; range 0%–63%) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">3</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This in-depth investigation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between patients and HCWs in a geriatric hospital, including several nosocomial outbreaks, has provided many valuable insights on transmission dynamics. First, we showed that the combination of epidemiological and genetic data using sophisticated modelling enabled us to tease out overall transmission patterns. Second, we showed that transmission dynamics among HCWs differed according to whether they worked in Covid wards or in wards where outbreaks occurred. We found that HCW-to-HCW transmission in Covid wards was not higher than expected but the risk of transmission between HCWs in non-Covid wards was twofold higher than expected. Third, we identified excess patient-to-patient transmission events, most of which occurred within the same ward, but not necessarily the same room. Fourth, we identified multiple importation events that led to a substantial number of secondary cases or clusters; most were related to HCWs, but one was related to a patient with community-acquired Covid-19.</p><p>These results are particularly important, as settings which care for elderly patients, such as geriatrics and rehabilitation clinics or LTCFs have high attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 for both patients and HCWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbas et al., 2021b</xref>). In an institution-wide seroprevalence study in our hospital consortium, the Department of Rehabilitation and Geriatrics, of which the hospital in this study was part, had the highest proportion of HCWs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martischang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The different transmission patterns between HCWs in Covid wards and outbreak wards (i.e., meant to be ‘Covid-free’) is intriguing. HCWs' behaviour may have affected transmission. Indeed, a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ottolenghi et al., 2021</xref> found that HCWs caring for Covid-19 patients were concerned about becoming infected while caring for patients, and therefore may apply IPC measures more rigorously than when caring for patients who do not have Covid-19. HCWs working in non-Covid wards may not have felt threatened by Covid-19 patients who were in principle allocated to other wards, and thus not in their direct care. HCWs in non-Covid wards also may have underestimated the transmission risk from their peers to a greater extent than those working in Covid wards, and thus may not have maintained physical distancing well. In addition, we found a higher mean duration (2.9 days) of presenteeism despite symptoms compatible with Covid-19 among HCWs working in non-Covid wards than for those working in Covid wards (1.6 days), which gives credence to the abovementioned possible explanations for the different transmission patterns. Other factors (e.g., work culture, baseline IPC practices) also may have affected transmission patterns.</p><p>Most patient-to-patient transmission events involved patients who were hospitalised in the same ward, and were therefore in close proximity. We cannot exclude transmission from a ‘point-source’ or via a HCW’s contaminated hands (i.e., an unidentified HCW who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to multiple patients in the same ward). To date, we have little evidence to suggest that this is the case; indeed, the transmission patterns were robust to changes in the model assumptions. Mathematical models have suggested that single-room isolation of suspected cases could potentially reduce the incidence of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission by up to 35% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). In the outbreaks we describe, symptomatic patients were identified promptly, with a median delay of 0 days between symptom onset and their first positive test. However, these precautions may not be sufficient as patients may transmit the virus when they are pre-symptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferretti et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, infection prevention teams may need to identify patients at high risk of developing nosocomial Covid-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Myall et al., 2021</xref>) if single rooms are not available for all exposed patients (e.g., in cases of overcrowding). For example, a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mo et al., 2021</xref> found that exposure to community-acquired cases who were identified and segregated or cohorted was associated with half the risk of infection compared with exposure to hospital-acquired cases or HCWs who may be asymptomatic. One possible explanation for this finding is that patients with CA-Covid may have passed the peak of infectiousness when they are admitted, whereas patients with HA-Covid cases have frequent unprotected contact with HCWs and other patients during their period of peak infectiousness.</p><p>The current evidence does not support the use of real-time genomics for control of SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stirrup et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stirrup et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, in this investigation, as in many others, we performed WGS to investigate transmission patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aggarwal et al., 2022</xref>). Although we were able to gain considerable insight from the powerful combination of genetic sequencing data and rich epidemiological data, we controlled the outbreaks without using WGS, as was the case in many published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, WGS may be more useful for ruling out transmission rather than for confirmatory purposes, due to the low number of mutations accumulated in the SARS-CoV-2 genome between transmission pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braun et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our study has several strengths. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only extensive outbreak investigation that employed WGS and sophisticated modelling to assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a geriatric acute-care hospital. We performed WGS on isolates from a high proportion (80%) of cases, including those from HCWs which has been previously shown to improve understanding of transmission dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellingford et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, we collected the data prospectively, thereby minimising the risk of bias.</p><p>Despite these strengths, some limitations must be acknowledged. First, we included only one sequence from a CA-Covid case. However the method we used to reconstruct who infected whom is able to cope with and identify missing intermediate cases, which allowed us to estimate that the overwhelming majority of cases (91.5%) was captured in our sample. Some misclassification may have occurred, for example, whether an imported cases is truly nosocomial or not. For example, the model predicted that patients C107 and C115 were imported cases. The predicted dates of infection were 14–22 March for case C107 and 8–24 March for case C115; their admission dates were 3 March and 18 March, respectively. The probability that infection occurred on or after date of admission for case C115 was 81%. So the fact that the cases are labelled as ‘imported’ does not preclude the fact that these were still nosocomial cases, simply that their infector was not identified in this outbreak. We did not collect data on adherence to Covid-specific IPC recommendations by HCWs in different wards. We were unable to relate the number of secondary infections with the population (ward) size; more complex models would be required to explain the underlying mechanisms in a context of fluctuating denominators, for example, due to ward closures, and so on. In addition, we performed these investigations during the first pandemic wave with a wild-type variant of SARS-CoV-2 in a susceptible population. For these reasons, the results may no longer be applicable in settings with high vaccination coverage and/or substantial natural immunity, or in later stages of the pandemic, also due to accrued experience in managing and preventing outbreaks. Nevertheless, the lessons learned may be useful in a large number of countries with slow vaccine roll-out due to vaccine hesitancy, particularly among HCWs where there is no vaccine mandate, or unequal access to vaccine supplies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">The Lancet Infectious Diseases, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 still occur despite high vaccination coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burugorri-Pierre et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shitrit et al., 2021</xref>). Also, these valuable lessons may be applicable for nosocomial outbreak control in the case of future pandemics due to respiratory viruses with characteristics similar to SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>In conclusion, strategies to prevent nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission in geriatric settings should take into account the potential for patient-to-patient transmission and the transmission dynamics between HCWs in non-Covid wards, which our study suggests may differ from those in dedicated Covid-19 wards.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>received honoraria (which was paid to the institution) from Pfizer for lecturing on a course on mathematical modelling of infectious disease transmission and vaccination book.

Direct coaching of HCWs working in Covid-19 wards by the IPC practitioner was undertaken once a ward had been attributed as such. The IPC practitioner assisted front-line HCWs in streamlining tasks.</p><p>HCWs caring for Covid-19 patients applied ‘contact’ and ‘droplet’ precautions, in line with Swissnoso and FOPH guidelines. Universal masking of all front-line HCWs was implemented on 11 March 2020. From 1 April 2020, the use of ocular protection (eye shields) was encouraged for contact with all Covid-19 patients, and masking of HCWs in non-clinical areas (e.g., offices) was recommended.</p><p>RT-PCR screening of SARS-CoV-2 on admission for all patients, even if asymptomatic or without clinical suspicion of Covid-19, started on 1 April 2020. From 7 April 2020, weekly screening surveys were performed in non-Covid wards, until 30 May 2020.</p><p>As of 11 April 2020 non-Covid wards were closed to new admissions, and room occupancy was decreased (e.g., four-bed rooms were limited to three patients).</p><p>Due to shortages in PPE, HCWs were instructed to wear surgical masks for 4 hr continuously (and 8 hr if not humid), and N95 respirators (FFP2 masks) for as long as possible. Gowns were used for &gt;1 patient in the same room, except in the case of patients carrying multidrug-resistant bacteria.</p><p>HCWs from outbreak wards were encouraged to undergo PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swabs, even if asymptomatic between 9 and 16 April 2020. Including tests that were performed since mid-March, a total of 83 out of 124 eligible HCWs (67%) in the four outbreak wards underwent testing.</p><p>We split the outbreak into two phases, up to 9 April 2020 and after 9 April 2020 for several reasons. First, many preventive measures were implemented around that date (e.g., weekly screening of patients on 7 April enhanced testing of HCWs on 9 April, decrease in bed-occupancy and closures on 11 April). Second, approximately half of the cases occurred in each phase of the outbreak. Third, the overall trend in the epidemic curve can be interpreted as increasing in the first phase, and decreasing in the second phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Ward architecture and room sizes in the geriatric hospital</title><p>The architectural layout of the hospital means that there are two wings per floor, each with a central corridor, and two wards per wing (without separation).

Therefore, the wards themselves are crowded areas, and it is sufficient for a patient to step outside their room in the corridor to potentially come in contact with another patient.</p><p>The mean room sizes (for rooms that were shared) were small, being 23.1 m<sup>2</sup> (standard deviation 6.5 m<sup>2</sup>) and 27.8 m<sup>2</sup> (standard deviation 0.2 m<sup>2</sup>) for two bed and three bed rooms, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Microbiological methods</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-1"><title>Amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing analysis</title><p>All nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (Cobas 6800 SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR), the Charite or the BD SARS-CoV2 reagent kit for BD Max system assays, and for which sufficient volume remained, were selected for whole-genome sequencing analysis.</p><p>NPS were sequenced with an amplicon-based sequencing method.

For the primary analysis we used a short serial interval (mean 3.0, standard deviation [SD] 4.1), under the assumption of swift isolation of patients following onset of symptoms. We also performed a sensitivity analysis using a longer serial interval (mean 5.2 days, SD 4.7) to allow for potentially slower isolation of symptomatic patients. We used the incubation period as estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi et al., 2020</xref>, which follows a lognormal distribution with parameters mu of 1.57 and sigma 0.65 (corresponding to a mean of 5.95 days and SD 4.31). Where dates of onset were unavailable, we imputed them by using the median of the difference between symptom onset and date of swab.</p><p>Imported cases are detected by <monospace>outbreaker2</monospace> during a preliminary run of the model, where cases are removed in turn (with a leave one out approach) and the ‘global influence’ of each case is measures as the extent to which removing it affects the genetic log-likelihood. Cases with high global influence (whose removal dramatically affects the genetic likelihood) are considered to be genetic outliers, and classified as imported cases. This approach is described in more detail in the original <monospace>outbreaker2</monospace> manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jombart et al., 2014</xref>). By default, a case is determined as being imported if its global influence is five times the average global influence. While this approach has excellent specificity, because of the limited genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, it may lack in sensitivity. We therefore ran the model over a range of lower thresholds (from 2 to 5 times the average global influence). We selected for our main model a threshold of 2, and present one-way sensitivity analyses with a threshold of 3 and the default (9).</p><p>The <monospace>outbreaker2</monospace> package is designed to use contact tracing data to inform who infected whom. These data were unavailable for our outbreak, but we made a series of assumptions to generate a matrix of possible contacts between cases. Initially, we aimed to construct this matrix using dates of presence in the hospital/ward for patients based on administrative data, and based on human resources shift rota for HCWs. However, we identified potential inconsistencies in the latter, in particular stemming from multiple changes as a result of many HCWs self-isolating due to possible or confirmed COVID-19. We therefore used these data in a sensitivity analysis, but for our main analysis, we reverted to a simpler set of assumptions to build our contact matrix. In our main analysis, we assumed that HCWs were present in the hospital every day until the date of their first positive swab, included. We further assumed that patients only interacted with patients in their own ward. We assumed that all HCWs were able to infect each other, but HCWs could have contact with patients only in the wards they were attributed to; HCWs such as physical therapists or doctors who worked across multiple wards could have significant contact with all HCWs and patients. Under these assumptions, we are likely to capture many contacts which did not happen, and it is possible that we miss a few contacts which in fact did happen. However <monospace>outbreaker2</monospace> does account for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of contact data, the levels of which are estimated as part of the model. To account for this uncertainty in potential contact patterns, we ran two sensitivity analyses where we input different contact data in the model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>We conducted a number of different analyses, including a base scenario and several (n=5) one-way sensitivity analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>):</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Sensitivity analysis 1:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We did not make any assumptions about contact patterns, and therefore all cases in the outbreak could potentially infect all other cases.</p></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><p>Sensitivity analysis 2:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We used a longer serial interval (mean 5.2 days, SD 4.7) to allow for potentially slower isolation of symptomatic patients.</p></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><p>Sensitivity analysis 3:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We used the HCW shift data from the human resources department, with minor corrections (removing HCWs that were mislabelled as ‘present’ after date of positive RT-PCR).

Indeed, we had a comprehensive screening and testing strategy, including of asymptomatic cases, and are therefore confident that we captured a near-total proportion of cases. We obtained sequences for 82% of all identified cases, and these are the cases used in the model.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lulla Opatowski (Reviewer #1); Thi Pham (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify and improve Figure 3.</p><p>2) If possible, add any available details about transmissions between ward-sharing individuals in terms of distance between rooms and beds.</p><p>3) Add discussion about which results may or may not be generalizable to other health care settings, as well as the issue of misclassifying the infection source.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Abstract line 63, sentence starting with &quot;the proportion of infectors…&quot; should be clarified.</p><p>– Because the analysed data provides from the first pandemic wave, several variables may have changed substantially over the studied period. In particular, as described in the methods section, sampling policy varied over time. Sampling was generally achieved differently in HCWs and patients. Were these two aspects accounted for in the statistical model? How does that affect uncertainty on estimates?</p><p>– What is the level of certainty for provided dates of symptom onset? Were they extracted from medical records or collected in real-time? To what extent does the reconstruction of the transmission chain rely on this variable and was uncertainty considered on that variable?</p><p>– Do all patients share rooms, and with how many others? What is this 44% as a proportion of those who do?</p><p>– There is a long-tailed distribution of infection by each individual (Figure 4). How much do heavy spreaders influence the results e.g. would the results from Figure 5 all hold if individual superspreader events were removed from the dataset?</p><p>– When calculating expectation in Figure 5, this is calculated by the prevalence of Covid-19 in each type of individual on a given ward. In our understanding, the ward was not considered here. Could the authors justify that choice? Would it be feasible to calculate an expectation which took into account the higher risk of transmission when sharing a room, and use this as the comparator against observed infections?</p><p>– Page 11 line 231, the referenced figure doesn't indicate these probabilities. What is the source?</p><p>– How was the date of April 9 fixed to define a cut-off between the early phase and late phase? Is it just based on the peak incidence? Or due to a change in screening practice?</p><p>– The large outbreak size makes figure 3 quite hard to interpret for the reader. Would it be possible to improve it possibly by zooming on some specific cases or wards, and adding global statistics informing on the precision/quality of the inference of transmission routes?</p><p>– How does the number of secondary infections relate to the population's sizes (i.e. at-risk patients and HCWs from the studied wards). Is that relationship expected?</p><p>– We may have missed this: (apologies if so): were HCWs cohorted by wards or were there HCWs shared among wards? How may that affect the results here?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper addresses an important question about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a geriatric acute-care hospital. This reviewer's comments address primarily manuscript clarity.</p><p>General Comments:</p><p>Patients should not be equated with their conditions. Please replace Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 patients with patients who have Covid-19 and patients who do not have Covid-19 throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Compare takes &quot;with&quot; not &quot;to&quot;.</p><p>The manuscript includes many &quot;there is,&quot; &quot;there are,&quot; &quot;it is,&quot; xxx. These statements are in passive voice and are usually wordier and more convoluted than a similar statement in active voice. This reviewer suggests revising most or all of these statements. For example, the following sentence could be revised as shown.</p><p>&quot;The reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare environments may contribute to amplifying the pandemic [5], and as such, it is important to understand transmission dynamics in these settings.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Because the reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare environments may contribute to amplifying the pandemic [5], we need to better understand transmission dynamics in these settings.&quot;</p><p>Statements like &quot;in order to&quot; and &quot;as well as&quot; have extra words that don't add to the meaning. They can be shortened to &quot;to&quot; and &quot;and&quot;.</p><p>Specific Comments</p><p>Line 67: Is the word &quot;unexpectedly&quot; needed? This reviewer was confused by that statement. I would assume HCWs knowing that they were caring for patients with Covid-19 might be more in adherence with PPE use and hand hygiene than those on non-Covid-19 units.</p><p>Lines 93-95: The meaning of &quot;in nosocomial Covid-19&quot; is vague and should be clarified. Does this mean HCWs' role in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 within healthcare facilities is complex?</p><p>Does it mean HCWs role in the epidemiology of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection is</p><p>complex? This reviewer does not like the word &quot;victim&quot; (although the alteration is nice) in this setting. This reviewer thinks the last part of this sentence will work better if revised to: &quot;as HCWs can acquire SARS-CoV-2 in the community or from their peers and patients and they can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to peers and patients [7, 8].</p><p>Methods</p><p>The authors switch frequently between active and passive voice. This reviewer suggests picking one and sticking with it. This reviewer prefers an active voice for clarity and brevity.</p><p>Line 162: This reviewer does not understand what the authors mean by &quot;trajectories&quot; in this sentence.</p><p>Lines 165-6: Revise to something like: &quot;conservative in that it accounts for non-infectious contacts and incomplete reporting of infectious contacts and it estimates the proportion of the total contacts in these categories.&quot;</p><p>Lines 18-91: Suggested revision. A post hoc epidemiological analysis of the 53 patients found that 4 of these patients likely acquired Covid-19 in the community (CA-Covid-19). The 49 nosocomial cases represented 20.2% (49/242) of all patients with COVID-19, and 81.7% (49/60) of nosocomial Covid-19 cases identified in the Geriatric Hospital. The ward-level attack rates ranged from 10 to 19% among patients and 21% of all HCWs in the geriatric...&quot;</p><p>Line 203: This reviewer does not understand this sentence given that the verb appears to be &quot;shows&quot;.</p><p>Lines: 273-5: Suggest revising to something like: &quot;Fourth, we identified multiple importation events that led to a substantial number of secondary cases or clusters. Most transmission events were related to HCWs, but one (?? or some) were related to a patient with community-acquired Covid-19.&quot; Note: the authors did not make clear how many transmissions were related to this patient.</p><p>Lines 282-292: Suggest revising to something like: &quot;HCWs' behavior may have affected transmission. Indeed, Ottolenghi et al., found that HCWs caring for Covid-19 patients were concerned about becoming infected while caring for patients, and therefore may apply IPC measures more rigorously than when caring for patients who do not have Covid-19 [23]. HCWs working in non-Covid wards may not have felt threatened by Covid-19 patients on other wards. HCWs in non-Covid wards also may have underestimated the transmission risk from their peers to a greater extent than those working in Covid wards, and thus did not maintain physical distancing well. In addition, we found a higher mean duration (2.9 days) of presenteeism despite symptoms compatible with Covid-19 among HCWs working in non-Covid wards than for those working in Covid wards (1.6 days), which gives credence to the abovementioned possible explanations for the different transmission patters. Other factors (e.g., work culture, baseline IPC practices) also may have affected transmission patterns.</p><p>This reviewer wonders if the following sentence is necessary? &quot;HCWs working in non-Covid wards may not have felt threatened by Covid-19 patients on other wards.&quot;</p><p>Line 294: This author is wondering how the same ward is close proximity when patients are not in the same room. How would the patients have contact with each other?</p><p>Lines 294-309: Suggested revisions: We cannot exclude transmission from a &quot;point-source&quot; or via an HCW's contaminated hands (i.e., an unidentified HCW who transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to multiple patients in the same ward). To date, we have little evidence to suggest that this is the case; indeed, the transmission patterns were robust to changes in the model assumptions. Mathematical models have suggested that single-room isolation of suspected cases could potentially reduce the incidence of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission by up to 35% [24]. In the outbreaks we describe, symptomatic patients were identified promptly, with a median delay of 0 days between symptom onset and their first positive test. However, these precautions may not be sufficient as patients may transmit the virus when they are pre-symptomatic [25]. Thus, infection prevention teams may need to identify patients at high risk of developing nosocomial Covid-19 [26] if single rooms are not available for all exposed patients (e.g., in cases of overcrowding). For example, Mo et al., found that exposure to community-acquired cases who were identified and segregated or cohorted was associated with half the risk of infection compared with exposure to hospital-acquired cases or HCWs who may be asymptomatic [27]. One possible explanation for this finding is that patients with CA-Covid may have passed the peak of infectiousness when they are admitted, whereas patients with HA-Covid cases have frequent unprotected contact with HCWs and other patients during their period of peak infectiousness.</p><p>Line 310: Suggested edit: The current evidence does not support the use of real-time genomics for control of SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreaks [28].</p><p>Lines 324-328: Suggested edits: Despite these strengths, our study had some limitations. First, we included only one sequence from a CA-Covid. However, the method we used to reconstruct who infected who is able to cope with and identify missing intermediate cases, which allowed us to estimate that our sample included the overwhelming majority of cases (91.5%). In addition, we performed these investigations during the first pandemic wave in a susceptible population....&quot;</p><p>Line 334: Replace &quot;in the case of&quot; with &quot;during&quot;.</p><p>Lines 336-338: The main point of the conclusion is not clear. What does it mean to take into account the complex interplay between HCWs in dedicated Covid-19 wards vs non-Covid wards? The way this is worded makes it sound like the HCW on the two different kinds of wards are interacting, which likely is not what the authors intended.</p><p>Table 1: This reviewer doesn't understand what is meant by &quot;Onset of symptoms before swab date, n (%)&quot;. Is this the number of people who were symptomatic before they were tested?</p><p>Table 2: Should HCWs be written out in the title? Readers in the US will likely not know what a logopedist is. We will call this person a speech therapist. Perhaps the authors could include a footnote defining this term. Did the authors address the longer time from onset of symptoms to testing for HCWs on non-Covid wards compared with those on Covid wards in the results and discussion?</p><p>Table 3: Dose &quot;Secondary onward transmission&quot; refer to transmission from the case in the first column? Consider putting NA (not applicable) in the blank cells.</p><p>Line 515: Suggested edit: &quot;Histograms displaying the distributions of secondary cases....&quot;</p><p>Line 525: Is something missing between &quot;... patient community and &quot;proportion&quot;?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Methods:</p><p>The authors present the IPC measures on page 6 in the main text and in the supplementary material.

This is probably because the authors did not have any information on that. This is a limitation and should be explained more explicitly or highlighted in the discussion.</p><p>It's not clear to me whether the HCWs only worked in either COVID or non-COVID wards during the study period. Please clarify in the Methods section.</p><p>On page 7, line 139: The authors state that they substituted the missing date of symptom onsets with the median difference between symptom onset date and swab date?

We therefore re-ran all our analyses after correcting this error. This has led to minor changes in our numeric results but has not altered our main findings and conclusions.

For these reasons, the results may no longer be applicable in settings with high vaccination coverage and/or substantial natural immunity, or in later stages of the pandemic with different variants, also due to accrued experience in managing and preventing outbreaks. Nevertheless, the lessons learned may be useful in a large number of countries with slow vaccine roll-out due to vaccine hesitancy, particularly among HCWs where there is no vaccine mandate, or unequal access to vaccine supplies [33]. Furthermore, nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 still occur despite high vaccination coverage [34, 35]. Also, these valuable lessons may be applicable for nosocomial outbreak control in the case of future pandemics due to respiratory viruses with characteristics similar to SARS-CoV-2.” Part in italics was already in the text.</p><p>Misclassifications may still occur, and it is even part of the method (<monospace>outbreaker2</monospace>) to quantify the uncertainty in determining the ancestry, as it operates within a Bayesian framework. Indeed, in most cases (c.f. new Figure 3) there are very few patients for whom the ancestry is identified with 100% posterior probability. For example, the model predicted that patients C107 and C115 were most likely imported cases with posterior probabilities of 100% and 57.5%, respectively. The predicted dates of infection were in the range March 14-22 for case C107 and March 8-24 for case C115, which was after their admission dates (March 3 and March 18, respectively). The probability that infection occurred on or after date of admission for case C115 was 81%. Therefore the model acknowledges the uncertainty in the classification of these cases as imported. We have modified the section on imported cases (under the heading “imported cases”), and added a sentence after referencing the new Figure 3 to highlight the uncertainty in the model.</p><p>Finally, the fact that a case has a probability of being “imported” does not preclude the fact that it is still nosocomial cases, simply that their infector was not identified in this outbreak c.f. update in the manuscript (lines 241-259).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Abstract line 63, sentence starting with &quot;the proportion of infectors…&quot; should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the sentence was unclear, and have modified it to “The proportion of infectors being HCW<sub>covid</sub> was as expected as random”.

In particular, as described in the methods section, sampling policy varied over time. Sampling was generally achieved differently in HCWs and patients. Were these two aspects accounted for in the statistical model? How does that affect uncertainty on estimates?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting and important point. Screening policies were indeed different between patients and HCWs. For patients, weekly screening surveys were performed in non-Covid wards from April 07, 2020 until May 30, 2020 (Appendix, page 3). In contrast, HCWs from outbreak wards were encouraged to undergo PCR testing, even if asymptomatic, between April 09 and April 16, 2020. These aspects were not explicitly accounted for in the statistical model. However, we are confident that the intensity of screening we performed during that period, led to a good case ascertainment. We note that the method we rely on, <monospace>outbreaker2</monospace>, does allow for undetected cases. It assumes a constant case reporting probability, which is estimated. In our study, this reporting probability estimated to be 91.5% (95% credible interval 91.2-91.9%), which confirms that case ascertainment was very high.</p><p><monospace>Outbreaker2</monospace> also estimates, for each observed case, the probability that one or more cases were unobserved in the transmission chain leading to their closest observed ancestry. We compared the posterior distribution of this number of “missed” generations between the early and late phases of the epidemic (i.e. before and after April 09, 2020). We have plotted the distribution of the number of missed generations across posterior trees, stratified by the phase. This suggests very little difference in the distribution of missed generations between the two phases. We have included this figure as Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What is the level of certainty for provided dates of symptom onset? Were they extracted from medical records or collected in real-time? To what extent does the reconstruction of the transmission chain rely on this variable and was uncertainty considered on that variable?</p></disp-quote><p>The dates of symptom onset were collected prospectively in real-time through several sources, minimising risk of bias. For patients, data were generated by the prospective surveillance of hospitalised patients with Covid-19 mandated by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, and for HCWs from both the hospital’s department of Occupational Health and from the prospective cohort study of outpatient Covid-19 testing in the hospital. We have clarified this in the “Data sources” section: “Dates of symptom onset were available for both patients and HCWs each source, respectively.”</p><p>The date of symptom onset is a main input of the model, as it is the starting point from which the date of infection is inferred. Although we did not directly account for potential uncertainty in the date of onset, our model considers whole distributions for the serial interval and incubation period which would allow absorbing a small level of uncertainty in onset dates, assuming such uncertainty is similar to those in studies which estimated the serial interval and incubation period.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Do all patients share rooms, and with how many others? What is this 44% as a proportion of those who do?</p></disp-quote><p>Out of all 43 patients, there were 5 patients (9.4%) who did not share a room with another Covid patient; this number increases to 11 patients (20.7%) if a “significant” room sharing is considered (i.e. when at least one room occupant is during an infectious period, defined as the period between 3 days before onset of symptoms and 14 days after). Of the 319 days where a room was shared, 256 days (80.3%) involved a room being shared by 2 patients, and 63 (19.7%) by 3 patients. The proportion of patient-to-patient transmissions that involved patients sharing a room was calculated for each posterior transmission tree (by determining whether the ancestor/infector had ever shared a room with the infectee), with the denominator being all patient-to-patient transmissions.</p><p>When responding to this comment we noticed an error in the pre-processing stage of contact data (n = 839 contacts, 4%, that should not have been included). We re-ran all the analyses after correcting this error. This has led to minor changes in our numeric results does not alter our major findings and conclusions. We apologise for this inconvenience, and thank the referee for their in-depth review which has given us the opportunity to double-check our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is a long-tailed distribution of infection by each individual (Figure 4). How much do heavy spreaders influence the results e.g. would the results from Figure 5 all hold if individual superspreader events were removed from the dataset?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this interesting observation and question. Altogether, the proportion of super-spreading events (defined as generating ≥5 secondary cases) among all posterior trees is very low (0.4%). The majority of posterior trees (54.1%) have no infectors with ≥5 secondary cases. The proportion of posterior trees with 1, 2, and ≥3 infectors with ≥5 secondary cases (super-spreaders) are 37.3%, 7.9% and 0.7%, respectively. The overwhelming majority of posterior trees (88.6%) do not have infectors who are the plausible ancestors of ≥6 infectees. For these reasons, we anticipated the influence of the superspreading events across all posterior transmission trees to be negligible. To confirm this, we performed a sensitivity analysis, estimating the proportion of transmissions (<italic>f<sub>case</sub></italic>) attributed to each case type (HCW<sub>covid</sub>, HCW<sub>outbreak</sub>, patient<sub>noso</sub>), i.e., the results from Figure 5, but excluding posterior transmission trees where there is at least one infector with ≥5 secondary cases.

In our understanding, the ward was not considered here. Could the authors justify that choice? Would it be feasible to calculate an expectation which took into account the higher risk of transmission when sharing a room, and use this as the comparator against observed infections?</p></disp-quote><p>The scenario chosen for the comparison is the most agnostic in that it does not make any assumptions regarding contact patterns. Instead, it assumes that all individuals are able to infect each other with the same probability, and, as a consequence, a group is able to infect an individual based on the proportion of individuals belonging to that group. However, this may be seen as an upper bound of the effect, as indeed it does not account for ward/room sharing in addition to the case type. Indeed, the analysis estimates excess transmission, but it does not specify what the excess is due to. For this reason, we performed the analysis of the ward type as well as the ward-to-ward matrix. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to account for both ward/room sharing and case type, as the combination of multiple characteristics would decrease the sample size and may potentially lead to type II error. As highlighted by the Reviewer, to calculate an expectation which takes into account the higher risk of transmission by sharing a room, we would need to estimate this, yet there is little data to inform this parameter.</p><p>We apologise but there was a small error in the Legend for Figure 5: instead of “<italic>f<sub>ward</sub></italic>”, the legend should read “<italic>f<sub>case</sub></italic>”.

Indeed, the Figure was intended to show the ward movements of the patients and the dates where the patients overlapped. The probabilities of infection were derived from the output of the model (basically from Figure 3). We have added that the referenced figure shows the ward movements, hoping this makes it clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How was the date of April 9 fixed to define a cut-off between the early phase and late phase? Is it just based on the peak incidence? Or due to a change in screening practice?</p></disp-quote><p>The epidemic phase was determined on the basis of several factors. First, many preventive measures were implemented around that date (e.g., weekly screening of patients on April 07, enhanced testing of HCWs on April 09, decrease in bed-occupancy and closures on April 11). Second, approximately half of the cases occurred in each phase of the outbreak. Third, the overall trend in the epidemic curve can be interpreted as increasing in the first phase, and decreasing in the second phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The large outbreak size makes figure 3 quite hard to interpret for the reader. Would it be possible to improve it possibly by zooming on some specific cases or wards, and adding global statistics informing on the precision/quality of the inference of transmission routes?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 1 that Figure 3 was difficult to read. We have now created an interactive version of this figure where one can hover over points and zoom in selected areas. We have also removed the colours, which did not have a particular meaning. We have decided to move this new interactive figure as Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure 1, and have replaced it with a more informative figure demonstrating the extent to which our model is able to infer of transmission routes (i.e., showing the distribution of the posterior support of ancestries based on different criteria (individual, case type, ward), see new Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How does the number of secondary infections relate to the population's sizes (i.e. at-risk patients and HCWs from the studied wards). Is that relationship expected?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer raises a valid and interesting point. Generally, and under normal circumstances, the ward sizes are comparable, as are the number of HCWs working in each ward. However, the number of patients in a ward is constantly fluctuating due to admissions/discharges as well as ward closures. Similarly, the number of HCWs fluctuates due to sick leave or annual leave. Therefore, the wards are not “closed systems”, and as the denominator fluctuates, more complex models would be required in order to explain the underlying mechanisms. We have added a sentence in the discussion to acknowledge this limitation:</p><p>“We were unable to relate the number of secondary infections with the population (ward) size; more complex models would be required to explain the underlying mechanisms in a context of fluctuating denominators, e.g., due to ward closures, etc.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– We may have missed this: (apologies if so): were HCWs cohorted by wards or were there HCWs shared among wards? How may that affect the results here?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. HCWs did work exclusively in one ward type or another. We have clarified this in the Methods (“Definitions” section):</p><p>“HCWs worked in either one or another type of ward, except for one HCW who worked in both Covid and non-Covid wards (although the proportion and/or days worked in each type of ward is unknown). Six HCWs worked across multiple wards (e.g. on-call) and were attributed to Covid-wards for the analyses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper addresses an important question about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a geriatric acute-care hospital.

However, at the time these outbreaks occurred, we did not think there would be such a stark difference in terms of cross-infections amongst HCWs in Covid vs. non-Covid wards.

When restricting to imports with ≥50% posterior support, there were 16 imported cases 16 (12 HCWs, four patients), generating 35 secondary cases. There was some degree of uncertainty, reflected by circular transmission pathways, in determination of imported cases and their secondary cases. There were 6 transmission pairs (C114-C115, C153-H1057, H1008-H1059, H1011-H1019, H1017-H12021, H1052-H1082) where there was uncertainty as to which of the cases was imported and which was a secondary case, i.e. for each case in the pair there was a ≥10% probability of importation, but also ≥10% probability of being a secondary case of an imported case.

On either side of the central corridor are patient rooms and/or offices (nursing, medical, etc.). Therefore, the wards themselves are crowded areas, and it is sufficient for a patient to step outside their room in the corridor to potentially come in contact with another patient.

To date, we have little evidence to suggest that this is the case; indeed, the transmission patterns were robust to changes in the model assumptions. Mathematical models have suggested that single-room isolation of suspected cases could potentially reduce the incidence of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission by up to 35% [24]. In the outbreaks we describe, symptomatic patients were identified promptly, with a median delay of 0 days between symptom onset and their first positive test. However, these precautions may not be sufficient as patients may transmit the virus when they are pre-symptomatic [25]. Thus, infection prevention teams may need to identify patients at high risk of developing nosocomial Covid-19 [26] if single rooms are not available for all exposed patients (e.g., in cases of overcrowding). For example, Mo et al., found that exposure to community-acquired cases who were identified and segregated or cohorted was associated with half the risk of infection compared with exposure to hospital-acquired cases or HCWs who may be asymptomatic [27]. One possible explanation for this finding is that patients with CA-Covid may have passed the peak of infectiousness when they are admitted, whereas patients with HA-Covid cases have frequent unprotected contact with HCWs and other patients during their period of peak infectiousness.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for taking the time to make these detailed suggestions, which we have implemented in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 310: Suggested edit: The current evidence does not support the use of real-time genomics for control of SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreaks [28].</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their suggestion.

The epidemic curve in Figure 1 shows the incidence on the y-axis but does the x-axis (date of symptom onset) make sense if not all of the cases were symptomatic?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer has rightly pointed out that the Epidemic curve is based on symptom onset and that for the asymptomatic cases (n = 8, 4.4%) there is no date available. It is common practice to use date of symptom onset to construct epidemic curves, and this explains our choice. So yes, the epidemic curve includes the asymptomatic cases, and we have clarified this in the legend of Figure 1 (“Includes 8 asymptomatic cases for whom date of onset was inferred (c.f. text).”). We could have, instead, used the date of the first positive sample. While using the date of the first positive sample might ensure that there were no missing data points, it does provide a completely different picture of the progression of the outbreak. For example, the earliest positive swab was on March 11, 2020, whereas the earliest onset of symptoms was 6 days earlier on March 05, 2020. An additional reason is that the <monospace>outbreaker2</monospace> model uses date of symptom onset as the starting point from which the date of infection is inferred statistically. Should the Editor request that we construct an epidemic curve using date of swab or removing the patients with the missing date of symptom onset, we will gladly do it. We can also highlight in the epidemic curve the 8 asymptomatic cases, should the Editor and/or the Reviewer request this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 8, line 169 and Figure 4: How was the epidemic phase determined?</p></disp-quote><p>The epidemic phase was determined on the basis of several factors. First, many preventive measures were implemented around that date (e.g., weekly screening of patients on April 07, enhanced testing of HCWs on April 09, decrease in bed-occupancy and closures on April 11). Second, approximately half of the cases occurred in each phase of the outbreak. Third, the overall trend in the epidemic curve can be interpreted as increasing in the first phase, and decreasing in the second phase. We have added justification for this in the Appendix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>At the beginning of the Results section, the authors write that post hoc epidemiological analysis showed that were likely 4 patients that had a community-acquired infection. What exactly did the post-hoc epidemiological analysis entail? Later on (page 10, lines 206ff), they present their analysis of the imported cases. How are these related?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their careful reading of our paper. The post hoc epidemiological analysis consisted of a chart review performed by the investigators at the start of the study, as opposed to conclusions that were arrived at during the management of the outbreak. The classification of cases as being imported is based on the model output, and they are defined as those that do not have apparent ancestors among the cases included in the outbreak. We have included this information in the manuscript, hoping that this has been clarified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>Could the authors discuss whether misclassifications (either of community- or hospital-acquired cases) even after the analysis is still possible and what impact it could have on their results?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer rightly points out that misclassifications may still occur. It is even part of the method (<monospace>outbreaker2</monospace>) to quantify the uncertainty in determining the ancestry, as it operates within a Bayesian framework. Indeed, in most cases (c.f. new Figure 3) there are very few patients for whom the ancestry is identified with 100% posterior probability. For example, the model predicted that patients C107 and C115 were most likely imported cases with posterior probabilities of 100% and 57.5%, respectively. The predicted dates of infection were March 14-22 for case C107 and March 8-24 for case C115, which was after their admission dates (March 3 and March 18, respectively). The probability that infection occurred on or after date of admission for case C115 was 81%. Therefore the model acknowledges the uncertainty in the classification of these cases. We have modified the section on imported cases (under the heading “imported cases”), and added a sentence after referencing the new Figure 3 to highlight the uncertainty in the model.</p><p>Finally, the fact that a case has a probability of being “imported” does not preclude the fact that it is still nosocomial cases, simply that their infector was not identified in this outbreak c.f. update in the manuscript (lines 241-259).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplement</p><p>Page 5: Could the authors elaborate on &quot;global influence&quot; for imported cases?</p></disp-quote><p>The global influence is a way of measuring the impact of a single observation on the log-likelihood of a parameter. During a preliminary run of the model, cases are removed in turn (with a leave one out approach) and the “global influence” of each case is measures as the extent to which removing it affects the genetic log-likelihood. Cases with high global influence (whose removal dramatically affects the genetic likelihood) are considered to be genetic outliers, and classified as imported cases. This approach is described in more detail in the original outbreaker manuscript (Jombart et al., PLoS Comput Biol 10(1): e1003457). We have added these details in the Appendix.</p></body></sub-article></article>
