Intracranial electrophysiological (iEEG) activity related to sensory, cognitive or motor events manifests mostly in two types of signals: event-related local field potentials in lower frequency bands (&lt;30 Hz, LF) and broadband activity in the higher end of the frequency spectrum (&gt;30 Hz, High frequency, HF). While most current studies rely exclusively on HF, thought to be more focal and closely related to spiking activity, the relationship between HF and LF signals is unclear, especially in human associative cortex. Here, we provide a large-scale in-depth investigation of the spatial and functional relationship between these 2 signals based on intracranial recordings from 121 individual brains (8000 recording sites). We measure category-selective responses to complex ecologically salient visual stimuli – human faces – across a wide cortical territory in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC), with a frequency-tagging method providing high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the same objective quantification of signal and noise for the two frequency ranges. While LF face-selective activity has higher SNR across the VOTC, leading to a larger number of significant electrode contacts especially in the anterior temporal lobe, LF and HF display highly similar spatial, functional, and timing properties. Specifically, and contrary to a widespread assumption, our results point to nearly identical spatial distribution and local spatial extent of LF and HF activity at equal SNR. These observations go a long way towards clarifying the relationship between the two main iEEG signals and reestablish the informative value of LF iEEG to understand human brain function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human face recognition</kwd><kwd>SEEG</kwd><kwd>broadband gamma</kwd><kwd>frequency-tagging</kwd><kwd>ventral occipito-temporal cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Belgian Excellence of Science program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>&quot;HUMVISCAT&quot; 30991544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossion</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Category-selective intracerebral neurophysiological activity in low- and high-frequency bands show unprecedented corresponding spatial, functional, and timing properties in the human brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the last two decades, the direct measure of neural activity from intracranial electrodes implanted in neurosurgical patients for clinical purpose has been increasingly popular among neuroscientists to investigate the neural basis of sensori-motor and cognitive functions. The richness and complexity of the human intracranial recordings approach come partly from the multiplicity of the recorded neural signals. At a macroscopic level of organization, there are two prominent neurophysiological signals. On the one hand, event-related potentials (ERPs; often called local field potentials in iEEG) which are time-locked and largely phase-locked to an event (e.g. a sensory stimulus in the visual modality) and predominant in the lower range of the frequency spectrum (&lt;30 Hz, here referred to as ‘low frequency’ activity, LF). On the other hand, broadband activity which is largely non phase-locked relative to events and typically observed and quantified over a higher frequency range of the spectrum (&gt;30 Hz also known as ‘gamma range’; here ‘high-frequency’ activity, HF). [Authors’ note: LF and HF signals differ both in the frequency range at which they are prevalent, and in terms of their phase-locking relative to the event onset. Event-related responses are (mostly) low-frequency responses while broadband signals are high-frequency mostly non phase-locked responses, distinct from narrow-band gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ray and Maunsell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hermes et al., 2015</xref>). For convenience, in keeping with the frequency range in which they are typically observed, we refer to the event-related/evoked response as ‘LF’ and the broadband response as ‘HF’. Note however that there are cases where phase-locking and frequency range may be dissociated, for instance when using high frequency periodic stimulation (e.g. 15 Hz). In this case, parts of the evoked phase-locked response may fall within the typical range of the high-frequency response, such as the 3rd (45 Hz) or 5th (75 Hz) harmonic of the response e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winawer et al., 2013</xref>] . A major challenge for the human intracranial approach is to determine which (characteristics) of these signals are most meaningful to understand the neural basis of sensory, cognitive, or motor events. Although early work focused exclusively on characterizing LF activity, the neuroscientific community has now largely shifted its interest to HF signals, which are thought to reflect population-level neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ray et al., 2008</xref>) and to be more correlated with blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity as recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mukamel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winawer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacques et al., 2016b</xref>). Compared to low frequency signals, HF also appears to be more straightforward to characterize the time-course of sensory-motor and cognitive processes (i.e. avoiding the issue of varying polarity and morphology of ERP responses), may be more selective to specific stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rangarajan et al., 2014</xref>), and is typically assumed to reflect more local neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermes et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, due to several factors, the degree of validity of these assumptions, and how they can be generalized across complex human brain functions subtended by large-scale neural networks, is largely unknown. First, in a given study, the simultaneous recording of HF and LF often takes place in a single, relatively small and specific region (e.g. the sensorimotor cortex: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfurtscheller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermes et al., 2012</xref>; the medial occipital cortex: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winawer et al., 2013</xref>; or the left posterior superior temporal gyrus: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crone et al., 2001</xref>), and often with limited data sets (4–5 individual brains; N=22 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>). Second, the two signals are not systematically quantified, with comparisons often limited to determine the number of significant responses for each signal and their overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crone et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfurtscheller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lachaux et al., 2005</xref>). Third, studies are often limited in their ability to objectively identify, quantify and compare HF and LF signals with the same analysis parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lachaux et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rangarajan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engell and McCarthy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vidal et al., 2010</xref>). Altogether, these factors may have led to, or at least substantially enhanced, the typically reported differences between the two types of neurophysiological signals in terms of spatial extent and localization, degree and type of functional selectivity as well as temporal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vidal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winawer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidesco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Privman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nozaradan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we provide an original contribution to understand the relationship between stimulus-evoked LF and HF neurophysiological activity in the human brain. Two key aspects of our study allow to circumvent the above-mentioned issues. First, we record the neural system for face recognition, a complex and widely distributed function in the human associative cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sergent et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duchaine and Yovel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grill-Spector et al., 2017</xref>), sampled here with a large population (N=121) of implanted individual human brains (&gt;8000 recording sites). Second, we rely on an original frequency-tagging approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galloway, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Norcia et al., 2015</xref>) providing an objective definition and quantification of simultaneously recorded LF and HF activity in the frequency-domain with a high signal-to-noise ratio and the same analysis parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recording and quantifying SEEG low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) face-selective signals in the VOTC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Coronal slice of an example depth (SEEG) electrode implanted in the right VOTC of an individual participant. Right: the same SEEG electrode array is shown on the reconstructed white matter surface of the participant (ventral view of the right hemisphere). Intracerebral electrode arrays consist of 5–15 contiguous recording contacts (small white rectangles in the coronal slice, white circles on the 3D surface) spread along the electrode length. Electrodes penetrate both gyral and sulcal cortical tissues. Here the electrode extends from the fusiform gyrus to the middle temporal gyrus. The recording contact located at the junction between the lateral fusiform gyrus and occipito-temporal sulcus and where the signal shown in panels D-F is measured is highlighted in red (left: red rectangles surrounded by a circle; right: red circles, see the black arrow).

(<bold>B</bold>) The fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) (or frequency-tagging) paradigm to quantify face-selective neural activity (originally from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rossion et al., 2015</xref>; see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacques et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rossion et al., 2018</xref>): natural images of nonface objects are presented by sinusoidal contrast modulation at a rate of six stimuli per second (6 Hz) with highly variable face images presented every five stimuli. Common neural activity to faces and nonface objects is expressed at 6 Hz and harmonics in the iEEG signals, while selective (i.e., differential) activity elicited reliably by face stimuli appears at the frequency of 6/5=1.2 Hz. Each stimulation sequence lasts for 70s (2 s showed here). (<bold>C</bold>) Representative examples of natural face images used in the study (actual images not shown for copyright reasons). (<bold>D</bold>) Top: example raw intracranial EEG time-domain signal measured at the recording contact shown in panel A. The signal is shown from –1.5 to 20 s relative to the onset of a stimulation sequence. The time-series displayed is an average of 2 sequences. Above the time-series, red vertical ticks indicate the appearance of face image in the sequence every 0.835 s (i.e. every 5 image at 6 Hz) and small black vertical ticks indicate the appearance of non-face objects every 0.167 s. Example images shown in each sequence are shown in panel B. Middle: a time-frequency representation of the SEEG data in the HF range (40–160 Hz) is obtained with a wavelet transform. The plot shows the percent signal change at each frequency relative to a pre-stimulus baseline period (–1.6s to –0.3s). This highlights distinct periodic burst of HF activity occurring at the frequency of face stimulation (i.e. 1.2 Hz) after the start of the stimulation sequence. Bottom: The modulation of HF amplitude over time (i.e. HF amplitude envelope) is obtained by averaging time-frequency signals across the 40–160 Hz frequency range. Red vertical ticks indicate the appearance of face images in the sequence. (<bold>E</bold>) LF face-selective amplitude is quantified by transforming the time-domain iEEG signal to the frequency domain (Fast Fourier Transform, FFT) and summing amplitudes of the signal at 12 harmonics of the frequency of face stimulation (1.2, 2.4, 3.6, 4.8, … Hz, excluding harmonics of the 6 Hz base stimulation rate).

While these findings point to largely similar properties between the two types of neural signals, LF category-selective activity has a higher signal-to-noise ratio and allows a more extensive exploration of the ATL, implicated in higher cognitive functions, than HF activity. Altogether, these observations clarify the relationship between two prominent neurophysiological functional activities in the human brain, challenging conventional views and the increasing focus on HF activity in human cognitive neuroscience research.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Face-selective activity in the VOTC was identified in the frequency domain following a Fourier transform applied either on the raw SEEG signal, highlighting low frequency (LF) activity as in previous studies with this paradigm (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagen et al., 2020</xref>), or on the time-varying amplitude envelope of the high frequency broadband (HF) signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, responses were quantified at the exact frequency of face stimulation (1.2 Hz) and harmonics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Significant face-selective responses were determined by grouping of the first four harmonics (i.e. summing 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and computing a Z-score transform (<italic>z</italic>&gt;3.1, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lochy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacques et al., 2020</xref>). At this statistical threshold, there were 2130 VOTC recording contacts in the gray matter and medial temporal lobe with significant face-selective activity in 118 participants (among 7374 contacts located in gray matter or medial temporal lobe in the VOTC of 121 participants, that is, 28.8% of all recorded contacts).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spatial distribution and proportion of LF and HF face-selective SEEG activity over VOTC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map of all VOTC recording contacts across the 121 individual brains displayed in the Talairach space using a transparent reconstructed cortical surface of the Colin27 brain (ventral view).

These maps indicate that <italic>LF+ contacts</italic> were widely distributed across the VOTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) with a particular focus in a stretch of cortex going from the IOG, through the FG (particularly in its lateral section –latFG- and adjacent OTS) and up to the antFG and surrounding sulci (antOTS and antCoS). In addition, we observed LF+ contacts in the temporal pole (TP) as well as in subcortical structures of the medial temporal lobe (amygdala –AMG- and hippocampus -HIP). <italic>HF+ contacts</italic> were also distributed across the VOTC with a focus around the same regions as for LF+ contacts (i.e. IOG, FG, antFG, antOTS, antCoS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Overall, the proportions of both LF+ and HF+ contacts showed a gradual reduction from posterior to anterior VOTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and were larger in the right compared to the left hemisphere (LF+: RH = 31.7%, 1059/3339 vs. LH = 25.3%, 1021/4035, p&lt;0.0001, two-tailed permutation test; HF+: RH = 9.6%, 322/3339 vs. LH = 8.0%, 322/4035, p&lt;0.01). Notably however, across the VOTC, the proportion of LF+ contacts was significantly higher than HF+ contacts (2080/7374=28.1% for LF+ vs. 644/7374=8.7% for HF+, p&lt;0.0001, two-tailed permutation test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>).</p><p>Computing a map of the relative decrease of proportion of HF+ relative to LF+ contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right) indicates that, while the lower proportion of HF+ contacts was observed throughout the VOTC, it was most evident in the ATL (i.e., anterior to the middle FG). We also found a decrease of proportion of significant contacts in lateral and medial portions of the PTL, apparently producing a more focused distribution of HF+ contacts around the FG region (see below for further analyses of the local spatial extent of both signals).</p><p>To further examine the correspondence in the spatial organization of face-selective response across LF and HF signals, we compared the patterns of amplitudes for the two signals across the VOTC. To avoid including noise in the amplitude estimates, LF and HF amplitudes were computed over their respective pools of significant contacts (i.e. LF+ contacts for LF signal and HF+ contacts for HF signal). Amplitude was quantified as the sum of the baseline-subtracted Fourier amplitude over the first 12 harmonics of the face-selective frequency, excluding harmonics of the base stimulation frequency (i.e. 1.2–16.8 Hz excluding 6 and 12 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). We first examined the winsorized mean amplitudes (see Materials and methods) across face-selective contacts in each individually-defined anatomical region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Overall, the patterns of amplitude variations across VOTC regions are largely similar across the two types of signals. For instance, for both signals, the largest amplitudes were recorded in the latFG, followed by the IOG. This similarity in patterns of amplitude is reflected in the strong correlation between the amplitudes computed in each region and hemispheres (Spearman’s Rho = 0.81, 95% C.I.: [0.42–0.99] computed using 17 regions with more than 5 HF+ contacts, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In line with this observation, VOTC maps in TAL space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) computed in 12mm x 12mm voxels reveal a striking similarity in the spatial patterns of face-selective response amplitudes for LF and HF signals measured over their respective sets of recording contacts. This similarity manifests in the robust correlation computed between amplitude maps, that is, using mean amplitudes across contacts in each voxel (Pearson’ r on log-transformed data = 0.75, [0.71–0.78], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Face-selective LF and HF amplitude quantification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LF face-selective amplitudes in LF+ contacts (left) and HF amplitude in HF+ contacts shown for each anatomical region (i.e., as defined in the individual native anatomy) and separately for the left and right hemispheres (LH and RH, respectively).

Statistical tests of interhemispheric amplitude differences for each signal and anatomical regions were performed using linear mixed model statistics. This revealed that for LF responses in LF+ contacts, face-selective amplitude was significantly larger in the right hemisphere in the latFG (p&lt;0.01, FDR corrected), MTG (p&lt;0.01, FDR corrected) and marginally so in the hippocampus (p=0.064; p=0.013 uncorrected; corrected p<italic>s</italic> &gt;0.28 for other regions). In contrast, no significant interhemispheric difference was found for the HF signal (all corrected ps &gt;0.22; MTG, antFG, antMTG, AMG, HIP not tested due to insufficient number of HF+ contacts in these regions, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Statistical threshold accounts for the low proportion of HF+ contacts in the ATL</title><p>In the previous section, we indicate that the proportion of face-selective HF+ relative to LF+ contacts in the ATL appears disproportionately low compared to the posterior section of VOTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). This observation could result either from a simple effect of statistical threshold linked to a quantitative difference across signal types and VOTC regions, or from a qualitative difference in the relationship between LF and HF signals in the posterior and anterior VOTC.</p><p>To address this issue, we first examined the distribution of face-selective Z-scores (i.e. the value used to determine whether a contact shows a significant face-selective response) across VOTC. We computed Z-scores for all recorded VOTC gray matter contacts (i.e. N=7374 contacts) and visualized the mean Z-score along the postero-anterior axis of VOTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for full VOTC maps). This revealed two interesting observations: (1) the mean Z-score is overall higher for LF signal (mean across all VOTC contacts = 3.56 +/- 7.31, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) compared to HF signal (1.27+/-4.9), and (2) the Z-scores for both LF and HF signals tend to decrease from posterior to anterior VOTC, with an abrupt reduction starting at around TAL coordinate Y = –40 to –30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These two observations indicate that a significance threshold of Z&gt;3.1 as used here will lead to a lower proportion of significant contacts specifically for HF signal at Y Talairach coordinates more anterior than –30, roughly corresponding to the posterior border of the ATL. Despite the difference in overall Z-score value across HF and LF signals, the postero-anterior profiles of Z-scores for the two signals were extremely similar (Pearson correlation: <italic>r</italic>=0.96). In fact, the Pearson correlation computed <italic>between</italic> LF and HF Z-score profiles was not statistically different from the correlations <italic>within</italic> signals when using split-halves datasets (1000 random split-halves, two-tailed 95% CI for between = [0.9 0.96]; for within = [0.88 0.98]), suggesting that the correlations between LF and HF profiles were at ceiling. This similarity was best visualized after normalizing the Z-score profiles (i.e. by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each profile, which corresponds to affine transformations of vertical translation and scaling) to minimize distances between profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Manipulating statistical threshold for LF+ and HF+ contacts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Postero-anterior Z-score profiles for LF and HF signals.

(<bold>A</bold>) We addressed the lower z-score for HF compared to LF (left plot) by computing face-selective signal and noise collected over all recorded VOTC contacts (N=7374,, excluding contacts in the white matter). We used all recorded contacts to avoid any potential bias resulting from the use of only contacts with a significant response (i.e. having z-score &gt;3.1). To directly compare signal and noise across signals we computed a ‘signal index’ (middle plot) and a ‘noise index’ (right plot) for each recording contact that accounts for the 1/f relationship between EEG amplitude and frequency and differences in the unit used for LF and HF (µV vs. percent signal change). Specifically, the signal and noise indices were computed as follows: (1) fft spectrum was segmented in 4 segments of 51 bins centered around the first 4 harmonics of the face-selective frequency (1.2–4.8 Hz, similarly as for the computation of the z-score); (2) we summed the 4 segments; (3) based on the summed segments we compute (<bold>a</bold>) the ‘raw face-selective amplitude’ as the amplitude at the face-frequency (i.e. at the center of the summed segment), (<bold>b</bold>) the ‘amplitude of the baseline’ as the mean amplitudes in the 48 bins surrounding the face-frequency bin (i.e. excluding the 2 bins immediately adjacent to the face frequency bin), (<bold>c</bold>) ‘the baseline-subtracted amplitude’ as the difference between the raw face-selective amplitude and the amplitude of the baseline, (<bold>d</bold>) ‘the standard deviation of the noise’ as the standard deviation of the amplitude in the 48 bins surrounding the face frequency; (4) from these values we compute the <bold>signal index</bold> as the baseline-subtracted amplitude divided by the amplitude of the baseline, and the <bold>noise index</bold> as the standard deviation of the noise divided by the amplitude of the baseline. This revealed that the face-selective signal <italic>amplitude</italic> was on average almost 5 times larger for LF compared to HF (middle plot: mean +/- std: 0.83+/-1.34 for LF vs. 0.15+/-0.45 for HF) while the <italic>noise</italic> was much more similar across the two types of signals (right plot: 0.28+/-0.03 for LF vs. 0.26+/-0.03 for HF). This indicates that the lower z-score for HF compared to LF is driven by a smaller face-selective signal, and not by a higher noise for HF. (<bold>B</bold>) Similarly, we also compare the face-selective HF signal amplitude (i.e. HF baseline-subtracted amplitude as described for panel A) and HF noise (i.e. HF standard deviation of the noise as described for panel A) across LF+ contacts with or without significant HF face-selective response. These contacts differ in terms signal amplitude (0.40+/-0.87 for LF+ HF vs. 9.32+/-9.13 for LF+ HF) rather than in terms of noise (0.77+/-0.28 for LF+ HF vs. 0.77+/-0.22 for LF+ HF-). (<bold>C</bold>) To investigate the overall lower z-score in the ATL compared to more posterior VOTC region (left plot, top row: LF signal; bottom row: HF signal), we computed LF and HF signal (i.e. baseline-subtracted amplitude as described for panel A) and noise (i.e. standard deviation of the noise as described for panel A) in 3 main regions of the VOTC (OCC, PTL, ATL), again using all recorded VOTC contacts (excluding contacts in the MTL). This revealed that the mean face-selective signal amplitude within the ATL was 72% (LF) and 92% (HF) smaller than in the PTL (middle plot). In contrast, the noise in the ATL was only 10% larger (LF) or of equal magnitude (HF) than in the PTL (right plot). This indicates that the lower z-scores in ATL are mostly driven by a smaller face-selective signal amplitude in this region compared to the posterior VOTC.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76544-fig4-figsupp3-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Second, we investigated how changing the statistical threshold affects the spatial distribution of LF+ and HF+ contacts across VOTC by adjusting the Z-score threshold to exactly match the number of significant LF+ (Z&gt;9.48, n=830 contacts) and HF+ (Z&gt;2.32, n=830 contacts) contacts. Under these conditions, the spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and proportion maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) for LF+ and HF+ contacts were extremely similar, with no meaningful statistical difference in local proportion of contacts across VOTC (two-tailed permutation test, fdr-corrected at alpha = 0.05). This was reflected in the high correlation between the two proportion maps (Spearman Rho = 0.890, 95% C.I. [0.86 0.91]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The same was true when statistically comparing the postero-anterior proportion profiles for LF+ and HF+ contacts after adjusting the Z-score thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, two-tailed permutation test, fdr-corrected at alpha = 0.05). Pearson correlation confirmed the similarity between the two postero-anterior proportion profiles (<italic>r</italic>=0.94). This lack of meaningful difference is in stark contrast relative to large differences in the postero-anterior profiles that were computed using the same threshold for LF+ and HF+ contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar observations were made when matching the number of LF+ and HF+ contacts using the original Z&gt;3.1 threshold for HF+ contacts and raising the statistical threshold to Z&gt;12.07 for LF+ contacts to equate the number of HF+ and LF+ contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To clarify the origin of the SNR difference (computed as the Z-score here) between LF and HF electrophysiological signals, we decomposed the Z-score into its ‘signal’ and ‘noise’ constituents. We addressed (1) the lower Z-score for HF compared to LF and (2) the lower Z-score in the ATL relative to posterior VOTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). First, to compare signal and noise between LF and HF signals, we collected these responses over all recorded VOTC contacts and computed a ‘signal index’ and a ‘noise index’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) that account for the 1/f relationship between EEG amplitude and frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pritchard, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Podvalny et al., 2015</xref>). This revealed that the <italic>noise</italic> was similar across the two types of signals (0.28+/-0.03 for LF vs. 0.26+/-0.03 for HF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) but the face-selective <italic>signal</italic> amplitude was on average almost five times larger for LF compared to HF (mean +/-std: 0.83+/-1.34 for LF vs. 0.15+/-0.45 for HF). This indicates that the lower Z-score for HF compared to LF is driven by a smaller face-selective signal, and not by a higher noise for HF. This is also in line with the observation that LF+ contacts with or without significant HF face-selective response differ mostly in the amplitude of the signal (0.40+/-0.87 for LF+HF vs. 9.32+/-9.13 for LF+ HF+ , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>) rather than the noise (0.77+/-0.28 for LF+ HF vs. 0.77+/-0.22 for LF+ HF+). Second, we investigated the overall lower Z-score in the ATL (excluding MTL) compared to more posterior VOTC regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We computed LF and HF signal and noise in three main regions of the VOTC (OCC, PTL, ATL), again using all recorded VOTC contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This revealed that the mean face-selective signal amplitude within the ATL was 72% (LF) and 92% (HF) smaller than in the PTL. In contrast, the noise in the ATL was only 10% larger (LF) or of equal magnitude (HF) than in the PTL. This indicates that the lower Z-scores in ATL are mostly driven by a smaller face-selective signal amplitude in this region compared to the posterior VOTC.</p><p>Altogether, these observations indicate that the apparent disproportionate reduction of HF+ face-selective contacts in the ATL region results from a combination of 3 quantitative factors: (1) the face-selective Z-score for the HF signal is overall lower than for the LF signal; (2) the Z-score for both signals decreases along the posterior-anterior axis of VOTC; (3) face-selective LF+ or HF+ contacts are defined using a common statistical threshold. These observations rule out major qualitative differences in the relationship between signals across the VOTC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Similar local spatial extent for LF and HF signals</title><p>In previous sections, we characterized and compared the spatial distribution of LF and HF signals at a global level across the VOTC. We found a more focused distribution of HF+ contacts around the FG region that could be interpreted as reflecting a narrower spatial distribution of HF responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To further explore this issue and characterize the spatial properties of LF and HF signals at a finer scale, we took advantage of the high spatial resolution of SEEG recordings (center-to-center distance between contacts is 3.5 mm, whereas it is commonly 10 mm in ECoG studies). To this end, we measured the variation of signal amplitudes along the length of whole SEEG electrode arrays (i.e. containing 5–15 contacts). To ensure that our analyses included reliable neural responses for both signals in each electrode array, we focused specifically on electrodes arrays containing at least one LF+HF+ contact (N=215 electrode arrays). Electrodes were grouped as a function of the main VOTC region label (i.e. OCC, PTL, ATL) of the recording contact with the maximum amplitude (based on LF signal).</p><p>To visualize and compare the spatial extent of LF and HF signals, we investigated the amplitude profiles of the two signals along each electrode array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This revealed that despite the much larger number of significant contacts for LF compared to HF at the threshold of Z&gt;3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), a large proportion of electrode arrays exhibited highly similar local amplitude profiles for LF and HF signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>; median Pearson correlation coefficient across 215 electrode arrays = 0.69).

To ensure that these analyses were performed on the same neural source for LF and HF in each electrode, we only included electrodes in which the recording contacts with the maximal amplitude for LF and HF were located within 3.5 mm of each other (i.e. 77% of the electrodes; similar results were obtained when including 100% of the electrodes).</p><p>As a first estimate of the spatial extent, we determined the size of clusters of contiguous significant face-selective contacts separately for each signal and regions. As expected, the size of these clusters was significantly larger for LF than for HF (mean +/-std = 3.83+/-2.66 contacts vs. 2.29+/-1.58 contacts for LF and HF respectively, p&lt;0.0001, two-tailed permutation test; that is, 13.4 mm vs. 8.0 mm for LF and HF), likely owing to the overall higher Z-scores for LF than for HF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Second, to quantify the spatial extent of LF and HF signals at a finer scale and, most importantly, independently of the Z-score and statistical threshold, we measured the rate of face-selective amplitude decline as a function of the distance from the maximum amplitude in each electrodes array, which were grouped by main region and hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Separately for LF and HF signals, electrodes were first spatially centered with respect to the contact with the largest amplitude. For each signal and electrode, amplitudes at contacts located on both sides of the maximum - and equidistant from it - were then averaged in order to ‘fold’ the electrode around the maximum. The spatial extent for LF and HF signals in each region was estimated by fitting an exponential decay function to the mean amplitude profile (goodness of fit - R² - ranged from 96.9 to 99.7) and locating the distance from the maximum at which the function reached half of its amplitude range. Across regions, the average spatial extent at half-range ranged from 2.3 to 3.0 mm for LF signal and from 1.9 to 3.4 mm for HF signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The difference in half-range spatial extent between LF and HF was therefore minimal, with LF being slightly but significantly larger in the left ATL (3.0 vs 2.3 mm for LF and HF respectively, p&lt;0.005, two-tailed permutation test, fdr-corrected). For other regions, differences in spatial extent were not significantly different from each other (−0.5 to 0.5 mm, all ps &gt;0.27). At lower amplitude relative to the peak (i.e. 25% of amplitude range), the spatial extent ranged from 4.8 to 6.0 mm for LF and from 3.8 to 6.8 mm for HF. At this lower relative amplitude, as for the half-range extent, the spatial extent was slightly larger for LF in the left ATL (6.0 <italic>vs</italic> 4.5 mm for LF and HF, p&lt;0.005, fdr-corrected) but no significant difference was observed for other regions (−0.93 to 1 mm, all ps &gt;0.25).

To avoid including noise in correlation estimates, we restricted the analyses to the set of LF+HF+ contacts in which a reliable face-selective activity could be measured for both signals. This revealed a strong relationship when considering responses across the VOTC (Pearson’s r on log-transformed amplitudes across 569 contacts: 0.59 [0.53–0.64], p&lt;0.001). Mapping Pearson correlations in Talairach space across the VOTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) revealed that the highest correlations were found in the posterior VOTC, with local peaks in the right latFG and VMO (<italic>r</italic>~=0.8–0.9), while they were slightly lower in the anterior VOTC. This was confirmed when computing correlations between LF and HF signals separately for each main VOTC region using individual participants’ anatomical labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

The noise used to compute the MEC was quantified as the standard deviation in face-selective response amplitude between FPVS sequences. The MEC (averaged across LF and HF) at the level of the whole VOTC was 0.88, 99% CI: [0.85–0.91]. This means that the correlation between LF and HF signals reaches 71%, 99% CI: [67-76]% ( ratio of the actual LF <italic>vs</italic>.

The FSI varies from 0 (no face-selective response) to 1 (only face-selective response and no general visual response) and allows to quantify the magnitude of the face-selective response relative to the overall visual responsiveness of the cortex around the recording contact. Unlike the face-selective amplitude, which cannot be directly compared across LF and HF, the FSI allows for a direct comparison of selectivity across the two signals. Quantifying the FSI (using LF+HF+ contacts) reveals three important findings. First, the face-selectivity indices were virtually identical between LF and HF signals. Comparing LF to HF FSI for each main VOTC region and hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) revealed no significant difference between signals (range of FSI difference: –0.023–0.041; all ps &gt;0.6, fdr-corrected). Second, selectivity indices increased from posterior VOTC / OCC (LF = 0.64, 99% confidence interval: [0.60–0.69]; HF = 0.62 [0.56–0.67]) to anterior VOTC / ATL (LF = 0.87 [0.85–0.89] and HF = 0.86 [0.84–0.89]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Third, the face-selectivity indices were larger in the right than in the left hemisphere in OCC (averaging LF and HF: left = 0.57 [0.5–0.64] vs. right = 0.71 [0.65–0.76], p&lt;0.005, fdr-corrected) and PTL (left = 0.74 [0.7–0.77] vs. right = 0.80 [0.76–0.83], p&lt;0.005) regions. In the ATL, the FSI was slightly larger in the left hemisphere (left = 0.89 [0.87–0.91] vs. right = 0.85 [0.82–0.88], p&lt;0.01). Computing a VOTC map of the face-selectivity index in the Talairach space corroborated these three observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The maps further reveal a low face-selectivity index in medial VOTC for both LF and HF signals, and a high index over more lateral regions, in the strip of cortex from IOG to ATL, where the largest face-selective amplitude is measured. However, unlike face-selective amplitude, the largest face-selectivity index is measured in the ATL regions, owing to the very low response to non-face stimuli (i.e. captured by the 6 Hz general visual response). This means that when taking into account the amplitude of the neural response to various visual categories, face-selectivity is similar across the two types of signals.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Similar face selectivity index for LF and HF.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Face-selectivity index (FSI) for LF and HF signals computed over LF+HF+ contacts separately for each main region and hemisphere (light color = left hemisphere).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, both signals started to deviate from baseline at around the same latency (LF: 79ms, 95% confidence interval: [58 - 101] ms and HF: 91ms, [82 - 103] ms), although the LF signal significantly rose above baseline slightly later than HF (102ms, [96 - 108] ms vs. 77ms, [75 - 81] ms for LF and HF respectively) due to higher across-trial standard deviation for LF. In addition, the response duration was longer for LF, returning to baseline level at 639ms (95% confidence interval: [637 641]), compared to HF signal which returned to baseline level at 409 ms [402 - 430].</p><p>To further characterize the timing relationship across signals, we estimated the onset latency of LF and HF face-selective response in each right latFG recording contact (rejecting 4 contacts in which we could not reliably determine onset latency).

Despite a significant correlation, the magnitude of the correlation suffers from the uncertainty in the estimated precise onset latency in a number of contacts with lower SNR.

To this end, we analyzed an unusually large dataset of 121 participants providing more than 8000 recording sites across the whole VOTC. We measured neural activity selectively triggered by the presentation of human faces, an optimal stimulus category to probe the ventral pathway for visual object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DiCarlo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grill-Spector et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rossion et al., 2018</xref>). Our original approach combines (1) intracerebral recordings, which give access to both sulci and gyri, and (2) frequency-tagging to maximize homogeneity across the two signal analyses pipelines, signal-to-noise ratio, and objectivity of measurement of both signal and noise (i.e., at pre-defined frequency bins). It reveals three main findings overall.</p><p>First, we find highly similar spatial patterns of LF and HF face-selective activity across brain regions, in terms of significant contacts overlap, relative amplitudes and local spatial extent. Second, our analyses show that genuine category-selective neural activity in the anterior portion of the VOTC, the VATL, is likely to be missed with HF signals only. Finally, these two face-selective neural signals are highly functionally related as indicated by their strong amplitude correlation, degree of face-selectivity, and concurrent onset timing.</p><p>Overall, these findings point to largely similar functional properties between these two major neural signals, which may, at the current state of knowledge, therefore provide essentially the same type of information regarding the neural basis of human (re)cognition. Yet, questioning the current focus on HF signals at the expense of LF signals in intracranial human recording research, our observations highlight significant advantages of LF signals: higher SNR to identify a larger number of significant responses, stronger right hemispheric dominance and more extensive ATL exploration. Altogether, these observations, which are discussed more specifically below, re-establish the high value of LF in mapping neural activity in human associative cortex with iEEG.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Spatially overlapping face-selective LF and HF neural activity</title><p>The wide spatial distribution of face-selective LF neural activity across the VOTC has been previously described with smaller samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagen et al., 2020</xref>), and is extended here to HF signals isolated with the same experimental approach. To our knowledge, only one human intracranial recording study compared the spatial overlap of HF and LF neural face-selectivity, focusing on the IOG and latFG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engell and McCarthy, 2011</xref>) and concluding in favor of spatially and functionally dissociated signals indexing face-selectivity. However, this reported dissociation could be due to substantial methodological differences for sampling LF and HF signals in that study, i.e., raw N200 peak amplitude in the 0.16–0.24 s time-window for LF <italic>vs.</italic> average power in a 0.2–0.6 s time-window for HF [Note also that in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engell and McCarthy, 2011</xref>, a large percentage of electrodes classified as showing HF-only face-selective responses since they did not meet strict criteria for face-selective N200s nevertheless exhibited a large face-selective component at a later time point (P290). This suggests that using the same time window for quantifying LF and HF signals might have reduced the number of HF-only responses and decreased the spatial dissociation between signals in that study]. In contrast, here with highly similar methods and criteria to quantify signals in the two frequency bands, significant face-selective LF activity was found on the vast majority of face-selective HF+ contacts (i.e. 92.7%), with the remaining very few HF-only responses being spatially scattered and thus likely to reflect noise. In particular, the strongest overlap was found in the regions showing the largest proportion and amplitude of face-selective activity such as the IOG and latFG. Overall, our results point to largely overlapping LF and HF functional neural activity, especially from the point of view of HF, which is almost never found in isolation.</p><p>Along these lines, the proportions of LF+ and HF+ contacts throughout the VOTC showed similar local and global patterns: highest proportions in the latFG and IOG, a progressive reduction toward the ATL, and a right hemispheric dominance. Yet, the proportion of LF+ contacts is higher overall and more broadly distributed than for HF, which appears to be in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engell and McCarthy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vidal et al., 2010</xref>). Here we demonstrate that the higher number of LF+ contacts is merely due to the larger SNR for LF as compared to HF signal, so that equating the number of LF+ and HF+ contacts by adapting statistical threshold results in indistinguishable spatial distributions between LF+ and HF+ contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the spatial overlap between LF and HF significant recording contacts, there were also robust spatial correlations between response amplitudes, either across anatomical regions or voxels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). One noticeable difference though, is the stronger right hemispheric advantage in LF than HF amplitude in the latFG, which is important given the well-known dominance of the right hemisphere in face recognition in the human species, especially in the latFG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rossion and Lochy, 2022</xref>, for review).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>HF underestimates face-selective ATL activity</title><p>As shown previously with fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins and Olson, 2014</xref>) but mainly with direct recordings of neural activity that do not suffer from magnetic susceptibility artifacts in this region, substantial face-selective neural activity is found in the human (ventral) ATL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagen et al., 2020</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison et al., 1999</xref>). Here, the highest amplitude and proportion of LF+ contacts were found in the antFG and adjacent sulci: the antCoS and antOTS. A smaller proportion of LF+ contacts were found in the temporal pole and in the anterior inferior and middle temporal gyri. In comparison, there was a disproportionately low number of face-selective HF+ contacts in the ATL. In the current study, the large sample of participants and number of recording contacts in the ATL allowed to reveal (a low proportion of) HF+ contacts in this region and to show their spatial and functional correspondence to LF signals. However, with more limited datasets as in most intracranial EEG studies (i.e. usually 2–15 subjects) and a data analysis restricted to HF signal, the ATL would not have been classified as a face-selective region. As a matter of fact, most previous intracranial EEG studies focusing on HF reported no or little face-selective ATL activity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sanada et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schrouff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacques et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidesco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Norman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rangarajan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kadipasaoglu et al., 2016</xref>). Given that fMRI barely record any face-selective ATL activity (except very anteriorly in the temporal lobe, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins and Olson, 2014</xref>), likely due to signal drop-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ojemann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Winawer et al., 2010</xref>), it is not surprising that this region is largely neglected, even in recent reviews on the functional architecture of face perception in the VOTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grill-Spector et al., 2017</xref>). More specifically, there appears to be a substantial spatial ‘gap’ between the FFA/mFus-faces in the middle fusiform gyrus and rarely disclosed ventral ATL face-selective area(s) close to the temporal pole (for recent illustrations of this functional spatial gap in face-selectivity; see e.g., Figure 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins and Olson, 2014</xref>; Figures 1 and 4 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; Figure 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kovács, 2020</xref>; Figure 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volfart et al., 2022</xref>). This gap corresponds in particular to the location of the antFG and adjacent sulci, that is, the antCoS and the antOTS, in which particularly large LF face-selective activity is found in the current study. Thus, overall, it is fair to say that it is the exploration of LF signal in intracranial electrophysiology that has truly brought forward the ATL as a major face-selective region, especially the antFG and adjacent sulci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacques et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volfart et al., 2022</xref>; the current study). In order to reveal the full spatial extent of the human cortical face network and investigate the nature of representations and processes in these (ventral) ATL regions, it is critical that future intracranial studies do not limit their investigation to HF neural activity but also fully explore LF signals.</p><p>Is this larger proportion of LF+ compared to HF+ contacts in the ATL explained by qualitative or quantitative differences across signals? In other words, is there a modulation of the relationship between LF and HF signals from posterior to anterior VOTC (i.e. a qualitative difference) or is this relationship stable across the VOTC (i.e. a quantitative difference)? Here we showed that this difference is accounted by a combination of three quantitative factors: (1) an overall higher SNR (Z-score) for LF signal, (2) a lower Z-score overall in anterior VOTC, (3) the use of a common statistical threshold for both signals (Z&gt;3.1, p&lt;0.001). Thus, according to these findings, the disproportionately lower proportion of HF+ responses in the ATL results mostly from a quantitative difference between LF and HF. In addition, we showed that the decrease in face-selective <italic>signal</italic> amplitude is much sharper than the increase in <italic>noise</italic> level. These observations indicate that the lower Z-score in the ATL (for both LF and HF but more so for HF) is predominantly caused by a smaller face-selective signal amplitude in this region compared to more posterior regions. Future intracranial human recording studies will have to determine whether the lower face-selective signal amplitude in the ATL relates to physiological properties of the cortex in this region, potentially generating weak population-level neural activity, and if it can be increased by using more suitable stimuli (e.g. familiar faces linked to semantic information; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins and Olson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rice et al., 2018</xref>) for this region.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Similar local spatial extent for LF and HF when accounting for differences in signal amplitude</title><p>In human intracranial recordings, it is generally assumed that HF signals reflect a more local neural activity than LF signals and hence provide higher spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crone et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfurtscheller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lachaux et al., 2012</xref>). However, this assumption rests on findings from studies that have quantified the spatial extent by counting the number of recording sites with significant responses for LF and for HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfurtscheller et al., 2003</xref>). In these studies, LF generate larger clusters of significant responses than HF, which is taken as an indication that the latter type of signal is more focal than the former. Here, we also observed a larger number of LF+ contacts and a larger mean number of contiguous LF+ compared to HF+ contacts. However, one important issue with the current and previous finding is that it may result either from (1) a higher amplitude or SNR at the neural source of the signal (as observed in the current study for LF), generating signals that stay above the significance threshold further away from the actual source (potentially due to simple volume conduction), or from (2) a genuine larger ‘size’ of the neural source (e.g. its cortical surface). In other words, counting significant responses confounds the quantification of spatial spread or ‘reach’ of the signal, and the quantification of the spatial extent of the cortical source. To circumvent this issue, in addition to quantifying the number of contiguous significant contacts, here we also quantified the spatial extent by computing the rate of amplitude decay as a function of distance from the peak amplitude, using all recording sites independently of the statistical significance of the signals at these sites. Systematic differences in the size of the neural source generating LF and HF should result in differences in the rate of the amplitude decay for these signals. This method is similar to what is typically used in the estimation of the spatial extent or magnification factor in lower-level visual cortex in previous studies in macaques or humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubey and Ray, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xing et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yoshor et al., 2007</xref>). Using this approach, and in contrast to the above prevalent view, we found a similar spatial extent for HF and LF signals, estimated to be between 1.8 and 3.5 mm radius. Interestingly, this is only slightly larger than a recent estimate of spatial extent in ECoG recordings in the macaque’s V1 cortex (~1.5 mm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubey and Ray, 2019</xref>). Overall, this lack of a difference in the amplitude decay function suggests a comparable cortical area generating the two signals, at least at the scale of our recordings, and a comparable source geometry (i.e., location, orientation and number of sources and sinks in the cortical layers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herreras, 2016</xref>). This finding is also in line with our observation that differences between face-selective HF and LF activity are mostly quantitative (i.e. a difference in SNR) rather than qualitative (i.e. a difference in the amplitude decay function).</p><p>Several additional factors may explain the discrepancy between our and previous findings from human intracranial recordings in terms of relative spatial extent of HF and LF. First, the view that the HF signal is more focal than the LF signal is partly inspired by the finding that the HF signal measured with micro-electrodes correlates with neuronal spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ray et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nir et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, given the reduced spatial and temporal summation of field potentials for spiking activity compared to lower frequency components of LFPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lindén et al., 2011</xref>) and the resulting more local activity of spiking neurons compared to lower frequency LFPs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gray et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki, 2004</xref>), it is often assumed than HF measured in ECoG or SEEG is more focal than responses in LF (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lachaux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crone et al., 2006</xref>). However, spiking activity and HF do not always correlate, especially in superficial layers close to the cortical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leszczyński et al., 2020</xref>) where macro-electrode HF is typically measured as in the ECoG studies that have highlighted a more focal activity for HF compared to LF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfurtscheller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermes et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the assumption about the spatial relationship between LF and HF in SEEG/ECoG measured through macro-electrodes is based on a direct extrapolation of the relationship between HF and spiking activity highlighted with micro-electrodes. This neglects the vast difference in the size and recording surface between micro- and macro-electrode recordings (1–2 orders of magnitude difference), and thus potential differences in the neurophysiological origins of HF (and thus also the spread of HF propagation in brain tissue) when measured with micro-electrodes or macro-electrodes. In other words, the spatial properties of HF measured with micro-electrodes may not translate to HF signal measured with macro-electrodes.</p><p>Second, the hypothesis for a more focal HF compared to LF signals is mostly supported by recordings performed in a single region, the sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfurtscheller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermes et al., 2012</xref>), which largely consists of primary cortices. In contrast, here we recorded across a very large cortical region, the VOTC, composed of many different areas with various cortical geometries and cytoarchitectonic properties. Moreover, by recording higher-order category-selective activity, we measured activity confined to associative areas. Both neuronal density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Turner et al., 2016</xref>) and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryant and Preuss, 2018</xref>) are substantially lower in associative cortices than in primary cortices in primates, and these factors may thus contribute to the lack of spatial extent difference between HF and LF observed here as compared to previous reports.</p><p>Third, previous studies compared the spatial properties of an <italic>increase</italic> (relative to baseline) in HF amplitude to the spatial properties of a <italic>decrease</italic> (i.e. event-related desynchronization) of LF amplitude in the alpha and beta frequency ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfurtscheller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermes et al., 2012</xref>). This comparison may be unwarranted due to likely different mechanisms, brain networks and cortical layers involved in generating neuronal increases and decreases (e.g. input <italic>vs.</italic> modulatory signal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</xref>). In the current study, our frequency-domain analysis makes no assumption about the increase and decrease of signals by face relative to non-face stimuli.</p><p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that previous studies have compared spatial properties across different signals using a slightly higher cutoff frequency for the high frequency range (&gt;60 Hz in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfurtscheller et al., 2003</xref>; &gt;76Hz in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; &gt;65Hz in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hermes et al., 2012</xref>) than the cutoff used here (&gt;40 Hz). Using a higher frequency cutoff allows to limit contamination of high frequency broadband signal by narrow-band gamma oscillations, which have different neurophysiological origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ray and Maunsell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hermes et al., 2015</xref>), and are typically observed in the 30–80 Hz range. To ensure that our observations are not contaminated by putative narrow-band gamma oscillations (narrow-band gamma oscillations are thought to be attenuated when presenting natural images, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hermes et al., 2015</xref>), we replicated most analyses (including spatial extent) using the 80–160 Hz frequency range and obtained extremely similar observations compared to when using the 40–160 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>In summary, by recording in a large area of the associative cortex, quantifying the rate of amplitude decay from the peak amplitude, and with no assumption regarding increase or decrease of signals, our study provides a more generalizable view of the relative local spatial extent of HF and LF signals than previous studies, pointing to comparable sizes of cortical sources generating the two types of signals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Corresponding functional properties across LF and HF face-selective activity</title><p>In addition to highly similar spatial properties of face-selectivity in VOTC for LF and HF signals, we provide three additional sources of evidence for a strong functional correspondence between these two signals. First, we found a robust correlation between face-selective amplitudes of LF and HF signals when using single recording contacts as unit data points (<italic>r</italic>=0.63 across the whole VOTC), with the highest correlation in the region showing the largest face-selective activity: the right latFG (<italic>r</italic>=0.8–0.9). As discussed above, only one human intracranial study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engell and McCarthy, 2011</xref>) directly compared face-selective HF and LF (ERP) neural activities in the IOG and latFG, reporting a clearly lower amplitude correlation than here, but using different parameters to quantify face-selectivity across signals. We acknowledge that the correlations found here are not at ceiling and that there were also slight offsets in the location of maximum amplitude across signals along electrode arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This lack of a complete functional overlap between LF and HF is also in line with previous reports of slightly different selectivity and functional properties across these signals, such as a different sensitivity to spatial summation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winawer et al., 2013</xref>), to selective attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidesco et al., 2013</xref>) or to stimulus repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Privman et al., 2011</xref>). While part of these differences may be due to methodological differences in signal quantification, they also underline that these signals are not always strongly related, due to several factors. For instance, although both signals involve post-synaptic (i.e. dentritic) neural events, they nevertheless have distinct neurophysiological origins (that are not yet fully understood; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leszczyński et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2009</xref>) that are manifested in the current study as the difference in the frequency range at which these signals are most prevalent, or the difference of phase-locking relative to the stimulation between LF signals (here mostly phase-locked) and HF signals (mostly non phase-locked, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lachaux et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winawer et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies focusing on separating phase-locked and non-phase locked responses are needed to determine the respective role of frequency range vs. phase-locking in accounting for differences between these signals. In addition, these differing neurophysiological origins may interact with the precise setting of the recording sites capturing these signals (e.g. geometry/orientation of the neural sources relative to the recording site, cortical depth in which the signals are measured).</p><p>Second, using a face-selectivity index which takes into account the response to non-face objects (i.e. the general visual response), we found a similar magnitude of face-selectivity between LF and HF signals on overlapping contacts (LF+HF+). This observation is inconsistent with previous ECoG studies showing higher face-selectivity for HF than LF (measured as the N200) in the middle FG, but again using different quantification methods across signals (amplitude in a 40ms interval around N200 peak for ERP <italic>vs.</italic> power in the 0.1–0.35 s time-window for HF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rangarajan et al., 2014</xref>) and underestimating face-selectivity of LF signals post-200 ms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engell and McCarthy, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Third, focusing on the most responsive right latFG, we found similar timing onsets of face-selectivity between LF and HF signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This similarity in onset latency is consistent with previous intracranial studies reporting the time-course of LF and HF responses to faces and non-face objects from the same electrodes in the IOG and latFG, although no quantitative and statistical comparisons were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lachaux et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engell and McCarthy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rangarajan et al., 2014</xref>). However, while none of these studies reported face-selectivity onset, our analyses filter-out the responses to non-face images (occurring at 6 Hz), thereby identifying onset latencies of <italic>face-selective</italic> activity for both signals at the same recording site for the first time.</p><p>An outstanding issue is how LF and HF activity respectively relate to behavior or perception. Both signals, when measured in VOTC, have been shown to be roughly equivalent in predicting the presentation time and category of a stimulus (face or house), although slightly higher performance were obtained when combining the signals, indicating that they contain a slight amount of complementary information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 2016</xref>). Other studies have also attempted to determine whether HF or LF correlate more with perceptual effects induced by local electrical stimulation of the cortex. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Winawer and Parvizi, 2016</xref> found that HF receptive fields derived from visual retinotopic mapping are slightly more similar to size and locations of phosphenes induced by electrical stimulation, although a combination of signals was not tested. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rangarajan et al., 2014</xref> reported that conscious face distortions evoked by ECoG electrical stimulation over the middle FG could be predicted by the degree of face-selectivity measured in HF but not in LF, suggesting a higher functional value of HF than LF signals. Nevertheless, objective transient face identity recognition impairments during intracerebral electrical stimulation appear to be highly related to LF indexes of face-selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jonas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jonas et al., 2015</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jonas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Volfart et al., 2022</xref> for similar relationships between LF and HF signals of face-selectivity and sensitivity to individual faces and the transient effect of intracerebral stimulation on behavior).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Generalizability of our findings</title><p>An important issue is the degree to which our findings are generalizable to other brain functions and are comparable to previous findings obtained with different stimulation modalities or other recording methodologies. For several reasons, we argue that the approach used here (wide cortical sampling, SEEG recordings, neural responses to natural images of faces, frequency-tagging) provides good generalizability of our results. First, we recorded from a large cortical surface (i.e. the VOTC), ranging from the occipital to the temporal poles and encompassing various types of cortices, architectonics, and cognitive systems: primary and associative cortices, unimodal visual (posterior VOTC) and multimodal semantic (ATL) cortices, neocortex and medial temporal structures (e.g. hippocampus). Given this diversity, our findings are likely to largely apply to other, unsampled brain regions. Second, we investigated category-selective neural responses to (human) faces, which are ubiquitous stimuli with high ecological validity in the human species known to recruit a widely distributed brain network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sergent et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haxby et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duchaine and Yovel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the use of natural images of such stimuli, as well as the contrasted nonface object categories, increase the ecological validity of our paradigm. Yet, whether our key findings of highly similar spatial distributions and functional properties of LF and HF signals extend to other recognition functions in vision or other sensory modalities remain to be tested in the future. Third, while ECoG mainly records activity from gyri and superficial cortical layers, SEEG (i.e. intracerebral) recordings, which are increasingly being used in the neuroscientific community, are sampled from all cortical layers and a wide range of anatomical structures and cortical geometries (sulci, gyri, deep structures, etc.), a diversity that increases generalizability of our findings. Despite this noticeable difference, the relatively low spatial resolution of these 2 recording methods (i.e., several millimeters) and size of recording sites (~2 mm) compared to the average cortical thickness (~2–3 mm) makes it very unlikely that SEEG and ECoG would reveal different patterns of LF-HF functional correspondence. Finally, we relied on a well-validated frequency-tagging stimulation approach, which provides objectivity of response identification and quantification, and similarity across analysis pipelines for LF and HF. Even though this approach remains relatively rare compared to slow temporally-jittered stimulation methods, streams of rapidly presented stimuli is a longstanding method of stimulation in human electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrian and Matthews, 1934</xref>), widely used in vision (and also auditory and somatosensory stimulation), both in behavioral (e.g. rapid serial visual presentation- RSVP, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Potter and Levy, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Potter et al., 2014</xref>) and electrophysiological research (“steady-state potentials”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Regan, 1966</xref>). In addition, frequency-tagged neural responses as used in the present paradigm with natural variable images are independent of temporal predictability (i.e. strictly identical to responses obtained in a nonperiodic presentation mode; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quek and Rossion, 2017</xref>) and qualitatively similar across a well-defined suitable frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Retter and Rossion, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Retter et al., 2020</xref>), further increasing their generalizability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, our large-scale intracerebral recording study shows that stimulus-triggered LF and HF signals recorded across the human associative cortex largely share spatial and functional properties, questioning a prevalent view in the neuroscientific community. Moreover, our observations indicate that neglecting LF signals in favor of HF activity comes at a cost in terms of identification and characterization of regions associated with low HF signal such as the VATL, which plays a key role in various higher order brain function including semantic cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lambon Ralph et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Persichetti et al., 2021</xref>). Although our observations were made with a specific type of stimulation in the visual modality and concerned essentially ventral occipital and temporal regions, the ubiquity of face stimuli in the natural environment, the wide cortical distribution dedicated to their recognition and their relevance for systems neuroscience in general, make it highly likely that these conclusions will generalize to other functional networks in the human brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>The study included 121 participants (61 females, mean age: 32.5±8.7 years; 109 right-handed) undergoing clinical intracerebral evaluation with depth electrodes (stereotactic electroencephalography or SEEG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) for refractory partial epilepsy.

Each image contained an unsegmented object or face near the center, these stimuli differing in terms of size, viewpoint, lighting conditions and background. Global images were equalized for mean pixel luminance and contrast, but low-level visual cues associated with the faces and visual objects remained highly variable, naturally eliminating the systematic contribution of low-level visual cues to the recorded face-selective neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rossion et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants viewed continuous sequences of natural images of objects presented at a fast rate of 6 Hz through sinusoidal contrast modulation. This relatively fast rate allows only one fixation per stimulus and is largely sufficient to elicit maximal face-selective activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Retter and Rossion, 2016</xref>). Images of faces appear periodically as every 5th stimulus, so that neural activity that is common to faces and nonface stimuli is expressed at 6 Hz and harmonics, while differential (i.e. selective) responses to faces are expressed at 1.2 Hz (i.e. 6 Hz/5) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). All images were randomly selected from their respective categories, with the constrain that no image could be immediately repeated. A stimulation sequence lasted 70 s: 66 s of stimulation at full-contrast flanked by 2 s of fade-in and fade-out, where contrast gradually increased or decreased, respectively. During a sequence, participants were instructed to fixate a small black cross which was presented continuously at the center of the stimuli and to detect brief (500ms) color-changes (black to red) of this fixation-cross. Among the 121 participants, participants viewed either 2 sequences (65 participants), 3 sequences (5 participants), 4 sequences (42 participants), 5 sequences (1 participant), 6 sequences (3 participants), 8, or more sequences (5 participants). These differences across participants were due to the particular clinical context in which the experiment took place. Since the study concerned only group comparisons of the two types of intracranial EEG signals, all collected sequences were considered for analysis (i.e. the exact same sequences were compared across the two types of signals). No participant had seizures in the 2 hr preceding the recordings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Intracerebral electrode implantation and SEEG recording</title><p>Intracerebral electrodes (Dixi Medical, Besançon, France) were stereotactically implanted within the participants’ brains for clinical purposes, that is, to delineate their seizure onset zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Talairach and Bancaud, 1973</xref>) and to functionally map the surrounding cortex for potential epilepsy surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bédos Ulvin et al., 2017</xref>). Each 0.8 mm diameter intracerebral electrode contains 5–15 independent recording contacts of 2 mm in length separated by 1.5 mm from edge to edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, for details about the electrode implantation procedure, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Salado et al., 2018</xref>). The exact anatomical location of each recording contact was determined by coregistration of post-operative non-stereotactic CT-scan with a pre-operative T1-weighted MRI. A total of 856 electrode arrays were implanted in the VOTC of the 121 participants. These electrodes contained 9703 individual recording contacts in the VOTC (i.e., in the gray/white matter or medial temporal lobe-MTL; 5316 contacts in the left hemisphere, 4387 in the right hemisphere). Intracerebral EEG was sampled at either 500 or 512 Hz and referenced to either a midline prefrontal scalp electrode (FPz, 94 participants) or an intracerebral contact in the white matter (in 27 participants). SEEG signal at each recording contact was re-referenced offline to bipolar reference to limit dependencies between neighboring contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, the signal at a given recording contact was computed as the signal measured at that contact (i.e. with the original recording reference) minus the signal at the directly adjacent contact located more medially on the same SEEG electrode array. Since SEEG field potentials are computed using pairs of adjacent contacts, each electrode array contains 1 contact less than in the original recording. All subsequent analyses were performed on bipolar-referenced signal in the set of bipolar contacts as described just above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>SEEG signal processing and analyses</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Low-frequency (LF) analysis</title><p>SEEG signal processing for low frequency were largely similar to those in previous studies with this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lochy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hagen et al., 2020</xref>). Segments of iEEG corresponding to stimulation sequences were extracted (74 s segments, –2 s to +72 s). The 74 s data segments were cropped to contain an integer number of 1.2 Hz cycles beginning 2 s after the onset of the sequence (right at the end of the fade-in period) until approximately 68 s, before stimulus fade-out (79 face cycles ≈ 65.8 s). Segments were averaged in the time-domain, then a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to these averaged segments and amplitude spectra were extracted for all recording contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The frequency-tagging approach used here allows identifying and separating two distinct types of responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonas et al., 2016</xref>): (1) a general visual response occurring at the base stimulation frequency (6 Hz) and its harmonics, as well as (2) a face-selective activity at 1.2 Hz and its harmonics. Face-selective activity significantly above noise level at the face stimulation frequency (1.2 Hz) and its harmonics (2.4, 3.6 Hz, etc.) were determined as follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lochy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacques et al., 2020</xref>: (1) the FFT spectrum was cut into 4 segments centered at the face frequency and harmonics, from the 1st until the 4th (1.2 Hz until 4.8 Hz), and surrounded by 25 neighboring bins on each side; (2) the amplitude values in these four segments of FFT spectra were summed; (3) the summed FFT spectrum was transformed into a Z-score. Z-scores were computed as the difference between the amplitude at the face frequency bin and the mean amplitude of 48 surrounding bins (25 bins on each side, excluding the 2 bins directly adjacent to the bin of interest, i.e. 48 bins) divided by the standard deviation of amplitudes in the corresponding 48 surrounding bins. A contact was considered as showing a face-selective response if the Z-score at the frequency bin of face stimulation exceeded 3.1 (i.e. p&lt;0.001 one-tailed: signal &gt;noise).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>High-frequency (HF analysis)</title><p>Segments of iEEG corresponding to stimulation sequences were extracted (74-s segments, –2 s to +72 s). Variation in signal amplitude as a function of time and frequency was estimated by a Morlet wavelet transform applied on each SEEG segment from frequencies of 40–160 Hz, in 3 Hz increments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, middle). Wavelet parameters were selected to ensure independence of the HF signal from higher frequency components of the LF evoked response (i.e. spectral leakage). The number of cycles (i.e. central frequency) of the wavelet was adapted as a function of frequency from 5 cycles at the lowest frequency to 11 cycles at the highest frequency, with a constant standard deviation in the time-domain of 0.15 s. The frequency bandwidth of the lowest wavelet (5 cycles at 40 Hz) was 20 Hz (full width at half maximum). Using these parameters, the lower boundary of the frequency bandwidth for the HF signal was 30 Hz (i.e. 40 – 20/2 Hz). This was well above the highest significant harmonic of face-selective response in the FPVS experiment which was 22.8 Hz (defined as the harmonic of the 1.2 Hz face frequency where, at the group level, the number of recording contacts with a significant response was not higher than the number of significant contacts detected for noise in bins surrounding harmonics of the face frequency). This ensures that the signal measured in the 40–160 Hz range is not contaminated by lower frequency responses. The wavelet transform was computed on each time-sample and the resulting amplitude envelope was downsampled by a factor of 6 (i.e. to 85.3 Hz sampling rate) to save disk space and computation time. For each segment, amplitude was normalized across time and frequency to obtain the percentage of signal change generated by the stimulus onset relative to the mean amplitude in a pre-stimulus time-window (–1600 ms to –300ms relative to the onset of the stimulation sequence). This normalization step ensures that each frequency in the HF range contributes equally to the computed HF signal, despite the overall 1 /f relationship between amplitude and frequency in EEG. The percent signal change was then averaged across frequencies (between 30 Hz and 160 Hz) to obtain the time-varying HF amplitude envelope, and the segments were averaged in the time-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom). The averaged segments were then cropped to contain an integer number of 1.2 Hz cycles (from 2 s after sequence onset to about 68.5 s, similarly as for LF) and the frequency content of the HF envelope was obtained using an FFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Significant face-selective responses in HF were detected based on the frequency spectra in exactly the same way as for the low-frequency bands. We used 30 Hz as the lower bound for HF, based on the observation that this frequency corresponds approximately to an intersection point on the frequency spectrum that separates properties of global power modulations above and below this frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Podvalny et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Contact localization in the individual anatomy</title><p>The exact position of each contact relative to brain anatomy was determined in each participant’s own brain by coregistration of the post-operative CT-scan with a T1-weighted MRI of the patient’s head. Anatomical labels of bipolar contacts were determined using the anatomical location of the ‘active’ contact. In cases where the active contact was in the white matter and the ‘reference’ contact was in the gray matter, the active contact was labeled according to the anatomical location of the reference contact. Bipolar contacts in which both the active and reference contacts were in the white matter were excluded from amplitude and proportion analyses. To accurately assign an anatomical label to each contact, we used the same topographic parcellation of the VOTC as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonas et al., 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lochy et al., 2018</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), which is close to the parcellation proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2000</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Classification of face-selective contacts according to LF and HF signals</title><p>For each VOTC contact, we determined whether there was a significant face-selective response in LF and in HF.

For analyses of proportions and amplitudes these contacts were sorted in two overlapping groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>): LF+ (contacts exhibiting significant face-selective response in LF independently of HF) and HF+ (contacts exhibiting significant face-selective response in HF independently of LF).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Quantification of response amplitudes</title><p>Amplitude quantification was performed on all face-selective contacts in the same manner for LF and HF responses. We first computed baseline-subtracted amplitudes in the frequency domain as the difference between the amplitude at each frequency bin and the average of 48 corresponding surrounding bins (up to 25 bins on each side, i.e. 50 bins, excluding the 2 bins directly adjacent to the bin of interest, i.e. 48 bins). Then, for each contact, LF and HF face-selective amplitude was quantified as the sum of the baseline-subtracted amplitudes at the face frequency from the 1st until the 14th harmonic (1.2 Hz until 16.8 Hz), excluding the 5th and 10th harmonics (6 Hz and 12 Hz) that coincided with the base frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonas et al., 2016</xref>). Base response amplitude was quantified separately as the sum of the baseline-subtracted amplitudes at the base frequency from the 1st until the 3rd harmonic (6 Hz until 18 Hz). Contacts located in the same individually defined anatomical region (see section “Contact localization in the individual anatomy” below) were grouped, separately for the left and the right hemisphere. Since in all anatomical region, tails of the distribution of amplitudes contained values strongly outside of the normality range, amplitudes were winsorized (i.e. by clipping the largest and smallest 10% of amplitudes of the sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tukey, 1962</xref>) by anatomical region before taking the mean and perform statistics. This allows providing an estimate of mean amplitude robust to these disproportionately large/small amplitudes. Then, for each anatomical region, we statistically compared group-level face-selective amplitude differences between hemispheres using general linear mixed effect models implemented in the lme4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) in R v4.0.0. Statistical models were fitted using REML and p-values were obtained using Satterthwaite’s approximation for degrees of freedom. Models included a random intercept per participant to account for both inter-participants variability and non-independence of contacts within a participant. P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Group visualization, proportion and amplitude analyses in Talairach space</title><p>For group analyses and visualization, anatomical MRIs were spatially normalized in order to determine the TAL coordinates of VOTC intracerebral contacts. The cortical surface used to display group contact locations and maps was obtained from segmenting the Collin27 brain from AFNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox, 1996</xref>), which is aligned to the TAL space. We used TAL transformed coordinates to compute maps of the local proportion of face-selective intracerebral contacts across the VOTC. Proportions were computed separately for LF+ and HF+ contacts. Local proportion of contacts was computed in volumes (i.e. ‘voxels’) of size 12 x 12 x 100 mm (respectively for the X: left – right, Y: posterior – anterior, and Z: inferior – superior dimensions) by steps of 3 x 3 x 100 mm over the whole VOTC. A large voxel size in the Z dimension enabled collapsing across contacts along the inferior-superior dimension. For each voxel, we extracted the following information across all participants in our sample: (1) number of recorded contacts located within the voxel across all participants; (2) number of significant face-selective LF+ and HF+ contacts. From these values, for each voxel we computed the proportion of significant LF+ or HF+ contacts as the number of significant contacts within the voxel divided by the total number of recorded contacts in that voxel. Then, for each voxel we determined whether the proportions of significant LF+ or HF+ contacts were significantly above zero using a percentile bootstrap procedure, as follows: (1) within each voxel, sample as many contacts as the number of recorded contacts, with replacement; (2) for this bootstrap sample, determine the proportion of significant (LF+ or HF+) contacts and store this value; (3) repeat steps (1) and (2) 2000 times to generate a distribution of bootstrap proportions; and (4) estimate the p-value as the fraction of bootstrap proportions equal to zero. Following the same principle, we also visualized the variations in the proportions of LF+ and HF+ contacts as a function of the posterior-anterior axis (Y TAL dimension) collapsed across both hemispheres. Proportions were computed along the Y dimension in segments of 12 mm and by steps of 3 mm, collapsing contacts across the X (lateral-medial) and Z (inferior-superior) dimensions.</p><p>We also used the same mapping approach to compute the local LF or HF face-selective amplitude or face-selective Z-score across the VOTC. For amplitudes, we used the winsorized (see ‘Quantification of response amplitudes’) mean LF or HF baseline-subtracted amplitude across contacts within each 12 x 12 x 100 mm voxel over the cortical surface. Amplitude maps were computed either in LF+ or HF+ contacts, and Z-score maps were computed using all recorded VOTC contacts (i.e. whether contacts were face-selective or not).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Correlation analyses</title><p>We performed a number of correlation analyses to estimate the similarity in the VOTC patterns of response amplitude/proportion for LF and HF signals and to quantify the functional correspondence between the two signals. Correlations were computed with either recording contacts or voxels (i.e. mean over a set of contacts) as unit data points. We applied different methods to deal with the different shapes of distributions of the data. Since amplitude data was not normally distributed (skewed to the right), we applied a log transformation to normalize the data and applied a Pearson correlation on the log-transformed data. If the log transformation did not result in a normal distribution (e.g. when correlating maps of LF and HF proportions) we used the Spearman correlation which does not assume normality. In the result section, unless explicitly specified, correlations are performed using Pearson’s r coefficient computed on non-normalized data.</p><p>We further characterized the magnitude of the correlations computed between LF and HF face-selective amplitude using individual recording contacts by comparing these correlations to the maximum correlation that is expected given the noise in the data (maximum expected correlation – MEC). The MEC, which derives from an estimation of test-retest reproducibility of the amplitudes, was computed by correlating the measured amplitudes to a simulated noisy measurement (modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kay et al., 2013</xref>). More specifically, first, we estimated the <italic>noise</italic> distribution by measuring the face-selective amplitudes for each stimulation sequence (in the exact same way as when using average across sequences as in the main analysis), taking the standard deviation of the amplitudes across stimulation sequences. This was done for each LF+HF+ contact and independently for LF and HF signals. Second, we used the amplitudes measured from averaged stimulation sequences (i.e. as in the main analyses) as an estimate of the ‘true’ <italic>signal</italic>. Third, using all LF+HF+ contacts, we determined the MEC using Monte-Carlo simulation, as follows. For each Monte-Carlo iteration (1) separately for LF and HF, we generate a simulated noisy set of amplitudes by summing the measured amplitudes (i.e. true signal) and simulated noise (computed by multiplying the noise distribution for each contact by random values drawn from a normal gaussian distribution); (2) we take the log of the measured and simulated amplitudes, and compute the Pearson correlation between these values; (3) we store the correlations (i.e. reflecting within-signal reproducibility) computed for LF and HF. We performed 2000 simulations, and averaged over the obtained 2000 correlation values for LF and HF to determine the mean reproducibility for each signal. The MEC was taken as the smaller of the two reproducibility values. This was done across all VOTC as well as separately for each main VOTC region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Estimating spatial extent of LF and HF signals</title><p>To estimate and compare the spatial extent of LF and HF signals at the millimeter scale we took advantage of the high spatial resolution of our SEEG setup in individual electrode arrays (i.e. 3.5 mm between the center location of recording contacts, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We took into account face-selective responses in all bipolar contacts along these electrode arrays, irrespective of whether or not the contacts displayed a significant face-selective response and including contacts located in the white-matter. To ensure that the estimation of spatial extent was based on the same neural source for LF and HF signals in each electrode array, the analyses were restricted to electrodes that contain at least one LF+HF+ face-selective contact. For the same reason, we only included electrodes in which the contacts with the maximal face-selective amplitude for LF and HF were located within 3.5 mm of each other (which was 78% of the electrodes). We estimated the spatial extent of face-selective signals in the following manner, separately for LF and HF: (1) selected electrode arrays were grouped as a function of the hemisphere and the main VOTC region label (OCC, PTL, ATL) of the contact with the maximum amplitude (based on LF signal) in each electrode; (2) electrodes were spatially centered with respect to the contact with the largest amplitude; (3) for each electrode, amplitudes at contacts located on both sides of the maximum -and equidistant from it- were averaged in order to ‘fold’ the electrode around the maximum; (4) resulting response profile representing the variation in face-selective response amplitude as a function of the distance from the maximum amplitude in each electrode were averaged by region/hemisphere; (5) for each region/hemisphere, an exponential decay function (y(x)=p * (1-d)^x+o; x being the distance from peak; p, d and o being 3 parameters representing respectively the peak amplitude, decay constant and vertical amplitude offset) was fitted to the mean amplitude profile; (6) the spatial extent for LF and HF signals in each region was quantified as the distance from the maximum at which the exponential decay function reached half of its amplitude range. Permutation tests (2000 permutations) were used to statistically compare the spatial extent across LF and HF in each region/hemisphere.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-9"><title>Face-selectivity index</title><p>We computed an index of face-selectivity for LF and HF signals by taking the ratio of the face-selective amplitude (i.e. at 1.2 Hz and harmonics) to the sum of the face-selective and general visual (i.e. amplitude at 6, 12, 18 Hz) responses. This index provides an additional quantification of face-selectivity by taking into account the magnitude of response to non-face stimuli. Since the index varies from 0 (no face-selective response) to 1 (face-selective response only, no general visual response) it also allows to directly compare face-selectivity across LF and HF. We computed the face-selectivity index either at the scale of main VOTC regions or by mapping the index using contacts localized in TAL space. In both cases, the face-selective and general visual responses were first averaged across contacts (i.e. within regions or voxels) before computing the index. This avoided obtaining indices outside the [0–1] range if, for instance, the denominator is smaller than 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-10"><title>Timing of face-selectivity</title><p>For recording contacts located in the right latFG where responses were maximal for both signals, we also compared LF and HF activity in the time-domain. To increase the temporal resolution of the HF signal for the timing analysis, we recomputed the HF signal using a number of cycles for the wavelet that ranged from 3.2 cycles (at 40 Hz) to 9 cycles (at 160 Hz). This resulted in wavelet duration of 20–30ms (i.e. full width at half maximum). The lower boundary of the frequency bandwidth for the HF signal using these parameters was 24.4 Hz which was still above the highest significant harmonic of face-selective response in the FPVS experiment (22.8 Hz). We only used LF+HF+ contacts (N=66 in right latFG) since they exhibit significant responses for both signals. To account for the sinusoidal modulation of contrast (rather than an abrupt onset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the face onset time was shifted forward by 41ms (~1/4 of a 6 Hz cycle duration), corresponding to a face contrast of about 50% of the maximal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Retter and Rossion, 2016</xref>). The starting point for the analyses in the time-domain was, for LF: the raw 70 s time-series of EEG recorded for each FPVS sequence; and for HF: the 70 s HF (i.e. average over 40–160 Hz) amplitude modulation time-series. Then, for each recording contact, LF and HF time-series were processed in the following way: (1) an FFT notch filter (filter width = 0.07 Hz) was applied to remove the general visual response at 6 Hz and three additional harmonics (i.e. 6, 12, 18, 24 Hz) and, specifically for the LF signal, an additional low-pass filter to remove signal above 30 Hz (Butterworth filter order 4); (2) time-series were segmented in 1.17 s epochs centered on the onset of each face (i.e. [–2 to +5] 6Hz-cycles relative to face onset) in the FPVS sequences; (3) resulting epochs were averaged and (4) baseline-corrected by subtracting the mean amplitude in a [-0.166–0 s] time-window relative to face onset. The resulting averaged time-domain responses per recording contact were used to determine the response latency of the face-selective response at each contact. Response onset latency was computed as the time-point at which the EEG response was outside the interval defined by the mean amplitude measured in an interval before face onset (i.e. [-0.166–0 s]) +/-2.58 times the standard deviation of the amplitude in the same interval (i.e. p&lt;0.01, two-tailed), for at least 30ms. We used these latencies to compute the Pearson correlation between the onset latencies of face-selective responses for LF <italic>vs.</italic> HF. Additionally, the latency of LF and HF face-selective response onset and offset at the group level were determined on the responses averaged across recording contacts in the latFG. For LF, to limit the variability in the response morphology or polarity across recording contacts, the averaged response at each contact was first transformed into phase-free variations of amplitude over time using a Hilbert transform, before averaging across contact. Onset and offset latencies for each signal was estimated using a percentile bootstrap approach in the following way: (1) randomly sample contacts with replacement, (2) average (mean) responses from sampled contacts, (3) repeat steps (1) and (2) 1000 times, (4) based on step (3), compute a p-value for each time point as the fraction of bootstrap samples higher than the mean amplitude in the pre-stimulus baseline, (5) determine response latency as the time-point at which p&lt;0.01 for at least 30 consecutive ms and store this latency value, (6) repeat steps (1) to (5) 1000 times to obtain a distribution and confidence interval for the response latencies.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All participants gave written consent to participate to the study, as approved by the human investigation committee (CHRU Nancy, reference center; MAPCOG-SEEG 2017-A03248-45).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-76544-transrepform1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All SEEG data generated or analysed during this study have been uploaded to Dyad (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.66t1g1k51">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.66t1g1k51</ext-link>).</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rossion</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Data from: Low and high frequency intracranial neural signals match in the human associative cortex</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.66t1g1k51</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the participants for their involvement in the study.

interested in neural brain signals at different frequencies. It shows that low-frequency local field potentials and high-frequency (&gt;30 Hz) broadband activity in response to face stimuli have largely similar spatial, functional, and timing properties. The compelling findings are supported by an innovative paradigm and analysis of intracranial recordings in 121 human participants. These observations provide novel basic science insights into how brain responses at different frequencies signal sensory information.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76544.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ploner</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02kkvpp62</institution-id><institution>Technische Universität München</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Ploner</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02kkvpp62</institution-id><institution>Technische Universität München</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.01.09.475577">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.09.475577v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Markus Ploner as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is essential that the authors demonstrate that the low and high-frequency signals do not confound each other but represent different types of signals. In particular, it should be ruled out that the high-frequency signals are confounded by spectral leakage of the response amplitude envelope, the type of time-frequency calculation, the noise level, or 1/f contributions. Subtracting the evoked signal from the broadband signal and excluding the lower frequency end of the broadband range might be important control analyses to address these issues.</p><p>2) It remains unclear whether and how the current findings generalize to the processing of other sensory stimuli and paradigms. Rhythmic presentation of visual stimuli at 6 Hz with face stimuli every five stimuli (1.2 Hz) represents a very particular type of sensory stimulation. Stimulation with other stimuli, or at other frequencies likely induce different responses. Moreover, signals from depth electrodes might differ from those recorded by surface electrodes. These important limitations should be appropriately discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The authors should use a more neutral and balanced writing style that avoids emphasizing a &quot;race&quot; between the functional significance of LF and HF brain responses and researchers focusing on one or the other.</p><p>– The authors should acknowledge that it remains unclear whether and how the current findings generalize to the processing of other sensory stimuli and paradigms. This important limitation should be explicitly mentioned in the abstract and appropriately discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>– P.12, line 1: It should read &quot;Figure 4A&quot; instead of &quot;Figure 3A&quot;.</p><p>– P.14, line 1: Please clarify &quot;Figure SX&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors frequently refer to the signals as differing in frequency (low vs high), which is only one way in which the signals differ: they also differ in that the low-frequency signal is phase-locked and the high-frequency signal is (probably) not. More concretely, the low-frequency signal is first order (the amplitude of voltage fluctuations), and the high-frequency signal is second order (the amplitude of fluctuations). This other difference is clear in the introduction but then mostly dropped for the rest of the paper. Any differences found (such as in SNR) could, in principle, either be due to the difference in frequency range or in first vs second order. For example, if stimuli had been shown at a higher frequency, there would be an evoked signal at higher frequencies (esp considering the harmonics). Additionally, there might be non-phase-locked signals at lower frequencies in this or other experiments. Whether the higher SNR would depend on frequency or phase-locking or both is not addressed by this study. This is not a problem per se, but as the paper is written now, the frequent references to low vs high frequency implicitly embrace only one of two possible interpretations. A brief acknowledgement of these possibilities, either in Discussion or Results would clarify the issue to the reader.</p><p>2) Some studies of broadband signals subtract (or project out) the evoked signal in order to isolate the induced (non-phase locked) signal from the evoked (phase-locked) signal. Doing so, at least as a control analysis, would strengthen the conclusion. As it is presented now, the possible confound is that the two signals look similar because they are both largely reflecting the evoked signal. While this is unlikely to be the explanation for the similarity of the two signals, it is easy enough to check and rule out, and given the relatively bold conclusions, ruling out possible confounds is important.</p><p>3) Related to 2, the cut-off of 30 Hz at the lower end of the broadband signal makes it possible that the broadband measure includes γ oscillations, which may differ from the high-frequency broadband signals. Many of the claims about the spatial specificity of high-frequency signals are based on analyses of responses at a higher frequency than γ oscillations (eg 80 Hz and above, or 100 Hz and above). This is not because the broadband signal is only found at the higher frequency range, but because the lower end (say, 30 Hz to 80 Hz) might include both. The results would be more convincing if they were shown to be similar when excluding the lower frequency end of the broadband range. (Note that this would also decrease the change of &quot;contamination&quot; of the broadband signal by the evoked signal).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Regarding the high number of participants: the given citation is from 2007, in the last years there have been quite a number of intracranial studies with a large number of participants (e.g. some random ones: Quon et al. 2021 n=261, Frauscher et al. 2018 n=106, Mohan et al. 2022 n=145 biorxiv), while the number of participants in the present study is definitely high, the extent of it is overstated in the current text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76544.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is essential that the authors demonstrate that the low and high-frequency signals do not confound each other but represent different types of signals.

This ensures that the lowest frequency included in the HF signal was 30 Hz. This is well above the highest significant harmonic of the low-frequency face-selective response in our frequency-tagging experiment, which was 22.8 Hz. Thus, the signal measured in the 40-160 Hz range is not contaminated by lower frequency evoked responses. We recomputed all analyses and statistics from the manuscript with the new HF definition. Overall, this change had very little impact on the findings. This indicates that the HF activity was mostly independent from phase-locked LF signal already in the original submission and that our initial conclusions were correct. However, since the analyses with the revised time-frequency analyses parameters enforces this independence, the revised analyses have become the main analyses in the manuscript. The manuscript has been revised accordingly and all figures (main and supplementary) have been modified to reflect the new analyses.</p><p>Second, as suggested by reviewer 2, we conducted supplemental analyses by restricting the HF signal to the 80-160 Hz range (please see below).</p><p>The 1/f decrease of amplitude as a function of frequency, which gives more weight to low frequencies when averaging signals within a given frequency range, was dealt with in the original (and revised) submission by computing the percent signal change relative to the pre-stimulation baseline independently for each frequency bin, BEFORE averaging across the frequencies in the HF range (i.e., 40-160Hz). This ensures that each frequency contributes equally to the computed HF signal, despite the overall 1/f shape of the power spectrum. The following sentence was added in the method section (‘HF analysis’), p 38 (line 1038):</p><p>“This normalization step ensures that each frequency in the HF range contributes equally to the computed HF signal, despite the overall 1/f relationship between amplitude and frequency in EEG.”</p><p>In addition, we did not subtract the evoked response prior to computing the HF signal since this approach can produce artifactual responses. Indeed, there are known trial-to-trial variations in the amplitude and latency of the LF phase-locked responses. Therefore, subtracting the averaged evoked response from each trial may generate spurious and unpredictable signals, particularly at higher frequency in case of small latency variations, which could themselves produce artificial contamination of HF signal by LF evoked activity (see e.g., Truccolo et al., 2002; see list of references at the end of the reply).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It remains unclear whether and how the current findings generalize to the processing of other sensory stimuli and paradigms. Rhythmic presentation of visual stimuli at 6 Hz with face stimuli every five stimuli (1.2 Hz) represents a very particular type of sensory stimulation. Stimulation with other stimuli, or at other frequencies likely induce different responses. Moreover, signals from depth electrodes might differ from those recorded by surface electrodes. These important limitations should be appropriately discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the issue of the generalizability of our results to other brain functions and to previous findings obtained with different stimulation modalities or other recording methodologies is important. We explicitly discuss this issue in the revised version of the manuscript, in particular by adding a new section in the Discussion section (p. 32-33). We argue that our original methodological approach allows maximizing the generalizability of our findings. First, we recorded form a large cortical surface. Second, we investigated responses to ubiquitous stimuli for the human brain, i.e., faces, which recruit a wide network in visual and memory systems. Third, we used depth electrodes, sampling all cortical layers and a wide range of cortical and non-cortical structures. Finally, we recorded responses through a frequency-tagging approach that increases the reliability of our observations (thanks to objective response identification and quantification and similar analysis pipelines across signal types). Based on previous research, we also indicate that this periodic mode of visual presentation does not lead to atypical brain responses (i.e., in fact, the responses are identical to nonperiodic visual presentation; Quek and Rossion, 2017) and that the responses are independent from the frequency of presentation, as long as the base rate frequency is within the suitable range for the studied function (Retter et al., 2021).</p><p>Here is the section added to the discussion:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Generalizability of our findings</p><p>An important issue is the degree to which our findings are generalizable to other brain functions and are comparable to previous findings obtained with different stimulation modalities or other recording methodologies. […] In addition, frequency-tagged neural responses as used in the present paradigm with natural variable images are independent of temporal predictability (i.e., strictly identical to responses obtained in a nonperiodic presentation mode; Queck and Rossion, 2017) and qualitatively similar across a well-defined suitable frequency range (Retter and Rossion, 2016; Retter et al., 2020), further increasing their generalizability.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The authors should use a more neutral and balanced writing style that avoids emphasizing a &quot;race&quot; between the functional significance of LF and HF brain responses and researchers focusing on one or the other.</p><p>– The authors should acknowledge that it remains unclear whether and how the current findings generalize to the processing of other sensory stimuli and paradigms. This important limitation should be explicitly mentioned in the abstract and appropriately discussed in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our reply above about the addition of a section in the revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– P.12, line 1: It should read &quot;Figure 4A&quot; instead of &quot;Figure 3A&quot;.</p><p>– P.14, line 1: Please clarify &quot;Figure SX&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>These were corrected, thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors frequently refer to the signals as differing in frequency (low vs high), which is only one way in which the signals differ: they also differ in that the low-frequency signal is phase-locked and the high-frequency signal is (probably) not. More concretely, the low-frequency signal is first order (the amplitude of voltage fluctuations), and the high-frequency signal is second order (the amplitude of fluctuations). This other difference is clear in the introduction but then mostly dropped for the rest of the paper. Any differences found (such as in SNR) could, in principle, either be due to the difference in frequency range or in first vs second order. For example, if stimuli had been shown at a higher frequency, there would be an evoked signal at higher frequencies (esp considering the harmonics). Additionally, there might be non-phase-locked signals at lower frequencies in this or other experiments. Whether the higher SNR would depend on frequency or phase-locking or both is not addressed by this study. This is not a problem per se, but as the paper is written now, the frequent references to low vs high frequency implicitly embrace only one of two possible interpretations. A brief acknowledgement of these possibilities, either in Discussion or Results would clarify the issue to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point. Therefore, in the introduction we have more clearly defined the signals of interest, and added a detailed acknowledgement of the relationship between frequency range and phase-locking as a footnote in the introduction.</p><p>Here are the modified sentences in the introduction:</p><p>“At a macroscopic level of organization, there are two prominent neurophysiological signals. On the one hand, event-related potentials (ERPs; often called local field potentials in iEEG) which are time-locked and largely phase-locked to an event (e.g., a sensory stimulus in the visual modality) and predominant in the lower range of the frequency spectrum (&lt; 30Hz, here referred to as ‘low frequency’ activity, LF). On the other hand, broadband activity which is largely non phase-locked relative to events and typically observed and quantified over a higher frequency range of the spectrum (&gt;30Hz also known as ‘γ range’; here ‘high frequency’ activity, HF).”</p><p>As well as the added footnote in the introduction:</p><p>“LF and HF signals differ both in the frequency range at which they are prevalent, and in terms of their phase-locking relative to the event onset. […] Future studies focusing on separating phase-locked and non-phase locked responses are needed to determine the respective role of frequency range vs. phase-locking in accounting for differences between these signals.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some studies of broadband signals subtract (or project out) the evoked signal in order to isolate the induced (non-phase locked) signal from the evoked (phase-locked) signal. Doing so, at least as a control analysis, would strengthen the conclusion. As it is presented now, the possible confound is that the two signals look similar because they are both largely reflecting the evoked signal. While this is unlikely to be the explanation for the similarity of the two signals, it is easy enough to check and rule out, and given the relatively bold conclusions, ruling out possible confounds is important.</p></disp-quote><p>First, given that HF signal is largely broadband and measured in a high-frequency window (40-160 Hz; e.g., Figure 1; i.e. above the frequency at which highest significant LF face-selective evoked responses are observed in our study, ~ 23 Hz), there is little reason to think that the HF activity would reflect an evoked (i.e. phase-locked) signal, and no reason to consider that it could be more so than in other iEEG studies that have investigated this signal and/or compared it to LF signals (e.g. Engell and McCarthy, 2011). Thus, we consider that our comparison of the two signals is in line with what has been done in previous studies (with the improvements that we introduce in the paper in terms of similarity of analysis and objectivity of identification and quantification of signal).</p><p>Second, we are familiar with the method mentioned by the reviewed which consists in averaging single trials to derive the mean evoked response and then subtract or regress-out this average response from each single trial (Kalcher and Pfurtsheller, 1995; Cohen and Donner, 2013). However, this approach is problematic for two reasons:</p><p>First, this approach can produce artifactual responses. Indeed, there are known small trial-to-trial variations in the amplitude and latency of the LF phase-locked responses. Therefore, subtracting the averaged evoked response from each trial may generate spurious and unpredictable signals, particularly at higher frequency in case of small latency variations, which could themselves produce artificial contamination of HF signal by LF evoked activity (see e.g., Truccolo et al., 2002).</p><p>Second, the subtraction procedure is not really compatible with our quantification in the frequency –domain. Indeed, to apply the procedure, we would have to segment the long (~60 seconds) recordings sequences in segments of 1 face-cycle duration ( = 1/1.2 = 0.833 s), average those segments in the time-domain to generate an average evoked response, subtract this average 0.833s segment from the original sequences at each face onset (alternatively one could re-construct artificial long sequences by stitching together the average evoked response of 0.833s and subtract it from the original sequences). The simple fact of subtracting successively the same signal of 0.833 s duration (i.e. 1.2Hz) from the original sequences might generate an unpredictable signal at 1.2Hz and harmonics (due to potential edges created, due to the subtraction, every 0.833 s in the resulting signal).</p><p>For these reasons we opted not to perform this potentially problematic analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to 2, the cut-off of 30 Hz at the lower end of the broadband signal makes it possible that the broadband measure includes γ oscillations, which may differ from the high-frequency broadband signals. Many of the claims about the spatial specificity of high-frequency signals are based on analyses of responses at a higher frequency than γ oscillations (eg 80 Hz and above, or 100 Hz and above). This is not because the broadband signal is only found at the higher frequency range, but because the lower end (say, 30 Hz to 80 Hz) might include both. The results would be more convincing if they were shown to be similar when excluding the lower frequency end of the broadband range. (Note that this would also decrease the change of &quot;contamination&quot; of the broadband signal by the evoked signal).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. In the literature, there is no consensus about what should be the lower bound of the high frequency broadband or γ range. It ranges from 30 Hz to about 80 Hz. We originally used 30 Hz as a lower bound for HF, based on the observation that this frequency corresponds approximately to an intersection point on the frequency spectrum that separates properties of global power modulations above and below this frequency (Miller et al., 2009; Podvalny et al., 2015). Other researchers divide the broadband/γ range into high and low γ range around 80 Hz (e.g. Ray and Maunsell, 2011; Foster an Parvizi, 2012).</p><p>It is unlikely that the signal in the current experiment contains strong γ ‘oscillations’, since these oscillations are mostly absent when using complex stimuli such as those used here (Hermes et al., Cerebral Cortex, 2014). Nevertheless, to take into account for the reviewer’s comment, we re-computed most of the analyses using the 80-160 Hz frequency range. We also computed correlations between HF 40-160 Hz and HF 80-160 Hz. This is included as supplementary material (Figure 5 —figure supplement 4; Figure 5 —figure supplement 5). We found a very high correlation between the signals in the two frequency ranges (r = 0.98 over HF+ contacts). Moreover, the overall pattern of results is replicated even with this much narrower frequency range, including the similarity in the spatial extent of the LF and HF signals.</p><p>This was added to the Results, in the section about spatial extent (p. 19, line 465) : “We obtained almost identical observations when restricting HF signal to the high-γ range, i.e. 80-160Hz (Figure 5, figure supplement 4; Figure 5, figure supplement 5).” In addition, we briefly discuss this issue in the discussion, in the section on spatial extent (p. 30):</p><p>“Finally, it is worth mentioning that previous studies that have compared spatial properties across different signals using a slightly higher cutoff frequency for the high frequency range (&gt;60Hz in Pfurtscheller et al., 2003; &gt;76Hz in Miller et al., 2007; &gt;65Hz in Hermes et al., 2012) than the cutoff used here (&gt;40Hz). Using a higher frequency cutoff allows to limit contamination of high frequency broadband signal by narrow-band γ oscillations, which have different neurophysiological origin (Ray and Maunsell, 2011; Hermes et al., 2014), and are typically observed in the 30-80 Hz range. To ensure that our observations are not contaminated by putative narrow-band γ oscillations (narrow-band γ oscillation are thought to be attenuated when presenting natural images, Hermes et al., 2014), we replicated most analyses (including spatial extent) using the 80 to 160 Hz frequency range and obtained extremely similar observations compared to when using the 40 to 160 Hz (Figure 5—figure supplement 4; Figure 5—figure supplement 5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Regarding the high number of participants: the given citation is from 2007, in the last years there have been quite a number of intracranial studies with a large number of participants (e.g. some random ones: Quon et al. 2021 n=261, Frauscher et al. 2018 n=106, Mohan et al. 2022 n=145 biorxiv), while the number of participants in the present study is definitely high, the extent of it is overstated in the current text.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused specifically on intracranial EEG studies recording the evoked electrophysiological responses to a stimulus presentation or an active cognitive task. Among the articles cited by the reviewer, only one corresponds to this type of studies (Mohan et al., 2022).
