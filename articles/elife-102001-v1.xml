apoptosis. However, its post-developmental roles are relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate its roles in post-mitotic cells by showing that defective Hpo signaling accelerates age-associated structural and functional decline of neurons in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Loss of <italic>wts-1</italic>/LATS, the core kinase of the Hpo pathway, resulted in premature deformation of touch neurons and impaired touch responses in a <italic>yap-1/</italic>YAP-dependent manner, the downstream transcriptional co-activator of LATS. Decreased movement as well as microtubule destabilization by treatment with colchicine or disruption of microtubule-stabilizing genes alleviated the neuronal deformation of <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants. Colchicine exerted neuroprotective effects even during normal aging. In addition, the deficiency of a microtubule-severing enzyme <italic>spas-1</italic> also led to precocious structural deformation. These results consistently suggest that hyper-stabilized microtubules in both <italic>wts-1</italic>-deficient neurons and normally aged neurons are detrimental to the maintenance of neuronal structural integrity. In summary, Hpo pathway governs the structural and functional maintenance of differentiated neurons by modulating microtubule stability, raising the possibility that the microtubule stability of fully developed neurons could be a promising target to delay neuronal aging. Our study provides potential therapeutic approaches to combat age- or disease-related neurodegeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hippo</kwd><kwd>neuronal aging</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019R1A6A1A10073437</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Junho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014364</institution-id><institution>Samsung Science and Technology Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SSTF-BA1501-52</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Hanee</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Christine H</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Junho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Hippo pathway maintains the integrity of differentiated neurons by modulating microtubule stability, and reducing microtubule stability of fully developed neurons offers a potential strategy to delay neuronal aging.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons perceive extracellular signals and transmit the information to other cells, often over long distances. For this to happen, neuronal cells extend their axons and dendrites from 1 μm to more than 1 m and must maintain an intact morphology throughout their lifetime. The long, elaborate neuronal structures are vulnerable to degeneration associated with organismal aging or pathological conditions. Structural abnormalities and the consequent functional decline are hallmarks of aged neurons or pathological neurons affected by neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yankner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bishop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fjell and Walhovd, 2010</xref>). Several studies have shown that the aged brain exhibits structural abnormalities such as synaptic loss, neuronal sprouting and restructuring, rather than neuronal cell death (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yankner et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Microtubules form essential cytoskeletal structures for most eukaryotic cells. In neurons, they serve as structural struts that allow the neuron to develop and maintain a specific shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marin et al., 2010</xref>). They also act as railroads for motor proteins that deliver cellular cargo from cell bodies to distal axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maday et al., 2014</xref>), as well as seeds for microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Job et al., 2003</xref>). Microtubules of varying lengths are observed in neurons, and they can be both stable and dynamic. Numerous studies have suggested that both hyper- or unstable microtubules are harmful for maintaining neuronal morphology as the imbalance in microtubule dynamics contributes to neurological diseases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubey et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, microtubule regulators have been implicated in a number of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matamoros and Baas, 2016</xref>) and signaling pathways including Notch pathway have been proposed as pharmaceutical targets for cytoskeletal protection of postnatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonini et al., 2013</xref>). Microtubule dynamics in normal neuronal aging, on the other hand, are poorly understood at the organismal level.</p><p>The neurons of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> provide a valuable model system because they share fundamental characteristics with mammalian neurons in terms of their molecular basis and functions. Major genetic pathways governing early neuronal development such as neuronal cell migration or polarization were initially identified from numerous studies on <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hedgecock et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wadsworth et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Culotti and Merz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ikegami et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons could be utilized to understand the molecular mechanism of neuronal aging as they demonstrate age-associated structural and functional deterioration. In particular, touch receptor neurons (TRNs), comprising two ALM, AVM, two PLM, and PVM, show the most prominent decline in structure and function with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tank et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toth et al., 2012</xref>). In aged animals, TRNs have highly wavy or ectopically branched processes, misshaped cell bodies with abnormal morphology or outgrown processes. Moreover, <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits gradual decreases in touch responses as they age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tank et al., 2011</xref>). DAF-2/IGF pathway, JNK/MAPK pathway, and membrane activity of TRNs have been identified to influence the speed of touch neuronal aging by modulating whole organismal senescence or cell-autonomous functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tank et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toth et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The Hippo (Hpo) kinase signaling pathway, which is evolutionarily conserved across animal species, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of tissue size homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>). It regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis during early development and tumorigenesis. When the Hpo pathway is active, LATS, the core kinase of the pathway, phosphorylates and inhibits the nuclear localization of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator. In the nucleus, YAP regulates target gene expression through interaction with the TEAD transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). The dysregulation of this pathway promotes uncontrolled cell proliferation, leading to tumorigenesis and developmental problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zheng and Pan, 2019</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, core components and their genetic interaction of the Hpo pathway are conserved. Inhibition of YAP-1/YAP by upstream WTS-1/LATS is needed for the maintenance of apicobasal membrane polarity of the developing intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). The functions of the Hpo pathway in growth control are extensively established; however, its post-developmental functions are relatively unknown.</p><p>Here, we establish a novel genetic animal model that reveals the postnatal roles of the Hpo pathway in the differentiated neurons. Loss of <italic>wts-1</italic> leads to premature decline of TRNs both in structure and function, and downstream effectors, <italic>yap-1</italic> and <italic>egl-44,</italic> are required in this phenomenon. We employ genetic and chemical approaches to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which <italic>wts-1</italic>-deficient TRNs lead to a premature deformation. Our results demonstrate that hyper-stabilized microtubules of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant or aged organism are responsible for neuronal deformation. The fact that loss of <italic>spas-1</italic>, a putative microtubule-severing enzyme, accelerates the onset of age-associated neuronal deformation also supports the contribution of hyper-stabilized microtubules in neuronal failures. Our study unveils the post-developmental functions of the Hpo pathway in the maintenance of neuronal integrity and highlights the importance of neuronal microtubule status in cellular aging and clinical approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>wts-1</italic> mutant showed impaired structure of TRNs</title><p>A previous study demonstrated that the intestinal Hpo pathway is essential for the proper development of the intestinal lumen and loss of <italic>wts-1</italic>, the core kinase of the pathway, leads to early larval death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). To define the non-intestinal roles of the Hpo pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we used the mosaic <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant system of which larval lethality was overcome with the intestine-specific expression of WTS-1.

In the wild-type, ALM and its posterior homolog PLM extended their neuronal processes along the anterior–posterior axis and maintained structural integrity during adolescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant- ALM and PLM exhibited ectopic swelling/waviness and branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), and other various deformations, including extended or shortened distal processes or outgrowth of processes from the cell body (somatic outgrowth) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Atypical structures of other TRNs, AVM and PVM, were also found in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), indicating that <italic>wts-1</italic> is essential in mechanosensory neurons.

To determine whether <italic>wts-1</italic> is required for the development or maintenance of TRNs, neuronal morphology of early larva was analyzed. The <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant had intact, unaltered neuronal processes of ALM and PLM at the very early L1 stage and the frequency of abnormal neurons gradually increased as the worms grew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). At the fourth larval (L4) stage, 98.89% of ALM and 84.44% of PLM, respectively, showed at least one morphological abnormality in the mutant, whereas they maintain intact structures in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Among the abnormalities, ectopic swelling and branching on the processes were the most common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>), followed by extension of the distal process and somatic outgrowth of the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>).

As colchicine treatment had a detrimental effect on the neurodevelopment of wild-type unlike in case of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), fully developed worms were transferred to colchicine-containing plates at the first day of adulthood (1DA), and neuronal morphologies were monitored in the same generation to assess age-associated morphological abnormalities. Among morphological alterations of TRNs, bead-like structures on the PLM did not accrue in the aged worms. Beaded PLM was most frequently observed in the young adults (2DA) and gradually decreased as the worms grew older (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>). This observation was consistent with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toth et al., 2012</xref>); thus, we excluded beaded PLM from defective neurons in further analyses.</p><p>Notably, both ALM and PLM of colchicine-treated worms maintained intact structures even after 20 days of adulthood (20DA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).

Colchicine treatment significantly reduced multiple structural abnormalities of TRNs, including somatic outgrowth of ALM and ectopic swelling or branching of PLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). However, it failed to mitigate other morphological abnormalities such as beaded process of ALM and somatic outgrowth of PLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–J</xref>). More importantly, colchicine treatment also improved touch responses of aged animals. Whereas there was no difference between touch responses of colchicine-treated and untreated 2DA animals, drug-treated 10DA animals showed significantly higher touch responses compared to the untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, touch responses of drug-treated 10DA were still lower than those of drug-treated 2DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). It seems plausible, given that TRNs of colchicine-treated 10DA were more structurally defective than that of colchicine-treated 2DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Considering that the same method of colchicine treatment did not affect worm lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), the protective effects of colchicine on the structural and functional integrity of TRNs are unlikely to be derived from the prolonged lifespan of worms.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Hyper-stabilized microtubules might be responsible for age-associated morphological deformation of touch receptor neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Representative images of (<bold>A</bold>) ALM and (<bold>B</bold>) PLM of colchicine-treated or untreated wild-type worms.

These observations say that the Hpo pathway of <italic>C. elegans</italic> has a neuroprotective effect in differentiated neurons in a cell-autonomous manner, restricting YAP-1 from triggering premature neuronal decline.</p><p>In addition to its extensively studied roles in early development and tumorigenesis, dysregulation of the Hpo pathway has been implicated in aging and pathologies of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sahu and Mondal, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gogia et al., 2021</xref>). Hyper-activation of the pathway components such as MST1 and the consequent inhibition of YAP have been noted in several neurodegenerative disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsumoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamanishi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mueller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tanaka et al., 2020</xref>). In these models, the inactivation of the pathway or the activation of YAP ameliorates neuronal cell death; thus, the manipulation of the Hpo pathway has been regarded to prevent pathologies associated with neuronal cell death. Our results showing that the proper inhibition of YAP-1 by an upstream WTS-1 is required to maintain neuronal integrity appear to contradict these previous observations. However, alterations that occur in the aged brain or the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants are structural alterations or failures in structural maintenance, which are different from neuronal cell death that occurs in neurodegenerative diseases. This could explain the conflicting function of YAP-1 in terms of neuroprotection. Moreover, some examples present the detrimental effects of uncontrolled YAP. Dysregulation of the pathway and ectopic activation of YAP have been observed in patients with Alexander disease, which is a rare neurodegenerative disease that results in progressive neuronal degeneration based on the loss of myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Further, the activation of YAP also occurred in Müller cells during retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamon et al., 2017</xref>). The present study shows that proper regulation of YAP is essential to maintain neuronal integrity and adds important information to the research on anti-aging roles of the Hpo pathway after development.</p><p>Genetic and pharmacological approaches suggest that defective, hyper-stabilized microtubules in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant were responsible for premature deformation of neurons, possibly in a ‘wear-to-tear fashion’ because of the mechanical strains generated by organismal movements. Reduced movement or treatment with colchicine had significant ameliorating effects on neuronal deformation of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant. Colchicine binds irreversibly to tubulin dimers and prevents the addition of tubulin dimers to the fast-growing ends of microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ravelli et al., 2004</xref>). It has been widely used to cure acute gouty arthritis and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dinarello et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zemer et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zemer et al., 1986</xref>). Our study demonstrated that colchicine reduced the severity of neuronal lesions and even improved neuronal function in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant TRNs. Moreover, colchicine treatment on fully developed animals largely reduced age-related failures in neuronal structures and functions during normal aging. This supports the idea that neuronal deformation seen in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants is similar to that in aged organism, and, more importantly, hyper-stabilization of neuronal microtubules would be a promising target to cure age-associated neuronal deformation.</p><p>These observations are unexpected because microtubule-destabilizing agents mimic several neuronal degenerative disease phenotypes, and microtubule-stabilizing agents such as paclitaxel and epothilone D exhibit neuroprotective effects in the pathological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shemesh and Spira, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Some reports have shown that colchicine has detrimental effects on cognitive function in animal disease models specifically leading to cholinergic neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goldschmidt and Steward, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Veerendra Kumar and Gupta, 2002</xref>). In contrast, a study in older patients with FMF showed that long-term colchicine treatment could protect against cognitive decline in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leibovitz et al., 2006</xref>) and the neuroprotective functions of colchicine also have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pratt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salama et al., 2012</xref>). In the case of HSP and paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy, hyper-stabilization of microtubule could be a cause of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavaletti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hazan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trotta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Swain, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scripture et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gornstein and Schwarz, 2014</xref>). Mutated spastin is the most common cause of HSP, a hereditary, neurodegenerative disease that affects the upper motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hazan et al., 1999</xref>). Similar to the neuroprotective effects of colchicine in the <italic>wts-1</italic> or aged neurons, vinblastine, a microtubule-destabilizing agent, rescues axonal swellings in the HSP models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fassier et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, the loss of <italic>spas-1</italic>, the worm homolog of spastin, led to premature deformation of TRNs, and treatment with colchicine alleviated premature decline of <italic>spas-1</italic> mutant TRNs in both structure and function. Additionally, the fact that impaired spastin activity in several animal models results in sparser microtubule array at axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherwood et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wood et al., 2006</xref>) provides a possible link between hyper-stabilization and the sparseness of microtubules we observed. These shared properties among <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant neurons, aged neurons, and HSP models strongly support that the hyper-stabilized microtubules are responsible for the structural and functional failures of neurons in both senescent and pathological conditions. It will be needed to determine that colchicine has more general neuroprotective effects on age- or diseases-associated decline in other animal models and other microtubule-destabilizing agents show similar beneficial effects.</p><p>Mutations in several tubulin proteins, microtubule-binding proteins such as tau, and failures in nerve attachment to the epidermis have been reported to induce similar deformities in TRNs, as seen in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant. In several mutants of <italic>mec-1</italic>, which encodes an ECM protein, TRNs fail to separate from body-wall muscles and they are prematurely degenerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>mec-1</italic> mutant neurons, TRNs of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant appeared to normally dissociate from the muscles and innervate the epidermal layer. Uncontrolled <italic>yap-1</italic> may affect the vesicular transport of membrane proteins by altering plasma membrane polarity in the same way it acts in the intestine. Since we were unable to identify transcriptional targets of YAP-1 associated with these phenomena, the detailed mechanism of how the activated YAP-1 triggers microtubule hyper-stabilization in TRNs cell-autonomously remains to be explored. The unique 15-protofilament microtubules in TRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chalfie and Thomson, 1982</xref>), which may contribute to their vulnerability to age-related deformation, could be influenced by transcriptional regulation through YAP-1. Otherwise, YAP-1 may have broader effects in neuronal microtubules and other characteristics of TRNs, such as their anatomical localization near the cuticle or their long projections along the body axis, which could also affect age-related deformation. Given that YAP is known to regulate transcription of secretory proteins, such as TGF-β ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), an extracellular factor possibly influences touch neuronal microtubules in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Despite these limitations in understanding the underlying mechanism, the phenotype of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant appears much earlier, and its phenotypic penetrance is notably higher compared with any other known mutant. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first reports to show the impact of the signaling pathway on the specific neuronal aging. As we have shown in this study, defective TRNs of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant could provide a neuronal model to investigate the potential therapeutic targets for improving neuronal aging that occurs either prematurely or normally.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm maintenance and strains</title><p>Worms were maintained at 20°C as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>), unless noted otherwise.

It presents a valuable investigation into the role of the Hippo signaling pathway (specifically wts-1/LATS and yap) in age-dependent neurodegeneration and microtubule dynamics in <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRNs. The authors convincingly demonstrated that disruption of wts-1/LATS leads to age-associated neuronal abnormalities and enhanced microtubule stabilization, with a genetic link to yap. While the study was praised for its well-conducted and well-controlled approaches, reviewers raised concerns about the specificity of the Hippo pathway's effects to TRNs, the correlation of Hpo signaling decline in TRNs with age, and the mechanistic link between Hpo-mediated gene expression and microtubule regulation. The authors addressed the TRN specificity by suggesting the unique microtubule structure of these neurons might contribute to their susceptibility. They acknowledged the difficulty in detecting Hpo signaling decline specifically in aged TRNs but noted increased YAP-1 nuclear localization in other tissues. Importantly, the authors provided evidence suggesting that YAP-TEAD-mediated transcriptional regulation is responsible for neuronal degeneration, as loss of yap-1 or egl-44 restored the wts-1 mutant phenotype. However, the specific transcriptional targets of YAP-1 regulating microtubule stability remain unidentified, representing a key limitation. The authors also discussed the possibility of non-cell-autonomous effects of YAP-1 and offered explanations for the seemingly moderate impairment of the touch response despite structural damage. Finally, they attributed the shorter lifespan of wts-1 and wts-1; yap-1 mutants to roles of wts-1 beyond TRNs and potential synergistic effects of yap-1. Overall, the study provides significant insights into the Hippo pathway's role in neuronal aging and microtubule dynamics, while acknowledging remaining mechanistic gaps.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102001.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Hanee</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Seoul National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Junsu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Wisconsin - Madison</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Madison</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sang-Hee</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Korea Basic Science Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cheongju</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Dowoon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Seoul National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Christine H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Seoul National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Junho</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Seoul National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the role of microtubule dynamics and its effects on neuronal aging. Using <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model, the authors investigate the role of evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway in microtubule dynamics of touch receptor neurons (TRNs) in an age-dependent manner. Using genetic, molecular, behavioral, and pharmacological approaches, the authors show that age-dependent loss of microtubule dynamics might underlie structural and functional aging of TRNs. Further, the authors show that the Hippo pathway specifically functions in these neurons to regulate microtubule dynamics. Specifically, authors show that hyperactivation of YAP-1, a downstream component of the Hippo pathway that is usually inhibited by the kinase activity of the upstream components of the pathway, results in microtubule stabilization and that might underlie the structural and functional decline of TRNs with age. However, how the Hippo pathway regulates microtubule dynamics and neuronal aging was not investigated by the authors.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a well-conducted and well-controlled study, and the authors have used multiple approaches to address different questions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are no major weaknesses identified, except that the effect of the Hippo pathway seems to be specific to only a subset of neurons.

While this pathway may regulate microtubules stability in multiple neurons, other characteristics of TRNs, such as their anatomical localization near the cuticle or their long projections along body axis, could contribute to their susceptibilities to age-related deformation. Otherwise, the Hpo pathway may be truly TRNs-specific. TRNs have unique microtubules in both terms of composition and structure. Among nine α-, six β-tubulin genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, one α-tubulin (<italic>mec-12</italic>) and one β-tubulin (<italic>mec-7</italic>) showed highly enriched expression in TRNs [1, 2] and TRNs contain special 15-protofilament microtubule structure, while all other neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have 11-protofilament microtubules [3]. Transcriptional regulation through YAP-1 may affect the specific microtubule structure of TRNs, leading to premature neuronal deformation. We have included this in the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines a novel role of the Hpo signaling pathway, specifically of wts-1/LATS and the downstream regulator of gene expression, yap, in age-related neurodegeneration in <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch-responsive mechanosensory neurons, ALM and PLM.

The study shows that knockdown or deletion of wts-1/LATS causes age-associated morphological abnormalities of these neurons, accompanied by functional loss of touch responsiveness. This is further associated with enhanced, abnormal, microtubule stabilization in these neurons. Strong pharmacological and especially genetic manipulations of MT-stabilizing or severing proteins show a strong genetic link between yap and regulation of MTs stability. The study is strong and uses robust approaches, especially strong genetics. The demonstrations on the aging-related roles of the Hpo signaling pathway, and the link to MTs, are novel and compelling. Nevertheless, the study also has mechanistic weaknesses (see below).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>(1) The study demonstrates age-specific roles of the Hpo pathway, specifically of wts-1/LATS and yap, specifically in TRN mechanosensory neurons, without observing developmental defects in these neurons, or effects in other neurons. This is a strong demonstration. Nevertheless, the study does not address whether there is a correlation of Hpo signaling pathway activity decline specifically in these neurons, and not other neurons, and at the observed L4 stage and onwards (including the first day of adulthood, 1DA stage). Such demonstrations of spatio-temporal regulation of the Hpo signaling pathway and its activation seem important for linking the Hpo pathway with the observed age-related neurodegeneration. Can this age-related response be correlated to indeed a decline in Hpo signaling during adulthood? Especially at L4 and onwards? It will be informative to measure this by examining the decline in wts1 as well as yap levels and yap nuclear localization.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we have included possible explanations for the specificity of the Hpo pathway in TRNs. Since components of the Hpo pathway are expressed in various tissues, including the intestine and hypodermis, this pathway could have broader neuroprotective roles across multiple neurons. Alternatively, it could function in TRNs. Given that the TRNs possess unique microtubules in both structure and composition, and that Hpo pathway has crucial roles in microtubule stability regulation, the roles of the Hpo pathway may indeed be TRNs-specific. As we described in the manuscript, our observations, along with those of others, indicate that neuronal deformation of TRNs begins around the 4th day of adulthood. Additionally, the degree of morphological deformation in <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants at the L4 stage is comparable to that of aged wild-type worms on the 15th day of adulthood. Therefore, to assess the functional decline of WTS-1 <italic>or nuclear localization of YAP-1</italic>, observations should begin in 4-day-old animals. Using fluorescence-tagged YAP-1 under the <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter, we couldn’t detect a significant increase in nuclear YAP-1 in TRNs of 4-day-old adult. Additionally, we were unable to assess YAP-1 intercellular localization in older animals, such as 10-day-old animals, possibly due to the small cell size of neurons or morphological alteration along with aging of TRNs. Although we did not detect functional decline of WTS-1 or increased nuclear YAP-1 in TRNs, nuclear localization of YAP-1 increases with age in other tissues, such as the intestine and hypodermis (Author response image. 1). This may result from inactivation of the Hippo (Hpo) pathway, an indirect consequence of structural and functional decline—such as tissue stiffness associated with aging—or a combination of both. Additionally, given that morphological deformation of TRNs appears to begin around fourth day of adulthood, nuclear localization of YAP-1 in the intestine and hypodermis seems to have a later onset and be more moderate. It is possible that YAP-1 nuclear localization in TRNs occurs earlier or that other factors contribute early-stage touch neuronal deformation.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of the proportion of worms exhibiting nuclear localization of YAP-1.</title><p>We used GFP-tagged YAP-1 driven by its own 4 kb promoter.

Although the study uses robust genetic manipulations of yap and wts-1/LATS, it is not clear whether the observed effects are attributed to yap-mediated regulation of gene expression (see 3).</p></disp-quote><p>Given that the neuronal deformation in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant was completely restored by the loss of <italic>yap-1</italic> or <italic>egl-44</italic>, it strongly suggests that YAP-TEAD-mediated transcriptional regulation is responsible for the premature neuronal degeneration of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant. However, in this study, we were unable to identify specific transcriptional target genes associated with these phenomena, which represents a limitation of our research (please see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The observations on the abnormal MT stabilization, and the subsequent genetic examinations of MT-stability/severing genes, are a significant strength of the study. Nevertheless, despite the strong genetic links to yap and wts-1/LATS, it is not clear whether MT-regulatory genes are regulated by transcription downstream of the Hpo pathway, thus not enabling a strong causal link between MT regulation and Hpo-mediated gene expression, making this strong part of the study mechanistically circumstantial. Specifically, it will be good to examine whether the genes addressed herein, for example, Spastin, are transcriptionally regulated downstream of the Hpo pathway. This comment is augmented by the finding that in the wts-1/ yap-1 double mutants, MT abnormality, and subsequent neuronal morphology and touch responses are restored, clearly indicating that there is an associated transcriptional regulation</p></disp-quote><p>If the target genes of YAP-1 are not identified, it will be difficult to fully understand how YAP-1 regulates microtubule stability. Microtubule-stabilizing genes, whose knockdown alleviates <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant neuronal deformation, could be potential transcriptional targets of YAP-1. Among these genes, PTRN-1 and DLK-1 contain MCAT sequences (CATTCCA/T), a well-conserved DNA motif recognized by the TEAD transcription factor, in their promoters near the transcription start site (TSS). We hypothesized that the expression of fluorescence-tagged reporters of promoter regions containing these MCAT sequences would be enhanced in the absence of <italic>wts-1</italic> activity. Although both reporters were expressed in TRNs, they did not show significant changes in the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant background. We also focused on <italic>spv-1</italic>, a worm homolog of ARHGAP29, which negatively regulates RhoA. YAP is known to modulate actin cytoskeleton rigidity through transcriptional regulation of ARHGAP29 [4]. The promoter of <italic>spv-1</italic> contains 2 MCAT sequences and loss of <italic>spv-1</italic> mitigated neuronal deformation of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant. However, reporters of promoter regions containing MCAT sequences only weakly expressed in the process of TRNs. More importantly, ectopic expression of dominant-negative form of rho-1/rhoA did not lead to significant deformation of TRNs. While YAP typically functions as a transcriptional co-activator, it has also been reported to repress target gene expression, such as DDIT4 and Trail, in collaborated with TEAD transcriptional factor [5]. As a reviewer pointed out, <italic>spas-1</italic> might be transcriptionally repressed by <italic>yap-1,</italic> given that its loss leads to premature deformation of TRNs. However, since the phenotype of the <italic>spas-1</italic> mutant has a later onset than the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant and is relatively restricted to ALM, we excluded it from our candidate gene search. Despite extensive genetic approaches, we were unable to establish a strong causal link between YAP-1 and the regulation of microtubule stability. Unbiased screenings, such as tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, may help address the remaining questions. We have outlined the limitations of this study in the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>(1) The TRN-specific knockdown of wts-1 and yap-1 is a clear strength. Nevertheless, these do not necessarily show cell-autonomous effects, as the yap transcription factor may regulate the expression of external cues, secreted or otherwise, thus generating non-cell autonomous effects. For example, it is known that yap regulates TGF-beat expression and signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>In the absence of LATS1/2 activity, activated YAP has been reported to drive biliary epithelial cell lineage specification by directly regulating TGF-β transcription during and after liver development [6]. Even when functioning in an autocrine manner, TGF-β can exhibit non-cell autonomous effects. While it primarily acts on the same cell that secretes it, some molecules may also affect neighboring cells, leading to paracrine effects. Additionally, TGF-β can modify the extracellular matrix (ECM), indirectly affecting surrounding cells. Similarly, if YAP regulates transcription of secretory protein in TRNs, the resulting extracellular factors or surrounding cells may influence touch neuronal microtubules in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Although our genetic data strongly suggest a cell-autonomous function of WTS-1-YAP-1 in TRNs, we could not exclude the possibility that YAP-1 functions non-cell-autonomously, as we were unable to identify its transcriptional targets. We have included this in the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Continuing from comment (3) above, it seems that many of the MT-regulators chosen here for genetic examinations were chosen based on demonstrated roles in neurodegeneration in other studies. It would be good to show whether these MT-associated genes are directly regulated by transcription by the Hpo pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>As we described above, several MT-associated genes­­, such as <italic>ptrn-1</italic>, <italic>dlk-1</italic> and <italic>spv-1</italic>, contain MCAT sequences in their promoter and their knockdown alleviated <italic>wts-1</italic>-induced neuronal deformation. These genes were tested to determine whether they were directly regulated by WTS-1-YAP-1. Based on our findings, we concluded that they were unlikely to be regulated by the Hpo pathway in TRNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The impairment of the touch response may not be robust: it is only a 30-40% reduction at L4, and even less reduction at 1DA. It would be good to offer possible explanations for this finding.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, the impairment of touch responses of <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants showed an approximately 33% reduction at both L4 and 1DA compared to age-matched wild-type animals. At the L4 stage, control worms responded to nearly every gentle touch (94%), whereas <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants responded to only 60% of stimuli. By 1DA, control worms exhibited slightly decline in touch responses compared to L4 (82.5%), whereas <italic>wts-1</italic> mutants displayed more pronounced impairment (55.7%) (Fig 1E). Regarding the severity and frequency of structural degeneration of <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant at both stages, it appears to be relatively moderate. As we noted in the manuscript, our observations, along with those of others, indicate that structural abnormalities in ALM and PLM neurons begin to appear around the fourth day of adulthood and progressively worsen as the worms age [7]. In a previous study, Tank et al. categorized day 10-aged worms into two groups based on their movement ability and then assessed structural deformation in each animal to determine whether structural and functional degeneration of TRNs were correlated. In this same group of animals, they examined the gentle touch response and found that animals responded to gentle touch 46 ± 5.1 %, 84 ± 12.2 %, respectively [8]. It could be said that, on average, day 10 animals had 65% touch response on average, which is consistent with our observation in day 10 animals (Fig. 5E, 56.3%). Given these observations, the function of TRNs of <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant or aged animals appears to be preserved despite severe structure failures. The gentle touch response evokes an escape behavior in which animals quickly move away from the stimulus; thus proper touch responses are essential for avoiding predators and ensuring survival. It has been reported to be necessary for evading fungal predation, such as escaping from a constricting hyphal ring [9]. Given that the gentle touch response is crucial for survival, its function is likely well preserved despite structural abnormalities, such as age-related deformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) Why is the effect of the Hippo pathway on microtubule dynamics specific to TRNs? Is it the structure of TRNs that makes them prone to the effects of age-dependent decline in microtubule dynamics? The authors are advised to discuss it in their resubmission.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we have included possible explanations for the tissue specificity of the Hpo pathway in TRNs and the vulnerability of TRNs to age-associated decline in the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors are advised to explain the shorter life span of wts-1; yap-1 double mutants (with restored TRNs) compared to wts-1 single mutants in Figure 2F. The life span of yap-1 single mutants should be included in Figure 2F. Further, based on the data, the shorter lifespan of wts-1 mutants cannot be attributed to abnormal TRNs as the lifespan of wts-1; yap-1 double mutants is even shorter. The authors are advised to explain the shorter life span of wts-1 mutants compared to wild-type controls.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>wts-1</italic> is known to be involved in various developmental processes, including the maintenance of apicobasal polarity in the intestine, growth rate control, and dauer formation [10-12]. Since WTS-1 activity is restored in the intestine of the mutant used for lifespan measurement, the shorter lifespan of the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant may result from the loss of WTS-1 in tissues other than the intestine. Although we were unable to include lifespan data for the <italic>yap-1</italic> mutant, recent studies indicate that the <italic>yap-1(tm1416)</italic> mutant or <italic>yap-1</italic> RNAi treated worms exhibit a shortened lifespan [13, 14]. Thus, our data showing a slightly shorter lifespan of the <italic>wts-1; yap-1</italic> mutant compared with the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant may result from the synergistic action of <italic>yap-1</italic> and <italic>yap-1</italic>-independent downstream factors of <italic>wts-1</italic>. While this study does not provide an explanation for the shortened lifespan of <italic>wts-1</italic> or <italic>wts-1; yap-1</italic> mutants, the fact that the <italic>wts-1; yap-1</italic> double mutant with restored TRNs still have a shorter lifespan compared with the <italic>wts-1</italic> mutant strongly suggests that premature deformation of the <italic>wts-1</italic> neurons appear to be a touch neuron-specific event, rather than being associated with whole body, as described in the manuscript..</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) In the abstract, please provide definitions for LATS and YAP.
