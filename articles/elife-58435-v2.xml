active synaptic remodeling by microglia in mature healthy brains is rarely directly observed. We performed targeted photoablation of single synapses in mature transgenic mice expressing fluorescent labels in neurons and microglia. The photodamage focally increased the duration of microglia-neuron contacts, and dramatically exacerbated both the turnover of dendritic spines and presynaptic boutons as well as the generation of new filopodia originating from spine heads or boutons. The results of microglia depletion confirmed that elevated spine turnover and the generation of presynaptic filopodia are microglia-dependent processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>filopodia</kwd><kwd>spine</kwd><kwd>bouton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The federal state Saxony-Anhalt and the European Structural and Investment Funds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZS/2016/08/80645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Klaus-Dieter</given-names></name><name><surname>Dityatev</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The causal role of microglia in the acceleration of spine turnover and generation of presynaptic filopodia is directly demonstrated in the adult brain following acute focal synaptic photodamage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia are highly motile cells that regularly survey their environment within the central nervous system and are responsible for immune defence in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>).

At this stage, microglia employ complement-dependent mechanisms to eliminate synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>). In mature brains, microglia constantly make brief direct contacts with pre- and postsynaptic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reshef et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wake et al., 2009</xref>). The frequency of contacts is increased during synaptic plasticity at postnatal day P30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pfeiffer et al., 2016</xref>). The interaction between microglia and neurons has been demonstrated to contribute to synaptic modulation during motor learning (P30 and P60) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>), sensory plasticity (P30) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref>), forgetting of remote memories (P70–P84) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), and chronic stress-related synaptic remodeling (P60-120) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Milior et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, the direct observation of structural plasticity caused by resting microglial contact with synapses in the healthy adult brain has been hampered due to the infrequency of sporadic structural synaptic alterations at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grutzendler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holtmaat et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we developed an approach to evaluate the role of microglia in synaptic remodeling by transiently attracting microglial processes to synapses in a temporo-spatially controlled manner using a laser-induced focal injury. This is an acute injury model that while subtle is likely to involve a combination of injury-specific and more general mechanisms shared by homeostatic/synaptic activity-driven microglia-synapse interactions.</p><p>We used two-photon microscopy to visualize the structural dynamics of microglia and their interactions with dendritic spines and axonal boutons in 16 adult (3–4 months old at the beginning of imaging) <italic>Cx3cr1</italic><sup>Cre/Tomato</sup> x GFPM <italic>Thy-1</italic> male mice, which expressed red fluorescent protein (tdTomato) in all microglia cells and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in a subset of cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) was chosen for imaging as an area crucial for spatial navigation, memory, and history-dependent value coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hattori et al., 2019</xref>). To avoid a complex global inflammatory response of microglia (e.g. triggered by traumatic injury or infection) and maximize the contribution of local mechanisms potentially shared by synaptic repair and experience-dependent plasticity, we employed photodamage (PD) of single synaptic elements. Three types of experiments were performed, by targeting (i) a single dendritic spine (Spine-PD) to attract microglia to the damaged, imaged dendritic site; (ii) an area near a spine (Near-Spine-PD) to promote microglial approach but avoid direct damage to the imaged spine; or (iii) an area close to an axonal bouton (Near-Bouton-PD) to attract microglia but avoid direct damage to the imaged axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). First, we collected time-lapse images every 10 min for 2 hr under basal conditions. Then, three photodamages, one of each type, were performed, and structural changes were tracked every 10 min during an additional 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Data from each replicate were averaged per mouse before being used for statistical analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synaptic photodamage induces microglia contact and promotes spine and bouton turnover and filopodia formation in the RSC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of the experiments. Mice received intraperitoneal injections of tamoxifen at 1 month of age to trigger the expression of red fluorescent protein in microglia. After 1.5 months, a glass coverslip was implanted over the RSC and 1 month later imaging of the RSC was performed. Typically, the baseline (2 hr) and responses to three types of PD (2 hr) were imaged in parallel at three locations, in two animals per day.

Using this information, we calculated turnover rates and normalized microglia-neuron contact areas (colocalization) before and after photodamage (shown on the same plot as mean + s.e.m. with two different <italic>y</italic>-axes) (Spine-PD: n = 16 mice, 47 dendrites; Near-Spine-PD: n = 16, 35 dendrites; Near-Bouton-PD: n = 14, 34 axons).

The colocalization area curve of Near-Bouton-PD was different in comparison with the Spine-PD and Near-Spine-PD curves (Spine-PD vs. Near-Spine-PD: p=0.687; Spine-PD vs. Near-Bouton-PD: p=0.003, and Near-Spine-PD vs. Near-Bouton-PD: p=0.006; GEE).

Despite the evident colocalization of microglia with spines or boutons in our experiments, the resolution of light microscopy used here does not allow us to claim that this apparent contact represents the physical contact between these both cells. The temporal profiles of fast-onset expansion in the contact area were similar in Spine-PD and Near-Spine-PD experiments and different from the slow increase in the contact area observed in the Near-Bouton-PD experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C2,D2,E2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The mean microglia-neuron contact area increased during 2 hr, from 0.53% and 0.24% before photodamage to 4.39% and 3.79% after Spine-PD and Near-Spine-PD, respectively. The microglia-neuron contact area was significantly higher in Spine-PD than in Near-Spine-PD and Near-Bouton-PD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). More detailed analysis of contacts per spine and bouton revealed that the number of microglia-contacted synaptic sites increased after Spine-PD and Near-Spine-PD but not after Near-Bouton-PD, compared with the baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Strikingly, the contact between microglial processes and spines/boutons lasted much longer after Spine-PD (60.97 ± 3.33 min), Near-Spine-PD (50.33 ± 3.22 min), or Near-Bouton-PD (70.57 ± 6.35 min) than during baseline imaging (~23.77 ± 4.9 min for spines and 21.18 ± 2.53 min for boutons) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). The prolonged duration of the contact between microglia processes and spines/boutons found after photodamage is similar to the values reported after induction of ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wake et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>All types of photodamage resulted in a higher turnover of spines and axonal boutons compared with the baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">3</xref>), when spine and bouton turnover rates were less than 0.05%. Importantly, the temporal dynamics of turnover matched those of microglia-neuron contact during the 2 hr evaluation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C2,D2,E2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To summarize the remodeling of spines and boutons, we calculated a mean turnover over the 2 hr of observation. It was higher after Spine-PD compared with other photodamage types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). There were no differences between the percentages of gained and lost spines after Spine-PD and Near-Spine-PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C3,D3</xref>). However, the rate of bouton formation after Near-Bouton-PD was higher than the elimination rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E3</xref>). Interestingly, we observed the formation of spine-head filopodia and new filopodia at boutons after Spine-PD/Near-Spine-PD and Near-Bouton-PD, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">Figure 1—Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video6">6</xref>). These structures were not observed during the baseline period and have been suggested to be important for the formation of multiple spine synapses following induction of long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Toni et al., 1999</xref>). The filopodia occurrence rate after Near-Bouton-PD (79.55%) was remarkably higher than after Spine-PD (11.98%) and Near-Spine-PD (23.61%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C4,D4,E4</xref>). All the boutons which formed filopodia were apparently contacted by microglia for an average duration of 87 ± 33.7 min.

Also, spine-head filopodia formation was independent of microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C4,D4</xref>).</p><p>These observations provide evidence that microglia react rapidly to photodamaged synapses in the mature brain and establish prominent contacts with synaptic structures to promote spine turnover, in agreement with studies of sporadic synaptic remodeling in the neocortex and somatosensory cortex of adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wake et al., 2009</xref>). We think that our approach with targeting of single synaptic sites makes an important advance to minimize the injury and standardize the signal that acutely drives microglial approach and interaction with neurons, as compared to previous studies using single-cell or single-neurite laser-mediated photoablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Go et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stoyanov et al., 2020</xref>). An important component of that signal, as shown in single-cell photoablation studies, is photodamage-released adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that attracts microglia via activation of P2Y12 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>). This is also the mechanism of microglial attraction under physiological conditions. Still, the changes in ATP may develop differently in time and magnitude and additional factors may be released by PD, so our data do not necessarily inform what microglia do at synapses in the context of synaptic activity-driven ATP release under normal healthy conditions. Here, we directly show increased spine formation/elimination after laser light-induced prolonged microglial contact and for the first time demonstrate the role of microglia in the induction of bouton filopodia. The observed microglia-mediated increase in the rates of spine and bouton filopodia formation might provide a substrate for formation of new associations and may be mediated by BDNF released by microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>). This hypothesis is based on the fact that BDNF release from microglia and TrkB phosphorylation in neurons can be strongly stimulated by the binding of ATP - derived from the photodamaged cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davalos et al., 2005</xref>) to the purinergic receptor P2X4R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khakh and North, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, our results revealed that after Spine-PD there was higher microglia attraction toward the targeted spine in comparison with Near-Spine-PD and Near-Bouton-PD. Also, higher variability in responses was observed in the latter conditions, particularly after the Near-Bouton-PD. It could be explained by the ability of microglia to respond to neurotransmitters during acute injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pocock and Kettenmann, 2007</xref>). It is possible that after a single spine cut there is a release of neurotransmitters that stronger attracts microglia processes in comparison with Near-Bouton-PD and Near-Spine-PD. On the other hand, the microglial response after Near-Bouton-PD and Near-Spine-PD could vary due to a photodamage of astrocytes or various non-<italic>Thy1</italic>-EGFP-positive neurons.</p><p>Our observation of microglia-mediated spine remodeling is in line with recent indirect data on the role of microglia in eliminating synaptic components in the adult hippocampus and the observation that depleting microglia or inhibiting microglial phagocytosis prevented forgetting of remote memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Acknowleding a difference in the mechanisms of focal injury and homeostatic microglia-synapse interactions, we still anticipate that the proposed methodology will be instrumental in further elucidating some aspects of synaptic surveillance by microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>) and the mechanisms of microglia-independent and dependent forms of synaptic remodeling during synaptic injury. The latter may help to dissect the multiple contributions of microglia to memory formation and updating under normal and neurodegenerative conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (Mice)</td><td valign="top">Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Stock No: 007905 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007905">IMSR_JAX:007905</ext-link></td><td valign="top">On C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (Mice)</td><td valign="top">Cx3cr1<sup>tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Jung</sup></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Stock No: 020940 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:020940">IMSR_JAX:020940</ext-link></td><td valign="top">On C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (Mice)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Tg(Thy1-EGFP)MJrs</italic></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Stock No: 007788 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007788">IMSR_JAX:007788</ext-link></td><td valign="top">On C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Iba1, rabbit polyclonal antibody</td><td valign="top">Wako</td><td valign="top">Cat# 019–19741, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_839504">AB_839504</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">PLX3397</td><td valign="top">MedChemExpress</td><td valign="top">HY-16749/CS-4256</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Fiji</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.net/Fiji">http://imagej.net/Fiji</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">R</td><td valign="top">(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.R-project.org/">https://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>) <break/>R Foundation for Statistical Computing</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism</td><td>GraphPad Software <break/>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/">http://www.graphpad.com/</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of a modified <italic>Thy1</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2000</xref>) (# 007788 from The Jackson Laboratory) and mice expressing red fluorescent protein dtTomato in microglia under the control of the endogenous <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yona et al., 2013</xref>) (obtained by crossbreeding of # 007905 and # 020940 lines from The Jackson Laboratory) were crossbred to simultaneously visualize microglia and neurons; 23 two-month-old male mice were used in this study.

Mice were then given intraperitoneal injections of 2 mg Tamoxifen (100 µl volume) per day, for a total of 5 consecutive days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PLX3397 treatment</title><p>To study the role of microglia-neuron interactions, we used the drug PLX3397 (inhibitor of the receptor to CSF-1 of myeloid cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>) from MedChemExpress (# HY-16749/CS-4256). Mice received PLX3397 mixed with Nutella (1:1000) via oral administration every day for 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spiller et al., 2018</xref>). The daily dose was between 1 and 1.5 mg of PLX3397 in 1–1.5 g of Nutella (~40–50 mg/kg of body weight) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mok et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spiller et al., 2018</xref>). This mix and the control (Nutella) were added to polystyrene Petri dishes and placed on the cage floor. All mice received a dose of Nutella 48 and 24 hr before the start of the treatment, to avoid the novelty effect and initial avoidance. Our pilot study revealed that microglial cells that remained after PLX treatment were still attracted to the photodamage sites. To ensure that we completely deplete microglia in large areas of RSC in all mice used for synaptic remodeling analysis, we used the above-described treatment to control the exact amount of drug that each mouse consumed and performed longitudinal monitoring of microglia depletion in the RSC of treated mice every week.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Surgery and in vivo two-photon imaging</title><p>Cranial windows were prepared in 2-month-old mice that were anesthetized with isoflurane at 1.5–2% and oxygen to 0.4 l/min. Mice were placed under a heating pad to keep the temperature of the mouse body at 37°C. The cranial window was located at 2 mm anteroposterior and 2 mm mediolateral from Bregma. After removing the overlaying skull, a round glass coverslip (5 mm diameter, Thermo Scientific) was fixed directly above the brain onto the skull by applying cyanoacrylate glue (Pattex-Henkel, Germany). Once the glue was dry, the surroundings of the coverslip were sealed with dental cement (Paladur, Heraeus Kulzer, Germany). The animals were then transferred to their cages and analgesics were given for three days (ketoprofen, 5 mg/kg of body weight). Then, all animals were allowed to recover for 1 month prior to imaging. Seven of the 23 mice used in this study, in which the craniotomy window was not optically clear at this time, were excluded and their brains were kept for immunofluorescence experiments (see the experimental design header).</p><p>In vivo two-photon imaging was performed using a multiphoton microscope (LSM 7 MP, Carl Zeiss, Germany) with a Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon Vision II, Coherent). Imaging of the retrosplenial cortex was performed with a 20x water immersion objective lens (Zeiss, N.A. = 1.0). The laser was tuned to 900 nm for EGFP imaging and to 850 nm for photodamage experiments (150–200 mW). dtTomato fluorophore was excited at 1040 nm. Thirty minutes before placing a mouse under the microscope, it was anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine (90 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (18 mg/kg of body weight) in 0.9% NaCl solution. The eyes were protected with eye ointment (Bepanthen) and a heating pad (37°C) was placed under the mouse to maintain the body temperature. To avoid photodamage to the sample, the pixel dwell time was kept between 1 and 2.5 ms.</p><p>Imaging began 4 weeks after the craniotomy, which proved to be an optimal time for quantification of the turnover of dendritic spines and axonal branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pryazhnikov et al., 2018</xref>). In general, three fields of view containing several dendritic elements (second and higher order branches) and axonal branches per mouse were selected and recorded with low magnification (20x objective, zoom factor: 1.5; 1024 × 1024 pixels; image size 292.01 μm x 292.01 μm; a z-stack of 20 optical sections with 2 μm z-spacing). Care was taken to achieve close to identical fluorescence levels across imaged fields of view. For each field, two dendrites and one axon (separated by &gt;250 um) were selected for further imaging. Then, high-magnification images of the previously selected dendrites and axon were collected in parallel using the position module of the Zeiss Zen software. Recordings were done before (baseline) and after photodamage during 2 hr every 10 min (20x objective, zoom factor: 5; 1024 × 1024 pixels; 85.02 μm x 85.02 μm; a z-stack of 5–10 optical sections with 1 μm z-spacing). Thus, recordings lasted 4 hr per animal, and two animals were imaged per day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Typically, this protocol was repeated 2–3 times per animal (exact sample sizes are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>), then a new pair of mice was imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Laser ablation</title><p>In previous studies, laser ablation has been described as an effective method to dissect specific structures without altering the tissue adjacent to the impacted target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allegra Mascaro et al., 2010</xref>). In this way, the cut of a dendritic branch (dendrotomy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sacconi et al., 2005</xref>) and axonal branches (axotomy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allegra Mascaro et al., 2013</xref>) have been reported. Here, spines were cut with a ≈1 μm-long line scan (laser power of 150–200 mW, excitation wavelength of 850 nm, 60 cycles, 1 s total duration of irradiation). For the Spine-PD experiment, a z-stack was acquired with the two-photon microscope to obtain a 3D reconstruction of the dendrite using a 20x water-immersion objective (Zeiss, N.A. = 1.0). Second, laser photodamage was performed by creating a line of ≈1 μm at the chosen segment. Near to spine PD and near to axonal bouton PD were performed using the same settings as for the spine ablation experiments in a neighboring field of view on the same day. For these experiments, the distance between the line scan and the spine or axonal bouton was ≈0.5 µm. To evaluate the success of our experiments, we measured the lifetime of each targeted structure. To accept a spine PD experiment as successful (75%), we considered that the spine should disappear during the first 30 min of recording. For the next to spine PD, the targeted spine should be stable during the first 30 min (≈80% of experiments). The average lifetime of all ablated spines was on average of 25.7 min in DP-SP experiments and 93.6 min for PD-NS experiments. In the case of the next to bouton PD, experiments that resulted in an evident axotomy (because of axonal swelling) were excluded (6%) and the lifetime of the targeted bouton was set to be more than 30 min for a successful experiment (total average = 118.62 min, 78% of cases). Special care was taken to introduce photodamage away from the dendritic branch and axonal shaft to avoid transient swelling.</p><p>Prior to the selection of spines/boutons for photodamage, we selected dendritic and axonal branches with visually similar spine/bouton density and shaft thickness. Only tertiary or secondary branches with no more than 2 µm of thickness and with the highest % of spines being located in one single optical plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holmes and Berkowitz, 2014</xref>) were chosen. Using these branches, the following inclusion criteria were taken into account in the selection of spines and boutons for photodamage: well-defined structures, not contacted by microglia (distance to microglia bodies from 23.9 to 75.8 µm) and without closely located neighbouring spines/boutons next to them to avoid their direct laser targeting. After the selection of the spines/boutons for photodamage, we imaged dendritic segments with the mean ± SD length of 27.34 ± 2.72 µm or axonal segments of 30 ± 2.98 µm. The dendritic thickness was in the range of 1.11–1.33 µm, on average of 1.18 µm. The spines and axonal boutons selected for PD were always located at the center of the segment studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A2,B2,C2</xref>) and were well-defined structures, with an average size perpendicular to the dendritic/axonal segment of 1.43 µm (1.10–1.82 µm) and 1.25 µm (1.03–1.47 µm), respectively.</p><p>To verify whether the structures selected for photodamage were within a spine/bouton clusters, the mean distance between the targeted structure and the closest left and right neighbours was compared with the mean of all the distances between neighbouring spines/boutons per each dendritic/axonal segment. The corresponding mean ± SD values and the Wilcoxon paired test p-values (with segments as sampling unit) were for Spine-PD: 1.88 ± 0.38 µm vs 1.53 ± 0.44 µm, p=0.009; for Near-Spine-PD: 2.07 ± 0.81 µm vs 1.77 ± 0.69 µm, p=0.023; for Near-Bouton-PD: 5.14 ± 4.39 µm vs 4.44 ± 3.83 µm, p=0.05. Thus, the structures selected for photodamage were not within clusters and were even slightly more distant from their left and right neighbouring spines as compared to all spines/boutons in the selected segments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Experimental design for microglia depletion</title><p>To confirm the role of microglia in the synaptic remodeling related to the photodamage, 12 mice were selected and randomly subdivided into two groups of six animals each (simple randomization method), as follows: (i) Nutella mixed with PLX3397 and (ii) Nutella. The sample size was estimated based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miyamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wake et al., 2009</xref>), in which 4–7 mice were used per group to find structural changes of spines after the contact with microglia or after the treatment with PLX3397. For this study, we needed a minimum total number of 12 animals to detect differences between the control and treated group with 80% power and a significance level alpha of 0.05 (G*Power version 3.0.10, the medium effect size of 0.25, F tests-ANOVA). Three days before the start of treatment, the pre-treatment measurements were performed: 2 hr of baseline followed by 2 hr of follow-up after the photodamage (3x Spine-PD, 3x Near-Spine-PD and 3x Near-Bouton-PD) using three fields of view per mouse (See Surgery and in vivo two-photon imaging header). In parallel, before and after the beginning of the treatment, one additional field of view (low magnification) was identified and tracked every 7 days for each mouse to follow-up the progression of microglia depletion. For this repetitive imaging, the positions were identified with the help of vascular landmarks and cell bodies of neurons. After 4 weeks of treatment, post-treatment baseline was recorded and laser photodamage (3x Spine-PD, 3x Near-Spine-PD and 3x Near-Bouton-PD) was performed again and followed by 2 hr of imaging. At the end of the post-treatment imaging sessions, all mice were euthanized and the brains were collected for immunofluorescence studies. To have enough time to obtain three biological replicates of each photodamage per mouse, mice were randomly separated in six subgroups and each subgroup was imaged consecutively (one control mouse and one PLX-treated mouse in each imaging session). Besides, four from the seven excluded animals (with not acceptable cranial windows, please see details in Surgery and in vivo two-photon imaging header) were used as a second control (Naïve group, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) for further immunofluorescence studies. These animals were fed with a normal chow diet and were euthanized at the same time as the control and PLX3397-treated mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Image and data analysis</title><p>We collected for each mouse mostly three replicates of each type of photodamage and their respective baseline images before and after the treatment with PLX. The recording of each replicate lasted 2 hr (every 10 min) and produced image stacks of 5–10 Z-slices, 13 time points and two channels (EGFP and dtTomato). For image processing and parameter evaluation, we selected a region of interest (ROI) of 50 µm x 50 µm using these image stacks. A database was created to facilitate the annotation of findings.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Normalized microglia-neuron area contact</title><p>To estimate the contact area between microglia and dendrites or axons, we quantified the colocalization area in µm<sup>2</sup> between the EGFP and dtTomato channels in each time point (13 values). For this purpose, a Fiji macro was used to set a colocalization threshold and run the Coloc2 plugin. We first manually removed neighboring dendrites and axons to isolate a single dendrite and axonal branch in the EGFP channel. Second, maximum intensity projection was generated from original z-stacks. Third, to normalize the contact area, we used the EGFP-positive area that represented the area of the studied dendrite/axonal segment. Finally, we calculated Microglia-Neuron interaction area in % by dividing the Microglia-Neuron interaction area by the area of the dendrite or axon and multiplying the result by 100. In addition, the mean Microglia-Neuron contact area in % was calculated by averaging areas estimated in 13 time frames (the sum of the contact area of each time point divided by the number of time points).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Spine turnover</title><p>For each collection of stacks containing one ROI, images were aligned with each other using the dendritic branch and the Linear Stack Alignment with Sift and MultiStackReg Plugins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thévenaz et al., 1998</xref>) in Fiji. In each ROI, we selected a dendritic segment of ≈30 µm of length. Spines were manually counted using original <italic>z</italic>-stacks and the 3D convolution viewer in ZEN software (Carl Zeiss). Spine counting was performed without knowing the baseline configuration. To calculate spine turnover, lost and gained spines were identified and quantified using previously validated criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holtmaat et al., 2005</xref>). Gained spines were considered as such when they had more than 0.4 µm (five pixels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holtmaat et al., 2005</xref>) in length and lost when the length was less than 0.4 µm (five pixels). The spine length was approximately calculated from the base at the dendritic shaft to the tip of the spine head. Besides, spines were scored as lost, if their position on the dendrite relative to neighboring spines shifted by ≥0.5 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holtmaat et al., 2005</xref>). The percentage of spines appearing and disappearing from time point to time point were calculated as the turnover percentage (%). The turnover (%) was the sum of gained and lost spines from the previous time point to the analyzed time point divided by the sum of total spines from both time points and multiplied by 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuhrmann et al., 2007</xref>).

To identify gained and lost axonal boutons across the time points, we used validated criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holtmaat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holtmaat et al., 2006</xref>), where gained boutons had to be three times brighter than the axonal backbone. To score a loss, brightness had to drop to below 1.3 times backbone brightness. However, to exclude the scoring of transport packets and moving organelles, EPBs included in the analysis had to be present on the same site for at least two consecutive time points (10 min). To distinguish between two close boutons, they have to be separated at least in one z-plane by 2 µm. The turnover (%) for axonal boutons was calculated in the same way as for the spine turnover.

The same criteria were used for detection of filopodia formation from EPBs with the exception that the protrusions shorter than 1 μm were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). For analysis, three parameters were evaluated: filopodia occurrence, size of filopodia and filopodial stability. The filopodia occurrence (%) was calculated as the total number of replicates where at least one event (filopodia formation) appeared divided by the total number of replicates per mouse and multiplied by 100. The filopodia size in length was calculated from the border of the spine or bouton to the tip of the filopodia and expressed in μm for each timepoint. The maximal filopodia length value was used for statistical comparisons of filopodial size. Filopodial stability was expressed as a percentage, calculated by dividing the filopodial lifetime by the total time of evaluation, i.e. 120 min.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Spine and boutons characterization according to stability</title><p>According to their stability in time, spines were classified into three types: stable, new and transient. Existing spines or boutons that lived for the two hours were classified as stable (100%). Newly formed spines or boutons across the two hours and after the first time point were classified as new. Spines living for less than 2 hr were classified as transient. To present a clear separation between categories, a cumulative stability percentage curve during the 2 hr was computed. For this purpose, the stability of each type of spine or bouton was measured as the cumulative lifetime that each spine or bouton remained visible at each time point divided by the value of the timepoint, expressed in %.

The authors use a clever method of spatially limited synaptic or axonal photodamage and then characterize relation between microglial contact and neuronal remodeling. This in itself would have been an interesting experiment, but the use of PLX3397 to eliminate microglia and then show that many neuronal changes are in fact due to the response of microglia to the damage, elevates this to a study that really provides insight into the roles of microglia in synaptic changes in this injury model. The authors present evidence that microglia respond rapidly to focal synaptic damage, form contacts with synaptic structures, and cause the very focal remodeling of dendritic spines and axonal boutons around the injury site.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the study is rigorous, well performed and well described. However, there is general agreement that the discussion and title are misleading and need to be revised to make it clear that this is an injury model. These data do not necessarily inform what microglia do at synapses in the context of activity-driven ATP release under normal healthy conditions, but rather the authors use a pathological stimulus to attract microglia to the neuron which could result in very different types of remodeling than during normal plasticity. Moreover, there are several other points that need to be addressed and clarified including:</p><p>– Please provide rationale why male mice were used and address if there were any sex-specific differences observed.

These experiments show that microglia are involved in spine turnover in their photodamage paradigms; however, they need to be careful about extending their conclusions to claim that microglia might have a similar role (albeit less frequent) without any sort of damage as this remains untested.

The authors present evidence that microglia respond rapidly to focal synaptic damage, form contacts with synaptic structures, and cause the very focal remodeling of dendritic spines and axonal boutons around the injury site. Overall the study is rigorous, well performed and well described. I have only a couple of comments that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) It is mentioned that this work was done in exclusively male mice. As microglia have been shown to exhibit sex specific phenotypes in both development and adulthood, this seems to be a major oversight (Villa et al., 2018; Thion, Cell 2018). While it would be much better to include female mice in the study, I acknowledge that this may be difficult given the large sample size used by the authors (which is a really big plus!) and the difficult experimental design. At the very least the use of exclusively male mice should be better rationalized and discussed by the authors in the text and mentioned as a part of their Materials and methods.</p><p>2) While the writing in the text itself is nice and easy to follow – much of the Materials and methods are very obtuse. I could not figure out how the authors did their biological replicates with the three fields and three injury types, whether these were imaged concurrently or sequentially and why different animals were imaged on different days in six imaging sessions. This made it difficult to understand how the authors averaged their data into a per animal quantification (which was very much appreciated as many studies inflate their Ns). Could the authors explain this better or provide a schematic that makes it clearer? It is also very difficult to understand how the filopodia quantification was done. Likewise survival percentages are hard to understand as these don't seem to be done the same way as most survival graphs. It is also unclear whether there is any overlap between new and transient spines or whether these are completely separate categories. The criteria for what determines spines and their appearance and disappearance were also really great. But how were spines that may be overlaid in z determined? In Figure 1C1 there appears to be a new spine in the lower part of the dendrite that appears right next to something that was counted as a single spine but has two spine heads (maybe indicating two spines that were overlapped in z and then separated due to tissue distortion into two clear spines).The description of the microglia-neuorns contact % – it is unclear whether this is completed in 3D or 2D. % is also somewhat misleading as it is the perimeter of contact vs. the area of the structure (maybe normalized microglia-neuron contact would be a better name?).</p><p>3) The authors do a great job summarizing their findings at the end of the manuscript. In the Introduction, however, they convolve microglial homeostatic surveillance with responses to injury in a way that is deceptive in rationalizing their experiments. While the work does have relevance for normal spine remodeling, and many molecular mechanisms are shared in homoeostatic conditions and in the early injury response, the two are certainly not the same. The authors should make it clearer that their work does not necessarily inform what microglia do at synapses in the context of activity-driven ATP release under normal conditions (or any other mechanism that regulates microglia-neuron interactions), but rather they are using a pathological stimulus to attract microglia to the neuron which could result in very different types of remodeling than during normal plasticity. I don't think this diminishes the impact of the work but I think this should be a small but important rewrite. The introduction of normal plasticity is appropriate – it just needs to be put into the context of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study uses laser induced injury to trigger physical interactions between microglial processes and dendritic spines or axonal boutons. The study is purely descriptive, in reporting increased plasticity of neuronal connections at sites of injury or very close by. This plasticity is arbitrarily attributed to increased microglial contacts with injury sites mainly due to reduction in observed post-injury plasticity following microglial depletion.

Only tertiary or secondary branches with no more than 2 µm of thickness and with the highest % of spines being located in one single optical plane (Holmes and Berkowitz, 2014) were chosen. Using these branches, the following inclusion criteria were taken into account in the selection of spines and boutons for photodamage: well-defined structures, not contacted by microglia (distance to microglia bodies from 23.9 to 75.8 µm) and without closely located neighbouring spines/boutons next to them to avoid their direct laser targeting. After the selection of the spines/boutons for photodamage, we imaged dendritic segments with the mean± SD length of 27.34±2.72 µm or axonal segments of 30±2.98 µm. The dendritic thickness was in the range of 1.11-1.33 µm, on average of 1.18 µm. The spines and axonal boutons selected for PD were always located at the center of the segment studied (Figure 2B,H,N) and were well-defined structures, with an average size perpendicular to the dendritic/axonal segment of 1.43 µm (1.10-1.82 µm) and 1.25 µm (1.03-1.47 µm), respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the clustering of inputs reported in cortex, it would be informative and important to compare the observed values in Figure 2 to a null distribution based on shuffling spine locations for each spine type.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the clustering of spines in the cortex (Gökçe, <italic>eLife</italic> 2016), we verified whether the structures selected for photodamage were within a spine/bouton clusters. As the number of some spine/bouton subtypes was limited, we avoided to use reshuffling and employed the following approach: The mean distance between the selected structure and the closest left and right neighbours was compared with the mean of all the distances between neighbouring spines/boutons per each dendritic/axonal segment. The corresponding mean± SD values and the Wilcoxon paired test P-values (with segments as sampling unit) were for Spine-PD: 1.88 ±0.38 µm vs 1.53±0.44 µm, p=0.009; for Near-Spine-PD: 2.07±0.81 µm vs 1.77±0.69 µm, p=0.023; for Near-Bouton-PD: 5.14±4.39 µm vs 4.44±3.83 µm, p=0.05. Thus, the structures selected for photodamage were not within clusters and were even slightly more distant from their left and right neighbouring spines as compared to all spines/boutons in the selected segments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting study with broad implications for the field of microglia synaptic interactions.

Indeed, microglia can exhibit different responses to stimuli according to gender, for that reason we preferred to use only one gender for all experiments. We chose males to maximize our chances to detect microglial effects in this initial study, as according to previous works the male microglia have higher motility capacity than female microglia (Lenz, Neuroscientist 2014) and male microglia are more prone to inflammatory activation than female microglia (Villa et al., 2018).

Spines living for less than 2 hours were classified as transient. To show a clear separation between categories, a cumulative stability percentage curve during the 2 hours was computed. For this purpose, the stability of each type of spine or bouton, was measured as the cumulative lifetime that each spine or bouton remained visible at each time point divided by the value of the timepoint, expressed in %.

This information is added in subsection “Surgery and in vivo two-photon imaging”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
