Mutations in the α2 helix of the motor domain of KIF22 have been identified in patients with abnormal skeletal development, and we report the identification of a patient with a novel mutation in the KIF22 tail. We demonstrate that pathogenic mutations do not result in a loss of KIF22’s functions in early mitosis. Instead, mutations disrupt chromosome segregation in anaphase, resulting in reduced proliferation, abnormal daughter cell nuclear morphology, and, in a subset of cells, cytokinesis failure. This phenotype could be explained by a failure of KIF22 to inactivate in anaphase. Consistent with this model, constitutive activation of the motor via a known site of phosphoregulation in the tail phenocopied the effects of pathogenic mutations. These results suggest that the motor domain α2 helix may be an important site for regulation of KIF22 activity at the metaphase to anaphase transition. In support of this conclusion, mimicking phosphorylation of α2 helix residue T158 also prevents inactivation of KIF22 in anaphase. These findings demonstrate the importance of both the head and tail of the motor in regulating the activity of KIF22 and offer insight into the cellular consequences of preventing KIF22 inactivation and disrupting force balance in anaphase.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromokinesin</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>mitotic spindle</kwd><kwd>KIF22</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AR074887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Alex F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM130556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stumpff</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM121491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stumpff</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM144133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stumpff</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pathogenic mutations in KIF22, which dominantly cause bone dysplasia, improperly activate the motor during anaphase in dividing cells leading to chromosome recongression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitosis requires mechanisms that mechanically control chromosome movements to ensure equal segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells. Forces that move mitotic chromosomes are generated by microtubule dynamics within the mitotic spindle and by molecular motor proteins. The chromokinesin KIF22 (or Kid, kinesin-like DNA-binding protein) is a plus-end directed member of the kinesin-10 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yajima et al., 2003</xref>). KIF22 and its orthologs, including Nod (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 1990</xref>) and Xkid (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Funabiki and Murray, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takagi et al., 2013</xref>), generate forces that move chromosomes away from the spindle poles. Structurally, KIF22 contains a conserved kinesin motor domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tokai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yajima et al., 2003</xref>), a second microtubule-binding domain in the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>), a predicted coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>), and a C-terminal DNA binding domain, which includes a helix-hairpin-helix motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tokai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Precisely how KIF22’s force generating activity is regulated in mitotic cells and how this regulation contributes to spindle function and cell viability remains incompletely understood.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of a novel pathogenic mutation in the tail of KIF22.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the domains of KIF22 with pathogenic mutations in the motor domain (magenta) and coiled-coil domain (yellow) indicated.

As cells enter mitosis, chromosomes condense and KIF22 binds along chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levesque and Compton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tokai et al., 1996</xref>). In prometaphase, chromosomes must congress and align at the center of the spindle. The interactions of the KIF22 motor domain with spindle microtubules and the KIF22 tail with chromosome arms allow the motor to generate polar ejection forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brouhard and Hunt, 2005</xref>), which push the arms of chromosomes away from the spindle poles and toward the center of the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marshall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rieder and Salmon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rieder et al., 1986</xref>), contributing to chromosome congression in prometaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iemura and Tanaka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levesque and Compton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wandke et al., 2012</xref>), as well as chromosome arm orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levesque and Compton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wandke et al., 2012</xref>). In metaphase, polar ejection forces also contribute to chromosome oscillation and alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Funabiki and Murray, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levesque and Compton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Levesque et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stumpff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takagi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tokai-Nishizumi et al., 2005</xref>). Purified KIF22 is monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yajima et al., 2003</xref>), and the forces generated by KIF22 on chromosomes arms may represent the collective action of many monomers. In anaphase, KIF22 is inactivated to reduce polar ejection forces and allow chromosomes to segregate toward the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Su et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wolf et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The generation of polar ejection forces by KIF22 is regulated by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)/cyclin B, which is high in prometa- and metaphase, and drops sharply at the metaphase to anaphase transition when cyclin B is degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hershko, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan, 1995</xref>). KIF22 is phosphorylated by CDK1/cyclin B at T463, a residue in the tail of the motor between the second microtubule-binding and coiled-coil domains. Phosphorylation of T463 is required for polar ejection force generation in prometa- and metaphase, and dephosphorylation of T463 is necessary for the suspension of polar ejection forces to allow chromosome segregation in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>). Although a reduction of polar ejection forces in anaphase is a necessary step for proper anaphase chromosome segregation, it is not clear how this contributes to a shift in force balance within the spindle at the metaphase to anaphase transition. Furthermore, while several regions of the KIF22 tail are known to contribute to KIF22’s inactivation as cells transition to anaphase, how motor activity is downregulated has not been resolved. Phosphoproteomic studies have identified sites of phosphorylation within KIF22’s α2 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rigbolt et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting this region, in addition to the tail, may also be important for the regulation of motor activity.</p><p>The study of pathogenic mutations can often provide insight into the regulation and function of cellular proteins. Mutations in KIF22 cause the developmental disorder spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity, leptodactylic type (SEMDJL2, also referred to as Hall Type or lepto-SEMDJL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Min et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tüysüz et al., 2015</xref>). Four point mutations in two amino acids have been reported in SEMDJL2 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Min et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tüysüz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These mutations occur in adjacent residues P148 and R149 in the α2 helix of the KIF22 motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). P148 and R149 are conserved in kinesin-10 family members across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and in many human members of the kinesin superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, no pathogenic mutations in the homologous proline or arginine residues have been recorded in OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://omim.org/">https://omim.org/</ext-link>). All identified patients are heterozygous for a single mutation in KIF22. Mutations in KIF22 dominantly cause SEMDJL2, and patients with both de novo and inherited mutations have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Min et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although KIF22 mRNA is expressed throughout the body (Human Protein Atlas; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">http://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>), the effects of these mutations are largely tissue-specific, and the development of the skeletal system is most affected in SEMDJL2 patients. A primary symptom of SEMDJL2 is short stature, resulting from shortening of both the trunk and the limbs. Additionally, patients presented with joint laxity, midface hypoplasia, scoliosis, and leptodactyly, a narrowing of the fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Min et al., 2011</xref>). In very young children with SEMDJL2, the softness of the cartilage in the larynx and trachea caused respiratory issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2011</xref>). Growth plate radiology demonstrated delayed maturation of the metaphyses and epiphyses in SEMDJL2 patients, and symptoms became more pronounced as patients aged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tüysüz et al., 2015</xref>). Leptodactyly, specifically, was only observed in older (young adult) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Pathogenic mutations in the KIF22 motor domain were predicted to be loss of function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Min et al., 2011</xref>). However, KIF22 knockout in mice did not affect skeletal development. Loss of KIF22 was lethal early in embryogenesis for approximately 50% of embryos, but mice that survived past this point developed to adulthood and demonstrated no gross abnormalities or pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ohsugi et al., 2003</xref>). As such, the cellular mechanism by which mutations in KIF22 affect development is unknown.</p><p>Here, we characterize an additional patient with a mutation in KIF22 and assess the effect of previously reported and novel pathogenic mutations on the function of KIF22 in mitosis. We demonstrate that mutations are not loss of function mutations, and do not alter the localization of the motor or the generation of polar ejection forces in prometaphase. Instead, mutations disrupt anaphase chromosome segregation, consistent with continued KIF22 activation and consequent polar ejection force generation in anaphase. Defects in anaphase chromosome segregation affect daughter cell nuclear morphology and, in a subset of cells, prevent cytokinesis. These findings demonstrate that anaphase inactivation of KIF22 is critical for daughter cell fitness. As such, mitotic defects may contribute to pathogenesis in patients with KIF22 mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that aberrant polar ejection force generation in anaphase primarily affects the segregation of chromosomes by limiting chromosome arm movements in anaphase A and spindle pole separation in anaphase B, offering insight into the balance of forces required for accurate chromosome segregation in anaphase. Finally, we demonstrate that mimicking phosphorylation of T158 in the α2 helix disrupts anaphase chromosome segregation, confirming that the region of the motor domain affected by SEMDJL2 mutations also contributes to the mechanism by which KIF22 is inactivated in anaphase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel mutation in KIF22 affects development</title><p>We report the identification and characterization of a patient with a novel mutation in KIF22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The patient is a 15-year-old male with a history of short stature, cryptorchidism and shawl scrotum, minimal scoliosis, secondary enuresis, and skin hyperpigmentation. He presented for evaluation at 9 years of age. At that time, his height was just below 3% of age, weight was at 40% of age, and BMI was 82% of age. He was noted to have relative macrocephaly, with a head circumference at 93% of age. He had a broad forehead and hypertelorism, round face, flaring of eyebrows, and ankyloglossia. He also had mild brachydactyly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). He had a history of short stature since infancy, but followed a trajectory close to the third percentile.

Indeed, plotting the distance between chromosome masses 7 min after anaphase onset against mean GFP intensity for each HeLa-Kyoto cell demonstrated that these two values were correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient –0.6246, one-tailed p-value&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This result is consistent with the published observation that causing chromosome recongression by preventing cyclin B1 degradation can result in cytokinesis failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wolf et al., 2006</xref>). In cells expressing KIF22-GFP with pathogenic mutations, cleavage furrow ingression began, but did not complete, resulting in a single daughter cell. The percentage of cells failing to complete cytokinesis was approximately tenfold higher in cells expressing mutant KIF22-GFP (R149Q 36%, V475G 25%) than in cells expressing wild-type KIF22-GFP (3%). Additionally, the distance between chromosome masses at the time of cleavage furrow ingression was reduced in cells expressing KIF22-GFP R149Q or V475G, suggesting that the position of the chromosome masses may be physically obstructing cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, cells that failed to complete cytokinesis tended to have lower distances between chromosome masses than the distances measured in cells in which cytokinesis completed despite the expression of mutant KIF22-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video4" xlink:href="elife-78653-video4.mp4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Cytokinesis and cytokinesis failure.</title><p>Mitosis and cytokinesis in HeLa-Kyoto cells expressing KIF22-GFP (left), KIF22-GFP R149Q (middle), or KIF22-GFP V475G (right) (all KIF22-GFP represented in green) and mCh-CAAX (magenta).

To test whether the activity of mutant KIF22 in anaphase affects one or both of these processes, anaphase was imaged in HeLa-Kyoto cells expressing fluorescent markers for the poles (pericentrin-RFP) and centromeres (CENPB-mCh) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The percentage of divisions resulting in nuclear morphology defects was approximately tenfold higher than in control cells (KIF22-GFP 6%, KIF22-GFP R149Q 64%, and KIF22-GFP V475G 68%) when live divisions were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Solidity values were reduced in cells expressing KIF22-GFP with pathogenic mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that these cells had more irregularly shaped nuclei.

For these purposes, only data from the first 48 hr of the proliferation assay were used, as cell growth rates plateaued after this time point. The doubling time of control HeLa-Kyoto cells expressing GFP was calculated to be 20.72 hr in these experiments, which is consistent with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Using this doubling rate, assuming exponential growth, and assuming every cell divides, the normalized cell count at 48 hr (normalized to a starting cell count of 1) was predicted to be 4.98. This is close to the experimental 48 hr cell count for control cells (4.60), and higher than the experimental 48 hr cell count for cells expressing KIF22-GFP R149Q (3.13) or V475G (3.60), as these cell lines have reduced proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, square). If one assumed that cells with abnormally shaped nuclei stop dividing, given that approximately 60% of mutant KIF22-GFP cell divisions result in abnormally shaped nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), the predicted cell count at 48 hr would be 2.18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, triangle). This is lower than the experimental cell count for cells expressing mutant KIF22-GFP, suggesting that cells with abnormally shaped nuclei must be capable of additional divisions. If, instead, one assumed that only cells that fail cytokinesis (30% of cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) stop dividing, the predicted cell count would be 3.42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, diamond). This value is consistent with the experimental 48 hr cell count for cells expressing KIF22-GFP with pathogenic mutations (3.13–3.60), suggesting the rate of cytokinesis failure may limit the rate of proliferation in these cells. Consistent with this possibility, an increased number of large cells that may have failed cytokinesis are visible in proliferation assay images at 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, we note that both nuclear morphology defects and cytokinesis failure may contribute to the measured reduction in proliferation.</p><p>To test the prediction that cells with nuclear morphology defects are capable of division, KIF22-GFP expression was induced approximately 24 hr before imaging to generate a population of cells with abnormally shaped nuclei. Division of these cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), demonstrating that nuclear morphology defects do not prevent subsequent divisions. The percentage of cells that divided over the course of this experiment was not reduced in cells expressing KIF22-GFP with pathogenic mutations despite the abnormal nuclear morphology of cells in those populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Mimicking phosphorylation of T463 phenocopies pathogenic mutations</title><p>The phenotypes observed in cells expressing KIF22-GFP with pathogenic mutations suggest that mutations may prevent inactivation of KIF22 in anaphase, and that polar ejection forces in anaphase disrupt chromosome segregation. If this is the case, then preventing KIF22 inactivation would be predicted to phenocopy the pathogenic mutations. One mechanism by which KIF22 activity is controlled is phosphorylation of T463: phosphorylation of this tail residue is necessary for polar ejection force generation, and dephosphorylation at anaphase onset contributes to polar ejection force suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we generated HeLa-Kyoto inducible cell lines expressing KIF22-GFP with phosphomimetic (T463D) and phosphonull (T463A) mutations to test whether preventing KIF22 inactivation in anaphase by expressing the constitutively active T463D construct phenocopies the expression of KIF22-GFP with pathogenic mutations. When treated with doxycycline, these cells expressed phosphomimetic and phosphonull KIF22-GFP at levels comparable to those seen in cell lines expressing KIF22-GFP with pathogenic mutations, which was approximately two- to threefold higher than the level of expression of endogenous KIF22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).</p><p>To assess the activity of KIF22-GFP T463D and T463A in HeLa cells, polar ejection force generation in monopolar spindles was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In cells with endogenous KIF22 present, expression of KIF22-GFP T463D increased the distance from the spindle pole to the maximum DAPI signal (GFP control 3.7±0.07 μm, KIF22-GFP T463D 4.4±0.12, mean ± SEM), indicating increased polar ejection forces, consistent with phosphorylation of T463 activating KIF22 in prometaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Conversely, when endogenous KIF22 was depleted, expression of KIF22-GFP T463A was less able to rescue polar ejection force generation (distance from the spindle pole to the maximum DAPI signal 3.0±0.08 μm, mean ± SEM) than expression of wild-type KIF22-GFP (3.6±0.07 μm) or KIF22-GFP T463D (3.7±0.10 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Again, this is consistent with previous work demonstrating that KIF22 phosphorylation at T463 activates the motor for prometaphase polar ejection force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>), although the reduction in polar ejection forces seen with KIF22-GFP T463A rescue is less severe in our system, possibly due to differences in cell type, level of depletion of endogenous KIF22, or the method used to quantify polar ejection forces.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Phosphomimetic mutation of T463 phenocopies pathogenic mutations in KIF22.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence images of monopolar HeLa-Kyoto cells.

Wild-type KIF22 is inactivated in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>), resulting in an attenuation of polar ejection forces, which allows chromosomes to move toward the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). The phenotypes we observe in cells expressing KIF22-GFP with pathogenic mutations are consistent with KIF22 remaining active in anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Polar ejection forces could cause recongression by continuing to push chromosomes away from the spindle poles during anaphase A and disrupting spindle elongation during anaphase B. These forces result in aberrant positioning of chromosomes during telophase and cytokinesis, which could cause the nuclear morphology defects and cytokinesis failure we observe in cells expressing mutant KIF22-GFP. Consistent with this model, mimicking phosphorylation of T463 to prevent KIF22 inactivation in anaphase phenocopies the effects of pathogenic mutations. Thus, we conclude that pathogenic mutations result in a gain of KIF22 function, which aligns with findings that KIF22 mutations are dominant in heterozygous patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Min et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tüysüz et al., 2015</xref>).

Additionally, mimicking phosphorylation of T158 in the motor domain or T463 in the tail also disrupts chromosome segregation. These findings demonstrate that the motor domain α2 helix participates in the process of KIF22 inactivation, adding to studies that demonstrate that deletion of the tail microtubule-binding domain and deletion or disruption of the coiled-coil domain prevent the inactivation of KIF22 in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>). Phosphorylation of KIF22 T158 has been detected in mitotic cells, but the relative phosphorylation levels of this residue at different times in mitosis are not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>). Further studies are needed to determine the time course of T158 phosphorylation, whether this phosphorylation regulates KIF22 function in mitosis, and if T158 and T463 phosphorylation control KIF22 activity independently or via the same mechanism.</p><p>The physical mechanism of KIF22 inactivation is unknown, and our results can be interpreted in the context of several models, which are not mutually exclusive. Previous work has proposed that the tail of KIF22 may interact with microtubules to suspend polar ejection force generation, as KIF22 inactivation requires the tail second microtubule-binding and coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>). Mimicking phosphorylation of T463 disrupts inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>). Dephosphorylation of T463 could facilitate tail-microtubule interaction, or charge change at T463 could disrupt the structure of the microtubule-binding or coiled-coil domains. The interaction between the tail of KIF22 and the microtubule may not be strong or long-lasting, as deletion of the tail microtubule-binding domain does not alter the velocity of KIF22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>), and KIF22 tail fragments containing the second microtubule-binding domain do not localize to spindle microtubules. In the framework of a tail-microtubule interaction inactivating KIF22, the mutation in the tail (V745G) could disrupt anaphase chromosome segregation by altering this interaction with microtubules. Whether or how the α2 helix could contribute to this mechanism is less clear. The α2 helix faces away from the surface of the microtubule, and we would not predict that mutations in this structure would directly alter the association of the motor domain with the microtubule. It is possible that this region of the motor domain could facilitate or strengthen an interaction between the tail and the microtubule surface indirectly.</p><p>Alternatively, given that mutations in the tail and motor domain of KIF22 both disrupt chromosome segregation, the tail and motor domain may interact to inactivate the motor. Head-tail autoinhibition is a known regulatory mechanism of other members of the kinesin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blasius et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Espeut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman and Vale, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hammond et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammond et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Imanishi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Verhey and Hammond, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Verhey et al., 1998</xref>), and disruption of autoinhibition can be a mechanism of disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asselin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blasius et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pant et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">van der Vaart et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations in either the tail or motor domain could disrupt this interaction, preventing KIF22 inactivation in anaphase. Dephosphorylation of both T463 in the tail and T158 in the motor domain could facilitate this interaction. Co-IP experiments did not demonstrate an interaction between the motor domain and tail of KIF22 under the conditions of our assays. However, it is possible that a transient head-tail interaction may not be detectable by IP. Thus, further studies are needed to rule out an inactivating interaction between these domains.</p><p>Rather than physically interacting with the motor domain, it is also possible that structural changes in the tail of KIF22 could have allosteric effects on the motor domain. An allosteric mechanism by which conformational changes are propagated down the stalk to the motor domain has recently been proposed to contribute to the inactivation of kinesin-1 motors by kinesin light chain, which binds the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiba et al., 2021</xref>). KIF22 inactivation may be caused by altered motor domain mechanochemistry, which changes in the tail could affect allosterically and modification of α2 could affect directly. This could explain the effect of tail and motor domain mutations, as well as the effects of mimicking tail and motor domain phosphorylation, on KIF22 activity.</p><p>An additional consideration is that pathogenic mutations may affect the inactivation of KIF22 in anaphase by altering phosphoregulation of KIF22 activity. If mutations prevented the dephosphorylation of T158 and T463 in anaphase this could cause anaphase recongression. However, addition of a phosphonull T463A mutation to KIF22 with coiled-coil or microtubule-binding domain deletions does not rescue anaphase chromosome recongression defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the role of the KIF22 tail in motor inactivation is not only to facilitate dephosphorylation of T463. Future studies using structural approaches will be required to distinguish between possible mechanisms of KIF22 inactivation.</p><p>The regulation of the motor domain α2 helix in KIF22 inactivation may inform our understanding of additional kinesin motors, as amino acids P148 and R149 are conserved in a number of members of the kinesin superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, phosphorylation or acetylation of amino acids in the α2 helix has been reported for members of the kinesin-3 (KIF13A S134) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>), kinesin-5 (KIF11 Y125, K146) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bickel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choudhary et al., 2009</xref>), kinesin-6 (KIF20B S182 and KIF23 S125) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hegemann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shiromizu et al., 2013</xref>), and kinesin-14 (KIFC3 S557) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>) families. Phosphorylation of Y125 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bickel et al., 2017</xref>) and acetylation of K146 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muretta et al., 2018</xref>) in KIF11 (Eg5) have been shown to modulate motor activity, and the functions of the remaining reported post-translation modifications in the α2 helix are yet to be characterized. Acetylation of KIF11 at K146 increases the stall force of the motor and slows anaphase spindle pole separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muretta et al., 2018</xref>). This post-translational modification represents a mechanism by which the activity of KIF11 could be regulated at the metaphase to anaphase transition to generate sliding forces for spindle assembly in prometaphase and control spindle pole separation in anaphase, analogous to how post-translational modifications of KIF22 regulate motor activity to ensure both chromosome congression and alignment in prometaphase and chromosome segregation in anaphase.</p><p>While chromosomes in some cells, particularly those expressing KIF22-GFP at high levels, completely failed to segregate and decondensed in the center of the spindle, most cells demonstrated chromosome recongression wherein poleward motion of chromosomes begins, but then chromosomes switch direction and move anti-poleward. These dynamics may be due to differences in microtubule density closer to the poles compared to the center of the spindle. This model is consistent with work demonstrating that in monopolar spindles, poleward movement of chromosomes is limited by chromosomes reaching a threshold density of microtubules at which polar ejection forces are sufficient to cause chromosomes to switch to anti-poleward movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cassimeris et al., 1994</xref>). We observed that chromosomes on the periphery of the spindle remain closer to the poles while central chromosomes are pushed further away from the poles during recongression in cells expressing KIF22-GFP with pathogenic mutations. This could also be explained by the central chromosomes encountering a higher density of microtubules, and KIF22 bound to these chromosomes therefore generating higher levels of polar ejection forces. In addition, this mechanism is consistent with observations that oscillations of peripheral chromosomes are reduced compared to chromosomes at the center of the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cameron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Civelekoglu-Scholey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stumpff et al., 2008</xref>), which could also be explained by reduced peripheral microtubule density limiting peripheral polar ejection force generation.</p><p>Our assessment of the relative trajectories of chromosomes, centromeres, and spindle poles offers insight into the relative magnitudes of polar ejection forces and other anaphase forces. Expression of KIF22-GFP with pathogenic mutations did not alter the distance between centromeres and spindle poles, indicating that while anaphase polar ejection forces altered the position of chromosome arms within the spindle, these forces were not sufficient to prevent the shortening of k-fibers. However, the expression of mutant KIF22-GFP did alter the movements of the spindle poles, allowing assessment of the relative magnitude of polar ejection forces compared to the forces generated by the sliding of antiparallel spindle microtubules to separate the spindle poles in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brust-Mascher et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nislow et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sawin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Straight et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Heesbeen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vukušić et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vukušić et al., 2021</xref>). In cells expressing mutant KIF22-GFP, spindle pole separation stalled, and poles moved closer to one another during anaphase chromosome recongression. This suggests that the polar ejection forces collectively generated by mutant KIF22 motors are of greater magnitude than the forces sliding the spindle poles apart during anaphase B. Although it is important to note that this phenotype was observed with moderate overexpression of mutant KIF22, the observed effects on spindle pole separation underscore the importance of KIF22 inactivation, and imply that reducing polar ejection forces is required for both anaphase A and anaphase B. This force balance may differ between cell types, as tail domain deletions that alter chromosome movements do not disrupt anaphase B in mouse oocyte meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Patients with mutations in KIF22 exhibit defects in skeletal development. The pathology observed in the patient heterozygous for the V475G mutation differs from those seen in SEMDJL2 patients with motor domain mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Min et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tüysüz et al., 2015</xref>). However, a meaningful comparison of pathologies between patients is limited both by the fact that only a single patient with a mutation in the tail of KIF22 has been identified, and by the considerable variation in clinical presentation between patients with motor domain mutations, even between patients with the same point mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Min et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tüysüz et al., 2015</xref>). The defects in chromosome segregation we observed in cells expressing mutant KIF22-GFP may contribute to skeletal developmental pathogenesis. Mutations could cause reduced proliferation of growth plate chondrocytes, which in turn could limit bone growth. Disrupting cytokinesis in the growth plate causes shorter bones and stature in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gan et al., 2019</xref>), and mutations in KIF22 could affect development via this mechanism. The presence of pathologies in other cartilaginous tissues, including the larynx and trachea, in patients with mutations in the motor domain of KIF22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2011</xref>) is also consistent with a disease etiology based in aberrant chondrocyte proliferation. Defects in mitosis could result in tissue-specific patient pathology based on differences in force balance within anaphase spindles in different cell types arising from different expression or activity levels of mitotic force generators or regulators. Growth plate chondrocytes, particularly, are organized into columns and must divide under geometric constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dodds, 1930</xref>), which could increase sensitivity to anaphase force imbalances. Additionally, we cannot exclude the possibility that these mutations may affect the function of interphase cells, which could affect development via a mechanism independent from the effects of the mutations on mitosis. Future work will be required to distinguish among these possible explanations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient assessment</title><p>Clinical exome sequencing was performed by the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, USA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cousin et al., 2019</xref>).

Background-subtracted intensities were normalized to the intensity of the first frame imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Polar ejection force assay</title><p>HeLa-Kyoto cells were treated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline to induce expression and transfected with control or KIF22 siRNA approximately 24 hr prior to fixation. Cells were arrested in 100 μM monastrol (Selleckchem #S8439) for 2–3 hr before fixation. Monopolar mitotic cells oriented perpendicular to the coverslip were imaged at the focal plane of the spindle pole for polar ejection force measurements. A circular ROI with a 12.5 μm radius was centered around the spindle pole of each cell, and the radial profile of DAPI signal intensity at distances from the pole was measured (Radial Profile Plot plugin; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/radial-profile.html">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/radial-profile.html</ext-link>). The distance from the pole to the maximum DAPI signal was calculated for each cell as a measure of relative polar ejection forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thompson et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analyses of anaphase chromosome segregation</title><p>HeLa-Kyoto or RPE-1 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline to induce expression approximately 18 hr before imaging. For HeLa-Kyoto cells, media ~ exchanged to CO<sub>2</sub>-indpendent media containing 2 μg/ml doxycycline and 100 nM SiR-Tubulin (Spirochrome #SC002) approximately 1–1.5 hr before imaging. For RPE-1 cells, media were exchanged to CO<sub>2</sub>-indpendent media containing 2 μg/ml doxycycline, 20–100 nM SiR-Tubulin (Spirochrome #SC002), and 10 μM verapamil (Spirochrome #SCV01) approximately 1.5–3 hr before imaging. Cells were imaged at 1-min time intervals. Distances between segregating chromosome masses were measured by plotting the KIF22-GFP signal intensity along a line drawn through both spindle poles (macro available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/StumpffLab/Image-Analysis">https://github.com/StumpffLab/Image-Analysis</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stumpff, 2021</xref>). This data set was split at the center distance to generate two plots, each representing one half-spindle/segregating chromosome mass. The distance between the maximum of each intensity plot was calculated using MATLAB (MathWorks, version R2018a) (script available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/StumpffLab/Image-Analysis">https://github.com/StumpffLab/Image-Analysis</ext-link>). To assess the broadness of segregating chromosome masses in cells expressing KIF22-GFP T463A, a Gaussian curve was fit to the same intensity plots and the full width at half maximum was calculated in MATLAB.</p><p>To measure the movements of spindle poles and kinetochores in anaphase, HeLa-Kyoto cells were seeded in glass-bottom 24-well plates (Cellvis #P24-1.5H-N) and cotransfected with PCM-RFP and mCh-CENPB using Lipofectamine LTX (Thermo Fisher Scientific #15338100) approximately 24 hr before imaging. Cells were treated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline to induce expression approximately 12–18 hr before imaging. Cells were imaged at 20-s time intervals. To more clearly visualize spindle poles and kinetochores, images of PCM-RFP and mCh-CENPB signal were background subtracted by duplicating each frame, applying a Gaussian blur (Sigma-Aldrich 30 pixels), and subtracting this blurred image from the original. For each frame, a line was drawn between spindle poles (PCM-RFP signal) to measure the distance between them, and the intensity of KIF22-GFP and mCh-CENPB along this line was plotted. These data sets were split at the center distance to generate two plots, and the distance between plot maxima and the distance from maxima to the spindle poles were calculated using MATLAB (scripts available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/StumpffLab/Image-Analysis">https://github.com/StumpffLab/Image-Analysis</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Assessment of cytokinesis failure</title><p>To visualize cell boundaries, HeLa-Kyoto cells were transfected with mCh-CAAX using Lipofectamine LTX approximately 24–32 hr before imaging and treated with 2 μg/ml doxycycline approximately 8 hr before imaging.

Automated bright field imaging using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) (4× Plan Fluorite 0.13 NA objective; Olympus) driven by Gen5 software (BioTek) was used to measure cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marquis et al., 2021</xref>). Images were collected every 4 hr for 96 hr. Gen5 software was used to process images and count the number of cells in each imaged field. Cell counts were normalized to the cell count in the first image acquired at time 0. Only wells with first frame cell counts between 10,000 and 20,000 were analyzed to account for the effects of cell density. Fold change at 96 hr was calculated by dividing the cell count at 96 hr by the cell count at time 0. Predicted cell counts at 48 hr were calculated using an experimentally determined doubling time of 20.72 hr for the control case where all cells divide (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>20.72</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>), the case where nuclear morphology defects limit proliferation and 60% of cells do not divide (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1.4</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>20.72</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>), and the case where cytokinesis<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> failure limits proliferation and 30% of cells do not divide (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1.7</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>20.72</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc), version 9.2.0.

However the reviewers thought the paper was very strong and with a little bit more biochemical experiments to dissect the function of the mutations on the motor and motor-tail regulation, this paper would be a good candidate for e<italic>Life</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Thompson and colleagues characterize the pathogenic mutations in Kif22, some of which previously identified in patients and a new patient reported here. Using cell biology and quantitative image analysis, they show that polar ejection forces during mitosis are not compromised in the various mutants. Instead the mutants appear to cause defects in anaphase in nuclear envelope reformation and envelope solidty, separation of chromosomes and separation of the spindles. The reported phenotype is similar to that of CDK1-phosphomimetic Kif22. The phosphorylated state of kif22 has been previoulsy shown to be inactivated by dephosphorylation. Overall, this work supports a dominant negative mechanism of action of Kif22, where polar ejection forces need to be inactivated at the metaphase to anaphase transition to ensure completion of cell division and cytokinesis. The manuscript is well written and the figures are of high quality.</p><p>Based on human genetics, some cell types are more reliant than others on this inactivation. One drawback of this work presented here is that is uses HeLa cells rather than chondrocytes and speculate these cells would be the ones affected by the mutations. But the cell model already provides insights into the potential cause of Kif22 mutation related disorder. A outstanding question here is whether polar ejection forces mediated by Kid are linearly correlated with motor levels and activity. Would distinct levels of expression correlate with how far the chromosomes are ejected? Where maximal activity of the motor would correspond to maximal ejection? Another point is whether the region mutated normally regulates the motor activity? This would support their hypothesis.</p><p>The prediction method of pathogenicity is not well explained. Is there a pathogenic score associated the predicted phenotype for each predictor? Can the phenotype be better quantified and documented? It is hard to understand the x-ray pictures.</p><p>Some of the P-values are difficult to read, because there are so many bars on the graph. Figure S1D: can the scale be adjuted so we see a difference between the sample? They all look close to 0 so p-value not meaningful. Same with data presentation of Figure 1B.</p><p>Specify number of cells analyzed for each condition rather than give a range.</p><p>How is the motor activated and switched off? Does the region where mutations occur bind to the motor domains?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This work identified a novel pathogenic mutation of kinesin KIF22 and characterized it together with the two previously known mutations associated with a developmental disorder spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMDJL2). The data revealed that these mutations disrupt inactivation of KIF22-mediated polar ejection forces (PEFs) in anaphase, leading to defects in chromosome segregation that disrupt cytokinesis in a subset of cells and consequently reduce the overall cell proliferation.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study that addresses an important question and offers an explanation for the role of KIF22 mutations in developmental disorders. The conclusions are well supported by the data, however some aspects have limited novelty and could be better discussed in light of previous literature. The study would benefit of a more mechanistic insight into how the described mutations prevent motor inactivation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study identified and characterized a novel pathogenic mutation in KIF22 and offered an explanation for the role of KIF22 mutations in developmental disorders. The work relies on a thorough experimental design accompanied with rigorous controls that included generation of multiple stable inducible cell lines, high quality quantification of cell phenotypes and detailed analysis of protein/mutants activity, localization and dynamics.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The work would need to be better discussed in light of previous literature. The first study showing that anaphase chromosomes recongress due to a failed inactivation of CDK1 and KIF22 has not been discussed in the context of presented data (Wolf et al., EMBO J 2006). Also, the effect of V475G mutant is not surprising, knowing that mutating 7 amino-acids within the same region (including V475) resulted in a similar anaphase recongression phenotype (Soeda et al., JCS 2016). The results of those two studies have indicated that PEFs, if not inactivated, are stronger than microtubule-sliding forces.</p><p>Some experiments were performed with a low cell number. For example, in Figure 5 only 2-3 cells were used per each of 3 independent experiments.

The main findings are that localisation, binding kinetics and generation of polar ejection forces during prometaphase are unaltered when comparing KIF22 mutants to the wildtype motor. However, cells expressing disease-causing mutants of KIF22 show defects in chromosome segregation due to a lack of inactivation of polar ejection forces during anaphase. This results in re-congression and in a significant subset of cells in cytokinesis failure and abnormal nuclear shape. All experiments have been conducted in HeLa cells with five different mutations, robustly quantified and reproduced in RPE1 cells with two key mutations. The authors then recapitulate the defects with a phosphomimetic T463D mutation, as phosphorylation of T463 has been shown previously to be required for generating polar ejection forces, and dephosphorylation at this residue was implicated in switching KIF22 off during anaphase. All mutations acted dominant in the experiment and also in patients, consistent with finding a gain-of-function defect. The finding that mutations in the motor domain and the tail cause similar defects suggests that an interaction of motor domain and tail might be involved in switching off KIF22's polar ejection force generation at the onset of anaphase and thus offers a testable hypothesis for future studies.</p><p>As the idea that polar ejection force needs to be switched off during anaphase is not new, the impact of the study for understanding cell division is somewhat limited. The authors discuss possible mechanisms why mutations in the motor domain and the tail show similar effects, but no experiments have been included to test these ideas. For example, testing for the proposed interaction of motor domain and tail domain would be a relatively straightforward biochemistry experiment and offer additional mechanistic insights that would increase the impact of the paper and also enable providing an explanation why these specific mutations cause disease if such motor-tail interactions would be reduced in the presence of the mutations.</p><p>While the paper shows that defects occur only in anaphase, localisation and turnover have only been analysed in metaphase. It would make sense to compare localisation and turnover in anaphase. This might also offer some insights into the switching off mechanism.</p><p>There isn't currently an explanation why such defects in cell division cause tissue-specific defects in skeletal development as cell division was investigated here only with cell types not involved in bone growth. As the manuscripts describes a new patient, I wonder whether the authors have access to biopsies that might allow showing nuclear deformations in patient tissue and whether this occurs in a tissue-specific manner.</p><p>Most cell biologists won't be familiar with normal bone images. Thus it would be valuable to add control images from a healthy person of similar age to illustrate the patient symptoms in (Figure 1F,G).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Pathogenic mutations in the chromokinesin KIF22 disrupt anaphase chromosome segregation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I appreciate their efforts to address the mechanism underlying the motor inactivation and find the discussion part covering that topic largely improved. The added experiments exploring the phosphoregulation of the α-2 helix show that the mutation-bearing region regulates motor activity. This is an important finding that significantly improves the manuscript. All my concerns were properly addressed and I recommend the revised manuscript for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This revised manuscript investigates the functional consequences of KIF22 mutations appearing in human pathologies during cell division. The authors conclude that these mutations do not affect the ability of KIF22 to generate a polar ejection force, but rather prevent the inactivation of KIf22 at anaphase onset, resulting in chromosome recongression, and in the extreme case to cytokinesis failure due to chromosomes masses in the site of cell division.</p><p>The study investigates an interesting link between a human pathology and a cell biology mechanism. It is therefore novel and original and of interest to a wider public. The cell biology scope of the study remains limited, since the fact that KIF22 must be inactivated at anaphase onset to prevent chromosome segregation defects, was already known. The weakness of the paper is that beyond this tight correlation between pathological mutations and anaphase defects, the authors do not offer major mechanistic advances in the inactivation mechanisms of KIF22, a point that remains unaddressed even after the revision work.</p><p>Indeed, even though the authors have done a good job at addressing many of the points of the reviewers, they could not obtain a major mechanistic understanding in how the α-2-helix of Kif22 or could be involved in the inactivation of KIF22. The additional characterization of the T463 mutation offers more support for a role of the coiled-coil domain, but I am not convinced that the presented data prove that this threonine must dephosphorylated to allow inactivation of KIF22: there is no direct evidence that this site is differentially phosphorylated during mitosis (Prometaphase and metaphase vs. Anaphase), and the Alanine mutant is fully functional, indicating that loss of this putative phosphorylation site is not sufficient to induce inactivation. Therefore it is equally possible that introduction of a charge disrupts the structure of the coiled-coil domain, thus mimicking the deletion of this domain.</p><p>Finally, I would suggest that the authors are more cautious when interpreting the cell proliferation data. The authors assume in their model two extreme possibilities: either that nuclear architecture defects or that cytokinesis defects are entirely responsible for the reduced proliferation. It could, however, be that both types of defects lead to a slow down of the cell cycle, which would also explain the reduced proliferation rate. If the authors want to claim that cytokinesis failure is the primary reason for a reduced proliferation, they would need to monitor cell populations over long time periods and demonstrate that the cell doubling time of cells with failed cytokinesis is substantially longer than the rest of the population (this is likely, but at this stage not shown).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78653.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, Thompson and colleagues characterize the pathogenic mutations in Kif22, some of which previously identified in patients and a new patient reported here. Using cell biology and quantitative image analysis, they show that polar ejection forces during mitosis are not compromised in the various mutants. Instead the mutants appear to cause defects in anaphase in nuclear envelope reformation and envelope solidty, separation of chromosomes and separation of the spindles. The reported phenotype is similar to that of CDK1-phosphomimetic Kif22. The phosphorylated state of kif22 has been previoulsy shown to be inactivated by dephosphorylation. Overall, this work supports a dominant negative mechanism of action of Kif22, where polar ejection forces need to be inactivated at the metaphase to anaphase transition to ensure completion of cell division and cytokinesis. The manuscript is well written and the figures are of high quality.</p><p>Based on human genetics, some cell types are more reliant than others on this inactivation. One drawback of this work presented here is that is uses HeLa cells rather than chondrocytes and speculate these cells would be the ones affected by the mutations. But the cell model already provides insights into the potential cause of Kif22 mutation related disorder.</p><p>A outstanding question here is whether polar ejection forces mediated by Kid are linearly correlated with motor levels and activity. Would distinct levels of expression correlate with how far the chromosomes are ejected? Where maximal activity of the motor would correspond to maximal ejection?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question, and measured GFP expression level in cells from which polar ejection force measurements were obtained to answer it. GFP expression level does not correlate with the distance of the chromosomes from the spindle pole in monopolar spindles, suggesting increased expression of wild type or mutant KIF22 does not necessarily lead to increased polar ejection force in prometaphase. These data are presented in Figure 3E (in the presence of endogenous KIF22) and 3F (KIF22 knockdown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another point is whether the region mutated normally regulates the motor activity? This would support their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>This a great question, and one we endeavored to answer by considering whether posttranslational modification of the α-2 helix may regulate KIF22 inactivation, analogous to the reported phosphoregulation of KIF22 inactivation at T463 in the tail (Soeda et al. 2016). We tested the consequences of mimicking the phosphorylation of two α-2 helix residues previously identified in phosphoproteomic screens, T134 and T158.</p><p>Both phosphomimetic and phosphonull mutations at T134 disrupt the localization of KIF22. It accumulates on spindle microtubules, consistent with previous use of T134N as a rigor mutation (Tokai-Nishizumi 2005). This is not consistent with this amino acid regulating KIF22 inactivation. These results are documented in a new figure, Supplemental Figure 6.</p><p>We determined that mimicking phosphorylation of T158 in the α-2 helix does, in fact, phenocopy the effects of both pathogenic mutations and the tail phosphomimetic T463D mutation. Cells expressing KIF22-GFP T158D demonstrate anaphase chromosome recongression and nuclear morphology defects. Importantly, expression of KIF22-T158A does not induce these phenotypes. These results are documented in a new figure, Figure 9. The T158 data suggest that yes, the α-2 helix region where pathogenic mutations were identified does regulate motor activity not only in SEMDJL2 but also outside of the context of human disease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The prediction method of pathogenicity is not well explained.

Does the region where mutations occur bind to the motor domains?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the question of how KIF22 is inactivated is a very interesting one. In response to reviewer comments, we tested whether we could observe an interaction between the motor domain and tail of KIF22.</p><p>To do this, we built a cell line with inducible expression of a GFP-tagged KIF22 motor domain construct (amino acids 1-383) and built plasmids for transient transfection to express mCherry-tagged KIF22 tail fragments. One mCh-Tail plasmid encoded a shorter construct containing only the described microtubule binding and coiled-coil domains (amino acids 442-506), and one plasmid encoded a slightly longer construct also containing the microtubule binding and coiled-coil tail domains (amino acids 420-520). Both constructs did not include the two nuclear localization signals in the KIF22 tail, and mCh-Tail localized to the cytoplasm in interphase and mitotic cells. Interestingly, no localization to the microtubules was observed in interphase or mitotic cells expressing either mCh-Tail construct, despite the presence of the microtubule binding domain in both.</p><p>We performed co-immunoprecipitations using lysates from cells expressing Motor Domain-GFP and mCh-Tail to test for an interaction between these domains of KIF22. While we were able to IP Motor Domain-GFP or mCh-Tail, we did not observe co-IP of the motor domain with the tail. We performed reciprocal experiments immunoprecipitating either Motor Domain-GFP or mCh-Tail and did not observe co-IP in either case. Additionally, given the role of phosphorylation of tail residue T463 in regulating KIF22 inactivation, we treated cells with the CDK inhibitor RO-3306 to reduce phosphorylation of T463. However, we did not observe co-IP of mCh-Tail with Motor Domain-GFP in lysates from cells treated with the CDK inhibitor.</p><p>These data suggest that a strong, long-lasting physical interaction between the tail and motor domain of KIF22 did not likely occur under the conditions of our assays. However, they do not rule out that such an interaction may be weak or dynamic and, therefore, not detectable using this assay. Similarly, our observation that KIF22 tail fragments do not localize to microtubules in interphase, metaphase, or anaphase are not consistent with the model of microtubule binding-mediated KIF22 inactivation (Soeda et al. 2016). However, the data do not preclude weak or dynamic interactions between the tail and the microtubule surface contributing to the inactivation of KIF22. It is also possible that the presence of the motor domain is necessary for strong interactions of the KIF22 tail with the microtubule surface and consequent motor inactivation.</p><p>Given that our negative IP results cannot rule out an interaction between the tail and motor domain, and the large parameter space that could still be explored to detect a potential interaction (e.g. changes to motor and tail constructs, different buffers, locations of tags) we prefer not to include the IP data in the manuscript. We believe that the reviewers’ suggestion to test the head-tail interaction model was fair. However, our data indicate that this will not be a simple problem to solve. We feel that a study of potential conformational changes to KIF22 at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition is likely worthy of a complete paper and is thus beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>In the revised discussion, we present our data in the context of the previously proposed model for KIF22 inactivation (Soeda et al. 2016) and additionally offer that physical tailmotor domain interactions or allosteric effects of the tail on the motor domain may contribute to the inactivation of KIF22. These models are not mutually exclusive, and our data suggest that regulation of KIF22 activity may not occur via a single, simple mechanism.</p><p>Our work is the first to demonstrate the involvement of the motor domain of KIF22 in inactivation. This conclusion is supported by data indicating that pathogenic mutations in the α-2 helix disrupt inactivation and that mimicking phosphorylation of T158 in the α-2 helix also disrupts inactivation. Further studies of this mechanism will need to consider how the tail, the motor domain, and the microtubules interact to inactivate KIF22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This work identified a novel pathogenic mutation of kinesin KIF22 and characterized it together with the two previously known mutations associated with a developmental disorder spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMDJL2). The data revealed that these mutations disrupt inactivation of KIF22-mediated polar ejection forces (PEFs) in anaphase, leading to defects in chromosome segregation that disrupt cytokinesis in a subset of cells and consequently reduce the overall cell proliferation.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study that addresses an important question and offers an explanation for the role of KIF22 mutations in developmental disorders. The conclusions are well supported by the data, however some aspects have limited novelty and could be better discussed in light of previous literature. The study would benefit of a more mechanistic insight into how the described mutations prevent motor inactivation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study identified and characterized a novel pathogenic mutation in KIF22 and offered an explanation for the role of KIF22 mutations in developmental disorders. The work relies on a thorough experimental design accompanied with rigorous controls that included generation of multiple stable inducible cell lines, high quality quantification of cell phenotypes and detailed analysis of protein/mutants activity, localization and dynamics.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The work would need to be better discussed in light of previous literature. The first study showing that anaphase chromosomes recongress due to a failed inactivation of CDK1 and KIF22 has not been discussed in the context of presented data (Wolf et al., EMBO J 2006).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this study. We agree that it is important to reference. We now discuss it in the introduction (lines 65-67), results (lines 378-380), and discussion (lines 914-917) sections of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the effect of V475G mutant is not surprising, knowing that mutating 7 amino-acids within the same region (including V475) resulted in a similar anaphase recongression phenotype (Soeda et al., JCS 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for encouraging us to better discuss our findings in the context of the work of Soeda et al. We agree that this paper is important for interpreting our results and cite it throughout the introduction and discussion. The assays in the Soeda 2016 study included assessment of tail domain deletions and mutation of 7 or 8 coiled-coil domain amino acids to serine or aspartate, respectively. While our V475G findings are consistent with their observations of cells with 7S or 8D mutations in the coiled-coil domain, we felt it was important to characterize the effect of a single point mutation rather than a larger alteration of tail structure, as the effects of a single mutation may not have matched the effects of these larger-scale changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results of those two studies have indicated that PEFs, if not inactivated, are stronger than microtubule-sliding forces.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify how our results differ from previous published studies. In Wolf et al. 2006, chromosome movements in cells with nondegradable cyclin B1 are assessed using H2B-GFP. This work does not use markers for the spindle poles or centromeres to assess the movements of these structures. The work of Wolf et al. includes imaging of microtubules and kinetochores in fixed cells, and the conclusions drawn from these experiments are that in cells with nondegradable cyclin B1, spindles are bipolar and kinetochores are not paired during recongression. For cells subjected to microinjection of anti-KIF22 neutralizing antibodies, the authors focus on chromosome movements, again using H2B-GFP as a marker for live imaging.</p><p>The results of the experiments presented by Wolf et al. are consistent with, but distinct from, our work. We used pericentrin-RFP and CENPB-mCh to image the movements of the spindle poles and kinetochores in live cells with high temporal resolution to directly compare the movements of these structures to chromosome movements during anaphase recongression. This approach allowed us to assess the effects of a failure to inactivate KIF22 on anaphase A and anaphase B. Our work is the first to demonstrate that anaphase polar ejection forces affect anaphase A by altering the movements of chromosome arms, but not the shortening of k-fibers (Figure 5H and 5I) and affect anaphase B by altering spindle pole separation (Figure 5F and 5G).</p><p>The movement of the spindle during anaphase recongression caused by deletion of the tail microtubule binding or coiled-coil domains was assessed by Soeda et al. using mChtubulin. They did not observe differences in spindle length during anaphase in cells with anaphase polar ejection forces, and in fact conclude that these forces do not affect spindle elongation. This is different than our result that the distance between spindle poles is reduced by anaphase polar ejection forces (Figure 5F and 5G), and we discuss this in the manuscript (lines 1019-1021). This difference may be due to the fact that Soeda et al. were observing meiosis in mouse oocytes.</p><p>Thus, neither the work presented in Wolf et al. 2006 nor Soeda et al. 2016 demonstrates that anaphase polar ejection forces overcome microtubule sliding forces to affect the movements of spindle poles (anaphase B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some experiments were performed with a low cell number. For example, in Figure 5 only 2-3 cells were used per each of 3 independent experiments. This is likely the reason why, despite showing a clear trend, no statistical significance was observed under some conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s interest in ensuring sample sizes are large enough to draw robust conclusions. The assays in Figure 5 require the identification of metaphase cells expressing both pericentrin-RFP and CENPB-mCh at appropriate levels and that the cells divide parallel to the imaging plane so that both spindle poles remain in focus. These challenges mean that throughput for this assay is quite low – the data originally presented was from six independent experiments, but some experiments included zero cells expressing one construct type that were ultimately suitable for analysis, hence the presented data included cells from three experiments per condition.</p><p>We repeated this experiment three additional times and were able to analyze 3 cells expressing KIF22-GFP, 1 cell expressing KIF22-GFP R149Q, and 3 cells expressing KIF22-GFP V475G from these additional experimental replicates. Including these new data, the reduction in distance between chromosome masses (Figure 5C), centromeres (Figure 5E), and spindle poles (Figure 5G) 10 minutes after anaphase onset is now significant for cells expressing KIF22-GFP R149Q or KIF22-GFP V475G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study does not provide a more mechanistic insight into how the described mutations prevent motor inactivation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the question of how KIF22 is inactivated is an interesting one.</p><p>To provide additional mechanistic insight into KIF22 inactivation, we explored whether the α-2 helix of the motor domain is required for this process outside of the context of disease-derived mutations.

Our work is the first to demonstrate a role for the motor domain in KIF22 inactivation.

However, these negative results do not rule out that such an interaction may be weak or dynamic and, therefore, not detectable using this assay. We also observed that KIF22 tail fragments do not localize to microtubules in interphase, metaphase, or anaphase.

Our data do show that the chromosome arms are pushed further from the poles in anaphase in cells expressing mutant KIF22 (Figure 5H), while centromere distance from the poles is not affected (Figure 5I). We interpret this as consistent with anaphase recongression being caused by increased polar ejection forces on chromosome arms. We are not able to specifically measure the distance between the centromere and the ends of chromosome arms for individual chromosomes given the density of chromosome masses in HeLa-Kyoto cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript investigates mutations in the kinesin KIF22 that cause abnormal skeletal development. The main findings are that localisation, binding kinetics and generation of polar ejection forces during prometaphase are unaltered when comparing KIF22 mutants to the wildtype motor. However, cells expressing disease-causing mutants of KIF22 show defects in chromosome segregation due to a lack of inactivation of polar ejection forces during anaphase. This results in re-congression and in a significant subset of cells in cytokinesis failure and abnormal nuclear shape. All experiments have been conducted in HeLa cells with five different mutations, robustly quantified and reproduced in RPE1 cells with two key mutations. The authors then recapitulate the defects with a phosphomimetic T463D mutation, as phosphorylation of T463 has been shown previously to be required for generating polar ejection forces, and dephosphorylation at this residue was implicated in switching KIF22 off during anaphase. All mutations acted dominant in the experiment and also in patients, consistent with finding a gain-of-function defect. The finding that mutations in the motor domain and the tail cause similar defects suggests that an interaction of motor domain and tail might be involved in switching off KIF22's polar ejection force generation at the onset of anaphase and thus offers a testable hypothesis for future studies.</p><p>As the idea that polar ejection force needs to be switched off during anaphase is not new, the impact of the study for understanding cell division is somewhat limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that previous work (Wolf et al. 2006, Su et al. 2016, Soeda et al. 2016) demonstrates that a failure to reduce polar ejection forces in anaphase can disrupt chromosome segregation. We have discussed these data throughout the revised manuscript, including in the introduction (lines 65-82). We have also attempted to clarify gaps in our understanding of how polar ejections forces are reduced during anaphase and why this is necessary for proper chromosome segregation to occur. In summary, the novel findings we present include:</p><p>Characterization of the consequences of a failure to inactivate polar ejection forces in cells: we show not only that anaphase polar ejection forces can disrupt chromosome movements, but also that daughter cell phenotypes are altered in cells experiencing aberrant polar ejection forces. We demonstrate that daughter cells have abnormally shaped nuclei (Figures 6 and S4), that the nuclear envelopes of these nuclei are capable of retaining mCh-NLS (Figure 6G), that cytokinesis failure occurs in about 30% of cells (Figure 4D and 4E), that cell proliferation is reduced, and that this reduction in proliferation is consistent with the rate of cytokinesis failure limiting the rate of proliferation (Figure 7). The only previous study to address this question is Wolf et al. 2006, which includes an observation that a number of cells expressing nondegradable cyclin B1 failed to form two daughter cells.</p><p>The effects of polar ejection forces on both anaphase A and anaphase B: as described in our response to reviewer #2 above, our work is the first to demonstrate that a failure to inactivate KIF22 in anaphase affects the movement of the spindle poles, suggesting that the polar ejection forces collectively generated by mutant KIF22 motors are of greater magnitude than the forces sliding the spindle poles apart during anaphase B.</p><p>The involvement of the motor domain α-2 helix in KIF22 inactivation: we show that pathogenic mutations at P148 or R149 or mimicking phosphorylation of T158 disrupts anaphase chromosome segregation. This implicates the α-2 helix in KIF22 inactivation for the first time, adding to previous work (Soeda et al. 2016) that defines the requirement of tail domains for polar ejection force suspension.</p><p>Connecting anaphase polar ejection forces to human health and development: while further study is needed to connect the cellular phenotypes we present to patient pathology, our characterization of the cellular consequences of pathogenic mutations in KIF22 provides the first potential connection between a failure to suspend polar ejection forces in anaphase and human pathology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors discuss possible mechanisms why mutations in the motor domain and the tail show similar effects, but no experiments have been included to test these ideas. For example, testing for the proposed interaction of motor domain and tail domain would be a relatively straightforward biochemistry experiment and offer additional mechanistic insights that would increase the impact of the paper and also enable providing an explanation why these specific mutations cause disease if such motor-tail interactions would be reduced in the presence of the mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the interest of all three reviewers in the mechanism of KIF22 inactivation. Please see our comments on testing mechanisms of KIF22 autoinhibition in response to Reviewer #1’s comment above. Briefly, we expressed Motor Domain-GFP and mCherry-Tail and used co-immunoprecipitations to test for an interaction between these domains of KIF22. We were unable to detect a physical interaction between the tail and motor domain of KIF22. However, these negative results do not rule out that such an interaction may be weak or dynamic and, therefore, not detectable using this assay. Similarly, we observed that KIF22 tail fragments do not localize to microtubules in interphase, metaphase, or anaphase. These data are inconsistent with a strong tailmicrotubule interaction that would support the model of microtubule binding-mediated KIF22 inactivation (Soeda et al. 2016), but also do not preclude weak or dynamic interactions between the tail and the microtubule surface contributing to the inactivation of KIF22. It is also possible that the presence of the motor domain is necessary for strong interactions of the KIF22 tail with the microtubule surface and consequent motor inactivation.</p><p>We agree that additional biochemical and biophysical studies of KIF22 would be of interest. However, to our knowledge, soluble, active KIF22 has not been purified in quantities required for these types of studies. There are very few studies of purified KIF22 for this reason, and those that exist have utilized low yield purifications for single molecule studies. Additionally, the lack of in vitro data on KIF22 means that there are fundamental questions that remain unanswered about this motor, including its oligomeric state. It has been characterized as a monomer by analytical ultracentrifugation (Yajima et al. 2003, Shiroguchi et al. 2003), but plus-end-directed movement of GFP-KIF22 oligomers on microtubules has been observed using single molecule TIRF (Stumpff et al. 2012). These technical and interpretation challenges limit our ability to perform biochemical or biophysical experiments to further characterize mutations in KIF22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the paper shows that defects occur only in anaphase, localisation and turnover have only been analysed in metaphase. It would make sense to compare localisation and turnover in anaphase. This might also offer some insights into the switching off mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that altered localization or turnover would be an interesting potential mechanism of KIF22 inactivation in anaphase. This question is what prompted us to assess localization and turnover in anaphase. Our results demonstrate that localization and dynamics of KIF22 are not altered by pathogenic mutations during interphase, metaphase, or anaphase. The localization of KIF22-GFP can be seen in the live imaging presented in Figures 4A and S3D, and FRAP data demonstrating that exchange of KIF22-GFP, KIF22-GFP R149Q, and KIF22-GFP V475G is low in anaphase is presented in Figures 2D, 2G, and 2J, respectively. These data, which were included in both the original and revised manuscripts, demonstrate that inactivation of KIF22 in anaphase does not alter the localization or turnover of the motor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There isn't currently an explanation why such defects in cell division cause tissue-specific defects in skeletal development as cell division was investigated here only with cell types not involved in bone growth. As the manuscripts describes a new patient, I wonder whether the authors have access to biopsies that might allow showing nuclear deformations in patient tissue and whether this occurs in a tissue-specific manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important question. We agree that patient samples could help connect cellular phenotypes to organismal pathology. However, we do not have access to patient samples for these tests. Access to patient samples is limited by the very small number of people diagnosed with SEMDJL2 and the fact that most patients are adolescents. We discuss the question of tissue specificity in the manuscript (lines 1022-1044) and plan to address this question more directly in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most cell biologists won't be familiar with normal bone images. Thus it would be valuable to add control images from a healthy person of similar age to illustrate the patient symptoms in (Figure 1F,G).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the challenge of interpreting the patient radiographs and have revised the text (lines 142-145), added an arrowhead to Figure 1F to highlight the fourth metacarpal, and revised the figure legends for Figure 1F and 1G. Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to identify an individual to serve as a paired control for additional imaging.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The negative data showing the tail and motor do not interact should be added to the paper and discussed in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the interest of the reviewers in these data and have added them in a new supplemental figure (Figure 9 —figure supplement 3). We have included images of the localization of mCh-Tail fragments and immunoprecipitation data testing the interaction of Motor Domain-GFP and mCh-Tail fragments. These data are described in the results (lines 848-862) and discussion (lines 1035-1038) sections of the manuscript. We have included a statement in the discussion that further studies would be needed to rule out a physical inactivating interaction between these domains of KIF22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is no direct evidence that this site is differentially phosphorylated during mitosis (Prometaphase and metaphase vs. Anaphase), and the Alanine mutant is fully functional, indicating that loss of this putative phosphorylation site is not sufficient to induce inactivation. Therefore it is equally possible that introduction of a charge disrupts the structure of the coiled-coil domain, thus mimicking the deletion of this domain. Please clarify the manuscript to highlight this region is important for Kif22 activity but not necessarily phosphorylated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that studies determining the phosphorylation status of T158 in different phases of mitosis are warranted to understand if or when phosphorylation of this residue regulates KIF22 activity and have added language to the Discussion section that states this (lines 1003-1007). We have emphasized in the discussion that our work examining charge changes at T158 support a role for the motor domain in KIF22 inactivation.</p><p>T158 is located in the a2 helix of the motor domain. To consider whether charge change at T158 may disrupt the structure of this helix, we used ColabFold (Mirdita et al. 2022, PMID 35637307) to predict the structure of the KIF22 T158D motor domain. No disruption of the a2 helix was predicted. We do not think it is likely that the T158D phosphomimetic mutation affects KIF22 function by disrupting the structure of this helix. Given the conservation and important mechanochemical role of this helix across kinesins, we would also predict that a complete disruption of this region would lead to loss of motor activity rather than constitutive activation.</p><p>The previously characterized phosphorylation site, T463, is located in the tail of KIF22, near the coiled-coil domain. This site is phosphorylated in mitosis, and its dephosphorylation occurs with similar kinetics to degradation of cyclin B, indicating that it is dephosphorylated as cells transition from metaphase to anaphase (Ohsugi et al. 2003, PMID 12727876). Additional studies demonstrate that mimicking phosphorylation of T463 or deletion or disruption of the coiled-coil domain cause anaphase chromosome recongression (Soeda et al. 2016, PMID 27550518). As the reviewer points out, whether or how phosphorylation of T463 affects the coiled-coil domain is unknown. We have added a note to the Discussion section stating that charge changes at T463 may disrupt the structure of tail domains necessary for KIF22 inactivation (lines 1013-1014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some experimental controls are missing and should be added, showing the expression levels and knockdown efficiency in the cell lines used.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added data measuring KIF22 expression levels and knockdown efficiency in T134 cell lines, included in a revised supplemental figure (Figure 9 —figure supplement 1). We have added similar data for T158 cell lines in a new supplemental figure (Figure 9 —figure supplement 2). We also demonstrate that anaphase recongression depends on expression level in the cell lines used to assess T158 (Figure 9 —figure supplement 2 E), and that the effect of T158D on recongression is also observed when only cells with low KIF22-GFP expression levels are considered (Figure 9 —figure supplement 2 F and G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please edit the manuscript about the interpretation of cell proliferation data to avoid overinterpretation. The authors assume in their model two extreme possibilities: either that nuclear architecture defects or that cytokinesis defects are entirely responsible for the reduced proliferation. It could, however, be that both types of defects lead to a slow down of the cell cycle, which would also explain the reduced proliferation rate. If the authors want to claim that cytokinesis failure is the primary reason for a reduced proliferation, they would need to monitor cell populations over long time periods and demonstrate that the cell doubling time of cells with failed cytokinesis is substantially longer than the rest of the population (this is likely, but at this stage not shown).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the careful assessment of our data by the reviewers and have added language to the Results section clarifying that both nuclear morphology defects and cytokinesis failure may contribute to reduced proliferation (lines 619-621).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have addressed most comments from the last round of revisions well.</p><p>One of the major points raised by the reviewers was to test whether the tail inhibited the motor. The authors have tested this and they do not see any interaction between the tail and motor that would inhibit/activate the kinesin using coIP and various approaches. So no clear mechanism for how Kif22 might be switched on and off emerge. Of course the paper then does not explain how Kif22 is working. However with the current data and all the studied mutants, the authors debate different models for the regulation of Kif22.</p><p>I think understanding the mechanism of Kif22 regulation would require a lot of biochemistry work, which is a different paper and not in the expertise of the authors. They tried to address all the comments and some experiments supporting tail-motor regulation we asked did not work technically, but some phosphomutants are further characterised. The negative data on the tail-motor showing they do not interact should be integrated into the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to point 1, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This revised manuscript investigates the functional consequences of KIF22 mutations appearing in human pathologies during cell division. The authors conclude that these mutations do not affect the ability of KIF22 to generate a polar ejection force, but rather prevent the inactivation of KIf22 at anaphase onset, resulting in chromosome recongression, and in the extreme case to cytokinesis failure due to chromosomes masses in the site of cell division.</p><p>The study investigates an interesting link between a human pathology and a cell biology mechanism. It is therefore novel and original and of interest to a wider public. The cell biology scope of the study remains limited, since the fact that KIF22 must be inactivated at anaphase onset to prevent chromosome segregation defects, was already known. The weakness of the paper is that beyond this tight correlation between pathological mutations and anaphase defects, the authors do not offer major mechanistic advances in the inactivation mechanisms of KIF22, a point that remains unaddressed even after the revision work.</p><p>Indeed, even though the authors have done a good job at addressing many of the points of the reviewers, they could not obtain a major mechanistic understanding in how the α-2-helix of Kif22 or could be involved in the inactivation of KIF22. The additional characterization of the T463 mutation offers more support for a role of the coiled-coil domain, but I am not convinced that the presented data prove that this threonine must dephosphorylated to allow inactivation of KIF22: there is no direct evidence that this site is differentially phosphorylated during mitosis (Prometaphase and metaphase vs. Anaphase), and the Alanine mutant is fully functional, indicating that loss of this putative phosphorylation site is not sufficient to induce inactivation. Therefore it is equally possible that introduction of a charge disrupts the structure of the coiled-coil domain, thus mimicking the deletion of this domain.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to point 2, above. We agree that the time course of motor domain residue T158 phosphorylation during mitosis is unknown and have emphasized this point in our revised manuscript (lines 1003-1007). Published results supporting the role of phosphorylation of tail residue T463 in the regulation of KIF22 inactivation include observations that T463 is phosphorylated by CDK1 (Ohsugi et al. 2003, PMID 12727876), that allowing CDK1 activity in anaphase via expression of non-degradable cyclin B1 disrupts chromosome segregation and that this disruption depends on KIF22 activity (Wolf et al. 2006, PMID 16724106), and that mimicking phosphorylation of T463 also disrupts anaphase chromosome segregation (Soeda et al. 2016, PMID 27550518).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, I would suggest that the authors are more cautious when interpreting the cell proliferation data.
