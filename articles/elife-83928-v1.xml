However, the widespread dissemination of β-lactamases among pathogenic bacteria limits the efficacy of β-lactam antibiotics. This has created a major public health crisis. The use of β-lactamase inhibitors has proven useful in restoring the activity of β-lactam antibiotics, yet, effective clinically approved inhibitors against class B metallo-β-lactamases are not available. L1, a class B3 enzyme expressed by <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, is a significant contributor to the β-lactam resistance displayed by this opportunistic pathogen. Structurally, L1 is a tetramer with two elongated loops, α3-β7 and β12-α5, present around the active site of each monomer. Residues in these two loops influence substrate/inhibitor binding. To study how the conformational changes of the elongated loops affect the active site in each monomer, enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations were performed, Markov State Models were built, and convolutional variational autoencoder-based deep learning was applied. The key identified residues (D150a, H151, P225, Y227, and R236) were mutated and the activity of the generated L1 variants was evaluated in cell-based experiments. The results demonstrate that there are extremely significant gating interactions between α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops. Taken together, the gating interactions with the conformational changes of the key residues play an important role in the structural remodeling of the active site. These observations offer insights into the potential for novel drug development exploiting these gating interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic></kwd><kwd>L1 metallo-β-lactamase</kwd><kwd>β-lactam antibiotics</kwd><kwd>anti-bacterial resistance</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>deep learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI100560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonomo</surname><given-names>Robert A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000030</institution-id><institution>US CDC Prevention Epicenters Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54CK000603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonomo</surname><given-names>Robert A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mojica</surname><given-names>Maria F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Extremely significant interactions between α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops in the tetrameric L1 metallo-β-lactamase play an important role in the structural remodeling of the active site and offer insights into the potential for novel drug development by exploiting these interactions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>β-Lactam antibiotics are the most important and widely used class of antibiotics for treating bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bush and Bradford, 2016</xref>). They exhibit high efficacy and minimal side effects. Penicillins, carbapenems, cephalosporins, and monobactams are typical β-lactam antibiotics on the market and, accounted for 65% of all antibiotics prescriptions in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bush and Bradford, 2016</xref>). A common structural feature in this exceptionally large class of antibiotics is the presence of a β-lactam ring, which acts as a false substrate for the transpeptidases (also called Penicillin-binding proteins, PBPs) and inhibits peptidoglycan cross-linking, thereby impairing the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palzkill, 2018</xref>). While all β-lactam antibiotics share a common mode of action, they however, exhibit distinct properties in terms of spectrum of action, pharmacokinetics and, to some extent, activity against resistant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Bambeke et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recognizing that β-lactams have shown great benefits in clinical treatments, the overuse and misuse of β-lactams have favored the emergence of β-lactam resistance, raising public concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tooke et al., 2019</xref>). As the resistance has progressed, β-lactams have experienced a rapid potency loss against various bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tooke et al., 2019</xref>). The World Health Organization projected in 2019 that such drug resistance could cause up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050 (‘No time to Wait’, n.d.). Therefore, dealing with β-lactam antibiotics resistance is an urgent global public health challenge.</p><p>Three established mechanisms through which bacteria develops resistance against β-lactam antibiotics are previously known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mora-Ochomogo and Lohans, 2021</xref>). These include but not limited to the production of β-lactamase enzymes, modification of the target protein – PBPs, or preventing β-lactam antibiotics from reaching the target. Among these, the expression of β-lactamases is the most common mechanism found in various bacteria resistant to β-lactams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lingzhi et al., 2018</xref>). β-Lactamases inactivate β-lactam antibiotics by hydrolyzing the amide bond in the β-lactam ring.</p><p>Four classes of β-lactamases are established. While classes A, C, and D are serine β-lactamases, class B groups the zinc-dependent metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs). MBLs employ one or two zinc ions at the active site as catalytic cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palzkill, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tooke et al., 2019</xref>). MBLs are further subdivided into three subclasses (B1, B2, and B3) based on their sequence, metal content, and different active site features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahr et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahr et al., 2021</xref>). All MBLs adopt the αβ/βα sandwich motif and have mono- (class B2) or binucleated zinc (classes B1 and B3) at the active site. The B1 and B3 subclasses have a broad-spectrum substrate profile that includes penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, while the B2 enzymes exhibit a narrow profile that includes carbapenems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palzkill, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tooke et al., 2019</xref>). Such distinctive ability to hydrolyze the new generation of carbapenem antibiotics, the rapid emergence of new clinical variants, the potential for interspecies transfer in the presence of mobile genetic elements, isolation from nosocomial and environment sources, coupled with the unavailability of any clinically useful MBL inhibitors makes MBLs of significant clinical interest and concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bush and Bradford, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mojica et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tooke et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> is a non-fermenting, Gram-negative bacillus that has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen. This organism mainly affects patients with cancer, cystic fibrosis, and other conditions leading to an immunosuppressed state, where it can cause a variety of clinical syndromes, mainly pulmonary and blood stream infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mojica et al., 2019</xref>).

L1 MBL can hydrolyze almost all β-lactam antibiotics with the exception of monobactams such as aztreonam and is resistant to all clinically available β-lactamase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooke, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mojica et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okazaki and Avison, 2008</xref>).</p><p>L1 MBL is unique among all known β-lactamases as it is the only known β-lactamase that functions as a tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In each subunit, there are two zinc ions bound at the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ullah et al., 1998</xref>). The first Zinc (Zn1) is in a tetrahedral coordination with a water molecule and three histidine residues. The second Zinc (Zn2) is coordinated by two histidine, one aspartic acid and a water molecule in a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Another water molecule, which acts like a nucleophile for the catalytic reaction bridges the two zinc ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

All these interactions are primarily hydrophobic and lead to each monomer burying 1300 Å<sup>2</sup> of non-polar side-chain surface area on the formation of the tetramer. A two-fold inverted symmetry of the subunit arrangement positions some important residues and interactions at the subunit interfaces in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Two novel substitutions were identified in vitro, on the α3-β7 loop: G159A and (G/E)161D. The role of G159 in substrate binding and catalysis has been determined by the substitution of G159A. This substitution disrupts the positioning of F156, another significant residue involved in the function of L1, by decreasing the flexibility of the loop. Similarly, the G161D substitution can also affect the efficiency of the enzyme catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carenbauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nauton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ullah et al., 1998</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Elongated loops.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">α3-β7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GGSDDLHFGDGITYPPANAD Residues 149–171</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">β12-α5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ADSLSAPGYQLQGNPRYPH Residues 219–239</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The β12-α5 loop consists of 19 residues (A219-H239) and lies adjacent to the active site.

The apical points of α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops are positioned at the interface between monomers, and direct interaction with residues that affects the catalytic activity of the L1 MBL has been confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ullah et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure of L1 MBL has been determined in apo state and in complex with inhibitors and final reaction products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nauton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sevaille et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Twidale et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ullah et al., 1998</xref>). In all structures, the substrate/inhibitor-binding site (active site from here onwards) is well defined. In the apo state, the β12-α5 loop is collapsed on the active site. In complex structures, the β12-α5 loop wraps around to enclose the substrate/inhibitor within the active site. It is worth noting that the conformation of the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops are identical in all structures, be it in the apo state or in complex with substrate/inhibitors. In this collapsed, closed conformation, residues R236 (β12-α5) and D150c (α3-β7) form a salt bridge interaction; Y227 (β12-α5) forms a π–π stacking interaction with H151 (α3-β7) and P225 (β12-α5) adopts an ‘in’ conformation, where the Cγ atom in the cyclic side chain of P225 is 6.5 Å from the centroid of the two Zinc ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). An additional interaction between the side chain of the Q310 (α6 helix) and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of A224 (β12-α5) stabilizes the loops in the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the inter-subunit interactions are the major contributors that affect the flexibility of α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops, and the dynamics of these loops can directly influence β-lactam binding and catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2005</xref>). These findings have indicated the importance of inter-subunit interactions in inhibitor design. While the catalytic mechanism of β-lactam hydrolysis in MBLs is well established, the mechanistic insights into how the dynamics of these flexible loops affect the structural rearrangements of the enzyme active site remains unknown.</p><p>To sample the conformational landscape explored by L1 MBL, we performed adaptive sampling simulations (cumulative sampling over 100 μs) and investigated the metastability of the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops via Markov State Models (MSMs). To visualize the major metastable conformations of the loops alone, unsupervised low-dimensional embeddings were created using a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE). Observations from MSMs and CVAE-based deep learning identified important conformational changes in the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops, which have significant effects on the dynamic architecture of the enzyme active site and may directly affect the catalytic activity of L1 MBL. Five residues, D150c, H151 (α3-β7 loop) and P225, Y227 and R236 (β12-α5 loop) were substituted and the activity of the engineered L1 variants was evaluated in cell-based experiments.

The ‘in’ conformation is defined as when the Cγ atom of P225 is oriented toward the zinc atoms in the active site. The distance between the Cγ atom and the centroid of the two zinc atoms is calculated to be 6.5 Å in the 1SML crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ullah et al., 1998</xref>).

This interaction tethers the terminal α6 helix to the rest of subunit and stabilizes the β12-α5 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). The loops are collapsed on the active site resulting in an occluded 420.4 ± 94.8 Å<sup>3</sup> cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The structure of the active site is analogous to the crystalline conformation, thereby highlighting it as a relevant functional state.

Therefore, similarly for L1 MBL, it can be inferred that the formation of the salt bridge observed in the ‘closed’ conformation of the loops is critical in stabilizing the topology of the active site and enhancing the antibiotic resistance.</p><p>The π–π stacking interaction between H151 and Y227 is another important interaction that stabilizes the loops. In the closed state (loop ‘closed’), the π–π stacking interaction is stable. However, the loss of the D150c-R236 salt bridge interaction generates enough space to permit the rotation of the side chain of Y227 from pointing to the zinc atoms in the active site to orienting toward R236, resulting in the loss of the π–π stacking interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This formation and loss of π–π stacking might be influenced by the formation of the salt bridge at the apical tips of the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops. Such π–π stacking interaction is considered a very important interaction in protein folding and molecular recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brylinski, 2018</xref>). Studies on other β-lactamases have revealed that the π–π stacking near the substrate-binding site can help stabilize the binding site topology and contribute to the recognition of the antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hargis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The side chain of P225 exists in trans configuration in L1 MBL, which is very unusual among the β-lactamases. Proline exists in two configurations in nature – cis and trans. Such configurations are defined by the ω torsion angle of proline (cis: close to 0°, trans: nearly 180°). Usually, in β-lactamases, the proline is found in the cis configuration. Studies on TEM-1 β-lactamase have already revealed the importance of the proline cis configuration in the protein folding and correct orientation of residues involved in the catalytic reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vanhove et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vanhove et al., 1995</xref>). Mutations at this proline, near the binding site prevents the enzyme from functioning properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vanhove et al., 1996</xref>). However, in L1 MBL, P225 is found in trans configuration. To confirm this, the ω torsion angle was calculated throughout the course of the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The angle is stable at ca. −180° in all four monomers, while also often transitioning to ca. 180°; thus, confirming the trans configuration of P225. The ‘in’ and ‘out’ conformations of P225 identified in different states are regulated by the coupled coordination of π–π stacking (H151-Y227) and the salt bridge (D150c-R236) interactions. These interactions may be the major contributor for stabilizing the trans conformation of P225. Moreover, the transitionary ‘in’ and ‘out’ conformational changes of P225 may also be important in for substrate binding.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Trans conformation of P225.</title><p>The cis/trans conformation of a peptide bond is determined by the torsion of the ω angle. The ω torsion angle is close to 0° in the cis configuration, or ca. 180° in the trans configuration. The ω angle of P225 in each subunit transitions between 180° and −180°. The stride is 100 frames.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83928-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The side chain of F156 also plays an important role in the ligand-binding process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sevaille et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2005</xref>). In fact, all the ligand/substrate-bound forms of L1 MBL structures adopt a closed conformation, presumably due to the tight packing interactions of the side chains in the binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drawz and Bonomo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sevaille et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2005</xref>). As observed in each state, the side chain of F156 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) rotates when transitioning between metastable states. In comparison with the crystal structure, there is an obvious difference in the F156 side-chain dihedral angles in the open, intermediate, and the closed states, suggesting the side-chain rotation of F156 may affect the ligand binding. The functional role of F156 in L1 MBL merits further study.</p><p>Several major conformational changes, including the formation and loss of the salt bridge (D150c-R236) and π–π stacking (H151-Y227) interactions, the ‘in’ and ‘out’ conformations of P225 existing in trans configuration, the side-chain rotation of F156, have been identified that explain the dynamics of the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops. These conformational changes of the loops would have significant impact on the topology of the active site, which may further affect the catalytic activity of the L1 MBL. Our findings suggest a plausible two state conformation where β12-α5 loop acts like a lid on the active site. In the open state, the D150c-R236 salt bridge is broken and the π–π stacking interaction between H151 and Y227 is lost. This allows P225 to adopt an ‘out’ conformation resulting in the loop to move away from the active site. The rearrangement of the residues in the loops increases the volume, which permits the access of the substrate into the active site. Since this is a high energy conformation, the loop is drawn back to a more stable closed conformation, where P225 adopts the ‘in’ conformation, the π–π stacking and the salt bridge interaction is reformed. The closed conformation is an extremely stable state that is observed in all crystallized conformations of L1 MBL including those with inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crisp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sevaille et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spencer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ullah et al., 1998</xref>). These findings in L1 MBL are further supported by experimental studies on two active site loops in NDM-1, IMP-1, and VIM-2 MBLs, which identified the loops to behave like mobile flaps and a direct link exists between the conformation of the loops and the changes in the substrate recognition profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oelschlaeger and Pleiss, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palacios et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the flexibility of the loops may also lead to a better positioning of the zinc ion, resulting in an enhanced catalytic profile of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tomatis et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Experimental validation by L1 MBL engineered variants</title><p>To study the role of each of the key residues identified in the coordinated dynamics of loops α3-β7 and β12-α5, we engineered the H151V, D150cV, P225A, R236A, and Y227A variants in L1 for susceptibility determinations. The susceptibility of the variants expressed in an isogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH10B background was tested against a panel of representative cephalosporins and carbapenems (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We also included a well-studied experimental L1 inhibitor to test the effect of these substitutions in inhibitor binding, L-CS319 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hinchliffe et al., 2016</xref>). The H151V substitution had the biggest detrimental effect on the catalytic activity of L1 of all substrates tested, decreasing the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in &gt;6 doubling dilutions. In the case of the P225A and Y227A variants, the effect on the MICs depended upon the substrate. Compared to L1, the MICs for ceftazidime of these variants decreased two-fold dilutions, in contrast to the six-fold dilutions observed for the MIC for imipenem. Lastly, the D150cV and R236A substitution had a minimal effect on the hydrolytic activity of L1, as their MICs values for all substrates were comparable. Addition of the MBL inhibitor L-CS319 further decreased the MIC values, indicating that this compound is able to bind the active site, a fact that is consistent with its small size and the lack of substituents such as those present in the β-lactam antibiotics. The effect of the inhibitor also supports that the enzyme is active in the bacterial periplasm, and that these mutations are not disrupting the protein fold.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Susceptibility results of various β-lactams against L1 variants expressed in the pBC SK (+) vector in <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B cells.</title><p>The reported values are the mode of at least three biological replicates.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="2">Strain</th><th align="center" valign="bottom" colspan="6">MIC value (mg/l)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn1">*</xref></th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">CAZ</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">FEP</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">IMI</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">MER</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">TEB</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">TEB + CS319<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table2fn2"><sup>†</sup></xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DH10B pBC SK blaL1a</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">256</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">16</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">16</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">32</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DH10B pBC SK blaL1a_H151V</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.03</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.125</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.03</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≤0.03</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≤0.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DH10B pBC SK blaL1a_D150cV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">256</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DH10B pBC SK blaL1a_P225A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">64</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.125</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.125</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≤0.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DH10B pBC SK blaL1a_R236A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">256</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DH10B pBC SK blaL1a_Y227A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">64</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">≤0.03</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table2fn1"><label>*</label><p>CAZ, ceftazidime; FEP, cefepime; IMI, imipenem; MER, meropenem; TEB, tebipenem.</p></fn><fn id="table2fn2"><label>†</label><p>CS319 was added to a final concentration of 100 mg/l.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this report, we have performed enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations and built MSM to analyze and understand the dynamics of two flexible loops (α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops) in the L1 enzyme. The deep learning analysis of the MSM cluster centers further resolved the role of individual subunits in the global dynamics of the L1 MBL.</p><p>The main focus of this work is to understand the relationship between the loop dynamics and the structural remodeling of the active site. The results presented here suggest that the dynamic properties of the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops can affect the architecture of the active site. Interactions between key residues in the loops are primarily responsible for the distinct conformational changes observed. The β12-α5 loop is highly flexible, while the α3-β7 loop is quite stable, due to the direct proximity to the zinc coordination in the active site. The loops adopt ‘open’ or ‘closed’ conformations gated by a salt bridge interaction between D150c and R236. The π–π stacking between H151 and Y227 is also crucial. The formation of the stacking interaction together with the salt bridge interaction stabilizes P225 in an ‘in’ conformation. These conformational changes influence the architecture of the active site and may affect the catalytic activity of L1 MBL. A coordination between the residues in the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops, leading to the structural remodeling of the active site would be crucial in understanding the conformational changes resulting in the entrance of the substrate and egress of the product from the binding site. It is worth emphasizing that the loop movements occur on the same timescale as the formation of the reaction intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carenbauer et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">González et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the analyses presented here serve as a starting point for more strategic drug design that capitalizes on these dynamic interactions present in the tetramer. Moreover, our analyses offer the opportunity to search for novel compounds that not only modulate inhibition but will overcome standard approaches that have continued to lead to resistance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>System preparation</title><p>The biological functional unit of L1 MBL is a tetramer.

The PDB file was then protonated at pH 7.0 using proteinprepare module implemented in playmolecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martínez-Rosell et al., 2017</xref>). Since L1 MBL contains zinc ions, the protonated PDB file was adapted to the Zinc Amber force field (ZAFF) format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peters et al., 2010</xref>).

Long-range electrostatic interactions were computed using the particle mesh Ewald summation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerutti et al., 2009</xref>). The system was energy minimized for 1000 iterations of steepest descent and then equilibrated for 5 ns at 1 atmospheric pressure using Berendsen barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feenstra et al., 1999</xref>). Initial velocities within each simulation were sampled from Boltzmann distribution at temperature of 300 K. Isothermic–isobaric NVT ensemble using a Langevin thermostat with a damping of 0.1 ps<sup>−1</sup> and hydrogen mass repartitioning scheme to achieve time steps of 4 fs. Multiple short MSM-based adaptively sampled simulations were run using the ACEMD molecular dynamics engine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doerr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harvey et al., 2009</xref>). The standard adaptive sampling algorithm performs several rounds of short parallel simulations. To avoid any redundant sampling, the algorithm generates an MSM discretized conformational space and uses the stationary distribution of each state to obtain an estimate of their free energy. It then selects any sampled conformation from a low free energy stable state and respawns a new round of simulations. In this context, the MetricSelfDistance function was set to consider the number of native Cα contacts formed for all residues, which were then used to build the MSMs. The exploration value was 0.01 and goal-scoring function was set to 0.3. For each round, 4 simulations of 50 ns were run in parallel until the cumulative time exceeded 100 μs. The trajectory frames were saved every 0.1 ns. 2090 trajectories were collected with each trajectory counting 500 frames.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Markov state modeling</title><p>PyEMMA v2.5.7 was used to build the MSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scherer et al., 2015</xref>) and carry out kinetic modeling of the tetramer. All 2090 trajectories were loaded into the software. The RMSD and backbone torsions of all residues in α3-β7 (G149-D171) and β12-α5 (A219-H239) loops from all four subunits were selected the input features. Next, the featurized trajectories were read in with a stride of 5 and were projected onto three independent components (ICs) using TICA. The produced projections can show the maximal autocorrelation for a given lag time (5 ns). The chosen ICs were then clustered into 200 clusters using <italic>k</italic>-means. In this way, each IC was assigned to the nearest cluster center. A lag time of 5 ns was chosen to build an MSM with seven metastable states according to the implied timescales (ITS) plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). After passing the Chapman–Kolmogorov test within confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), the MSM was defined as good. This indicates the model highly agrees with the input data, and it is statistically significant for use. Bayesian MSM was used to build the final model in the system. The net flux pathways between macrostates, starting from state 1, were calculated using Transition Path Theory (TPT) function. These pathways all originate from state 1, as it shows the lowest stationary probability (the highest free energy) in the system. This is why state 1 is a reasonable starting point to illustrate all the relevant kinetic transitions through the full FE landscape. The structural results were selected from each PCCA distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>CVAE-based deep learning</title><p>A CVAE-based unsupervised deep learning was implemented to resolve the dynamics of the individual subunits L1 MBL. The CVAE model has been previously used successfully to study many multiple cases including protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhowmik et al., 2018</xref>), enzyme dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akere et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romero et al., 2019</xref>), COVID-19-related molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2021</xref>), and more specifically β-lactamases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olehnovics et al., 2021</xref>).

The main objective of the CVAE-based deep learning was to cluster the conformations of the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops sampled in all four subunits independently.</p><p>A typical CVAE architecture is a specific deep learning algorithm, built on top of a traditional autoencoder with an added variational approach. In general, an autoencoder has an hourglass-like architecture, where high-dimensional data are fed on one end. As the high-dimensional data passes through the autoencoder, only the essential information is captured. The essential information is then used to reconstruct the high-dimensional data to ensure that there is no loss of information during the compression mechanism of the encoder. The reduced dimension data that is captured is optimized by the variational approach, and is distributed normally, thereby ensuring the efficient utilization of the latent space. The convolutional layers are introduced so that the local and global information is captured in an efficient way from the multilayered complex biomolecular structures.</p><p>The distance maps for each monomer were built separately to deconstruct the dynamics of individual subunits. The pairwise distance maps were built for each Cα atom in the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops with a cutoff &lt;8 Å. The distance matrices (39 × 39) were stacked in a 3D array. Prior to the training step, the four arrays were concatenated followed by a randomized reordering of the frames. A validation split of 80:20 was defined. A batch size of 300 was used, and the data were reshuffled after each completed epoch. The training was performed for 100 epochs and was assessed by a converged gradient descent. The embeddings were labeled based on P225-Zn distance (6.5 Å), H151-Y227 π–π stacking interaction (4 Å) and D150c-R236 salt bridge interaction (4.5 Å).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Davide Provasi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please address the concerns of three reviewers, which are appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Authors mention &quot;D150c&quot; in several parts of the paper and in figure labels. Authors should clarify this nomenclature for a broader audience.</p><p>2. Figure 2A needs a legend.</p><p>3. On line 237, the authors state residue 150 is S, whereas throughout the rest of the paper they discuss it as D150. Please clarify and correct.</p><p>4. Lines 303-308 have 39 mentioned in the text -please correct.</p><p>5. In the experimental testing step – a larger diversity of residues being tested would enable a broader understanding of the active site. This study would be further enhanced by double mutant variants to enable the authors to understand whether the bond type is important for the active site or if different bond types can exist to stabilize these loops (H-Bonding instead of pi-pi stacking as an example). This enhances the claim of the paper being useful for drug design. Further, there are several amino acids mentioned as being important at the beginning of the manuscript, yet we do not see their trajectories later in the manuscript. These would enhance the authors' claims as well.</p><p>6. How were the 22 residues identified and which are they? Understanding this is important for manuscript flow and would improve the narrative of the study. Further, data split results, and reducing input data matrix below 22 residues are all factors that should be tested for the validity of study results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As outlined in the public review, I think that the combination of CVAE and dihedral featurisation is confusing. If sophisticated CVAE embedding is necessary to resolve the relevant dynamical features, then it should be used instead of the dihedrals+tICA to build the MSM. Microstates for the MSM analysis could be easily defined based on k-means clustering of the 14-dimensional CVAE latent space, providing a unified description of the dynamics. If, on the other hand, the dihedral+tICA featurisation is enough to obtain a descriptive and converged model, what is the additional insight offered by the deep learning approach?</p><p>Another concern is that presently, all results from the CVAE are analysed and presented after a further projection with tSNE. What is the effect of the compression to 2 dimensions from the original dimensions of the VAE latent space?</p><p>The description of the methods is unclear or insufficient on several points:</p><p>1) System preparation. The system preparation strategies should be justified better. The authors simulate a homo-tetramer, building the complex from the monomer crystal structure. This choice should be justified, and the result of the tetramer modeling validated. Why should we trust the complex structure if there are no experimental structures of the tetramer?</p><p>2) Adaptive Simulations. the adaptive simulation strategy is not described. The authors just mention that &quot;Multiple short Markov State Model (MSM)-based adaptively sampled simulations were run&quot;. How? What were the criteria to build the MSM used to re-spawn adaptively the simulations? Was it the same as the one used for the analysis?</p><p>3) MSM. It should be made more clear in the methods that the dynamics of each of the four tetrameric units are used by considering the four units to be independent and featuring the dynamics of each unit, and not of the full tetramer. This is a good strategy to increase the available data for kinetic modeling, but it means that no conclusions can be extracted from cooperative effects across subunits. The CK test results should probably be reported as figure supplements.</p><p>For the results and discussions section:</p><p>1) confidence intervals should be reported for timescales (Figure 2A), mean first-passage times (Figure 2C), probabilities, and free-energies (Figure 2D). Error bars should be reported for the experimental data too (the authors mention triplicate experiments but only report one value per condition).</p><p>2) The description of the MSM results can be greatly improved and streamlined. For instance, the description of the structural features of the 7 macrostates (paragraph &quot;The α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops exist in open, intermediate and closed states&quot;) should come before the description of the most probable paths connecting the different states. Furthermore, to clarify and facilitate the identification of the structural features of the 7 macrostates, the distributions (or averages and percentiles) of the key distances mentioned in the results (e.g., D150c-R236, H151-Y227), etc. should be reported for each state, similar to what has been done in Figure 3D.</p><p>3) &quot;States 3, 5, and 6 are sub-states of the closed conformation, with differences in the conformations of loops joining β-sheets 10 and 11, far away from the active site&quot;. It's unclear how the macrostates, which were defined based on features describing only the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops, could resolve structural features unrelated to these two regions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although a very thoughtful and detailed MD study, several additional inputs would further strengthen the study. They are described below:</p><p>1) Using orthologs, it will be good to provide the percentage of MBLs (e.g., say at 85% sequence identity) that have elongated alpha3-beta7 and beta12-alpha5 types of loops. AlphaFold2 structures of such sequences can further facilitate loop content estimation. This will enhance the relevance of the study, i.e., applicable to not just one (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia MBL L1) but to MBLs of other pathogens. If the percent of MBLs with elongated loops is say &lt; 10%, should this study be carried out? In that case (i.e., if the elongated loops in MBLs are uncommon.), the threat from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia will need to be emphasized further for the significance of the study.</p><p>2) As a nonpolar surface patch is responsible for MBL L1 multimerization, can alphafold2 also help in estimating the number of multimeric MBLs that are possible based on the non-polar surface patches of alphafold2 modeled MBL proteins? That is, an estimate of the proportion of expected multimeric MBLs with elongated loops would help enhance the relevance of the study to a wider collection of MBLs.</p><p>3) In describing the conformational landscape of the loops, is mutagenesis the right experiment to capture the essence of the interacting loop residues? To illustrate this point, let there be two situations: (a) only one conformation for a loop which is held in place by a salt bridge, (b) two conformations for the loop, (1/3rd time in conformation-i and 2/3rd time in conformation-j) where conformation-i is held in place by the salt bridge. Can mutagenesis of the salt bridge residues distinguish scenario (a) from that of (b)?</p><p>4) Alternatively, let us say the following scenarios: (a) only one conformation for a loop (i.e., an open conformation) with no specific interaction, (b) two conformations for the loop (1/3rd time in conformation-i and 2/3rd time in conformation-j) where conformation-i is held in place by the salt bridge. Can mutagenesis of the salt bridge residues distinguish scenario (a) from that of (b)? It is better to describe the scenarios as in (3) or (4) or some others that are being probed and how mutagenesis captures or distinguishes the different scenarios. From Figure 1B, the impression is that scenarios (in (3) above) are likely the case and it is obvious that mutagenesis of the salt bridge residues will have an impact even if the conformational states were not identified by the current study. [In Figure 1, label '(C)' should be in place of label '(B)' in the legend]</p><p>5) As the ultimate goal of such a study is to identify better inhibitors, would the following investigation be a better way to utilize the conformational states of the loops? For example, let us say there are 3 loop conformations, i, j, and k that are captured by the enhanced MD sampling and MSM methods. Can each conformation (i.e., i, j, and k) be utilized separately for virtual screening of small molecules (e.g., using Schrodinger such as in ) to demonstrate that searching with each conformation independently (i.e., as three pocket volumes were observed in Figure 3D) provides higher success in the virtual screen than that of the single conformation of the experimental structure?</p><p>6) Authors mention specific interactions of the closed state (e.g., salt bridge R236-D150c, pi-pi stacking Y227-H151, and Q310 sidechain-mainchain hydrogen bond). These interactions are lost in the open state. How does the loss of the 3 interaction energies of the closed state get compensated in the open state? What is the population density of each of the open, intermediate, and closed states? Can the difference (i.e., loss or gain) in the energies due to the 3 interactions (R236-D150c, Y227-H151, and Q310) help explain the population densities of each state?</p><p>7) The authors mention Y227-H151 pi-pi stacking. The surface-exposed H151 residue can be protonated as well. That is, Y227-H151 could be a cation-pi too. Can the protonation status of H151 further influence the observed outcome?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83928.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Based on various published crystal structures, many of these residues in the active site that are in direct contact with the zinc ions or in the second shell of interactions have been mutated and their effects have been reported (https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00405-19). Our choice of amino acids was based entirely on the dynamic roles extracted from molecular dynamics simulations. We agree that, indeed, there would be additional residues that would play an important role in the stabilisation of these loops (directly or indirectly). We are in the process of identifying amino acids, studying their dynamic roles and experimentally testing them for a follow up study. Similarly, we designed the single mutants with the intention to disrupt specific residue-residue interactions that could affect the stability of the loops. The experimental data obtained so far supports out hypothesis regarding the role of those residues in the stabilization of the loops and their effect on substrate binding/catalysis. More experiments would need to be conducted to assess the specific effect of each substitution in protein stability, zinc affinity and substrate binding (Km) or catalysis (Kcat) that explains each specific phenotype. Once we have established the effect of each individual substitution, we could design double mutants to evaluate more possible scenarios that would ultimately deepen our knowledge of this enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. How were the 22 residues identified and which are they? Understanding this is important for manuscript flow and would improve the narrative of the study. Further, data split results, and reducing input data matrix below 22 residues are all factors that should be tested for the validity of study results.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point raised by the reviewer. The loop residues were selected between two structural elements- α3-β7 (residues 149-171) and β12-α5 (residues 219-239) (Table 1). All 39 residues from α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops were used to build our MSMs. However, since the loops are quite long, we truncated our selection based on the dynamics identified from the MSMs. This is how we selected 22 residues and built our 22x22 matrix for the CVAE analysis.</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewer on the importance of understanding the selection of these residues and the narrative of the study. Therefore, we have expanded the selection to include ALL residues in the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops. The residue boundaries have been mentioned on line 239-240. A list of residues included in the loops, that make up the matrix are also listed in Table 1.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we further reanalysed the data for three different sets of matrices besides the 22x22 matrix previously reported. First, we included ALL residues of two loops in a 39x39 matrix (data split 80:20); followed by 28x28 (residues G149-D161 and A219-P238; data split 80:20 and 70:30) and 17x17 (residues D150b-F156 and S223-R236; data split 80:20 and 70:30) matrices. The results from the new runs have been illustrated in Author response images 1-4. Since the results between 39x39, 28x28 and 22x22 matrices are similar, we have now included the results from the 39x39 matrix in Figure 4. Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 has also been changed to correspond with the results from the 39x39 matrix.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>CVAE based deep learning analysis from a 28x28 matrix with 80 (training):20 (validation) data split.</title><p>(a) The training and validation loss plot as assessed over consecutive epochs at various reduced dimensions.

If sophisticated CVAE embedding is necessary to resolve the relevant dynamical features, then it should be used instead of the dihedrals+tICA to build the MSM. Microstates for the MSM analysis could be easily defined based on k-means clustering of the 14-dimensional CVAE latent space, providing a unified description of the dynamics. If, on the other hand, the dihedral+tICA featurisation is enough to obtain a descriptive and converged model, what is the additional insight offered by the deep learning approach?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment that the use of dihedral featurisation and then the subsequent use of CVAE might seem confusing. The use of such a protocol is not unprecedented and has been published elsewhere (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006801). To place this in the context of our study, we were able to build Markovian models using dihedrals+tICA as our data reduction method (using the backbone atoms and RMSD of loops as input features) and subsequently used them for structural comparisons. The MSMs were generated from trajectories of the tetrameric L1. MSM was preferred here since we wanted to study the transitions between metastable states.</p><p>We then used CVAE as a second method to analyse the dynamics of each of the four individual subunits independently. The CVAE method was sensitive enough to identify subtle conformational differences between the metastable states. The use of CVAE allowed us to simultaneously observe various distances, and identify subunits that contributed to these individual conformations.</p><p>To summarise, by using dihedral+tICA we were able to carry out kinetic modelling of the tetramer, while CVAE helped us study the dynamics of individual subunits.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that one of the routes that we could have taken was to use CVAE clustered data and integrate it to generate our Markov state models. However, we went with tICA instead in this instance. We have therefore added a sentence in the methods section and discussion emphasising our rationale on the use of CVAE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another concern is that presently, all results from the CVAE are analysed and presented after a further projection with tSNE. What is the effect of the compression to 2 dimensions from the original dimensions of the VAE latent space?</p></disp-quote><p>CVAE results are analysed and further projected with tSNE with the purpose of easier visualisation in lower dimensions (such as 2D or 3D) that are more natural for the human eye to follow. That means finding an easier visualisation scheme that facilitates efficient non-linear mapping. But for this non-linear mapping, one of the basic obstacles to overcome is to find an effective solution to the crowding problem i.e. finding how to segregate neighbouring modestly spaced data points into lower dimension while simultaneously maintaining the separation among the clusters. tSNE achieves this by converting these distances to probability scores in the projected lower dimensions while simultaneously allowing to interpret original complex relation and maintaining global and local structure of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The description of the methods is unclear or insufficient on several points:</p><p>1) System preparation. The system preparation strategies should be justified better. The authors simulate a homo-tetramer, building the complex from the monomer crystal structure. This choice should be justified, and the result of the tetramer modeling validated. Why should we trust the complex structure if there are no experimental structures of the tetramer?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that we have not modelled the tetramer, but rather generated the biological functional unit using the symmetry related operators via the PQS server. There are several structures of L1 MBL present in the PDB. Some are deposited as dimers (PDB entry 5DPX) and others as tetramers (PDB entry 2AIO). Our choice of structure was based on the fact that PDB entry 1SML was an apo structure unlike others which are in complex with small molecules. The overall RMSD between 1SML and 5DPX structures over 1064 Ca residues is 0.77 Å.</p><p>We have added further details to the system preparation section. The section now reads as follows:</p><p>“The biological functional unit of L1 metallo-b-lactamase is a tetramer. The coordinates of the L1 MBL deposited in the PDB entry 1SML are monomeric. The symmetry operators required to generate the tetrameric two-fold inverted symmetry are present in the PDB headers. The protein quaternary server (Henrick, 1998) server uses these operators to generate the multimeric biological functional unit of the enzyme. i.e. a tetramer. The overall structure is shown in (Figure 1A), each subunit is in different colors. The PDB file was then protonated at pH 7.0 using proteinprepare module implemented in playmolecule (Martínez-Rosell et al., 2017). Since L1 MBL contains zinc ions, the protonated PDB file was adapted to the Zinc Amber force field (ZAFF) format (Peters et al., 2010). The system was hydrated using TIP3P water in a cubic waterbox, whose dimension extended to 12 Å from the closest protein atom.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Adaptive Simulations. the adaptive simulation strategy is not described. The authors just mention that &quot;Multiple short Markov State Model (MSM)-based adaptively sampled simulations were run&quot;. How? What were the criteria to build the MSM used to re-spawn adaptively the simulations? Was it the same as the one used for the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added to methods section and now reads:</p><p>“Multiple short Markov state model based adaptively sampled simulations were run using the ACEMD molecular dynamics engine. The standard adaptive sampling algorithm performs several rounds of short parallel simulations. To avoid any redundant sampling, the algorithm generates an MSM’s discretized conformational space and uses the stationary distribution of each state to obtain an estimate of their free energy. It then selects any sampled conformation from a low free energy stable state and respawns a new round of simulations. In this context, the MetricSelfDistance function was set to consider the number of native Ca contacts formed from all residues, which were then used to build the MSMs. The exploration value was 0.01 and goal-scoring function was set to 0.3. For each round, 4 simulations of 50 ns were run in parallel until the cumulative time exceeded 100 µs. The trajectory frames were saved every 0.1 ns. 2090 trajectories were collected with each trajectory counting 500 frames.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) MSM. It should be made more clear in the methods that the dynamics of each of the four tetrameric units are used by considering the four units to be independent and featuring the dynamics of each unit, and not of the full tetramer. This is a good strategy to increase the available data for kinetic modeling, but it means that no conclusions can be extracted from cooperative effects across subunits. The CK test results should probably be reported as figure supplements.</p></disp-quote><p>We like to point out that the dynamics of all four tetrameric subunits was used to build the MSMs. It was in CVAE that the dynamics of each tetrameric unit was considered independently. This has now been clarified added to the methods section. A CK plot has been added as Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 as advised by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the results and discussions section:</p><p>1) confidence intervals should be reported for timescales (Figure 2A), mean first-passage times (Figure 2C), probabilities, and free-energies (Figure 2D). Error bars should be reported for the experimental data too (the authors mention triplicate experiments but only report one value per condition).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added confidence intervals for the ITS plot and mean first-passage times. Regarding the MIC data, the value reported is the mode out of at least 3 biological replicates. This has now been mentioned in the methods. To emphasise this, we have also added this in the table legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The description of the MSM results can be greatly improved and streamlined. For instance, the description of the structural features of the 7 macrostates (paragraph &quot;The α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops exist in open, intermediate and closed states&quot;) should come before the description of the most probable paths connecting the different states. Furthermore, to clarify and facilitate the identification of the structural features of the 7 macrostates, the distributions (or averages and percentiles) of the key distances mentioned in the results (e.g., D150c-R236, H151-Y227), etc. should be reported for each state, similar to what has been done in Figure 3D.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, the paragraph &quot;The α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops exist in open, intermediate and closed states&quot; has been moved before the description of the probable paths. The violin plots of the interactions from each metastable state have been added as Figure 3 —figure supplement 2-5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;States 3, 5, and 6 are sub-states of the closed conformation, with differences in the conformations of loops joining β-sheets 10 and 11, far away from the active site&quot;. It's unclear how the macrostates, which were defined based on features describing only the α3-β7 and β12-α5 loops, could resolve structural features unrelated to these two regions.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in pointing this out. The b-sheets are at the distal ends of the active site and directly connected to loop β12-α5. We have reworded the sentence, which now reads:</p><p>“States 3, 5 and 6 are sub-states of the closed conformation. In addition to the slight differences in the conformations of the a3-b7 and b12-a5 loops, minor changes are also observed in the conformations of the adjacent loops at the distal end of the active site.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Although a very thoughtful and detailed MD study, several additional inputs would further strengthen the study. They are described below:</p><p>1) Using orthologs, it will be good to provide the percentage of MBLs (e.g., say at 85% sequence identity) that have elongated alpha3-beta7 and beta12-alpha5 types of loops. AlphaFold2 structures of such sequences can further facilitate loop content estimation. This will enhance the relevance of the study, i.e., applicable to not just one (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia MBL L1) but to MBLs of other pathogens. If the percent of MBLs with elongated loops is say &lt; 10%, should this study be carried out? In that case (i.e., if the elongated loops in MBLs are uncommon.), the threat from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia will need to be emphasized further for the significance of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>The a3-b7 and b12-a5 elongated loops are a structural feature of all B3 MBLs. Subclass B3 groups enzymes from <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, FES<sup>-1</sup> from <italic>Legionella gormanii</italic>, SMB-1 from <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> and GOB-type enzymes from <italic>Elizabethkingia meningoseptica</italic>, BJP-1 from <italic>Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens</italic>. <italic>B. diazoefficiens</italic> is a bacterium of considerable agricultural importance, as it is the most widely used species in commercial inoculants.

However, little is known about the clinical importance of these MBLs mainly because of the difficulties in identifying and distinguishing these bacteria from the other closely related <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species. With no structure available for these b-lactamases, the L1 MBL acts like a model to understand the function of these enzymes.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83928-sa2-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref> illustrates superimposition of several B3 enzymes: L1 in green (PDB 1SML), SMB-1 in cyan (PDB 3VQZ), FEZ-1 in magenta (PDB 1JTZ) and BJP-1 in yellow (PDB 3LVZ), all of them displaying the elongated active site loops.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As a nonpolar surface patch is responsible for MBL L1 multimerization, can alphafold2 also help in estimating the number of multimeric MBLs that are possible based on the non-polar surface patches of alphafold2 modeled MBL proteins? That is, an estimate of the proportion of expected multimeric MBLs with elongated loops would help enhance the relevance of the study to a wider collection of MBLs.</p></disp-quote><p>L1 MBL is unique in its structural architecture with the presence of the non-polar N-terminal loop that is essential for tetramerization. In addition to L1 MBL, POM1/2, PAM1/2/3 and DHT2-1 MBLs also possess this N-terminal non-polar loop. Therefore, a multimer generated for the MBLs with homologous non-polar loop via AlphaFold would also be predicted as a tetramer, since most of the MSA information will come from the closest homolog – the L1 MBL. However, there has been no experimental verification that these MBLs are oligomeric. Furthermore, DeepMind team and others have shown that AlphaFold predictions vary substantially in their global and local agreement with only 40% of residues in the human proteome modelled with high confidence (iScience 25, 104496 (2022), PLOS Computational Biology 18, e1009818 (2022)). While some AlphaFold predictions are astonishingly accurate, many predictions are incompatible with experimental data from corresponding crystal structures (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.21.517405v1). To summarise, L1 MBL can act like a template to model individual subunits, however predicting multimerization in absence of experimental data or verification would at best be speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In describing the conformational landscape of the loops, is mutagenesis the right experiment to capture the essence of the interacting loop residues? To illustrate this point, let there be two situations: (a) only one conformation for a loop which is held in place by a salt bridge, (b) two conformations for the loop, (1/3rd time in conformation-i and 2/3rd time in conformation-j) where conformation-i is held in place by the salt bridge. Can mutagenesis of the salt bridge residues distinguish scenario (a) from that of (b)?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe mutagenesis is one of the best experiments to describe the essence of the interacting loop residues. From the scenarios that the reviewer presents, there would be a large change in (a) and to a lesser extent in (b). A loss of the salt bridge in (b) would not shift the equilibrium resulting from a loss of conformation-i to conformation-j.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Alternatively, let us say the following scenarios: (a) only one conformation for a loop (i.e., an open conformation) with no specific interaction, (b) two conformations for the loop (1/3rd time in conformation-i and 2/3rd time in conformation-j) where conformation-i is held in place by the salt bridge. Can mutagenesis of the salt bridge residues distinguish scenario (a) from that of (b)? It is better to describe the scenarios as in (3) or (4) or some others that are being probed and how mutagenesis captures or distinguishes the different scenarios. From Figure 1B, the impression is that scenarios (in (3) above) are likely the case and it is obvious that mutagenesis of the salt bridge residues will have an impact even if the conformational states were not identified by the current study. [In Figure 1, label '(C)' should be in place of label '(B)' in the legend]</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is better to describe the scenarios as they are being probed. There have been numerous other studies that carry out alanine scanning of multiple residues and then describe the effects of the mutations. However, in our context, we have rationalised the important residues based on the dynamics of the loops and then subsequently mutated them to confirm the predictions from the simulations. The typo has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As the ultimate goal of such a study is to identify better inhibitors, would the following investigation be a better way to utilize the conformational states of the loops? For example, let us say there are 3 loop conformations, i, j, and k that are captured by the enhanced MD sampling and MSM methods. Can each conformation (i.e., i, j, and k) be utilized separately for virtual screening of small molecules (e.g., using Schrodinger such as in ) to demonstrate that searching with each conformation independently (i.e., as three pocket volumes were observed in Figure 3D) provides higher success in the virtual screen than that of the single conformation of the experimental structure?</p></disp-quote><p>Like the reviewer has suggested, it is a possibility that we also envisage. For this very reason we conclude our study with the sentence. “Therefore, the analyses presented here serves as a starting point for more strategic drug design that capitalizes on these dynamics interactions present in the tetramer. Moreover, our analyses offers the opportunity to search for novel compounds that not only modulate inhibition but will overcome standard approaches that have continued to lead to resistance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Authors mention specific interactions of the closed state (e.g., salt bridge R236-D150c, pi-pi stacking Y227-H151, and Q310 sidechain-mainchain hydrogen bond). These interactions are lost in the open state. How does the loss of the 3 interaction energies of the closed state get compensated in the open state? What is the population density of each of the open, intermediate, and closed states? Can the difference (i.e., loss or gain) in the energies due to the 3 interactions (R236-D150c, Y227-H151, and Q310) help explain the population densities of each state?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestion we calculated the pairwise interaction energies between residues. We observe that even in the open state, when there is a considerable change in energy; at no point we observe unfavourable energies between the residues. Therefore, in the open state, the loops behave like a high-tension spring, which is energetically pushed to a more relaxed (stable) and preferred closed conformation. It is therefore not surprising that loops in all crystal structures are in closed conformation.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83928-sa2-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Furthermore, we calculated the population density profiles of the described interactions in the open, intermediate and closed states.
