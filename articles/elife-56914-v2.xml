islet function and glucose homeostasis. We have previously shown that primary cilia directly regulate insulin secretion. However, it remains unclear whether they are also implicated in islet vascularization. At eight weeks, murine <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic>islets show significantly lower intra-islet capillary density with enlarged diameters. Transplanted <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets exhibit delayed re-vascularization and reduced vascular fenestration after engraftment, partially impairing vascular permeability and glucose delivery to β-cells. We identified primary cilia on endothelial cells as the underlying cause of this regulation, via the vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway. In vitro silencing of ciliary genes in endothelial cells disrupts VEGF-A/VEGFR2 internalization and downstream signaling. Consequently, key features of angiogenesis including proliferation and migration are attenuated in human <italic>BBS4</italic> silenced endothelial cells. We conclude that endothelial cell primary cilia regulate islet vascularization and vascular barrier function via the VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primary cilia</kwd><kwd>pancreatic islet</kwd><kwd>islet vascularization</kwd><kwd>VEGF-A</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Center for Diabetes Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerdes</surname><given-names>Jantje Mareike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011264</institution-id><institution>FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Reintegration Grant PIRG07-GA-2010-268397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerdes</surname><given-names>Jantje Mareike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berggren</surname><given-names>Per-Olof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berggren</surname><given-names>Per-Olof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swedish Strategic Research Program Diabetes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berggren</surname><given-names>Per-Olof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swedish Diabetes Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berggren</surname><given-names>Per-Olof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berggren</surname><given-names>Per-Olof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000273</institution-id><institution>Diabetes Research &amp;

In addition, blood vessels are important to establish microenvironments or ‘niches’ required for stem or progenitor cell maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brissova et al., 2014</xref>). Proper islet re-vascularization has also been suggested to be a critical determinant in graft survival following islet transplantation in the treatment of <italic>Type 1 Diabetes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vaithilingam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brissova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brissova et al., 2004</xref>). As the functional barrier between tissues and the blood stream, vascular endothelial cells in both central and peripheral organs of insulin action have been implicated in insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Konishi et al., 2017</xref>) and diabetes etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goligorsky, 2017</xref>). However, functional assessment of nutrient delivery and insulin disposal across the endothelial barrier has been difficult, since blood vessels are not preserved in vitro after islet isolation, while pancreas is difficult to access in situ with long-term, non-invasive live imaging techniques.</p><p>Anatomically, the exocrine pancreas is organized by branching ducts while the endocrine islets of Langerhans are scattered throughout the exocrine tissue and interconnected by blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cleaver and Dor, 2012</xref>). During development, pancreatic bud and blood vessel formation are initiated at the same time and, although both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic tissue are derived from the same progenitors, vessel density in the exocrine portion of the organ is five times lower compared to intra-islet vessel density after maturity. Moreover, islet capillaries have ten times more diaphragm-covered fenestrae than the exocrine pancreas- a distinctive feature that facilitates rapid exchange of fluids and small solutes between tissue and blood stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kolka and Bergman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henderson and Moss, 1985</xref>). This suggests that specific local factors play a role in endocrine pancreatic vascularization.</p><p>One of the main players in islet vascularization is vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) dependent signaling. VEGF-A is produced by islet endocrine cells (both α- and β-cells) and binds to VEGFR2 on endothelial cells, which is crucial for the maintenance of a dense and leaky islet microvasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brissova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lammert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christofori et al., 1995</xref>). While pancreas-specific VEGF-A ablation does not completely block islet vascularization, islet fenestration is crucially dependent on VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling. Delivery of nutrients to β-cells and disposal of insulin into the blood vessels is modulated by fenestrated blood vessels that are fine tuning the system to optimize glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lammert et al., 2003</xref>). Constitutive, targeted deletion of <italic>Vegfa</italic> from β-cells at embryonic development revealed a critical role for VEGF-A dependent signals in islet vessel formation, maintenance and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brissova et al., 2006</xref>). β-cell-specific <italic>Vegfa</italic> deficient mice are severely glucose intolerant but show normal glucose response and insulin secretion in isolated islets, suggesting that either nutrients (such as glucose) are not delivered efficiently to the β-cells or insulin disposal into the blood stream is significantly hampered <italic>in</italic> vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brissova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lammert et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, removal of <italic>Vegfa</italic> from mature β-cells at a later stage has a less severe impact on glucose tolerance although intra-islet capillary density is reduced by 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reinert et al., 2013</xref>). This may suggest that, after islet maturation, local VEGF-A/VEGFR2 dependent signaling is less important for the maintenance of intra-islet capillaries and insulin disposal compared to during development. Changing the biomechanical properties such as actomyosin cortex tension of epithelial cells in developing islets by deletion of <italic>Integrin-linked kinase</italic> (<italic>Ilk</italic>) specifically blocks intra-islet capillary formation completely and leads to glucose intolerance. Instead, blood vessels accumulate in the islet periphery and form an envelope-like structure suggesting that biomechanics of epithelial tissues are important determinants of blood vessel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kragl et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Primary cilia are present on roughly eighty percent of the cells in the adult mammalian organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wheatley et al., 1996</xref>). In metabolically active organs, they play a role in sensing metabolic signals and energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Volta and Gerdes, 2017</xref>). We have shown that β-cell cilia play a role in insulin signaling, insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Volta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerdes et al., 2014</xref>). Endothelial cells are also ciliated, and endothelial cilia have been implicated in flow-sensing and vascular hypertension, intracranial blood vessel formation, and atherosclerosis prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nauli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nauli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kallakuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dinsmore and Reiter, 2016</xref>). Recent studies further unveiled a novel role of primary cilium in preventing vascular regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vion et al., 2018</xref>). Here we address the role of endothelial cilia in re-vascularization of transplanted islets and regulation of vascular barrier function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intra-islet capillary density is reduced in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup>pancreata</title><p>To test if primary cilia play a role in pancreatic islet vascularization, we characterized intra-islet capillaries in pancreatic cryosections of 2-month-old <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (N = 8). <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are a model of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (OMIM #209900), a ciliopathy characterized mainly by polydactyly, renal and gonadal malformations and truncal obesity. <italic>Bbs4</italic> encodes a protein that is a component of the BBSome complex, a protein super complex thought to be involved in the sorting of membrane proteins to and from the ciliary compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liew et al., 2014</xref>). While <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice form primary cilia, they are not fully functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mykytyn et al., 2004</xref>). The symptoms show good overlap with what has been observed in BBS patients and include obesity, male sterility, and impaired glucose handling. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) immunofluorescence, as a marker of endothelial cells, revealed 35% reduced intra-islet capillary density compared to wildtype (wt) littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). To calculate intra-islet capillary density, the relative PECAM-1 positive volume was normalized to insulin-positive islet volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, p=0.0019). In addition, the average vessel diameter was increased by 18% compared to that in wt controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, p&lt;0.0001). Because tissue integrity is often compromised in cryopreserved samples, we corroborated our results by whole mount staining and imaging of freshly isolated islets of 2-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). In good agreement with our previous observations, capillary density was reduced by 34% and vessel diameter increased by 20% in islets of <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (p&lt;0.0001 for both). Of note, we observed no change in pericyte coverage of intra-islet capillaries based on Neuron-glial 2 (NG2) immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, p=0.7045). In 4-month-old <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, however, the difference in intra-islet capillary density and diameter in <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice approximated that of wt littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–1E</xref>, p=0.0676 and 0.0736 respectively). There is no evidence of significant changes in β-cell mass or insulin content in <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, and the observation of only slightly but not statistically significantly larger islets in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice at 4 weeks of age rules out effects of islet size on vessel density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerdes et al., 2014</xref>). These dynamics implicate that primary cilia and centrosome/basal body integrity play a role during the vascularization of pancreatic islets. Importantly, there was no detectable difference in vascularization of the exocrine portion of the pancreas at two months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Bbs4</italic> function seems to be mostly restricted to the endocrine pancreas and not relevant for the exocrine compartment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets show delayed vascularization and enlarged capillary diameter in the pancreas and the anterior chamber of the eye upon transplantation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immuno-fluorescence staining of pancreatic sections from 2-month-old wt and <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice showing islets (insulin, red) and intra-islet capillaries (PECAM-1, green). (<bold>B–C</bold>) Quantification of relative intra-islet PECAM-1 positive volume, normalized to insulin-positive volume (<bold>B</bold>) and average intra-islet capillary diameters (<bold>C</bold>) in wt and <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> pancreatic sections.

This approach allows for longitudinal and non-invasive in vivo monitoring of islet engraftment and re-vascularization. We and others have previously shown that endothelial cells disappear over prolonged periods of cultivation of isolated islets. Immediately after isolation, endothelial cells maintain the intra-islet capillary network. After two days in culture, endothelial cell clusters remain, whereas seven days post-isolation, intra-islet endothelial cells are generally lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, when transplanted shortly after isolation, a significant number of endothelial cells from the donor survives and contributes to revascularization of the islet graft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brissova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Linn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nyqvist et al., 2005</xref>).

We determined the rate of re-vascularization by intravenous (i.v.) injection of fluorescently labeled 70 KDa dextran once a week for a total of twelve weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The percentage of dextran-labeled vascular structure in total islet volume (based on backscatter signal; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ilegems et al., 2015</xref>) was used as a measure of islet vascularity, and re-vascularization rate of each islet was calculated by normalizing its dextran-labeled volume at each individual week to the volume at twelve weeks. Two weeks after transplantation, <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> islets showed significantly less re-vascularization compared to wt controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

As previously reported, in isolated islets or <italic>Bbs4</italic> depleted MIN6m9 cells, we did not observe a difference in β-cell glucose uptake or glucose metabolism. However, the role of <italic>Bbs4</italic> in islet endothelial cell barrier function remains uncharacterized. Blinded analysis of electron micrographs showed significantly reduced fenestration in the capillaries of <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> compared to wt islet grafts in the ACE four months after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, 27% lower, p=0.0006). Although the basement membrane seems slightly thicker in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets, we did not observe significant thickening of this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, p=0.1414). To test if reduced fenestration could affect the permeability and thus barrier function of <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islet capillaries, we intravenously injected 40 kDa fluorescently labeled dextran and measured the diffusion of dextran-related fluorescence outside the islet graft over time (inside the dashed area not including the part of vessel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Fluorescently labeled dextran of different sizes were tested prior to the experiments, and we chose 40 KDa dextran due to its specific leakage through fenestrated islet vessels instead of surrounding iris vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). During the time of the experiments, fluorescence intensity immediately increases outside the islet graft followed by a plateau that is established at comparable times after dextran injection due to the active drainage of aqueous humor. Fluorescence intensity is normalized to islet size for better comparison. Importantly, both the initial rate and the plateau are decreased in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islet grafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, p=0.0478). Simulation of this process also supports different kinetics of dye leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that the delivery of medium sized molecules out of the blood stream is less efficient in <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> intra islet capillaries. Nutrients such as glucose or fatty acids are small molecules that often rely on active transport across cell membranes. But in the case of highly fenestrated capillaries, solutes including small molecules, ions and hormones pass freely through the pores between the blood and luminal surface. To test if glucose delivery to islet cells was affected by the ultrastructural changes in islet capillaries, we injected fluorescently labeled glucose analog (2-NBDG) into wt animals transplanted with <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and wt islets. 2-NBDG is rapidly transported into islet cells from intra-islet capillaries and simultaneously leaked into the surrounding aqueous humor from iris vessels. We followed 2-NBDG uptake by measuring fluorescence intensity originating from islet cells over time, and normalized it to the fluorescence intensity originating from the aqueous humor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), since the 2-NBDG leaking from iris vessels is determined by the recipient animal and not by the individual eye.

This result points to a critical role of ciliary/basal body proteins in maintaining islet capillary fenestration with implications for the delivery of glucose and potentially other nutrients to islet cells. To investigate the physiological relevance of our findings, we utilized our transplantation model in combination with <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or wt islets to better understand how reduced intra-islet capillary density and permeability may affect islet output and glucose tolerance. It was previously shown that 100 islets (diameter between 150 and 200 μm) transplanted into the ACE of chemically induced diabetic mice were sufficient to revert blood glucose concentration to normoglycemic levels. This amount of pancreatic islets is defined as marginal islet mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2018</xref>).

Four weeks after transplantation, mice transplanted with <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> islets were glucose intolerant compared to those mice transplanted with wt islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Eight weeks after transplantation, mice showed impaired glucose tolerance and, 12 weeks post-transplantation, only mildly impaired glucose handling compared to those transplanted with wt islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and K</xref>). Overall, the phenotype is ameliorated over time, which is consistent with our previous observations in re-vascularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), suggesting that a lack of capillaries in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets indeed negatively affects whole body glucose homeostasis. Glucose handling is mildly impaired by the end of 12 weeks, which is probably caused by impaired vascular barrier function in combination with defective 1<sup>st</sup> phase insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerdes et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Dysfunctional intra-islet vasculature in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets undermines glucose metabolism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electron microscopic images of wt and <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> islet graft dissected from wt recipient eyes, showing fenestrated islet capillaries (arrows) and basement membrane (asterisks). Scale bar: 1 μm.

Therefore, we tested if VEGFR2-dependent phospho-activation of downstream signaling molecules, including Phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1), Protein Kinase B (Akt) and Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK 42/44) were affected. We used primary human endothelial cells HDMEC stably transduced with lentivirus encoding shRNA targeting <italic>BBS4</italic>, and tested before (t = 0), seven and fifteen minutes after VEGF-A addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). In control cells (scrambled), VEGFR2 Tyr 1175 phosphorylation is markedly increased at seven minutes (4.3-fold) and sustained until 15 min (3.4-fold) after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). By comparison, pTyr1175 levels increased minimally in <italic>BBS4</italic>-depleted HDMECs (2-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). At the same time, total levels of VEGFR2 are also lowered in absence of Bbs4 by 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, p=0.0101). In addition, we found that EphrinB2 protein level is slightly reduced in <italic>BBS4</italic>-depleted HDMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1B</xref> and 5%, p=0.0051), corroborating our previous finding of decreased gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). While PLCγ1 phosphorylation peaks at seven minutes and decreases 15 min after stimulation in control cells, loss of Bbs4 leads to a 40% attenuation in PLCγ1 phosphorylation at seven minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, p=0.0336). Similarly, pAkt and pMAPK 42/44 were significantly reduced in <italic>BBS4</italic>-depleted cells seven and fifteen minutes after VEGF-A addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, p=0.0222 and p=0.0010, respectively). These in vitro experiments are suggestive but do not necessarily reflect in vivo processes of islet vascularization. Therefore, we further validated these results in freshly isolated islets from wt and <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals, which still contain endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In unstimulated islet cells, pAkt and pMAPK baseline levels did not differ between wt and <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells. Ten minutes after addition of 100 ng/ml VEGF-A, pAkt levels increased 2.2-fold in wt but only 1.4-fold in <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. Likewise, pMAPK levels increased 3-fold in wt but only 1.5-fold in <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, demonstrating that VEGF-A triggered downstream signaling is not sufficiently activated in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Importantly, similar experiments on wt islets cultured for seven days to diminish intra-islet endothelial cells showed markedly lower response to VEGF-A stimulation; therefore, VEGF-A/VEGFR2 dependent signaling cascades in endothelial cells contribute significantly to overall VEGF-A dependent signaling in whole murine islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>).</p><p>Binding of VEGF-A to receptors triggers their endocytosis instantly, which is the initial step for subsequent intracellular signaling, and mainly regulated by EphrinB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sawamiphak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakayama et al., 2013</xref>). Several studies have shown that VEGFR2 does not signal from the plasma membrane but from other intracellular compartments, mainly early endosomes and the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakayama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruns et al., 2010</xref>). The observed attenuation of VEGFR2 downstream signaling may stem from dysregulation of these initial steps. Therefore, we examined the uptake of biotinylated VEGF-A in <italic>BBS4</italic>-depleted HDMECs. After 30 min incubation, <italic>BBS4</italic>-depleted cells had only internalized 45% VEGF-A compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>, p=0.0101). We also tested VEGF-A uptake dynamics in a pancreatic endothelial cell line, MS-1 cells. Similar to our observations in HDMECs, control MS-1 cells efficiently and rapidly internalized VEGF-A, while by comparison, <italic>Ift88</italic>-depleted MS-1 cells internalized less VEGF-A after 30 min (61% compared to controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H–1J</xref>, p=0.0027). We further tested if VEGFR2 internalization was impaired in <italic>BBS4</italic>-depleted HDMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Plasma membrane-bound VEGFR2 was evident prior to VEGF-A stimulation in both control and <italic>BBS4</italic>-depleted HDMECs. After ten min incubation with VEGF-A, a significant number of VEGFR2 was internalized in control cells, while 25% more VEGFR2 remained on the cell surface in <italic>BBS4</italic>-silenced cells, which indicates decreased internalization of VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, p=0.0019) and may be explained by our previous finding of lowered EphrinB2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). These results suggest that the VEGFR2 internalization upon ligand binding is regulated by ciliary and basal body proteins.</p><p>VEGF-A signaling triggers a complex array of biological processes including endothelial cell proliferation and migration, two characteristic processes of angiogenesis. We tested the effect of <italic>Bbs4</italic>-depletion on proliferation by ethynyldeoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation in MS-1 cells. Under the chosen conditions, VEGF-A induced cell proliferation in <italic>Bbs4</italic>-depleted cells was reduced by 27% compared to controls cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>, p=0.0024). A scratch assay revealed that <italic>Bbs4</italic>-depleted cells covered only 73% of the distance of control cells in the same time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>, p&lt;0.0001), similar to previous reports of ciliary involvement in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vion et al., 2018</xref>). These independent lines of evidence, i.e. reduced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and impaired vessel fenestration, all point to a role for cilia and basal body proteins in VEGF-A/VEGFR2 dependent regulation of endothelial cell function.</p><p>An important negative regulator of VEGF-A dependent signaling is Notch1 –dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we tested the ability of Ift88 depleted pancreatic endothelial cells to respond to Notch1- dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Placing firefly luciferase under the control of multimerized CSL response elements upstream of a minimal promoter showed that the <underline>N</underline>otch1 <underline>i</underline>ntra<underline>c</underline>ellular <underline>d</underline>omain (NICD) elicited a weaker response in <italic>Ift88</italic> depleted cells compared to controls. We did not observe different responses in the absence of NICD suggesting that the phenotype was specific to Notch1- dependent signaling. Because Notch1 signaling is a negative regulator of VEGF-A dependent signaling, loss of Notch1 signaling cannot explain the observed phenotype.</p><p>We also examined the relative expression of the same set of angiogenic factors in freshly isolated islets and found, while most expression levels remain unchanged, VEGF-A expression was reduced by 20% in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets compared to wt controls. <italic>Von-Hippel-Lindau</italic> gene expression, a known ciliary protein mutated in Von Hippel-Lindau disease and a known regulator of Hypoxia induced factor 1a, remains unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1L</xref>). VEGF-A gene expression was also slightly decreased in βICKO islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1M</xref>). To test if this reduction was physiologically relevant, we tested VEGF-A secretion in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and βICKO islets. Loss of Bbs4 or Ift88 function respectively decreased VEGF-A secretion by 33% and 28% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1N</xref>, p=0.0063 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1O</xref>, p=0.0070), which could be explained by the reduction in VEGF-A gene expression. Altogether, these results consistently suggest that the intra-islet VEGF-A signaling pathway is impaired in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several recent studies have addressed the role of primary cilia in endothelial cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nauli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kallakuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dinsmore and Reiter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vion et al., 2018</xref>). However, the precise role of primary cilia in islet vascularization remains unclear. Here, we reveal the role of the ciliary/basal body machinery in islet vascularization during islet islet engraftment upon transplantation. <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets exhibited lower intra-islet capillary density and enlarged capillaries at two months of age. Similarly, <italic>Pifo</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets also have a reduced intra-islet capillary density and increased vessel diameter compared to littermate controls at the same age. This suggests that the observed defects are probably due to dysfunctional cilia and not related to other, non-ciliary functions of <italic>Bbs4</italic>. Of note, although Bbs4, Pifo and Ift88 are linked to ciliary function, their individual roles do not overlap precisely. Bbs4 localizes to the BBSome complex at the basal body and is involved in sorting of proteins to and from the ciliary compartment, but cilia still form. By comparison, Pifo mediates Aurora Kinase A (AurA)-dependent cilium disassembly resulting in persistent ciliation and bifurcation of cilia. In addition, cilia function is impaired as evidenced by laterality defects in <italic>Pifo</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kinzel et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, Ift88 depletion ablates all cilia. Importantly, though, vesicle docking still occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), resulting in an abnormal cell that should not be interpreted as a wildtype, unciliated cell. Phenotypic variations could be explained by these different roles, but the fact that they are overlapping strongly implicates the cilia/basal machinery in endothelial function.</p><p>Previous work has shown hyperglycemia and elevated circulating insulin levels in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice at 4–6 months of age. This suggests increased insulin demand and thus insulin resistance, which could potentially affect islet vascularity. Indeed, studies with three independent insulin resistance mouse models showed that intra-islet vessel area significantly increased, primarily due to morphological changes, namely vessel dilation but not angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, studies in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF) also demonstrated that early stages of insulin resistance and islet hyperplasia are accompanied by hypervascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2006</xref>). Of note, <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice only become significantly overweight at 3–4 months of age, while we observe changes in islet vascularization at 2 months of age. We believe that we can exclude confounding effects of increasing body weight and insulin resistance on islet vascularization at the time of our investigation because the intra-islet capillary density is decreased, and not increased as is the case for models of insulin resistance.</p><p>Islet vascularization is typically regulated by paracrine signaling between endocrine cells (including α-, β- and δ-cells) and endothelial cells in the tissue surrounding the islet. Islet transplantation into the ACE and subsequent non-invasive and longitudinal monitoring of re-vascularization recapitulated this phenotype. In addition, this approach allows us to observe islets depleted of <italic>Bbs4</italic> in a wildtype environment similar to targeted knockout islets. Given the problems with β-cell or islet specific Cre lines such as leakiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) or activity in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Honig et al., 2010</xref>) our approach avoids these confounding factors. On the other hand, removing cilia from all endothelial cells also makes it difficult to exclude secondary, indirect effects that stem from endothelial cells in another tissue. In our experimental setup, both control and <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> islets are transplanted into the eyes of the same wt animal, and vice versa, which minimizes the variability between different recipient animals and therefore makes it ideal for comparison.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the observed phenotype is largely driven by impaired ciliary and basal body function in endothelial cells. First, <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> islets that were transplanted two days after isolation were re-vascularized at a lower rate than those transplanted after seven days. Prolonged islet cultivation depletes donor endothelial cells (in this case <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> endothelial cells). <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> islet endothelial cells are less efficient at islet revascularization compared to wt endothelial cells of the recipient. Second, wt islets transplanted into the ACE of <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were more slowly re-vascularized when transplanted after seven days compared to two days of tissue culture. The former condition shifts the composition of the islet vasculature toward a higher proportion of ciliary/basal body deficient <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> endothelial cells, which are less responsive to the angiogenic demands than wt endothelial cells. Third, native and transplanted βICKO islets (β-cell-specific <italic>Ift88</italic> depletion) show no obvious defect in capillary density, diameter or revascularization rate. Although we cannot exclude a minor contribution by reduced VEGF-A secretion from both <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and βICKO islets, the effect on islet vascularization is likely minimal and mostly compensated for by circulating VEGF-A. Islet vascularization is in part modulated by changing the actomyosin cortex of islet cells; while we have shown EMT-like polarization defects in β-cells depleted of Ift88, we did not observe a complete loss of intra-islet capillary formation nor an enveloping structure of blood vessels surrounding the islets in βICKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kragl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Volta et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, primary cilia are also present on some α- and δ-cells of the murine pancreatic islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>); we cannot fully exclude that they might play a role in islet re-vascularization, and that this might explain the difference between the findings in global knockout models <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Pifo</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or βICKO respectively. Because previous work has shown that β-cell VEGF-A secretion is responsible for the bulk of islet vascularization we believe that α-cell cilia are unlikely key denominators of islet vascularization. Here we suggest that there is an important, albeit not exclusive role for the endothelial ciliary/basal body apparatus in islet vascularization.</p><p>VEGF-A/VEGFR2 is a key signaling pathway for maintaining the especially dense and leaky islet microvasculature. Our results suggest that dysfunctional primary cilia alter the VEGF-A/VEGFR2 paracrine signaling activity in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets by impairing the internalization of ligand-bound VEGFR2 receptor. VEGF-A/VEGFR2 internalization and subsequent phosphorylation are disrupted in endothelial cells depleted of <italic>BBS4</italic> and <italic>Ift88</italic>, respectively. Several downstream signaling components are insufficiently activated in good agreement with previous observations. We conclude that defective VEGF-A/VEGFR2 dependent signaling in endothelial cells is the underlying cause of the observed phenotypes, namely reduced intra-islet capillary density and impaired fenestration of intra-islet micro-vessels. However, we cannot rule out a possible role of the Notch1 signaling pathway in the observed vascular phenotypes, although we did not detect significant changes in Dll4 expression in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets. Extensive studies are required to further pinpoint the involvement of other angiogenic signals which could also be affected by cilia dysfunction.</p><p>Intra-islet capillary networks provide endocrine cells with nutrients, oxygen and growth factors which support the development and maturation of islets. In addition, the microvasculature constantly adapts its barrier properties to the dynamic metabolic rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pi et al., 2018</xref>). Finely tuned interplay between nutrient delivery to islet endocrine cells, endocrine cell function and insulin disposal into the blood stream is essential for the maintenance of glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brissova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwashita et al., 2007</xref>). Whereas intra-islet capillary density normalizes over time in <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> islets, vessel function remains impaired when cilia/basal function is compromised more than four months after transplantation. Blood vessel fenestration is significantly reduced in <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> islets. Fenestrae are key features of islet capillaries that enable efficient nutrient delivery from and insulin disposal into blood vessels. In vivo 2-NBDG diffusion is less efficient and leakage of 40 KDa dextran diminished when <italic>Bbs4</italic> is deleted from intra-islet capillaries. With respect to glucose handling, decreased vessel permeability in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets could impose an additional barrier on insulin disposal, adding to the observed defects in 1<sup>st</sup> phase insulin secretion. We thus suggest that defective delivery of nutrients such as glucose to β-cells and the disposal of insulin from β-cells into the blood stream may contribute to impaired glucose handling of <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerdes et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Functional imaging of micro-vessels remains challenging and is largely limited to easily accessible tissues such as cornea and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honkura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Transplantation of islets into the ACE not only renders established intra-islet capillaries more accessible for standard imaging techniques but also provides the opportunity to follow dynamic processes such as islet re-vascularization under physiological as well as pathological conditions. This technique may also prove to be a useful resource for further investigations into blood vessel function in other tissues when transplanted into the ACE.</p><p>Finally, re-vascularization and establishing a functional interface between islet cells and blood supply are not only important in the context of islet transplantation but will likely prove vital for all approaches to β-cell replacement therapy. Moreover, considering the scarcity of organ donations worldwide, it is of paramount importance to optimize the outcomes of organ transplants. Revascularization rates in liver transplants correlate with long-term graft survival, renal function and early allograft dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchholz et al., 2018</xref>). Understanding the signaling role of primary cilia in this process provides us with novel targets to improve tissue re-vascularization and hence graft survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Images of islet grafts were obtained by a Leica SP5 system with 25 × objective (N.A.0.95, Leica Microsystems, Germany). Viscotears (Laboratoires Théa, France) was used as an immersion medium between the lens and the mouse eyes. For visualization of islet vascularization, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (Baxter, USA). 100 μl of PBS solution containing 5 mg/ml of 70 kDa Texas Red-conjugated dextran (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was injected intravenously prior to imaging.

Graft volume was estimated from backscatter signals using Volocity image analysis software (Perkin Elmer, USA). Dextran-labeled islet capillaries were identified at different time points, using the same thresholds for all groups at all times, and structures smaller than 10 μm<sup>3</sup> were automatically excluded. Their diameters and volumes were calculated using Volocity. Re-vascularization rate at 1 to 8 weeks post-transplantation was calculated as the percentage of islet vascular volume at each individual time point to that of the same islet at 12 week end point. Relative vascularity of each islet graft at 12 weeks post-transplantation was calculated from dividing the volume of islet vessels by the estimated graft volume. For FITC-dextran and 2-NBDG leakage analysis, images were first movement corrected in MATLAB (MathWorks, USA). Afterwards, time lapse confocal image stacks were analyzed and fluorescence intensity was quantified using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) with the plugin Time Series Analyzer V3. Islet cells were identified by backscatter signals. The simulation of in vivo leakage kinetics was done in GraphPad Prism using the model of plateau followed by one phase association.</p><p>Image analysis for histological sections were performed with Volocity. The region of interest per stack (ROI) was drawn according to insulin staining. The surface area and volume of PECAM-1, NG2, and insulin-positive structures were calculated using Volocity. Islet capillary density was obtained by counting the PECAM-1-positive volume and dividing it by the insulin-positive volume enclosed in this region. Pericyte coverage was calculated by counting NG2-positive surface area and dividing it by PECAM-1-positive surface area in the same insulin-positive region.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eckhard Lammert (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study sets out to uncover the mechanism underlying islet primary cilia control of islet function and in turn whole-body glucose homeostasis. The authors had previously shown that primary cilia on islet β-cells regulate insulin secretion. Observed changes in islet vascular density in <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, supported by well-planned re-vascularization experiments of <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> islet transplanted into WT mice, and vice versa, showed that islet primary cilia also do play some role in supporting vascularization. These observations were corroborated in another ciliopathy model (Pifo KO) further implicating primary cilia as being important to neo-vascularization. Cell-specific primary cilia contribution to islet vascularization was also addressed to a certain extent by showing that deletion of primary cilia on β-cells did not affect islet vascularization. Through in vitro as well as ex vivo studies, the authors concluded that primary cilia on endothelial cells, and separately islet primary cilia, facilitate VEGFR2 signaling required for normal neo-vascular growth. in vitro studies are thorough in their design and in their use of experimental controls. The authors should be commended for putting together this large body of work and for presenting it in an elegant, easy to understand, manner.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) The authors do not cite sufficient original work (such as the first paper describing the role of VEGF in islet vascularisation and glucose tolerance, published in Curr Biology 2003, or the paper on the biomechanics of islets in vessel development, published in Nat Comms 2016. They should introduce these papers from the beginning to better highlight why they designed their experiments as they did.</p><p>2) While use of multiple knockout models is a positive, it is likely that each affects cilia and the role of cilia in islet vascularization in different ways. Please discuss.</p><p>3) It remains unclear whether primary endothelial cell cilia are solely responsible for the observed islet phenotype, as stated in the title. Cilia were suggested to be on other cell-types (eg. α-cells, Hughes et al., 2020). Specific deletion of primary endothelial cell cilia would have greatly helped address the hypothesis. The authors state that endothelial cell-specific cilia KO from other tissues could potentially confound the interpretation of the data. This is a valid concern and the work could be strengthened by showing that primary cilia were only found on endothelial and β-cells (and this can be shown through primary cilia distribution within the islet). The βICKO mouse results sufficiently addresses the concern of β-cell contribution (with the caveat of the slight time gap of 8wk in <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and approx 12wk in βICKO).</p><p>4) Figure 6—figure supplement 1D. To pinpoint endothelial cell culpability in the observed changes, it will be useful to test whether VEGF-A still stimulates downstream phosphorylation cascade in endothelial-cell depleted islets (after 7 days).</p><p>5) It would be helpful to the reader to introduce the rationale, advantages and disadvantages for the different models. For example, introducing the <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model before detailing the experimental results would help the reader.</p><p>6) In Figure 1A, is islet mass affected in knockout mice at two months and further at four months of age? Does variation in islet size directly affect the vessel density measurements?</p><p>7) Bbs4 knockout mice have increased body weight. Are these mice generally healthy? Does knocking out Bbs4 lead to peripheral insulin resistance and islet hypertrophy and hyperplasia (as in other models of insulin resistance)? Please discuss whether the increase in body weight would affect the islet response to insulin resistance and vascularization.</p><p>8) Please discuss how the current results relate to prior reports from some of the authors on the manuscript: a) Sci Rep. 2016 Feb 22;6:21448. doi: 10.1038/srep21448. Non-invasive cell type selective in vivo monitoring of insulin resistance dynamics. b) FASEB J. 2019 Jan;33(1):204-218. doi: 10.1096/fj.201800826R.

They should introduce these papers from the beginning to better highlight why they designed their experiments as they did.</p></disp-quote><p>Our sincerest apologies for not sufficiently citing the work that this study is built on. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, indeed, and have failed to acknowledge it.</p><p>While islet vessel formation itself does not depend on islet derived VEGF-A, fenestration is strictly dependent on VEGF-A expression in islet cells and VEGF-A dependent signaling in endothelial cells. In addition, biomechanical properties of islet cells direct a sorting process of endothelial and epithelial cells and ultimately switch between invasion into or envelopment of islet cells by endothelial cells. We have shown that β-cell polarity is disturbed when cilia are impaired and that this is also affecting actin dynamics. However, <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>islets are vascularized, albeit at a lower density than those of littermates, suggesting that the change in biomechanical properties of Bbs4 depleted cells does not lead to a complete switch towards vessels enveloping the islets.</p><p>We have changed the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“While pancreas-specific VEGF-A ablation does not completely block islet vascularization, islet fenestration is crucially dependent on VEGF-A/ VEGFR2-dependent signaling. Delivery of nutrients to β-cells and disposal of insulin into the blood vessels is modulated by fenestrated blood vessels that are fine tuning the system to optimize glucose tolerance.”</p><p>“Changing the biomechanical properties such as actomyosin cortex tension of epithelial cells in developing islets by deletion of Integrated-linked kinase (ILK) specifically blocks intra-islet capillary formation completely and leads to glucose intolerance. Instead, blood vessels accumulate in the islet periphery and form an envelope-like structure suggesting that biomechanics of epithelial tissues are important determinants of blood vessel formation.”</p><p>We have also added to the Discussion:</p><p>“Islet vascularization is in part modulated by changing the actomyosin cortex of islet cells; while we have shown EMT-like polarization defects in β-cells depleted of Ift88, we did not observe a complete loss of intra-islet capillary formation nor an enveloping structure of blood vessels surrounding the islets in βICKO mice.”</p><p>Again, we apologize for our omission and hope that our revisions have amended for our mistake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While use of multiple knockout models is a positive, it is likely that each affects cilia and the role of cilia in islet vascularization in different ways. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Indeed, we feel that the use of multiple knockout models can help us triangulate the role primary cilia play in the process of islet vascularization and nutrient/ insulin delivery to/ from the blood stream.</p><p><italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are a model of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) and show reasonable overlap with the symptoms that BBS patients manifest. While ciliogenesis is not interrupted in these animals, cilia are not fully functional. The BBSome is thought to mediate sorting of membrane associated proteins to and from the cilium. Some evidence suggests that cells are not polarized correctly in Bbs-depleted cells and non-canonical, β-catenin independent signaling (planar cell polarity signaling) is impaired<sup>1-4</sup>. We have shown that EMT-like polarity defects lead to defects in actin polymerization dynamics and early endocytosis.</p><p><italic>Pifo</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice show defects in cilia disassembly and re-entry into the cell cycle mediated by AurA activity. PIFO accumulates at the basal body during cilia disassembly and interacts with ciliary targeting complexes. While the exact role of PIFO in cilia function is not known, known defects include left-right asymmetry defects and heart looping defects. This suggests that cilia function is impaired and that at least a subset of ciliary signaling pathways- such as the symmetry breaking morphogen gradient- are affected by cilia dysfunction.</p><p>Depletion of Ift88 from cells leads to defects in ciliogenesis and cilia maintenance and function. Importantly, the early steps of ciliogenesis including vesicle docking are still taking place, so Ift88-depleted cells are not simply cells without a cilium, they are dysfunctional. We have shown that Ift88 depletion leads to stabilization of β-catenin in the cell and subsequent EMT-like polarity defects in an insulinoma cell line. We suggest that similar impairments are present in endothelial cells and that this is affecting actin dynamics.</p><p>We have added a paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“Of note, although Bbs4, Pifo and Ift88 are linked to ciliary function, their individual roles do not overlap precisely. Bbs4 localizes to the BBSome complex at the basal body and is involved in sorting of proteins to and from the ciliary compartment, but cilia still form. By comparison, Pifo mediates Aurora Kinase A (AurA)-dependent cilium disassembly resulting in persistent ciliation and bifurcation of cilia. In addition, cilia function is impaired as evidenced by laterality defects in <italic>Pifo</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice<sup>5</sup>. By contrast, Ift88 depletion ablates all cilia. Importantly, though, vesicle docking still occurs, resulting in an abnormal cell that should not be interpreted as a wildtype, unciliated cell. Phenotypic variations could be explained by these different roles, but the fact that they are overlapping strongly implicates the cilia/ basal machinery in endothelial function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It remains unclear whether primary endothelial cell cilia are solely responsible for the observed islet phenotype, as stated in the title. Cilia were suggested to be on other cell-types (eg. α-cells, Hughes et al., 2020). Specific deletion of primary endothelial cell cilia would have greatly helped address the hypothesis. The authors state that endothelial cell-specific cilia KO from other tissues could potentially confound the interpretation of the data. This is a valid concern and the work could be strengthened by showing that primary cilia were only found on endothelial and β-cells (and this can be shown through primary cilia distribution within the islet). The βICKO mouse results sufficiently addresses the concern of β-cell contribution (with the caveat of the slight time gap of 8wk in Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup> and approx 12wk in βICKO).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. We can confirm that α- but also a subset of δ- cells are ciliated as well. However, in a β-cell-specific VEGF-A knockout mouse model, islet vascularization is strongly impacted- although α-cells still express VEGF-A. While we cannot fully exclude a role for α- and δ-cell cilia in the vascularization process, we think that it is unlikely that they are playing a major role in the islet vascularization process. We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“Similarly, primary cilia are also present on some α- and δ-cells of the murine pancreatic islet<sup>6</sup>; we cannot fully exclude that they might play a role in islet re-vascularization, and that this might explain the difference between the findings in global knockout models <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Pifo</italic><sup>-/-</sup> or βICKO respectively. Because previous work has shown that β-cell VEGF-A secretion is responsible for the bulk of islet vascularization we believe that α-cell cilia are unlikely key denominators of islet vascularization. Here we suggest that there is an important, albeit not exclusive role for the endothelial ciliary/ basal body apparatus in islet vascularization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6—figure supplement 1D. To pinpoint endothelial cell culpability in the observed changes, it will be useful to test whether VEGF-A still stimulates downstream phosphorylation cascade in endothelial-cell depleted islets (after 7 days).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To test whether VEGF-A stimulation persists in islets depleted of endothelial cells, we isolated islets from 2 female C57/BL6 mice and kept them in culture for 7 days. On the day of experiment, islets were starved for 1.5 hrs and then incubated in control buffer or VEGF-A containing buffer for 10 minutes for stimulation, similar to what has been done with freshly isolated islets. Afterwards, protein lysates were used in Western blots for the examination of VEGF-A downstream signaling. As shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, VEGF-A stimulated phosphorylation in Akt and MAPK 42/44 is only minimal in this case. We have added the panels to Figure 6—figure supplement 1F and 1G, and revised the section as follows:</p><p>“Importantly, similar experiments on wt islets depleted of intra-islet endothelial cells show markedly lower response to VEGF-A stimulation; therefore, VEGF-A/ VEGFR2 dependent signaling cascades in endothelial cells are major contributors to overall VEGF-A dependent signaling in intact murine islets (Figure 6—figure supplement 1F and 1G)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be helpful to the reader to introduce the rationale, advantages and disadvantages for the different models. For example, introducing the Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model before detailing the experimental results would help the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the omission and have added a short Introduction accordingly:</p><p>“<italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are a model of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (OMIM #209900), a ciliopathy characterized mainly by polydactyly, renal and gonadal malformations and truncal obesity. <italic>Bbs4</italic> encodes a protein that is a component of the BBSome complex, a protein complex thought to be involved in the sorting of membrane proteins to and from the ciliary compartment<sup>1,2,7</sup>. While <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice form primary cilia, they are not fully functional. The symptoms show good overlap with what has been observed in BBS patients and include obesity, male sterility, and impaired glucose handling.”</p><p>“<italic>Pitchfork</italic> (<italic>Pifo</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice have dysfunctional cilia that cannot be properly disassembled<sup>5</sup>. PIFO does not localize to the ciliary axoneme but accumulates at the base of the cilium during cilia disassembly and interacts with ciliary targeting complexes. Laterality defects in <italic>Pifo</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice suggest that ciliary signaling is impaired in these animals.”</p><p>“Ift88 is essential to ciliary maintenance and formation, and cells depleted of Ift88 do not have ciliary axonemes, although the early stages of ciliogenesis, vesicle docking to centrosomes, are still complete.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 1A, is islet mass affected in knockout mice at two months and further at four months of age? Does variation in islet size directly affect the vessel density measurements?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising these valid concerns. We have previously published that islet size distribution was slightly skewed towards larger islets in 1-month-old male <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice without clear differences in range, β-cell mass and pancreatic insulin content are not significantly different from those of littermates<sup>7</sup>. We have not tested β-cell mass at later stages but could isolate islets from 4 months old animals, suggesting that no overt loss of β-cell mass occurs. To address your concern, we have performed additional immunostaining on pancreatic sections from 2- and 4-month-old wt and <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice respectively, and correlation between vessel density and β-cell volume (estimated by insulin staining) was calculated in each group as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. As the Pearson coefficient suggests, there is no correlation between vascular density and β-cell mass.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56914-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Bbs4 knockout mice have increased body weight. Are these mice generally healthy? Does knocking out Bbs4 lead to peripheral insulin resistance and islet hypertrophy and hyperplasia (as in other models of insulin resistance)? Please discuss whether the increase in body weight would affect the islet response to insulin resistance and vascularization.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue. Because models of obesity and peripheral insulin resistance show hypervascularization in the early stages of islet cell hyperplasia, we do not think that there is a confounding effect of insulin resistance on islet vascularization in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>mice</italic>. Interestingly, vessel diameter could be related to insulin resistance although the findings are not clear.</p><p>We have added a statement as follows:</p><p>“Previous work has shown hyperglycemia and elevated circulating insulin levels in <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice at 4-6 months of age. This suggests increased insulin demand and a certain level of insulin resistance, which could potentially affect islet vascularity. Indeed, studies with three independent insulin resistance mouse models showed that intra-islet vessel area significantly increased, primarily due to morphological changes, namely vessel dilation but not angiogenesis. Similarly, studies in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF) also demonstrated that early stages of insulin resistance and islet hyperplasia are accompanied by hypervascularization. Of note, <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice only become significantly overweight at 3-4 months of age, while we observe changes in islet vascularization at 2 months of age. We believe that we can exclude confounding effects of increasing body weight and insulin resistance on islet vascularization at the time of our investigation because the intra-islet capillary density is decreased, and not increased as is the case for models of insulin resistance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please discuss how the current results relate to prior reports from some of the authors on the manuscript: a) Sci Rep. 2016 Feb 22;6:21448. doi: 10.1038/srep21448. Non-invasive cell type selective in vivo monitoring of insulin resistance dynamics. b) FASEB J. 2019 Jan;33(1):204-218. doi: 10.1096/fj.201800826R. Diet-induced β-cell insulin resistance results in reversible loss of functional β-cell mass.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. In the two studies, we generated biosensors for the detection of insulin resistance and functional islet mass. We took advantage of the optical properties of the eye and the in vivo imaging platform to longitudinally monitor Western diet induced changes in β-cell functionality. In our study, we used fluorescent dyes to track the newly formed vessels during islet engraftment and evaluate the barrier function of islet vessels. While there is some evidence that <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are hyperinsulinemic, their obesity phenotype is related to hyperphagia of standard chow and not high fat/ high sucrose diet. We transplanted <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets into wt mice without an additional dietary challenge, and transplanting wt islets into <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice did not suggest additional effects by persistent insulin resistance (Figure 3D,E). While we agree that the question of hyperinsulinemia, insulin signaling and insulin resistance in ciliopathy models such as <italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> is important and warrants further study, we feel that it is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) What is the contribution of donor and recipient endothelial cell contribution during re-vascularization in these models (as related to Nyqvist et al., 2005)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this question and apologize for the confusion. In Nyqvist et al., 2005, Tie2-GFP islets were used for transplantation labelling all the remaining endothelial cells in donor islets. In this study, donor islet endothelial cells form vessel structures in the islet graft when transplanted shortly after isolation. However, the exact contribution of donor endothelial cells to the newly formed graft vessels was not quantified. In our current study, we have used a different model and approach for discerning the contribution from the two cell populations, as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We transplanted wt and <italic>Bbs4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> islets (after 2 days in culture) into <italic>Cdh5-tdT</italic> mouse eyes, which means that all recipient endothelial cells express tdTomato. Cells in the newly formed vessels that are negative for tdTomato are derived from donor islets. We quantified the surface area ratio of tdTomato positive structures to the FITC-dextran labeled vascular structures, as a measure of contribution from recipient endothelial cells. This ratio shifts slightly during islet engraftment, and by the 12-wk time point it’s on average 41.7% in wt and 45.9% in Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup> islets. One caveat of our method is, although the labelling efficiency/specificity of tdTomato in <italic>Cdh5-tdT</italic> mice is high, it may not be 100% in all the animals. In addition, the accuracy of the ratio calculation also depends on imaging depth of the lasers used for detecting FITC-dextran and tdTomato in vivo. We would like to point out that this result is consistent with another study where freshly picked islets were transplanted under the kidney capsule, and the donor endothelial cells identified by immunofluorescent staining constitute 40±3% of the newly formed vasculature at 3-5 weeks post-transplantation (Brissova et al., 2004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Does the size of transplanted islets affect the re-vascularization rate? Were similar islet equivalents transplanted into the eye each time?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these questions. It has been shown in multiple studies that islets are exposed to different levels of hypoxia when they are cut off from the blood stream and transplanted to a new site<sup>8,9</sup>. This leads to the increased expression and activation of various hypoxia induced angiogenic factors, including VEGF-A, which may result in different re-vascularization rates between small and large islets<sup>10</sup>.</p><p>To avoid confounding effects, we have consistently used similar-sized islets in all transplantations and re-vascularization analysis. The islets that we have chosen had an average diameter of 200 µm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please provide additional rationale for the transition to cell lines to study molecular mechanisms and impaired VEGFA-VEGFR2 dependent signaling (Figure 6). Please discuss how the in vitro cell studies relate to overall process addressed in Figures 1-5 in primary tissue and cells (and the data related to this in supplemental figures).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if this section was somewhat confusing and felt unrelated to the previous sections. The advantage of cell lines are the supply of material and the relative ease by which pure endothelial cellular material can be obtained. In addition to murine pancreatic endothelial cell line MS-1, we have also used Human Dermal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HDMEC), to validate our experimental findings in human primary cells. As mentioned before, vascular fenestration of intra-islet capillaries is causally linked to VEGF-A/ VEGFR2-dependent signaling. Our findings suggest that in Bbs4- and Ift88-depleted cells VEGFR2, EphrinA1 and B2 are downregulated, VEGF-A uptake and VEGFR2 internalization are reduced. Because VEGFR2 signaling activity does not only occur from the plasma membrane but also depends on EphrinB2 mediated internalization, these lines of evidence suggest that this pathway is impaired in endothelial cells void of functioning cilia. This is supported by the fact that VEGFR2 phosphorylation and phospho-activation of downstream signaling nodes is decreased in Bbs-4 depleted endothelial cells.</p><p>We have changed the text as follows:</p><p>“We have observed a role for endothelial cilia in the islet vascularization process; the signaling pathways involved in this process, however, remained elusive. To complement the in vivo data and to better understand the cell-autonomous role of ciliary/basal body proteins in endothelial cells, we used a murine pancreatic endothelial cell line, MS<sup>-1</sup>. Suppressing <italic>Bbs4</italic> by RNA interference reduces <italic>Bbs4</italic> expression up to two-fold (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). Expression analysis of key angiogenic factors revealed no observable changes in Tie1, Tie2, endothelial Nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) or Notch ligand Δ-4 (Dll4) (Figure 6A). However, VEGFR2, Ephrin A1 and B2 are downregulated by 20% when MS<sup>-1</sup> cells are depleted of Bbs4. Interestingly, Bbs4 depletion has no effect on PECAM-1 expression and therefore does not change characteristic properties of this endothelial cell line. Of note, intra-islet capillary density and fenestration is primarily maintained by VEGF-VEGFR2-signaling<sup>11-13</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) An explanation of the engraftment timeline or a schematic showing your various timepoints would help the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment.

Is the eye filling with dextrans at a certain point and not allowing further movement of dextrans?</p></disp-quote><p>There are several factors contributing to the plateau of dextran fluorescence. First, the animals were given a single bolus injection of dextran at the 1-min time point, and the total amount of dextran in circulation soon declines after injection, due to clearance by the liver and kidney of recipient animal. Consequently, dextran diffusion from the blood flow into the aqueous humor slows down as the concentration gradient becomes smaller. Meanwhile, there is constant flow of the aqueous humor, and the average turnover rate is 2.5% per minute<sup>14</sup>. This further hinders the accumulation of dextran in aqueous humor after the initial peak following the intravenous injection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Was the reader of the fenestration measurements blinded to the samples?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reader of the fenestration measurements is blinded to all the samples.
