If this phenomenon reflects a fundamental property of aging remains an open question. Transcriptional changes at the cellular level are best detected by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). However, the diverse computational methods used for the quantification of age-related loss of cellular identity have prevented reaching meaningful conclusions by direct comparison of existing scRNAseq datasets. To address these issues we created <italic>Decibel</italic>, a Python toolkit that implements side-to-side four commonly used methods for the quantification of age-related transcriptional noise in scRNAseq data. Additionally, we developed <italic>Scallop</italic>, a novel computational method for the quantification of membership of single cells to their assigned cell type cluster. Cells with a greater <italic>Scallop</italic> membership score are transcriptionally more stable. Application of these computational tools to seven aging datasets showed large variability between tissues and datasets, suggesting that increased transcriptional noise is not a universal hallmark of aging. To understand the source of apparent loss of cell type identity associated with aging, we analyzed cell type-specific changes in transcriptional noise and the changes in cell type composition of the mammalian lung. No robust pattern of cell type-specific transcriptional noise alteration was found across aging lung datasets. In contrast, age-associated changes in cell type composition of the lung were consistently found, particularly of immune cells. These results suggest that claims of increased transcriptional noise of aged tissues should be reformulated.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human body contains hundreds of different cell types which vary greatly in shape and size despite all sharing the same genetic material.

This phenomenon was first described by Vijg and colleagues as an <italic>age-related increase in transcriptional noise</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahar et al., 2006</xref>), which is still the most commonly used term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Warren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Enge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelidis et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Transcriptional noise</italic> is here defined as the measured level of variation in gene expression among cells supposed to be identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raser and O’Shea, 2005</xref>). Later, similar findings have been reported as an increase in <italic>identity noise</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salzer et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>cell-cell heterogeneity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimmel et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>cell-to-cell variability</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez-Jimenez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ximerakis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hernando-Herraez et al., 2019</xref>), or <italic>loss of cellular identity</italic> in aged tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Solé-Boldo et al., 2020</xref>). However, a loss of cellular identity does not necessarily concur with an increase in transcriptional noise, and both phenomena are thus best studied separately. Additionally, while all these claims have in common the notion of cells expressing their core transcriptional program or <italic>transcriptomic signature</italic> in a loose way, there are important methodological differences between the published reports that deserve further scrutiny.</p><p>Early studies were based on the quantification of the variance associated with the expression of a few pre-selected transcripts by real-time PCR, on bulk cell and tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Warren et al., 2007</xref>). With the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) technologies, whole-transcriptome variability on aged tissues was studied at the single-cell level. A pioneering study on human pancreas by Quake and colleagues found an age-related increase in transcriptional noise specific to pancreatic <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Enge et al., 2017</xref>). The authors introduced a definition of transcriptional noise that was based on whole-transcriptome variability: the ratio between biological and technical variation, where the latter was inferred from External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) spike-in variability. As ERCC spike-in controls are not included in every scRNAseq experiment, they proposed two alternative methods that were based on the notion of ‘distance to centroid (DTC)’: the greater the gene-based distance between cells of the same cell type, the greater the transcriptional noise associated with them. One of them measured the Euclidean distance to the cell type mean per individual, using the whole transcriptome. The other one measured the Euclidean distance between each cell and the tissue mean, using a set of invariant genes. Soon after, loss of identity was reported in aged murine dermal fibroblasts by measuring the coefficient of variation of the distances between each highly variable gene between the two main fibroblast clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salzer et al., 2018</xref>). Similar findings were published in early activated CD4+ T cells, based on the observation that the fraction of cells that expressed the core activation program was lower in old animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez-Jimenez et al., 2019</xref>). A study on murine aging lung found an increase in cellular heterogeneity in most (but not all) cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelidis et al., 2019</xref>), based on the distance-to-mean method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Enge et al., 2017</xref>. Later, a study on murine lung, spleen, and kidney corroborated by Euclidean DTC methods an age-related increase in cell-to-cell variability, albeit present in some cell types only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimmel et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, a study in murine aging brain found no increase in transcriptional heterogeneity associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ximerakis et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that the purported age-associated increase in transcriptional noise might be restricted to particular cell types or tissues.</p><p>Of note, alternative explanations to the variability in the expression of individual genes being the basis for increased transcriptional noise do exist. Among others, the lack of balance between spliced and unspliced mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gupta et al., 2021</xref>) and the existence of dysregulated gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mishra et al., 2021</xref>) have been proposed. In fact, Bashan and colleagues developed a novel computational tool to measure age-related loss of gene-to-gene transcriptional coordination (what they called <italic>global coordination level</italic> or GCL), and reported a GCL decrease in aging cells across diverse organisms and cell types, which was also associated with a high mutational load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Levy et al., 2020</xref>). In a nutshell, these authors suggested that the observations of age-associated increase in cell-to-cell variability were restricted to specific cell types and tissues but not generalized. Instead, they proposed that transcriptional dysregulation occurs at the level of gene-to-gene coordination. Despite the numerous attempts at measuring transcriptional noise in aged tissues, several challenges remain: (i) there are important differences in between studies with regard to the definition of <italic>transcriptional noise</italic> and the computational methods used to quantify it; (ii) studies focused mostly on single datasets of different tissues and cell types, while it is well known that both the inter-tissue and the inter-cellular variability might be significant; and (iii) little to no attention was given to the fact that cellular composition of aged organs shows relevant variability as compared to the young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nalapareddy et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we aimed to systematically measure age-associated transcriptional noise across different tissues and species, testing diverse computational methods in parallel. The main goals of the study were to substantiate claims of age-associated transcriptional noise increase and determine whether it presents a cell type-specific pattern. For this, we took advantage of the large number of aging mouse and human scRNAseq datasets that are publicly available and developed two computational tools (<italic>Decibel</italic> and <italic>Scallop</italic>) to analyze them by focusing on two aspects: age-related transcriptional noise and changes in cell type composition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Decibel</italic>: a Python toolkit for transcriptional noise quantification</title><p>We developed a Python toolkit for the quantification of transcriptional noise in scRNAseq, where we implemented the four main families of methods that have been used in the literature to measure increase in transcriptional noise associated with aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first method, which we refer to as <italic>biological variation over technical variation</italic>, takes the Pearson’s correlation distance between each cell and the mean expression vector of its corresponding cell type for that individual, using the whole transcriptome in the calculation. It then divides this correlation by the ERCC-based distance between each cell and its cell type mean. This method can only be used when ERCC spike-ins have been included in the experimental design. The second method computes the gene-based Euclidean distance between each cell’s expression vector and its cell type mean expression vector per donor/individual. The third one computes the Euclidean distance between each cell and the average gene expression across cell types, using a set of invariant genes. Invariant genes are selected by splitting the whole transcriptome into 10 equally sized bins according to their mean expression. Then, the two bins with the most extreme expression values are discarded, and the 10% with the highest coefficient of variation within each of the remaining bins are selected. The fourth one is the GCL. Its original formulation takes a dataset containing a single cell type, and it randomly splits its transcriptome into two halves, then computes the dependency between them as the batch-corrected distance correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Levy et al., 2020</xref>). The GCL is obtained by averaging this dependency over <italic>k</italic> iterations. We implemented an extension of this method so that it could be used in datasets containing several cell types, by computing the GCL averaged over 50 iterations for each cell type of the same individual. Therefore, our implementation outputs a GCL score per cell type and individual rather than a transcriptional variability measure per cell.

Thus, cluster membership takes values between 0 and 1. <italic>Scallop</italic> relies on the assumption that the more consistently a cell is assigned to a particular cluster across bootstrap iterations, the greater its transcriptional stability. Conversely, a cell being assigned to different clusters across iterations is indicative of a greater transcriptional variation. Therefore, we quantify loss of cell type identity as <italic>1 ‍ − membership</italic>. A detailed description of the three steps of the method (bootstrapping, cluster relabeling, and computation of the membership score) is provided in the <italic>Scallop</italic> subsection in the Methods.</p><p>In order to characterize and validate our method for transcriptional noise quantification, we conducted three types of analyses. First, we used artificially generated datasets containing various degrees of transcriptional noise to compare the performance of <italic>Scallop</italic> and DTC methods side by side, regarding their ability to measure transcriptional noise and detect noisy cells within cell types. Next, we ran simulations using artificial datasets in order to study the effect of a number of dataset features on the performance of <italic>Scallop</italic>: cellular composition, dataset size, number of genes, and marker expression. Finally, we graphically evaluated the output of <italic>Scallop</italic> on a dataset of human T cells, we analyzed its robustness to its input parameters, and we studied the relationship between membership and robust marker expression, using the PBMC 3 K dataset from 10× Genomics.</p><p>We compared the output of <italic>Scallop</italic> and two DTC methods (the whole transcriptome-based Euclidean distance to average cell type expression and the invariant gene-based Euclidean distance to average tissue expression) on four artificially generated datasets containing various levels of transcriptional noise. The analysis showed that <italic>Scallop</italic>, unlike DTC methods, was able to discern between the core transcriptionally stable cells within each cell type cluster from the more noisy cells that lie in between clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then compared one of the DTC methods to <italic>Scallop</italic> regarding their ability to detect noisy cells within each of the cell types, by plotting the top 10% noisiest and top 10% most stable cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Analyzing the distribution of noise values for each cell type separately revealed that <italic>Scallop</italic> can distinguish between clusters that mainly consist of transcriptionally stable cells from noisier clusters that do not have such a distinct transcriptional signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we ran a series of simulations on artificially generated datasets to evaluate the performance of <italic>Scallop</italic> in the presence of different levels of class imbalance, dataset size, number of genes, and different degrees of expression of cell type markers. Our analysis showed that <italic>Scallop</italic> was remarkably robust to changes in cellular composition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Both the average percentage of noise and the distribution remained unchanged for a wide range of class imbalance degrees (IDs). Similarly, altering the dataset size (number of cells) and the number of genes of an artificial dataset did not cause any major changes on the transcriptional noise values attributed to each cell type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). Additionally, we conducted an analysis where we identified the 10 most differentially expressed gene (DEG) markers for a cell type and measured the transcriptional noise associated with that cell type as we removed the expression of those genes from the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Transcriptional noise steadily increased as we removed the effect of the top marker genes that defined the cell type under study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). This experiment provides further evidence on how strong marker expression is related to robust cell type identity and how the lack of it results in transcriptional noise.</p><p>We extended the validation of our method to biological datasets: we compared the output of <italic>Scallop</italic> to the transcriptional noise measured using the methods implemented in <italic>Decibel</italic> on 8278 human T cells drawn from the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/20-k-human-pbm-cs-3-ht-v-3-1-chromium-x-3-1-high-6-1-0">(PBMC</ext-link>) 20 K dataset from 10× Genomics. First, clustering revealed three main T cell subtypes, which we annotated according to their expression of <italic>CD4</italic> and <italic>CD8</italic> markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A</xref>). Then, we measured transcriptional variability and gene coordination level using <italic>Decibel</italic> and inspected the distribution of variability scores over the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7B</xref>). Unlike DTC methods, <italic>Scallop</italic> detected transcriptionally noisy cells that lie in between transcriptionally stable T cell subtypes on the UMAP plot. GCL yielded different coordination levels for each T cell subtype, but the method does not allow for comparisons between individual cells, as it outputs a single score per cell type. In addition, we plotted the 10% most transcriptionally stable and unstable cells according to the <italic>Euclidean distance to the cell type mean</italic> and <italic>Scallop</italic> methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7C</xref>). These analyses suggested that <italic>Scallop</italic>’s membership score outperforms DTC methods at discriminating between noisy cells lying in between clusters and more transcriptionally robust cells constituting the core of T cell subtypes.</p><p>Next, we analyzed <italic>Scallop</italic>’s robustness in response to input parameters, namely, the number of bootstrap iterations and the fraction of cells used in each iteration. We ran <italic>Scallop</italic> on five independent scRNAseq datasets with different size and cluster composition (see Appendix 1) and studied the convergence of <italic>Scallop</italic> membership scores for a wide range of values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). The median correlation distance between membership scores decreased as we increased the number of bootstrap iterations (<monospace>n_trials</monospace>) and the fraction of cells used in each iteration (<monospace>frac_cells</monospace>). We concluded that <italic>Scallop</italic>’s output is robust to changes in its input parameter values, the results suggesting that <monospace>frac_cells</monospace> &gt;0.8 and <monospace>n_trials</monospace> &gt;30 are appropriate parameter values for most datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we studied the relationship between <italic>Scallop</italic> membership score and robust gene marker expression, by comparing the statistical significance of the output of differential expression analysis between cell type clusters, conducted on stable and unstable cells. For this, we analyzed six cell types and subtypes (<italic>CD4</italic> and <italic>CD8</italic> T cells, <italic>CD14</italic> and <italic>FCGR3A</italic> monocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer [NK] cells) from the PBMC 3 K dataset from 10× Genomics. Cells with a higher <italic>Scallop</italic> membership to their cluster differentially expressed cell type-specific markers with greater statistical significance than low-membership cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). Overall, these results showed that <italic>Scallop</italic> membership is related to a more robust expression of gene markers defining cell types than other existing methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Increased transcriptional noise is not a universal hallmark of aging</title><p>To determine if aging is associated with a generalized increase in transcriptional noise at the tissue level, we used <italic>Scallop</italic> to compare the average degree of membership of young and old cells to their cell type cluster in scRNAseq datasets of various tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For the initial analysis, we selected seven datasets where transcriptional noise had already been measured using different methods and with differing outcomes. We provide a summary of the main characteristics of each dataset, as well as the findings regarding transcriptional noise obtained in each of the original studies, whether changes in transcriptional noise were restricted to particular cell types and the computational method used to measure noise (see Appendix 2). The age and cell type composition of the final datasets used in our study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, and the samples included in the datasets as well as the inclusion criteria are provided in Appendix 3 . Additionally, the methods implemented in <italic>Decibel</italic> to compute loss of identity were run in parallel as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). When measuring the <italic>Scallop</italic> membership score of individual young and old cells to their cell type clusters, the results were inconsistent. Differences between age groups were found in some datasets, but the directionality of the change was not conserved across datasets, neither in the average <italic>1 ‍ − membership</italic> score nor in the percentage of noisy cells in the young and the old fraction of each dataset. For most datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ximerakis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimmel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez-Jimenez et al., 2019</xref>), no significant change in mean transcriptional noise was found. Two datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Enge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salzer et al., 2018</xref>) showed an increase in mean membership associated with aging, although we observed the interquartile range of noise values to be very similar between young and old individuals. In one of the datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Solé-Boldo et al., 2020</xref>), cells showed decreased transcriptional noise with aging. Of note, similar inconsistent results were found when using the pre-existing noise-measuring methods as compiled in <italic>Decibel</italic>, even when applying different methods to the exact same dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, these results indicated that a generalized <italic>increase in transcriptional noise</italic> or a <italic>loss of cellular identity</italic> is not universal hallmark of aging, at least at the tissue level. However, the possibility that transcriptional noise increased in specific cell types was still unexplored by these analyses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>No consistent increase in transcriptional noise detected in seven single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) datasets of aging at the tissue level.</title><p>The graphs show the amount of transcriptional noise, computed as 1 - membership to cell type clusters, in the young and old age groups of seven scRNAseq datasets of different tissues.

In order to answer this question, we focused on a single tissue and conducted an in-depth analysis of transcriptional noise at the cell type level. For this, we selected the murine aging lung because of the relative abundance of available datasets in which authors had reported an age-associated increase in transcriptional noise, yet restricted to particular cell types: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimmel et al., 2019</xref>; and the Tabula Muris Senis (TMS) lung droplet and FACS datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almanzar et al., 2020</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app5fig1">Appendix 5—figure 1</xref>). In each dataset, transcriptional noise was measured as <italic>1 ‍ − membership</italic> to cell type clusters in the young and old fractions, and the differences in median noise between the old and the young fraction for each of the existing 31 lung cell types and subtypes were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Since changes in the gene expression of tissues can also be caused by altered cell type composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trapnell, 2015</xref>), we estimated the relative abundances of the 31 cell types in the young and old fraction of each dataset and measured the effect of age by fitting generalized linear models (GLM) to cell type composition data of the four datasets, using each mouse as a biological replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). By plotting the age-related cell type enrichment together with the cell-to-cell transcriptional variability in each of the datasets, we obtained a comprehensive map of cell type enrichment and transcriptional noise associated with aging at the cell-identity level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In this analysis, the direction and magnitude of changes in transcriptional noise varied across cell types. For instance, club cells (a bronchiolar exocrine cell type) were detected in sufficient numbers in three out of four datasets, their median membership score consistently decreasing 10–17% (which showed up as a moderate increase in transcriptional noise in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; bubble #22). Similarly, lung interstitial fibroblasts’ transcriptional noise appeared to increase with age, although with a larger range of membership scores (3–17%; bubble #24). In both cases, the cell type abundance was not affected by aging. In contrast, alveolar macrophages showed a decrease in age-associated transcriptional noise (5–12% increase in median membership; bubble #10). Finally, several cell identities appeared not to change significantly with regard to their transcriptional noise related to aging. That was clearly the case for capillary endothelial cells (bubble #9) and plasma cells (bubble #5). Vascular endothelial cells (bubble #6) showed less than 2% of change in noise in three out of four datasets but increased up to 8% in one dataset. Therefore, and contrary to expectation, quantitative analysis of age-associated transcriptional noise did not show a consistent pattern across diverse lung cell types in the four available datasets.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Lack of evidence for an increase in transcriptional noise of the murine aging lung and detection of an enrichment in immune cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bubble chart of transcriptional noise and cell type enrichment (old/young odds ratio [OR]) of 31 murine lung cell identities.

In particular, plasma cells (bubble #5) showed highly consistent enrichment in old mice, with an old/young odds ratio (OR) of 3 in the Kimmel dataset (p-value=1.1×10<sup>-5</sup>) and of 9.3 in the Angelidis dataset (p-value=6.5×10<sup>-21</sup>). The ORs for the two TMS datasets were most likely overestimated due to low cell numbers (only 9 and 22 old plasma cells were detected in the TMS datasets). The more abundant B cells (bubble #4) were also significantly enriched in 3/4 datasets (Angelidis: OR = 4.4, p-value=2.5×10<sup>-69</sup>; Kimmel: OR = 1.2, p-value=6.3×10<sup>-8</sup>; TMS FACS: OR = 2.0, p-value=8.9×10<sup>-6</sup>). Other immune cell types such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells also appeared to be enriched in all datasets. This prompted us to further investigate the basis for the apparent immune cell enrichment and its potential relationship to increased transcriptional heterogeneity in the old age. In a qualitative approach to look for consistent patterns across datasets, we ranked cell identities according to their age-related increase in noise and enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). While most cell types were evenly distributed along the transcriptional noise ranking, this representation provided a visible distinction between immune and non-immune cell types regarding their age-related enrichment, with nearly all immune cell types appearing on top of the enrichment ranking. For instance, plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, #5) were the third most enriched cell type in the Angelidis dataset and appeared on the top position in the rest of the datasets. Classical monocytes (#13) were found within the top 4 most enriched in 3/4 datasets. Interestingly, NK cells (#2) were the only underrepresented lymphocytes in old mice and ranked consistently in the least enriched positions among immune cells. Conversely, parenchymal cell types such as goblet cells, club cells, and ciliated cells consistently appeared at the bottom of the enrichment ranking, indicating that their proportion diminished with increased immune cell infiltration in the organ or, alternatively, loss of parenchymal cells associated with the old age. Endothelial cells were more evenly distributed along the ranking and thus did not show a clearly discernible age-associated enrichment or loss. Finally, we separated the lung cells into immune and non-immune cell categories and represented transcriptional noise and cell type enrichment values on a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As clearly seen in this representation, the transcriptional noise increase associated with aging was extremely variable across cell identities and not always consistent across datasets (a comparison between these results and the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelidis et al., 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kimmel et al., 2019</xref> is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

To test if this was specific of murine lungs or it could be a more generalized phenomenon, we conducted similar analyses on two large scRNAseq datasets of the aging human lungs (15,852 cells from 9 donors from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raredon et al., 2019</xref> dataset and 15,048 cells from 2 donors of the human lung cell atlas (HLCA) dataset by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Travaglini et al., 2020</xref>). We harmonized cell type labels between datasets by projecting the HLCA labels onto the Raredon dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then, we calculated the difference in mean membership score between old and young cells for each cell type in the two datasets, together with the cell type enrichment using the GLM method as described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In general, and similar to what we had previously observed in the murine aging lung, we found a lack of consistency between the two datasets regarding transcriptional noise associated with aging of specific lung cell types. However, we did observe some conserved changes in cell type composition. Particularly, many immune cell types were enriched in older donors, as in the murine aging lung. Plasma cells were significantly enriched in the Raredon dataset (OR = 2.6, p-values = 1.9e−6) and enriched, albeit not significantly, in the HLCA dataset (OR = 3.5e−11, p-value = 1). The latter result was most probably due to lack of statistical power, as the dataset only consists of two donors. Interestingly, alveolar macrophages were enriched (rather than depleted as in the murine aging lung) in both human aging lung datasets (OR = 1.2, p-value = 3.61e−5 in Raredon; OR = 2.8, p-value = 1.54e−261 in HLCA). Several endothelial cell types were significantly depleted in the two human aging lung datasets. Vein endothelial cells (OR = 0.65, p-value = 7.7e−5 in Raredon; OR = 0.58, p-value = 1.9e−9 in HLCA), capillary endothelial cells (OR = 0.81, p-value = 3.4e−2 in Raredon; OR = 0.3, p-value = 3.5e−141 in HLCA), endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels (OR = 0.51, p-value = 1.9e−9 in HLCA). These results indicated that aged human lungs present reduced vascularization and significant immune cell infiltrates as compared to the young. Even though the evidence for changes in tissue composition is based on a single tissue, we hypothesize that these facts may have influenced previous analyses of transcriptional noise associated with aging.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Human aging lungs show no increase in transcriptional noise but consistent depletion and enrichment of specific endothelial and immune cell types.</title><p>The increase in transcriptional noise associated with aging (<italic>Noise</italic>, left) and the cell type enrichment (<italic>Enrichment</italic>, right) values are shown for 30 human lung cell identities as detected in the human lung cell atlas (HLCA) and Raredon datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raredon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Travaglini et al., 2020</xref>).

Some authors consider transcriptional noise to be a hallmark of aging in and of itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mendenhall et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In any case, the origin of transcriptional noise is unclear, as it could arise from many different sources. Most importantly, it is not possible to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic noise from a snapshot of cellular states, i.e., one cannot tell whether the observed differences between cells in a single-cell RNA experiment reflect time-dependent variations in gene expression or differences between cells across a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ham et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2017</xref> measuring intrinsic noise in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> showed that aging is associated with a steady decrease in noise, with a sudden increase in soon-to-die cells. They proposed that noise decreasing in normal aging was due to increased rates in chromatin state transitions, and showed that disrupting chromatin structure at the gene promoter was sufficient to change this course. Another longitudinal study found an increase in extrinsic noise and a lack of change in intrinsic noise in diploid yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarnoski et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Since aging is multifactorial, and mutational load most likely leads to clonal expansion of aberrant cells that accumulate throughout the lifetime of the individual, other authors suggest that aging traits may be associated with cell type imbalance in aged organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cagan et al., 2022</xref>).

Our results suggest that transcriptional noise is not a <italic>bona fide</italic> hallmark of aging. Instead, we posit that previous analyses of noise in aging scRNAseq datasets have been confounded by a number of factors, including both computational methods used for analysis as well as other biology-driven sources of variability.</p><p>In this work, we made a systematic comparison of the most important families of methods that have been used to quantify age-related transcriptional noise through the implementation of <italic>Decibel</italic>, a novel Python toolkit. Since we were not convinced of the utility of these methods to determine <italic>bona fide</italic> transcriptional noise, we developed a novel method and applied it to a wide array of tissues. Our proposed tool, <italic>Scallop</italic>, presents some advantages over existing methods: it does not require neither ERCC spike-ins nor cell type labels. In addition, it provides information that is complementary to the GCL, as it yields a cell-wise measurement of transcriptional noise that enables us to compare between <italic>stable</italic> and <italic>unstable</italic> cells within the same cluster or cell type. Most importantly, <italic>Scallop</italic> measures transcriptional noise by membership to cell type-specific clusters which is a re-definition of the original formulation of <italic>noise</italic> by Raser and O’Shea: measurable variation among cells that should share the same transcriptome. This is in stark contrast to measurements of <italic>noise</italic> including other phenomena (as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) by the DTC methods prevalent in the literature. Interestingly, <italic>Scallop</italic> appears to detect transcriptional noise driven by the lack of expression of cell type markers in a very robust way, and this should make it a better choice for measuring loss of cell type identity compared to DTC methods. When applied to seven independent aging datasets, the results obtained revealed little overlap in the magnitude and directionality of the changes in transcriptional noise associated with aging of the different tissues analyzed, providing evidence that an increase in transcriptional noise might not be as evident as generally thought.</p><p>In order to investigate cell type-specific effects in transcriptional noise, it is crucial to compare between different datasets of the same aging tissue. Otherwise, it is difficult to ascertain whether the variability observed between cell types is due to a pattern that is conserved in that tissue or is merely the effect of the intrinsic variability associated with scRNAseq experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fonseca Costa et al., 2020</xref>). For the cell type-specific study, we focused on the aging lung, as the effect of aging of this tissue has gained relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schiller et al., 2019</xref>) due to its association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and interstitial lung disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schneider et al., 2021</xref>) and its increased risk of severe illness in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>). In the 31 cell types analyzed in mouse lungs, we found increased transcriptional noise in club cells and interstitial fibroblasts only, while alveolar macrophages seemed to decrease it. Of interest, a single-cell analysis of alveolar macrophages did not identify distinct clusters associated with mouse or human aging, identifying changes in the aged alveolar microenvironment as key for their altered functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McQuattie-Pimentel et al., 2021</xref>). In humans, we analyzed two aging lung datasets that provide complementary information, as the final Raredon dataset consists of 9 donors of a wider range of ages but is not as well powered in terms of cell type resolution as the HLCA dataset, which contains 48 cell identities. Similar to what we had previously observed in the murine aging lung, there was no consistency between the 2 datasets regarding transcriptional noise of the 30 specific cell types detected. However, both in human and mouse lungs we detected a shift in the abundance of a number of cell populations with age, most clearly seen for immune cells.</p><p>In fact, the age-associated increase in immune cell infiltration of solid organs may be generalized. Specifically, one study found neutrophil and plasma cell infiltration in adipose tissue, aorta, liver, and kidneys of aged rats of both sexes, and the immune cell infiltration was reversed by caloric restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2020a</xref>). Another study found a subtype of highly secretory plasma cells infiltrated in the aged bone marrow, spleen, fat, kidney, heart, liver, muscle, and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, immune cell senescence has been shown to induce aging of solid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yousefzadeh et al., 2021</xref>), in what has been proposed to be a feed-forward circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salminen, 2021</xref>). Therefore, the importance of immune cell infiltration of the aged lungs cannot be overlooked. In fact, age-associated immune cell type enrichment has also been observed in two independent studies of macaque lungs. One study found increased mast cells, plasma cells, and CD8+ T cells in aged lung tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2020b</xref>), while the other found increased alveolar and interstitial macrophage numbers in bronchoalveolar lavages of old macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rhoades et al., 2022</xref>). The significance of the shift in cellular composition of the aged lungs in relation to the appearance of aging traits remains to be determined. Of note, alternative explanations for transcriptional changes associated with aging such as <italic>tissue convergence</italic> are compatible with shifts in the cellular composition of aging tissues and organs being a primary cause of convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Izgi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the sources of the apparent increase in <italic>transcriptional noise</italic> reported by previous studies may be multiple and are mostly related to the computational methods used to characterize transcriptional noise and cellular identity in aged tissues.

Graph-community detection methods take a graph representation of a dataset. In the context of single-cell RNAseq data, shared nearest neighbor graphs are commonly used. These are graphs whose nodes represent individual cells, and edges connect pairs of cells that are part of the K-nearest neighbors of each other by some distance metric. The aim of community detection algorithms like Leiden is to find groups of nodes that are densely connected between them, by optimizing modularity. For a graph with C communities, the modularity (Q) is computed by taking, for each community (group of cells), the difference between the actual number of edges in that community (<italic>e</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) and the number of expected edges in that community (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mfrac><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo largeop="true" movablelimits="false" symmetric="true">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is a resolution parameter (r&gt;0) that controls for the amount of communities: a greater resolution parameter gives more communities whereas a low-resolution parameter fewer clusters.

We computed the 100 most DEGs between each cell type and the rest of the cells using (1) all cells, (2) only the stable cells, and (3) only the unstable cells. B cells and megakaryoctes were excluded from the analysis as the former was highly stable (so we could not compare between the stable and the unstable fraction) and the latter consisted of very few cells.

We have now included novel data that substantially increase the evidence on our algorithm’s robustness as well as provided new examples of where previous attempts to measure age-associated transcriptional noise provided inconclusive/inaccurate results. The new results strengthen our original conclusions and may facilitate wider use of the pipeline for other biological systems as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

This is why we made all of our comparisons between age groups of the same dataset, to ensure that the preprocessing pipeline was not a confounding factor in our analysis. This way, even though individual datasets might have been preprocessed differently, the comparisons are always made between samples that have been processed together in identical experimental conditions and using the same computational pipeline, the age-difference of the donors/mice being the sole difference between them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Overall, I found the comparison across methods particularly interesting, but the authors seem to overlook the possibility that they might capture different biology and search for consistency. I would be interested in a discussion point on what each method can measure biologically.</p></disp-quote><p>We think this is a very interesting point, and believe that the output of the different existing methods is certainly influenced by different sources of both technical and biological variability. For instance, the ERCC-based method proposed by Enge et al. is likely the only method that explicitly accounts for and removes the effect of technical noise, and methods that measure the dispersion of gene expression (standard deviation of the expression, coefficient of variation, etc) are likely to be more sensitive to changes in the expression of highly expressed genes, and so on. However, we think that the main contribution of our work is to show that, regardless of the method used to measure transcriptional noise, there is no convincing evidence that increased noise (of any type) is a universal feature of aged cells. We fully agree that other methods may be capturing different biology but finding out the underlying cause of apparent “noise” in each dataset is certainly out of scope for this manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) The figshare repository with the code does not seem to be updated.

This is now corrected as follows:</p><p>“In any case, the origin of transcriptional noise is unclear, as it could arise from many different sources. Most importantly, it not possible to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic noise from a snapshot of cellular states, i.e., one cannot tell whether the observed differences between cells in a single-cell RNA experiment reflect time-dependent variations in gene expression or differences between cells across a population (Ham et al. 2021). Interestingly, recent work by Liu et al. measuring intrinsic noise in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> showed that aging is associated with a steady decrease in noise, with a sudden increase in soon-to-die cells. They proposed that noise decreasing in normal aging was due to increased rates in chromatin state transitions, and showed that disrupting chromatin structure at the gene promoter was sufficient to change this course. Another longitudinal study found an increase in extrinsic noise and a lack of change in intrinsic noise in diploid yeast Sarnoski et al. (2018).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
