Prom1 interacts with membrane cholesterol and actively remodels the plasma membrane. Membrane-bending activity is particularly evident in photoreceptors, where Prom1 loss-of-function mutations cause failure of outer segment homeostasis, leading to cone-rod retinal dystrophy (CRRD). The Tweety Homology (Ttyh) protein family has been proposed to be homologous to Prominin, but it is not known whether Ttyh proteins have an analogous membrane-bending function. Here, we characterize the membrane-bending activity of human Prom1 and Ttyh1 in native bilayer membranes. We find that Prom1 and Ttyh1 both induce formation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in cultured mammalian cells and that the EVs produced are physically similar. Ttyh1 is more abundant in EV membranes than Prom1 and produces EVs with membranes that are more tubulated than Prom1 EVs. We further show that Prom1 interacts more stably with membrane cholesterol than Ttyh1 and that this may contribute to membrane-bending inhibition in Prom1 EVs. Intriguingly, a loss-of-function mutation in Prom1 associated with CRRD induces particularly stable cholesterol binding. These experiments provide mechanistic insight into Prominin function in CRRD and suggest that Prom and Ttyh belong to a single family of functionally related membrane-bending, EV-generating proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Prominin 1</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>membrane biophysics</kwd><kwd>protein conformation</kwd><kwd>cholesterol-binding protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Tristan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM142553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chao</surname><given-names>Luke H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prominin 1 and Tweety Homology 1, two proteins that regulate membrane shape in neural and neuroepithelial cells, have shared evolutionary history and both cause cells to secrete extracellular vesicles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian cells interact with the extracellular environment through proteins, lipids, and glycans at the plasma membrane. Organized protrusive structures of the membrane such as microvilli and cilia are hotspots for nutrient absorption, cell cycle regulation, and extracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharkova et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). Membrane protrusions are organized both by interactions with the cytoskeleton and by sorting of proteins and lipids within the membrane bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and London, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corbeil et al., 2010</xref>). Prominin 1 (Prom1) is a five-transmembrane pass integral membrane protein that interacts with membrane cholesterol at sites of membrane protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corbeil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thamm et al., 2019</xref>). Prom1 was first characterized as the target of AC133-1, a monoclonal antibody raised against pluripotent human epithelial stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miraglia et al., 1997</xref>). Since then, Prom1 has been identified in the apical membranes of most epithelial and neuroepithelial cell types, but is only natively recognized by AC133-1 in stem cells and photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbeil et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kemper et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mak et al., 2012</xref>). In photoreceptors, Prom1 associates with a retinal cadherin (Protocadherin-21, Pcdh21) to promote normal outer segment membrane homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgoyne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rattner et al., 2001</xref>), and several Prom1 mutations are linked to hereditary cone-rod retinal dystrophy (CRRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zacchigna et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eidinger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maw et al., 2000</xref>). Most animal genomes also encode at least one paralogous prominin gene (Prominin 2) that is expressed in non-retinal cell types and localizes to positively curved membrane regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fargeas, 2013</xref>).</p><p>When overexpressed, Prom1 dramatically reorganizes the plasma membrane of cultured mammalian cells into long protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Röper et al., 2000</xref>). Small-molecule inhibitors of actin and tubulin do not impair the tubulation phenotype, indicating that cytoskeletal interactions are not strictly required for membrane bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Röper et al., 2000</xref>). However, cells treated with cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors or depletion agents do not exhibit membrane tubulation, suggesting that cholesterol plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Prom1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Röper et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Prom1 also induces release of small extracellular vesicles (EVs, &lt;250 nm in diameter) that bleb from the apical plasma membrane of differentiating epithelial stem cells at organized membrane protrusions such as microvilli and cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marzesco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dubreuil et al., 2007</xref>).

Ttyh proteins share prominins’ five-transmembrane topology but have a more minimal extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2000</xref>). Most animals have three paralogous Ttyh proteins (Ttyh1, Ttyh2, and Ttyh3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>) that all are predominantly expressed in neural tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halleran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sukalskaia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melvin et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, overexpression of Ttyh1 at the plasma membrane in cultured cells induces plasma membrane tubulation that is strikingly similar to that observed with Prom1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stefaniuk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wiernasz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Defining mechanisms of membrane bending by Prominin-family proteins is foundational for understanding retinal disease and stem cell development. Here, we reconstitute EV formation by Prom1 and Ttyh1 to characterize their functions in a native membrane bilayer system. To our knowledge, we present the first evidence that Ttyh1 induces formation of EVs that are functionally and physically analogous to Prom1 EVs. Ttyh1 EVs are more tubulated and protein-rich than Prom1 EVs. Prom1 forms a more stable interaction with cholesterol than Ttyh1, and when depleted of cholesterol, Prom1 EVs mimic the tubulation observed in Ttyh1 EVs. A CRRD-associated Prom1 mutant (W795R) binds cholesterol more stably than wild-type protein, suggesting that a less dynamic interaction between Prom1 and cholesterol inhibits membrane bending. These findings contribute to a path toward mechanistic understanding of Prominin-family protein function in different tissues, including the role of Prom1 in retinal pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution and purification of Prom1 EVs</title><p>To understand how Prom1 interacts with and reshapes native membranes, we sought a method to purify Prom1 without disturbing protein–lipid interactions. Because Prom1 induces EV formation in epithelial stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marzesco et al., 2005</xref>), we asked whether Prom1 can also form EVs in cultured cells. C-terminally Strep-tagged Prom1 was detected in immunoblots of the conditioned media (CM) from transfected cells, but not in cells treated with a no-plasmid mock transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). To validate that the ~120 kDa Strep-reactive band we observe is indeed Prom1-Strep, we immunoblotted with the Prom1-specific antibody AC133-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kemper et al., 2010a</xref>) and observed robust staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm that EV production is not an artifact of transfection, we introduced Prom1-Strep into Expi293 cells by lentiviral transduction to generate a stable polyclonal overexpression cell line. A Strep-reactive band consistent with mature Prom1 was detectable in the CM from these cells over several rounds of cell passaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We assessed the protein composition of Prom1 EVs using sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and silver nitrate staining. Prom1 was a constituent of our samples alongside several other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We cannot conclude whether these proteins specifically interact with Prom1 in EVs, are hitchhikers enclosed within the EVs, or originate from endogenous co-purifying EVs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reconstitution and purification of Prom1 EVs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Extracellular vesicle (EV) expression and purification graphic protocol.

It is important to note that our purification protocol removes any large EVs and midbody remnants, focusing our downstream experiments on small Prom1 EVs. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), we measured the solution sizes of the purified Prom1 EVs. The sample was monodisperse with an average diameter of 164 ± 14 nm, considerably larger than previously reported 50–80 nm EVs measured by negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (NS-TEM) in samples purified from biological fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marzesco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon treatment with PNGase F, an enzyme that cleaves <italic>N</italic>-glycan groups from proteins, the ~120 kDa Prom1 gel band shifted down to its predicted molecular weight of 102 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To verify that the purified particles are truly EVs (secreted particles with intact bilayer membranes), we vitrified purified samples and imaged them using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We observed spherical EVs with bilayer membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, inset). The diameters of EVs measured from cryo-TEM images were bimodal with an average diameter of 117 ± 58 nm, somewhat lower than our measurements from DLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We next used NS-TEM to directly compare our reconstituted Prom1 EVs with previously characterized endogenous Prom1 EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marzesco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We observed a distribution of largely circular EVs ranging in size from ~50 to ~250 nm in diameter, but more skewed toward smaller diameters than observed in the cryo-TEM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, EVs had rough edges and internal depressions in NS-TEM, a characteristic feature of EV fixation and dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marzesco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Because solution DLS measurements (164 ± 14 nm) suggest slightly larger EV diameters than our NS-TEM (123 ± 73 nm) or cryo-TEM (117 ± 58 nm) measurements, we speculate that sample fixation/dehydration or vitrification may induce deformation and potentially fission of the reconstituted EVs. This effect may have similarly impacted previous characterization of endogenous Prom1 EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marzesco et al., 2005</xref>). We conclude that reconstituted Prom1 EVs have similar morphology to endogenous EVs but may be slightly larger in size.</p><p>We next asked whether Prom1 in purified EVs retains known functional behavior of Prom1 from endogenous membranes. Prom1 stably binds the retinal cadherin Pcdh21 in photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgoyne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rattner et al., 2001</xref>). To determine if Prom1 can co-traffic with Pcdh21 in our EV samples, we co-transfected Expi293 cells with Strep-tagged Prom1 and Flag-tagged Pcdh21 and looked for the presence of each component in cells, CM, and clarified conditioned media (CCM). Pcdh21 was only observed in CCM samples when co-expressed with Prom1, indicating that Prom1 is necessary to traffic Pcdh21 into this class of EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). To establish a direct interaction between Prom1 and Pcdh21, we co-expressed Prom1-Strep with mNeonGreen-tagged Pcdh21 and immunopurified Prom1 from EVs solubilized with 1% <italic>n</italic>-dodecyl-β-<sc>D</sc>-maltoside (DDM). Pcdh21-associated mNeonGreen reproducibly co-purified with detergent-solubilized Prom1 compared to a control condition lacking Prom1, indicating that the two proteins physically interact in purified EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mutations in the Prom1 transmembrane domain impair EV formation</title><p>Prom1 binds cholesterol in native membranes and the Prom1–cholesterol interaction is necessary for remodeling the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Röper et al., 2000</xref>), but the mechanism of cholesterol-dependent Prom1 function is unclear. We analyzed the sequence of human Prom1 to identify candidate cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus (CRAC, [L/V]-X<sub>1−5</sub>-[Y/F]-X<sub>1−5</sub>-[K/R]) or mirrored CRAC (CARC, [K/R]-X<sub>1−5</sub>-[Y/F]-X<sub>1−5</sub>-[L/V]) sequences in the transmembrane helices, as these motifs often predict cholesterol binding in membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fantini and Barrantes, 2013</xref>).

To our surprise, none of the mutants substantially disrupted cholesterol binding, but the W795R mutant and the CARC-1 mutants bound cholesterol significantly more stably than WT Prom1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We chose to focus our efforts on the W795R mutant as it is a naturally occurring single-residue mutation with exceptional evolutionary conservation and a clinically validated disease phenotype. To verify that differences in cholesterol binding between wild-type and W795R Prom1 do not arise from a gross oligomerization defect, we purified EVs from cells co-transfected with Strep- and mScarlet-tagged Prom1 and measured co-purification of Prom1-mScarlet on Strep resin. Prom1 W795R co-purified with ~60% as much mScarlet fluorescence as WT Prom1, indicating that W795R indeed multimerizes, albeit with reduced efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Comparative analysis of EV Yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and cholesterol bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) indicates that though there may be a weak inverse correlation between cholesterol binding and stable cholesterol binding, W795R, CARC-1, and CARC-2 are outliers that bind cholesterol exceptionally tightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cholesterol-binding stability inversely correlates with Prom1 EV membrane bending</title><p>Because Ttyh1 promotes greater membrane curvature than Prom1 but does not stably bind cholesterol, we hypothesized that cholesterol-binding stability may contribute to negative regulation of membrane bending by Prominin-family proteins.

Though we have not examined whether Ttyh1 endogenously induces EV formation, we note that it is sufficient to do so in a recombinant system with similar or higher efficiency than Prom1. Given similar membrane remodeling behavior of Prom1 and Ttyh1 in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stefaniuk et al., 2010</xref>), Ttyh1 EVs may form by a similar mechanism to Prom1 EV formation.

We observe formation of Prom1 EVs of relatively similar size in our reconstituted system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This may be an example of endogenous regulation of Prom1-induced membrane curvature, with curvature-stabilizing proteins like Peripherin preventing the evaginating membrane from budding into EVs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ttyh1 forms EVs with membranes that are more tubulated than Prom1 EV membranes</title><p>Ttyh1 produces EVs similar in size and density to Prom1 EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–L</xref>). However, Ttyh1 EVs are dramatically more tubulated that Prom1 EVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D, E, G</xref>). Several factors could contribute to this increase in membrane bending. First, Ttyh1 is present in EVs at concentrations approximately fivefold higher than Prom1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I</xref>). Membrane proteins can induce curvature through molecular crowding when enriched at sufficiently high local concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Derganc and Čopič, 2016</xref>). Second, Ttyh1 co-purifies with cholesterol less efficiently than Prom1 does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A confounding effect in our experiments is that molecular crowding may also alter the efficiency with which cholesterol is extracted from EV membranes by detergent. Although we did not observe a kinetically stable interaction between Ttyh1 and cholesterol, it remains to be conclusively determined whether Ttyh1–cholesterol interactions occur in native membranes. Ideally, molecular-crowding and cholesterol-binding effects could be differentiated by modulating protein-to-lipid ratios in EV membranes. Unfortunately, our native purified EVs do not provide a tractable path to perform these experiments. Future experiments reconstituting Prom1 and Ttyh1 into artificial liposomes with variable cholesterol content will be necessary to fully elucidate the mechanistic differences in membrane bending between Prominin and Ttyh proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cholesterol-binding stability may contribute to membrane-bending regulation by Prom1</title><p>We find here that Prom1 in EVs forms a stable interaction with cholesterol that is resistant to delipidation by nonionic detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). A disease-associated mutation in a strikingly conserved residue in the fifth transmembrane helix of Prom1, W795R, substantially stabilizes cholesterol binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). In AlphaFold2 models, Trp-795 forms a series of base–stacking interactions with Phe residues in neighboring transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). We find that conservative mutations in several of these adjacent aromatic residues impair EV formation by Prom1, but do not mimic the stable cholesterol binding of W795R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D, F</xref>). Cholesterol is asymmetrically distributed in eukaryotic membranes, with a bias toward the outer leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lorent et al., 2020</xref>). Prom1 Trp-795 is predicted to be positioned toward the outer leaflet, possibly potentiating interactions with cholesterol. We also observe increases in cholesterol-binding stability for mutations to two CARC domains in Prom1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, F</xref>). This effect could arise because these residues interface with cholesterol or because they destabilize the transmembrane domain in a manner that mimics the effect of the W795R mutation. Given the poor evolutionary conservation of the two CARC motifs in human Prom1, we favor the latter explanation.</p><p>We further show that the W795R mutation prevents efficient trafficking of mStayGold-tagged Prom1 to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). W795R Prom1 is expressed but primarily localizes to WGA<sup>+</sup> intracellular vesicles. This observation explains the low yield of W795R EVs produced in cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

They find that Ttyh1 expression leads to an increase in small EVs as well as tubulated EVs, while Prom1 expression leads to a milder increase in small EVs. EV induction by Prom1 is dependent on cholesterol and the authors show that Prom1 makes the cholesterol in EVs more resistant to detergent. The authors show no connection between Ttyh1 EV induction and cholesterol, although they claim it is important. They also show that a disease mutation in Prom1 decreases Prom1 trafficking to the plasma membrane and increases cholesterol resistance to detergent in EVs. The authors also find that the disease mutation decreases the size of the Prom1-induced EVs.</p><p>Major Comments</p><p>Results – line 99-106 – The EV isolation protocol would remove large EVs like the Prom1+ midbody remnants. It is important to explicitly specify that this study focused on small EVs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and appreciate the suggestion to make this distinction. We have clarified the Results text (lines 104-105) to specify that our method specifically reconstitutes and isolates small EVs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistics – The t tests appear to have been performed without correction for multiple comparisons (Figure 2C-D, Figure 4D). Given that &gt;10 comparisons were made, this can alter the biological significance of p&lt;0.05 (1 incorrect in 20 comparisons). Please reanalyze with a more appropriate statistical test for multiple comparisons (i.e. ANOVA) or apply a correction to the t test values (i.e. Bonferroni).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that multiple test correction is appropriate for these figures. We have applied Bonferroni correction to the t-tests in Figures2C, 2D, and 4D by adjusting our significance thresholds (α), and included additional text in the figure legend to indicate how and why the correction was performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The DLS data does not appear to give any insight into EV size (unlike the EM data) and could be removed from the whole manuscript (or moved to supplemental). The authors should also remove any conclusions based on the DLS data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers raising this point and agree that the DLS is less informative than our other measurements of EV size and morphology. We have moved all DLS figure panels where EV size is characterized by another method to the Supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion – line 382-383 &quot;Because Prom1 EVs arise directly from blebbing of the plasma membrane23, this finding suggests that Prom1 and Ttyh1 traffic to similar regions of the plasma membrane.&quot;</p><p>The authors have not examined where Prom1 or Ttyh1 localize in the plasma membrane and can not draw this conclusion. That both proteins promote plasma membrane budding would only suggest that both proteins localize to the plasma membrane, not subregions of the plasma membrane. However, the authors have not demonstrated that Ttyh1 specifically induces plasma membrane budding. The different size of Ttyh1 EVs could be due to different biogenesis mechanisms (i.e. derived from intracellular organelles instead of the plasma membrane), making this statement an over-interpretation on both parts.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point. We have removed this sentence from the Discussion (lines 402-403) as the reviewer requests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion – line 398-400 &quot;Membrane cholesterol is necessary for Prom1-mediated remodeling20,21 and is present at similar levels in purified Prom1 and Ttyh1 EVs (Figure 5E), indicating that it is undoubtedly important for EV formation by both proteins.&quot; &amp; line 415-417 &quot;We find that conservative mutations in several of these adjacent aromatic residues impair EV formation by Prom1, but do not mimic the stable cholesterol binding of W795R (Figures2C, 4D). &quot;</p><p>The author's data suggests that cholesterol is not important for Ttyh1 to induce EV formation. The authors show that cholesterol depletion does not alter Ttyh1 EV production. Similarly, they find separable effects on cholesterol binding and EV formation with Prom1 mutants, which suggest that there is more to Prom1-mediated EV formation than cholesterol. That cholesterol is present at similar levels can reflect that overexpression of these proteins does not alter the amount of cholesterol in the EV source membrane (i.e. plasma membrane). Also, wouldn't molecular crowding of a membrane protein be predicted to influence how easy it is to extract lipids?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this imprecisely phrased sentence. We only meant to indicate that cholesterol is present in both sets of EVs and contributes globally to membrane fluidity. We have removed this sentence from the Discussion (lines 419-421) to avoid over-interpretation or confusion.</p><p>The reviewer is also correct to point out that molecular crowding could alter how extractable lipids are from EVs.

We agree that “physically similar” is a more precise and accurate term, and have revised all instances of this language in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Intro – line 59-60 – &quot;Large Prom1 EVs (500-700 nm in diameter) appear to form from bulk release of membrane from the cell midbody&quot;</p><p>Midbody remnants are well defined (if variously named, i.e. flemmingsome) large EVs derived from the spindle midbody, intercellular bridge, and cytokinetic ring. I'm not sure what the authors are trying to express by &quot;bulk release of membrane&quot;. Midbody remnants are also a site of membrane tubulation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to point out that midbody remnant release is a well defined process. We originally included this statement to avoid indicating that we are studying the only known class of Prominin EVs, but now recognize that including this creates more confusion that it alleviates. To improve clarity concurrently with the changes referenced above emphasizing that we are specifically studying small EVs, we have removed this reference to the larger class of EVs from the introduction (lines 61-63).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The effect on total numbers of EVs is buried in the y-axes of the EM graphs, making it difficult to distinguish where a higher n of images was examined vs. where there is an increase in EVs. This is especially hard to interpret given the high difference in n values.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise a valid critique of these figure panels. To improve clarity, we have adjusted the y-axes to represent the fraction of EVs rather than the absolute value of EVs, and listed the n values in figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C – Missing WT error bars</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern for the WT error bars in these figures. The measurements underlying these plots are derived from quantification of Western blots. Because the blots have a limited number of lanes, the WT sample was run as a normalization control on each of several sets of blots. By employing this approach, we could make quantitative comparisons within each blot without needing to make direct comparisons between blots, eliminating confounding variables such as blotting times, positions of blots on rotary shakers, developer incubation time, exposure times, etc. Because WT lanes were used for normalization, each “WT” blot condition has its own set of error bars that was used for t-test comparison with the samples that share a blot. For this purely technical reason, we can represent the data either normalized against WT values or with three separate WT measurements for each plot. In the interest of clarity and transparency, we elected to report the values normalized to WT and to include all raw blot images in Supplementary Figure S4. We understand that we could have made this more transparent, so to clarify this decision for readers, we now explicitly reference the raw blot images in both the Results text (lines 185) and in the Figure 2 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3H, 5C – Why not show raw numbers on the y-axes of the inset graphs like the main graph?

I had a hard time figuring out what these insets were trying to show me, so please think about presenting this data more clearly (and larger).</p></disp-quote><p>For clarity, we have moved the inset graphs to separate panels alongside the main panel and implemented the requested changes to the axes (see Figures 3G, 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion – line 377 – &quot;Though we do not claim that Ttyh1 endogenously induces EV formation&quot;</p><p>This statement could be misinterpreted to say that you do not think endogenous Ttyh1 regulates EV formation.

They showed that both proteins can induce EV formation, while the mechanisms by which they do it might differ slightly. Ttyh1 binding to cholesterol is not as pronounced as Prom1. Surprisingly, cholesterol binding efficiency inversely correlates with EV formation. Also, EVs induced by Tthy1 and Prom1 are structurally different.</p><p>My suggestions to improve the manuscript are below.</p><p>- Figure 2E is not very convincing. As the authors mentioned, the signal is too low to have a concrete conclusion. The line scans somehow show that WT is more membrane-localized than mutant, but colocalization of Prom1 and WGA seems very similar in both cases. Is it certain that the addition of fluorophore did not change the trafficking? Does endogenous Prom-1 staining look like this? Also, why is WGA staining brighter in mutant sample, just a usual variation or biologically important?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern about low signal, but respectfully disagree that the signal is too low to draw a meaningful conclusion. The only point we conclusively make in Figure 2E is that WT Prom1 is more efficiently trafficked to the plasma membrane than W795R Prom1. We feel that this effect is sufficiently well evidenced by the line scan analysis in Supp. Figure S5, where Prom1 peaks are cleanly visible for WT but not for W795R protein.</p><p>We observe somewhat variable WGA staining in our experiments, and the differences we show in this figure panel are representative of typical staining variation. We do not draw any biological conclusions from the level of WGA present, only from its localization. Because both the plasma membrane and late endosomes are WGA<sup>+</sup>, we suspect that the W795R Prom1 is failing to traffic from endosomes to the plasma membrane. However, given the limitations of our fluorescence assay, we have removed any claim beyond the change plasma membrane trafficking efficiency from discussion of this experiment.</p><p>We cannot conclude whether the mStayGold fluorophore alters trafficking of Prom1 to the plasma membrane. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we attempted to use immunofluorescence to measure membrane localization of untagged Prom1 with the AC133-1 antibody. Unfortunately, we were unable to optimize this protocol to achieve sufficient membrane staining for quantification. We have softened our interpretation of Figure 2E in the Results and Discussion (lines 203-204, 450) to acknowledge that the effects we observe are only measured with fluorophore-tagged Prom1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I also recommend showing the localization of Ttyh1 on cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion here, and it is an experiment we considered. One of the challenges we faced in this assay was quantitatively measuring fluorescent signal along cell-boundary plasma membranes without saturating signal from the very bright WGA<sup>+</sup> endosomes. Because Ttyh1 globally expresses at higher levels than Prom1 (see Figures 3C, 3I), direct comparison of membrane-localized Prom1 and Ttyh1 is technically challenging in these cells. However, Ttyh membrane localization has been widely reported in other papers (Matthews et al., J. Neurochem, 2007; Jung et al., J. Neurosci., 2017; Sukalskaia et al., Nat. Commun., 2021; Melvin et al., Comm. Biol., 2022) that we now explicitly mention and cite for reader clarity in both the Introduction and Results (lines 69-71, 224-225).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A graph directly showing cholesterol binding vs EV formation efficiency would be very useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this would be an interesting and useful addition to the paper.
