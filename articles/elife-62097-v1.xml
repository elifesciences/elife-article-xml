We report that mouse Celsr1 engages in both <italic>trans</italic>- and <italic>cis</italic>-interactions, and organizes into dense and highly stable punctate assemblies. We provide evidence suggesting that PCP-mutant variant of Celsr1, Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup>, selectively impairs lateral <italic>cis</italic>-interactions. Although Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> mediates cell adhesion in trans, it displays increased mobility, diminishes junctional enrichment, and fails to engage in homophilic adhesion with the wild-type protein, phenotypes that can be rescued by ectopic <italic>cis</italic>-dimerization. Using biochemical and super-resolution microscopy approaches, we show that although Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> physically interacts with PCP proteins Frizzled6 and Vangl2, it fails to organize these proteins into asymmetric junctional complexes.

The PCP pathway is essential for embryonic development, and genetic disruption of PCP leads to severe developmental defects, including neural tube and congenital heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kibar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curtin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phillips et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). To align polarity across a tissue, PCP proteins interact intercellularly to couple polarity between neighboring cells, but the mechanisms regulating these molecular interactions remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ebnet et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A defining feature of PCP is the asymmetric localization of membrane-associated PCP proteins at cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>). The direction of polarity is thought to be determined by a global cue that biases PCP localization relative to the tissue axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aw and Devenport, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>). PCP proteins then redistribute from initially uniform localizations to become enriched at cell junctions oriented along one tissue axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devenport, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aw and Devenport, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ebnet et al., 2018</xref>). Transmembrane proteins Frizzled (Fz) and Van Gogh-like (Vangl) localize to opposing sides of the junction, where they interact intercellularly in complex with atypical cadherin Celsr1. Cytoplasmic proteins Dishevelled and Prickle colocalize with Fz and Vangl, respectively, and are important for amplifying asymmetry through oligomerization domains that mediate self-recruitment, and by promoting mobility and disassembly of the oppositely oriented complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devenport, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 2020</xref>). How Celsr1-mediated intercellular interactions contribute to this asymmetric reorganization of PCP protein complexes is poorly understood.</p><p>Celsr1 is a large atypical cadherin with an extracellular domain comprised of nine N-terminal cadherin repeats followed by several EGF and laminin repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goffinet and Tissir, 2017</xref>).

The <italic>Crash</italic> (<italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic>) mutant mouse, which harbors a single amino acid substitution (D1040G) between extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats 7 and 8 of Celsr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curtin et al., 2003</xref>), provides an inroad into understanding cadherin-mediated adhesion in the establishment of PCP. Originally identified in a chemical mutagenesis screen, mice homozygous for the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> allele display severe defects associated with a loss of PCP: a complete failure to close the neural tube, misoriented stereocilia bundles in the inner ear, and misalignment of hair follicles across the skin surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curtin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>). A point mutation in the cadherin repeats of Celsr1 is predicted to affect homophilic adhesion, but not necessarily protein levels or intracellular transport, allowing us to selectively address the function of Celsr1 adhesive interactions in PCP.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that the membrane proximal cadherin repeats of Celsr1 modulate its adhesive function to regulate PCP dynamics. Specifically, we use a combination of cell adhesion and biochemical assays, as well as live and super-resolution imaging to show that the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation in Celsr1 does not eliminate <italic>trans</italic>-adhesive interactions but rather interferes with lateral <italic>cis</italic>-interactions that organize PCP proteins into stable, clustered assemblies. Importantly, Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> is capable of physically interacting with both Fz6 and Vangl2, yet fails to organize these proteins into asymmetric junctional complexes in vivo. We propose that <italic>cis</italic>-interactions are a novel facet of Celsr1 adhesion, essential for the molecular organization of asymmetric PCP complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation abolishes Celsr1 asymmetric localization and acts as a partial dominant-negative</title><p>To investigate how extracellular adhesive interactions contribute to PCP asymmetry, we examined polarity establishment in <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>Crsh</italic></sup> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâD</xref>). In basal epithelial cells of the epidermis, PCP proteins accumulate preferentially at anteriorâposterior junctions and are depleted from mediolateral junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aw et al., 2016</xref>). For simplicity, we refer to these as âverticalâ and âhorizontalâ junctions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The diffuse cell border distribution and inability to cluster into dense membrane domains suggested that <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> may reduce Celsr1 stability. To measure the mobility of Celsr1 at intercellular junctions, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in keratinocytes expressing three Celsr1 variants â WT, Crsh, and deltaN (ÎN), a deletion that removes most of the extracellular domain. Regions along cell borders between neighboring Celsr1-expressing cells were photobleached and imaged to monitor fluorescence recovery. Celsr1<sup>WT</sup>-GFP showed little recovery into the bleached region and only a small fraction of the junctional protein was mobile, indicating Celsr1 is highly stable at junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Removing the extracellular domain (Celsr1<sup>ÎN</sup>), which prevents adhesion in trans, resulted in a dramatic increase (5.5-fold) in mobility at cell borders, demonstrating junctional stability requires intercellular interactions. The rate and total amount of fluorescence recovery for Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup>-GFP were intermediate compared to Celsr1<sup>WT</sup> and Celsr1<sup>ÎN</sup> variants (3.7-fold increase relative to WT).

These results suggest that the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation lies within a region of Celsr1 thatÂ further stabilizes Celsr1 once Celsr1 is already engaged in adhesive interactions between neighboring cells.

One possible explanation for the loss of asymmetry in <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>Crsh</italic></sup> mutants is that the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation simply abolishes the physical interaction between Celsr1 and Fz6 and/or Vangl2. However, three key pieces of evidence argue against this possibility. First, examination of Fz6 and Vangl2 localization in the epidermis in vivo showed that although their asymmetric localization was severely disrupted in <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>Crsh</italic></sup> embryos, Fz6 and Vangl2 still localized to cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Second, similar to Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> co-expression with Vangl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Devenport and Fuchs, 2008</xref>), when co-expressed with Fz6-tdTomato in cultured keratinocytes, Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup>-GFP was still able to drive the redistribution of Fz6 from the cytoplasm to cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Surprisingly, we observed neither. Rather, Fz6 and Vangl2 segregated laterally along borders, into distinct, non-overlapping, and often alternating domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8AâC</xref>). We refer to this distribution as <italic>lateral-junctional separation</italic>, which is further illustrated by plotting fluorescence intensity measurements along cell borders.

To quantify the cross- and lateral-junctional separation phenotypes, we used Pearsonâs correlation to measure the co-occurrence of Fz6 and Vangl2 at cell borders. At vertical borders, Fz6 and Vangl2 co-occurrence was greater than 0.7 (Â±0.04) in WT, <italic>Celsr1<sup>+</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>+</italic></sup> epidermis, and was significantly reduced in <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic><sup>/<italic>Crsh</italic></sup> (0.38Â Â±Â 0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

Thus, at horizontal borders, Fz6 and Vangl2 do not organize into asymmetric co-assemblies between cells, as they do at vertical borders.

Although Celsr1 enrichment at keratinocyte cell interfaces was highly suggestive of adhesive activity, our aggregation experiments provide definitive evidence that Celsr1 mediates cellâcell adhesion in trans. This agrees with the aggregation ability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fmi in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Usui et al., 1999</xref>) and of mammalian Celsr2 and Celsr3 in A431D cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shima et al., 2007</xref>).

It remains to be determined whether the Celsr1 cadherin repeats are sufficient for adhesion and which cadherin repeats engage in homophilic binding.</p><p>Using the Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> variant to investigate Celsr1 adhesive interactions in PCP, we provide several lines of evidence that Celsr1 also engages in lateral <italic>cis</italic>-interactions. Though, it remains to be determined if the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation weakens <italic>trans</italic>-interactions, we find that Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> retains the ability to mediate <italic>trans</italic>-cell adhesion in aggregation assays. Cadherin mutations that disrupt <italic>trans</italic>-interactions abolish cell adhesion and mutations that interfere with <italic>cis</italic>-interactions prevent the formation of stable junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). This is precisely what we observe for Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup>. Cell adhesion in the aggregation assay is not abolished, rather we find that Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> fails to form stable junctions, both on its own or in mixed junctions with WT. Whereas Celsr1<sup>WT</sup> enriches at cell borders and organizes into punctate assemblies, the Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> variant displays a diffuse cell surface distribution and fails to enrich at cellâcell borders. Further, Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> exhibits increased mobility by FRAP, but is more stable than a variant incapable of mediating adhesion in trans. Notably, many of these features phenocopy those of an E-cadherin <italic>cis</italic>-mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, induced <italic>cis</italic>-dimerization of Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> rescues both its border enrichment and interactions with Celsr1<sup>WT</sup>, providing compelling evidence that Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> interferes with extracellular <italic>cis</italic>-interactions. The Celsr1 <italic>cis</italic>-binding interface could involve EC7-8, near where the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation lies. Alternatively, many cadherin superfamily proteins contain membrane adjacent domains (MADs) that mediate weak <italic>cis</italic>-homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De-la-Torre et al., 2018</xref>). Celsr1 contains a predicted MAD just C-terminal to EC9, thus it is possible that the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation hinders MAD-dependent <italic>cis</italic>-interactions.</p><p>Cadherins organize into relatively stable, nanoscale clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yap et al., 2015</xref>), a feature we observe to be shared by Celsr1 in both mouse epidermis and keratinocytes. Further, PCP proteins also organize into stable punctate assemblies that are highly clustered, uniformly sized, and regularly spaced along cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strutt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aw et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strutt et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Warrington et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these puncta are characterized by increased fluorescence intensity and low turnover compared to non-punctate regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strutt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strutt et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Warrington et al., 2017</xref>). Our data implicate the EC7-8 region of Celsr1 in this stable cluster formation. Using dSTORM, we observe that Celsr1 organizes into dense, evenly spaced puncta at cell borders, whereas Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> mutant puncta are disorganized with reduced molecular density. Celsr1 turnover is also relatively slow, with a mobile fraction only 60% that of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aw et al., 2016</xref>), and the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation increases Celsr1 mobility 3.7-fold. Thus, enrichment of PCP proteins into stable punctate assemblies is a conserved feature of PCP organization driven in part by Celsr1-mediated lateral <italic>cis</italic>-clustering.</p><p>Importantly, our data also provide new insights into the formation of asymmetric, junctional PCP complexes. Using SIM, we observe separation of Fz6 and Vangl2 across verticallyÂ oriented junctions, providing direct evidence that endogenous Fz6 and Vangl2 partition to opposite sides of the cell. By contrast, Fz6 and Vangl2 segregate laterally along junctions in <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh/Crsh</sup></italic> epidermis, suggesting that Celsr1 <italic>cis</italic>-clustering is a prerequisite for intercellular Fz6-Celsr1 and Vangl2-Celsr1 complexes to stably engage. Intriguingly, Fz6 and Vangl2 also separate laterally along horizontal, non-PCP borders suggesting that lateral-junctional separation may represent a distinct phase of PCP establishment or an alternative steady-state of PCP. Although we cannot resolve whether laterallyÂ separated Fz6 and Vangl2 domains represent symmetric, homotypic PCP complexes, or hemi-PCP complexes that are unbound intercellularly, such non-asymmetric complexes are thought to be unstable and removed through endocytic turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>). The observation that PCP organization at horizontal borders resembles that of a potential <italic>cis</italic>-clustering mutant suggests a model where global cues that direct PCP asymmetry might promote Celsr1 lateral clustering, ensuring stable PCP complexes form preferably along vertical edges.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> Fmi has been shown to display differential preferences for Fz and Vang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Struhl et al., 2012</xref>), leading to the suggestion that the FmiâFmi <italic>trans</italic>-homodimer could have an asymmetric conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, Celsr1 <italic>cis</italic>-interactions may in fact provide such a conformational change that serves as an allosteric switch leading to preferential Fz6 or Vangl2 interactions. This in turn could nucleate and propagate asymmetry via clustered, stable PCP domains. Feedback interactions involving Fz6, Vangl2, and/or cytoplasmic PCP proteins could then amplify asymmetry through additional Celsr1 clustering and stabilization.</p><p>The importance of investigating how Celsr1 adhesion contributes to junctional PCP asymmetry and the utility of the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation are underscored by the presence of human disease-associated mutations in Celsr1, such as those identified in patients with neural tube and congenital heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allache et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiao et al., 2016</xref>). Several of these human Celsr1 mutations have been mapped to the cadherin repeats, including the region near the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation in mouse Celsr1. Of particular interest are variants P870L and V1008L, as they may hinder Celsr1 dimerization and PCP organization, thus contributing to the disease phenotype. V1008L maps near the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> region of Celsr1 and P870L maps to EC6, a membrane-proximal cadherin repeat not far from EC8 where <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> is localized. Interestingly, a zebrafish model of P870L induced neural tube defects, but the underlying molecular interactions and membrane dynamics of Celsr1<sup>P870L</sup> need to be investigated further. Future studies deciphering whether these and other human mutations differentially disrupt Celsr1 adhesion and PCP asymmetry will further aid in identifying the mechanisms of Celsr1 adhesion.</p><p>Together with the data presented here, we propose a model in which the <italic>Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup></italic> mutation lies within a <italic>cis</italic>-interacting region of Celsr1 that functions to stabilize and reinforce adhesion. Lateral <italic>cis</italic>-interactions would serve as a novel mechanism to regulate Celsr1 adhesion, stability, and possible conformational changes that are required for the asymmetric organization of core PCP proteins within the junctional complex. Additional studies that define the precise <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans-</italic>binding interfaces are essential to support or challenge this model of Celsr1 adhesion and function. Elucidating the specific Celsr1 adhesive interactions that contribute to PCP complex organization will further illuminate how PCP modulates tissue polarity during development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, a segmented line was drawn along the junction and non-junction regions of the cell perimeter and the ratio of junction to non-junction mean intensity ratio was quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Quantification of Celsr1 polarity</title><p>Celsr1 polarity was calculated using Tissue Analyzer as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aw et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cetera et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, cells were segmented using Vangl2 staining as a membrane signal for images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Axis and magnitude (nematic order) of junctional polarity were calculated. MATLAB was used to plot the data on a circular histogram using the polar plot function. The magnitude of average Celsr1 polarity (Mp) was defined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Quantification of Celsr1 puncta imaged by dSTORM</title><p>After initial processing of raw dSTORM images in NIS-Elements, cell border regions of molecular density rendered images were further processed using custom MATLAB scripts (source codes 1â2). Images were binarized and Celsr1-containing clusters were identified using a morphological closing operation with a disk-shaped structural element and a 17-pixel radius corresponding to 45 nm. Identified clusters were labeled with IDs using the âbwlabelâ function in MATLAB with an 8-pixel connectivity. The labeled image was then multiplied with the original binarized image to label the original pixels with the associated cluster ID. Clusters with 10 or more molecules were classified as âpunctaâ. Coordinates of all pixels were outputted and marked whether they were part of a puncta or not. For those classified as puncta, several measurements were taken. Molecule count is the sum of the value of pixels in the puncta of the image prior to binarization. Area of the pixels making up a puncta was defined using a convex hull generated from the puncta pixels. Density is the number of molecules in a puncta divided by the area of the convex hull for that puncta. Images of puncta outlined with the convex hull were generated to allow for manual filtering of puncta actually containing multiple puncta that were mis-identified as individual puncta. Fifteen out of 283 Celsr1<sup>WT</sup> (WT) and 14 out of 795 Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> (Crsh) puncta were filtered out of all further analyses and plots.</p><p>To quantify Celsr1 clustering behavior, we turned to the widely utilized Ripleyâs K function, a measure of spatial clustering by determining the deviation of the observed distribution from a random, non-clustered distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ripley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). Ripleyâs L statistic, the linear transformation of Ripleyâs K, was calculated on the coordinate data in a custom R script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode3">Source code 3</xref>) using the âspatstatâ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baddeley et al., 2016</xref>). Coordinates were read into R and the point pattern dataÂ set was constructed for each cluster with windows as rectangles with width equal to the distance between the leftmost and rightmost point plus 75 pixels (200 nm), and height equal to the distance between the bottommost and topmost point plus 75 pixels. This 200 nm buffer was added to ensure that the Ripleyâs L statistic was calculated up to 200 nm for each puncta, as the sizes of the puncta vary in size. Ripleyâs L statistic was then calculated for each cluster. Significance testing between WT and Crsh were calculated using the âstudperm.testâ function of the âspatstatâ package using the âLestâ for Ripleyâs L as the summary function, âbestâ for the correction, 0â200 nm for the r interval, three as the minimum number of points, and Tbar for the significance test. Note that one limitation of this analysis is the âspatstatâ package utilizes the binarized images and does not allow for duplicate points, or multiple molecules per pixel. Thus, the number of molecules is not taken into account for these measurements. However, we expect that differences in the Ripleyâs L statistic are being under-estimated given that WT puncta consist of more molecules per puncta compared to Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Quantification of Frizzled6 and Vangl2 colocalization</title><p>Reconstructed SIM images were analyzed for Pearsonâs R value using âColoc 2â in ImageJ Fiji.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper examines the role of the transmembrane adhesion protein CELSR-1 in establishing the asymmetric cell-cell junctions in mammalian planar polarized epithelia. CELSR-1 can mediate adhesion between cells, and it also organizes the proteins Fzd6 and Vangl, which are found on opposing membranes in these junctions, into stable clusters, which provides insights into how planar cell polarity develops and maintained.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.

Super-resolution imaging shows that CELSR-1 can organize Fzd6 and Vangl into stable clusters. The clustering is disrupted in the Crsh mutant, which causes defects in PCP and which harbors a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular cadherin repeats of CELSR-1, which the authors interpret as an effect on cis-interactions of CELSR on the cell surface. The segregation of non-junctional Fzd6 and Vangl2 is another potentially important finding for understanding how PCP develops or is maintained. Although clustering has been documented in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these findings add important new data for the mammalian system.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers find that your data do not establish that the Crsh mutant is specifically defective in cis- vs. trans adhesion, which is a major mechanistic conclusion. The mechanism of CELSR cadherin interactions is not known, and it is possible that the mutant has weakened trans adhesion; unfortunately there do not appear to be mutations equivalent to W2A of classical cadherins that selectively disrupts trans interactions. The failure to see Crsh at borders between keratinocytes or its weak accumulation there in K-562 cells does not distinguish between cis and trans defects, and either kind of defect could explain the FRAP data. The sorting observed in the K-562 adhesion experiments could be due to weakened trans interactions, and/or different levels of surface CELSR molecules.

We completely agree that without experiments aimed at measuring the strength and/or duration (such as single-molecule biophysics) of trans or cis interactions specifically with respect to Wt and Crsh, we cannot definitely conclude that Crsh is a cis-specific mutant. We are pursuing these experiments as part of a separate study. Within the scope of this current manuscript, we simply wished to present our working model and hypothesis that Crsh is lies within a cis-interacting region of Celsr1. We are open to other possibilities and look forward to fully uncovering this aspect of Celsr biology. To address the reviewersâ concerns, we have made an effort to discuss our results in a more balanced manner, considering models that account for both defects in trans- and cis-interactions. This is reflected in edits to the Abstract, Results and Discussion sections. We have also modified the phrasing in the Discussion section to âproposeâ a working model rather than stating our findings âsupportâ a model with Crsh defective in cis-interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Cell surface levels of WT and Crsh CELSR need to be compared (perhaps by cell surface biotinylation) to rule out differences as a possible contribution to the adhesive differences, particularly given the apparently larger amount of intracellular Crsh compared to WT.

Surface biotinylation was used to measure the cell surface level of Celsr1<sup>WT</sup> and Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup> in the K562 cells used for mixing adhesion assays. These results are now presented in current Figure 2âfigure supplement 1, panels C-D. We do find that both Celsr1 forms are expressed at the cell surface at similar levels. Thus, adhesive differences observed with our mixing assay are likely not due to difference in Celsr1 levels at the cell surface. Further, if differences in surface levels were present, we might expect that Wt and Crsh cells would still aggregate but that the lower expressing cells would surround the higher expressing cells, as has been observed for classical cadherins. However, that is not what we see, as the Wt and Crsh really sort into distinct cell aggregates. Even at initial, early time points of mixing, we do not see evidence of the âinner coreâ / âouter shellâ phenotype. This result is now addressed in more detail in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the text, the authors say that the Crsh mutation does not impair Celsr1 interactions with Vangl2.

While we see a slight decrease in Vangl2 interactions compared to Fz6 (both normalized to Celsr1), the results were variable across the three experimental replicates and were not ultimately statistically significant. The text has been modified to account for the quantification addition and we have edited the Results section heading âCrsh does not impair Celsr1 interactions with PCP proteins Frizzled6 and Vangl2â to read âCrsh physically interacts with PCP proteins Frizzled6 and Vangl2â. Our main conclusion from these results are that Crsh is still physically and biochemically able to interact with both Fz6 and Vangl2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comparing colocalization of WT and Crsh mutants with anti-Celsr1 and Vangl2 and Fzd6 antibodies should be done to assess whether the mutant only associates with Fzd6 or at least localizes more with Fzd6 than Vangl2.</p></disp-quote><p>Colocalization of Celsr1 with either Fz6 and Vangl2 in WT and Crsh mutants is now presented in current Figure 8âfigure supplement 1 and 2. We find that Fz6 and Vangl2 colocalization with Celsr1 is similarly reduced in Crsh mutants at vertical borders. Celsr1 and Fz6 colocalization at horizontal borders also resembles that of Crsh at all borders, similar to the findings for Fz6 and Vangl2 colocalization. Interestingly, we do find a statistically significant reduction of Celsr1 colocalization with Vangl2 at horizontal cell borders in Crsh mutants relative to WT. This result, along with the slight reduction (though not statistically significant) in Crsh-Vangl2 interactions by co-IP, does suggest that the Crsh mutation may have a greater effect on Celsr1-Vangl2 interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related issue occurs when it is stated that &quot;when co-expressed with Fz6-tdTomato or mCherry-Vangl2â¦in cultured keratinocytes, Celsr1<sup>Crsh</sup>-GFP was still able to drive the redistribution of Vangl2 and Fz6 from the cytoplasm to cell contacts (Figure 8âfigure supplement 1).&quot; Only Fz is shown.</p></disp-quote><p>For Figure 8âfigure supplement 1 (now Figure 7âfigure supplement 1), only Fz6 is shown because this experiment with Vangl2 was previously published (Devenport and Fuchs, 2008).
