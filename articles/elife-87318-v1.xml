id="abs1"><title>Background:</title><p>Primaquine is an 8-aminoquinoline antimalarial. It is the only widely available treatment to prevent relapses of <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria. The 8-aminoquinolines cause dose-dependent haemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd). G6PDd is common in malaria endemic areas but testing is often not available. As a consequence primaquine is underused.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted an adaptive pharmacometric study to characterise the relationship between primaquine dose and haemolysis in G6PDd. The aim was to explore shorter and safer primaquine radical cure regimens compared to the currently recommended 8-weekly regimen (0.75 mg/kg once weekly), potentially obviating the need for G6PD testing. Hemizygous G6PDd healthy adult Thai and Burmese male volunteers were admitted to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Bangkok. In Part 1, volunteers were given ascending dose primaquine regimens whereby daily doses were increased from 7.5 mg up to 45 mg over 15–20 days. In Part 2 conducted at least 6 months later, a single primaquine 45 mg dose was given.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>24 volunteers were enrolled in Part 1, and 16 in Part 2 (13 participated in both studies). In three volunteers, the ascending dose regimen was stopped because of haemolysis (n=1) and asymptomatic increases in transaminases (n=2; one was hepatitis E positive). Otherwise the ascending regimens were well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. In Part 1, the median haemoglobin concentration decline was 3.7 g/dL (range: 2.1–5.9; relative decline of 26% [range: 15–40%]). Primaquine doses up to 0.87 mg/kg/day were tolerated subsequently without clinically significant further falls in haemoglobin. In Part 2, the median haemoglobin concentration decline was 1.7 g/dL (range 0.9–4.1; relative fall of 12% [range: 7–30% decrease]). The ascending dose primaquine regimens gave seven times more drug but resulted in only double the haemoglobin decline.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with Southeast Asian G6PDd variants, full radical cure treatment can be given in under 3 weeks compared with the current 8-week regimen.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom (MR/R015252/1) and Wellcome (093956/Z/10/C, 223253/Z/21/Z).</p></sec><sec id="abs6"><title>Clinical trial number:</title><p>Thai Clinical Trial Registry: <related-object document-id="TCTR20170830002" document-id-type="clinical-trial-number" id="RO1" source-id="TCTR" source-id-type="registry-name" source-type="clinical-trials-registry" xlink:href="https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/export/pdf/TCTR20170830002">TCTR20170830002</related-object> and <related-object document-id="TCTR20220317004" document-id-type="clinical-trial-number" id="RO2" source-id="TCTR" source-id-type="registry-name" source-type="clinical-trials-registry" xlink:href="https://www.thaiclinicaltrials.org/export/pdf/TCTR20220317004">TCTR20220317004</related-object>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primaquine</kwd><kwd>glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency</kwd><kwd>radical cure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R015252/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pukrittayakamee</surname><given-names>Sasithon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/093956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/223253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Primaquine has been given to hundreds of millions of patients in single doses to prevent <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission, in 5- to 14-day courses for radical cure of vivax and ovale malarias, and during mass treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashley et al., 2014</xref>). The main adverse effect of primaquine, and the other 8-aminoquinoline antimalarials, is dose-dependent oxidant haemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luzzatto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Recht et al., 2014</xref>). As G6PD deficiency is common in malaria endemic regions, primaquine is underused because reliable point-of-care testing for G6PD deficiency is usually not available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Recht et al., 2018</xref>) and prescribers are naturally reluctant to risk causing potentially severe, life-threatening haemolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yilma et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Outside sub-Saharan Africa <italic>P. vivax</italic> is the main cause of malaria in most endemic regions, and in these regions relapse is often the main cause of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Commons et al., 2020</xref>). Relapsing infections cause significant morbidity and, in higher transmission settings, mortality in young children, mediated mainly by chronic anaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Douglas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Commons et al., 2019</xref>). Relapses are also an important source of <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission. The underuse of primaquine therefore contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality and to the failure to control and eliminate vivax malaria in endemic areas.</p><p>G6PD deficiency is the most common red blood cell enzyme deficiency of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luzzatto et al., 2020</xref>). G6PD deficiency occurs mainly in malaria endemic or historically endemic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Howes et al., 2012</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>G6PD</italic> gene on the X chromosome confer reduced enzyme stability. This results in impaired erythrocyte defences against oxidant stresses and thereby increases the risk of haemolysis of older G6PD-depleted erythrocytes. More severe <italic>G6PD</italic> deficiency variants are associated with greater drug-induced haemolysis as a broader erythrocyte age range is G6PD-depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Piomelli et al., 1968</xref>). The substantial haemolytic risk from 8-aminoquinoline antimalarials means that the standard 7- to 14-day radical cure primaquine regimens are contraindicated in G6PD deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Seminal clinical investigations were conducted over 50 years ago in adults with the African A-variant of G6PD deficiency. These showed that although oxidant haemolysis was inevitable, it affected predominantly the older erythrocytes. Continued primaquine administration to G6PD-deficient subjects resulted in ‘resistance’ to the haemolytic effect. The selective haemolysis of the older red cells resulted in a compensatory increase in the number of reticulocytes. Thus, the red cell population became progressively younger and increasingly resistant to oxidant stress, so overall haemolysis decreased and a steady state was reached. This suggested a therapeutic strategy of controlled haemolysis which would limit the degree of anaemia by allowing time for the compensatory erythropoetic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alving et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kellermeyer et al., 1962</xref>). This mechanistic understanding provided the rationale for the once weekly primaquine regimen of 0.75 mg base/kg for 8 weeks, currently recommended by the World Health Organization in patients with G6PD deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>). However, the safety of this regimen in more severe <italic>G6PD</italic> deficiency variants was never established. A small cohort study of the weekly primaquine regimen in 18 G6PD-deficient (17 had the 871G&gt;A [Viangchan] variant) and 57 G6PD-normal adult vivax malaria patients in Cambodia suggested that single 45 mg doses may not be safe in the more severe <italic>G6PD</italic> deficiency variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kheng et al., 2015</xref>). A quarter of the G6PD-deficient patients had a &gt;25% fall in haemoglobin (compared to none in the G6PD-normal group) and one patient required a blood transfusion for a symptomatic fall in haemoglobin fall from 10 to 7.5 g/dL.</p><p>Over the past 50 years there has been substantial variation in national policies and practices. Some countries (e.g. Iran, Myanmar), which did not have G6PD testing available in endemic areas, have recommended the once weekly primaquine regimen as standard practice for all vivax malaria cases. Other countries have recommended giving the 14-day daily courses of primaquine without testing, although this recommendation is often not followed. To develop an alternative shorter and potentially safer approach to primaquine dosing in G6PD deficiency, we conducted a two-part adaptive pharmacometric study in Thailand with the goal of characterising the dose-response relationship for primaquine-induced haemolysis in healthy G6PD-deficient volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Trial design</title><p>The overall objective of this study was to identify radical cure primaquine regimens that would be safer in G6PD deficiency. This required titration of the daily primaquine doses against haemolysis, balancing the need to provide a radical curative dose of primaquine within a reasonable time-frame whilst minimising the inevitable haemolysis.</p><p>This was a two-part study, conducted in the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Bangkok, of primaquine in hemizygote G6PD-deficient male healthy volunteers. Part 1 evaluated the tolerability, safety, and haematological consequences of ascending doses of primaquine and was adaptive. The primaquine regimen was titrated based on the incremental haemoglobin changes observed in the previous participants, continuous safety evaluation by the investigators, and a set of guiding pre-specified rules. This iterative adaptive approach accumulated information to refine the successive regimens. The primary consideration throughout the trial was participant safety. In Part 2 of the study, after a wash-out period of at least 6 months, a single 45 mg (base equivalent) primaquine dose was given, and the volunteers were monitored as in Part 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Study site and participants</title><p>The study took place in the Clinical Therapeutics Unit volunteer ward in the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. The recruitment and follow-up periods were from November 2018 to October 2020 (Part 1) and June to September 2022 (Part 2). This coincided with and was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A COVID-19 mitigation plan was implemented when the local lockdown was lifted.</p><p>Healthy male volunteers were recruited if they provided written informed consent, had a G6PD enzyme activity &lt;30% of the population median value determined by a validated quantitative spectrophotometric G6PD assay, a known genotype-confirmed G6PD deficiency variant (according to a previously published method; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bancone et al., 2019</xref>), and were aged between 18 and 65 years with a screening haemoglobin concentration &gt;11 g/dL. Detailed exclusion criteria are provided in Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Trial procedures</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Enrolment and primaquine dosing</title><p>The risks and the rationale of the study were detailed to potential volunteers and it was explained that they could withdraw from the study at any time if they wished. Primaquine phosphate (Thailand Government Pharmaceutical Organisation, Bangkok, Thailand) was provided as tablets containing either 5 or 15 mg primaquine base equivalent. A tablet cutter was used to split the tablets (smallest dose increment was 2.5 mg base equivalent). Primaquine was given orally following a standardised light snack and subjects were observed closely for the first 4 hr.</p><sec id="s2-3-1-1"><title>Part 1</title><p>We recruited in cohorts of five volunteers, with an interval of 2 weeks between cohorts to allow sufficient time to analyse the data and determine the next primaquine regimen. The overall goal was to increase the daily primaquine doses and cause gradual haemolysis which was offset by concomitant reticulocytosis. This would steadily reduce the age of the red cell population and thereby avoid precipitous symptomatic falls in the haemoglobin concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alving et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kellermeyer et al., 1962</xref>). The cumulative total primaquine dose given needed to be sufficient to provide a radical curative effect in the treatment of vivax malaria (i.e. between 5 and 7 mg base/kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Commons et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Careful monitoring was done throughout to assess the degree of haemolysis and adjust or stop the dosing, as required. The dose regimens in this exploratory investigation (Part 1) were adapted as follows.</p><p>The primaquine regimen given to the first five volunteers consisted of four cycles of 5 days daily primaquine dosing (i.e. total 20 days). The ascending doses were 7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30 mg base equivalent, respectively. This initial dose regimen was chosen on the basis of a mathematical model of primaquine-induced haemolysis in G6PD deficiency using earlier data from vivax malaria patients who had received single 45 mg primaquine doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Watson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kheng et al., 2015</xref>). Subjects proceeded to the next higher dose cycle if they satisfied several prospectively defined safety criteria (Appendix 2). In this first round the total primaquine dose was 375 mg base equivalent. The results of the first five volunteers were reviewed and the dosing regimens adjusted. This iterative process of review and adjustment continued thereafter. The once daily dosing in each cycle was increased in increments of 2.5 or 7.5 mg (not adjusted for body weight). Once it became clear this rate of dose increase was generally well tolerated, the number of days per cycle was reduced to 3 or 4 days in subsequent subjects to test regimens of shorter duration with faster dose escalation. Subjects were reviewed clinically before each dose increase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-1-2"><title>Part 2</title><p>In Part 2, a single dose of 45 mg primaquine base equivalent was administered, with similar careful monitoring for 1 week.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Monitoring procedures/evaluations</title><p>In both studies, volunteers were observed closely. In Part 1, all volunteers were admitted to the ward for 28 days with a subsequent follow-up visit on day 49. For Part 2, at least 6 months later, volunteers were re-admitted for 24 hr on day 0, reviewed daily until day 7, and then again on day 14.</p><p>At enrolment all volunteers underwent a detailed clinical examination. Thereafter, at each assessment volunteers were asked how they felt, whether they had any adverse effects, had their vital signs measured, and two blood samples were taken for measurement of haemoglobin concentration (HemoCue, Ängelholm, Sweden). The average of the two results was recorded. Methaemoglobin (%) was measured non-invasively at least once daily using a Masimo Rad 57 oximeter, and urine colour was recorded twice daily. Haemoglobinuria was assessed visually using a modified Hillmen score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hillmen et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Wright-Giemsa-stained and new methylene blue-stained blood films were prepared for red cell morphology, and manual reticulocyte and Heinz body counts, respectively. In Part 1 these were done daily from day 0 (day of first primaquine dose) until day 20, and then on days 22, 24, 26, and 28, and finally on day 49. In Part 2 they were done at every visit. Other laboratory investigations included a complete blood count (CBC) and reticulocyte count, routine biochemistry (including lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] and haptoglobin), plasma haemoglobin, and plasma primaquine and carboxyprimaquine concentrations. In Part 1 these were done at screening and then every 3–5 days (start of each new cycle, i.e. dosing increment); in Part 2 they were done at screening, and on days 3, 7, and 14.</p><p>The G6PD deficiency variants were genotyped as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bancone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boonyuen et al., 2021</xref>). Haemoglobin electrophoresis and genotyping of the common cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) genotypes found in Southeast Asia was also performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Puaprasert et al., 2018</xref>). Presumptive alpha-thalassaemia trait (which is very common in Thailand) was defined as a mean cell volume &lt;80 fl or a mean cell haemoglobin &lt;27 pg, and HbA2 ≤4.4. Additional laboratory measurements were taken if unplanned dose adjustments were necessary, or there was a clinical indication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Safety monitoring and stopping rules for Part 1</title><p>The pre-specified rules for adjusting primaquine dose regimens across cohorts in Part 1 are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>, and the rules for increasing primaquine doses for each enrolled subject are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>. The overall aim was to titrate dosing in order to obtain small daily falls in haemoglobin of between 0.1 and 0.2 g/dL. For a given subject, primaquine doses were increased only if the haemoglobin concentration was &gt;9 g/dL, was &gt;70% of baseline, the urine Hillmen score was ≤5, and the subject felt well and had no symptoms of anaemia.</p><p>We defined haemolysis which would result in stopping primaquine (study withdrawal), as any one of the following:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&gt;40% fall in haemoglobin from baseline;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a haemoglobin below 8 g/dL (irrespective of symptoms);</p></list-item><list-item><p>a fall in haemoglobin associated with clinically significant signs of haemolysis: jaundice, passing dark urine (Hillmen score ≥6), evidence of acute renal injury (≥2-fold increase in serum creatinine from baseline), or hyperkalaemia (serum potassium &gt;5.2 mmol/L).</p></list-item></list><p>Any individual whose laboratory tests met these criteria remained in hospital and was monitored closely until resolution of signs and symptoms, and haemoglobin concentrations had reached at least 10 g/dL. Blood transfusion was available at any time if needed if volunteers had a symptomatic fall in haemoglobin to below 8 g/dL.</p><p>An Independent Drug Safety Monitoring Board was established to review the data after each cohort had completed their follow-up and gave feedback before the next cohort was allowed to proceed. For both studies, adverse events were recorded and graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria v 5.0 for grading adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Sample size</title><p>As this was an exploratory proof-of-concept, adaptive dose optimisation pharmacometric, and safety study in healthy G6PD-deficient males, there was no formal sample size calculation. We reasoned that if the tested primaquine regimens were well tolerated in 20 volunteers (i.e. four cohorts), this would provide preliminary evidence for the safety and the feasibility of this approach. In addition, the rich longitudinal data could then be used to develop an intra-host model to design optimal ascending regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Watson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Graphical visualisation of the data was the primary approach to qualitatively characterising the safety of the trialled regimens.

The baseline value for each continuous measurement was defined as the mean of the screening and day 0 measurement. Haemoglobin was measured using HemoCue (daily, two samples) and using a laboratory-processed CBC (every 4–5 days). The daily mean haemoglobin concentration was calculated as the mean of the HemoCue derived haemoglobin (the mean of the two samples) and the haemoglobin concentration from the CBC (if no CBC was done then just the mean HemoCue value). The baseline haemoglobin was then calculated as the mean of the values at screening and on day 0. The dose-response models were linear models fit using maximum likelihood. Linear regression was performed to estimate the relationship between the day 10 cumulative primaquine dose and the primary and secondary outcomes (listed in Appendix 3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Study population</title><p>Of 215 potential subjects (either identified through hospital records or screened at the walk-in clinic for G6PD deficiency), 27 male hemizygote G6PD-deficient volunteers were enrolled to the two studies between November 2018 and August 2022.

Volunteer number 18 was withdrawn from the study after 3 days of receiving 10 mg of primaquine daily because of severe low back pain which resulted from an MRI-confirmed prolapsed intervertebral disc that improved with symptomatic treatment. He was not followed up and did not participate in Part 2. As this was considered unrelated to drug administration and the total primaquine dose received was very low, his data were excluded from the primary outcome analysis.

This decrease met the stopping rule for study withdrawal (dose limiting toxicity, see Appendix 2). He developed a substantial compensatory reticulocytosis (15%). Over the next 5 days, his haemoglobin remained at ∼9 g/dL (nadir observed haemoglobin was 8.8 g/dL corresponding to a 40% decrease from baseline) and rose thereafter to 13.0 g/dL (day 28) and 14.9 g/dL by day 49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app5fig1">Appendix 5—figure 1</xref>).

He was hepatitis B immune, hepatitis A IgM negative, but hepatitis E IgM positive with a borderline IgG result, consistent with early hepatitis E infection. A liver ultrasound showed slightly increased liver echogenicity consistent with a mild fatty liver and/or mild hepatic parenchymal disease. His primaquine dosing was stopped on day 15. His increases in AST and ALT were considered most likely a result of asymptomatic hepatitis E and not primaquine. His haemoglobin was 11 g/dL at the time of withdrawal (baseline: 14.3 g/dL; 23% fall); he was subsequently lost to follow up.</p><p>Volunteer 14 (16-day regimen) also developed asymptomatic rises in ALT to reach plasma concentrations of 423 U/L (&gt;10 ULN, grade 3) and AST of 229 U/L (&gt;5 times ULN, grade 3) on day 11, associated with a raised LDH (608 IU/L) mildly raised direct (0.4 mg/dL) but normal indirect (0.9 mg/dL) bilirubin. He was also hepatitis B immune, and was hepatitis A and E antibody negative, but had a mild fatty liver on ultrasound. Primaquine dosing was stopped on day 11. By day 28, the ALT was 87 IU/L and the AST was 36 IU/L. As no other cause could be found, his increases in AST and ALT were considered to be probably related to primaquine.

Significant haemolysis from radical cure regimens cannot be avoided in G6PD deficiency but, using the rapidly eliminated primaquine, it can be attenuated. Ascending dose primaquine regimens in G6PD-deficient malaria patients exploit the same pharmacodynamic principle underling the current once weekly treatment recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alving et al., 1960</xref>). They aim to provide controlled haemolysis while allowing for steady reconstitution of the red cell population with increasingly younger, and therefore ‘oxidant-resistant’ erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kellermeyer et al., 1962</xref>). As G6PD testing is usually unavailable in malaria endemic areas, the prescriber treating vivax or ovale malaria is currently faced with the therapeutic dilemma of either not giving the drug, and failing to prevent relapses with their attendant substantial morbidity, or giving it and causing iatrogenic haemolysis in G6PD-deficient patients. The net result is that radical cure primaquine regimens are often not prescribed, even though they would be well tolerated and safe in the majority of patients who are G6PD-normal. Primaquine underuse is a major contributor to global vivax malaria morbidity.</p><p>The currently recommended 8-week radical cure regimen for G6PD-deficient patients attenuates the fall in haemoglobin, but it still risks significant haemolysis, particularly with the first 0.75 mg/kg dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kheng et al., 2015</xref>). This regimen has not been well evaluated in patients with severe <italic>G6PD</italic> deficiency variants who are at greatest risk, and it requires good adherence for 8 weeks. As much of the oxidant haemolysis occurs after the first dose, failure to complete the 8-week course (which is likely to be common) therefore incurs most of the haemolytic risk without providing the full benefit.</p><p>In this study the single 45 mg dose resulted in a median fall in haemoglobin concentration of 1.7 g/dL, which was nearly half the median fall observed with the full ascending dose regimen. In comparison, the ascending dose regimens gave a seven times higher total dose. These ascending dose primaquine regimens were relatively well tolerated in adult male volunteers with Southeast Asian variants of G6PD deficiency. Although these <italic>G6PD</italic> variants are generally regarded as moderate in severity, there is wide variation in the phenotype between variants and also between individuals with the same genotype. The ascending primaquine dose regimens are still associated with a clinically significant haemolytic risk. Thus, in considering the radical cure treatment of vivax malaria, the risks of relapse, often on multiple occasions with consequent anaemia, must be balanced against the predictable haemolysis that will result from the oxidative effects of the 8-aminoquinoline radical cure regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Commons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Commons et al., 2019</xref>). In the Southeast Asian region approximately half the vivax malaria cases will be followed by at least one relapse if radical curative treatment is not given. Many factors need to be incorporated in the assessment of both population and individual risk from haemolysis. Acute kidney injury only results from fulminant haemolysis. The main risk is dangerous anaemia. At a population level the overall risks are lower than predicted from gene frequencies because severe variants of G6PD deficiency protect against vivax malaria, although whether they affect the risk of relapse is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awab et al., 2021</xref>). At an individual level the haemolytic risk depends on the <italic>G6PD</italic> genotype, the degree of exposure to the putative oxidative 8-aminoquinoline metabolites, and also the degree of pre-existing anaemia. Vivax malaria causes anaemia, but as the haemolytic component of the malarial anaemia also results in loss of older, more deficient erythrocytes, the fractional reduction in erythrocytes resulting from the oxidant drug in acute malaria is correspondingly less. Finally, chronic anaemias associated with haemolysis (e.g. hookworm, recurrent malaria) result in younger red cell populations with right shifted oxygen dissociation curves and thus increased oxygen delivery. As a result, the pathological consequences of causing severe anaemia (haemoglobin concentration &lt;5 g/dL) depend on whether the patient was already significantly anaemic before the malaria infection and why they were anaemic.</p><p>In this exploratory study, in which there were cautious stopping rules, 3 out of 23 (13%) of the volunteers did not complete the regimen because of drug toxicity; one had significant haemolysis and two had asymptomatic hepatitis. Hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of primaquine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Recht et al., 2014</xref>). Asymptomatic hepatitis E is well documented and more common than symptomatic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kamar et al., 2012</xref>). Three volunteers were not escalated to higher primaquine doses as intended because of significant falls in haemoglobin. Such falls in haemoglobin were expected by design in this exploratory adaptive study. In none of the volunteers did haemoglobin concentrations fall below 8 g/dL. The extent of haemolysis varied substantially between volunteers, even within the same genotype. Higher baseline haemoglobin values tended to be followed by greater falls. Taken together with the high baseline reticulocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bancone et al., 2017</xref>), this suggests that subjects with G6PD deficiency have variably shortened red cell survival, and thus variably sized populations of erythrocytes vulnerable to oxidant haemolysis.</p><p>One of the important advantages of primaquine (half-life approximately 5–7 hr) relative to its slowly eliminated analogue tafenoquine (half-life approximately 15 days) is that the treatment can be stopped as soon as there are signs or symptoms of haemolytic toxicity. Despite the use of primaquine for nearly 70 years and administration of hundreds of millions of treatments there have been very few reported deaths from haemolytic toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Recht et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yilma et al., 2023</xref>). Very large mass treatments with primaquine have been used in malaria elimination campaigns involving millions of people in China, Nicaragua, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and North Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hsiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kondrashin et al., 2014</xref>). In the latter four countries an interrupted regimen involved giving 4 days of primaquine, stopping for 3 days and then completing a further 10 days. Subjects with significant haemolysis could stop the drug at any time. Serious toxicity was very rare, despite the high prevalences of G6PD deficiency in some of the regions. In West and Central Asia the severe <italic>G6PD</italic> Mediterranean variant would have been the most prevalent genotype.</p><p>In G6PD-deficient patients with acute malaria, the disease itself causes haemolytic anaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">White, 2018</xref>), and the consequent preferential loss of older erythrocytes ameliorates the adverse impact of oxidant drugs. On the other hand, compensatory reticulocytosis might be inhibited but limited experience with weekly primaquine shows a robust reticulocyte response post treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kheng et al., 2015</xref>). Differences in haemolytic response between healthy volunteers and malaria patients are likely to be small as the illness usually resolves within a few days with effective treatment, while the ascending dose regimen would still be using the lowest dose.</p><p>The main limitation of this therapeutic approach is its complexity. This could be addressed by preparation of blister packed primaquine allowing easy dose transition. The <italic>G6PD</italic> deficiency genotypes studied here are representative of those present in the Southeast Asian region, and can be regarded as of moderate severity, with the African A-genotype (in which the currently recommended once weekly dosing regimen was developed) being at the less severe end of the spectrum, and the common Mediterranean <italic>G6PD</italic> genotype being at the more severe end. The safety of this ascending dose regimen in patients with severe <italic>G6PD</italic> deficiency cannot be predicted based on these data. From a therapeutic perspective, as G6PD testing is usually not available in malaria endemic areas, the individual patient risk assessment must take into account the factors described earlier (i.e. the prevalence of G6PD deficiency and its likely severity, the sex of the patient, the degree of anaemia, and the probability of relapse), and also an assessment of the patients’ understanding of the risks and when to stop treatment, and the likelihood and feasibility of accessing health care if there is severe haemolysis.</p><p>In summary, shorter course ascending dose vivax malaria radical cure regimens in G6PD-deficient subjects offer the prospect of an effective treatment which does not incur prohibitive haemolytic toxicity and in some areas could obviate the need to test for G6PD deficiency.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data sharing statement</title><p>All analysis code and data are available via an accompanying github repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jwatowatson/Primaquine-Challenge">https://github.com/jwatowatson/Primaquine-Challenge</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial registration TCTR20170830002; TCTR20220317004.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The two parts of this study were approved as separate studies.

On one hand PQ will cause haemolysis; on the other hand, without PQ the chance of relapse is very high. As a result, out of fear of severe haemolysis, PQ has been under-used.</p><p>In view of the above, the authors have investigated in well-informed volunteers, who were kept under close medical supervision in hospital throughout the study, two different schedules of PQ administration: (1) escalating doses (to a total of 5-7 mg/kg); (2) single 45 mg dose (0.75 mg/kg).</p><p>It is shown convincingly that regimen (1) can be used successfully to deliver within 3 weeks, under hospital conditions, the dose of PQ required to prevent P vivax relapse.</p><p>As expected, with both regimens acute haemolytic anaemia (AHA) developed in all cases. With regimen (2), not surprisingly, the fall in Hb was less, although it was abrupt. With regimen (1) the average fall in Hb was about 4 G.

On one hand PQ will cause haemolysis; on the other hand, without PQ the chance of relapse is very high. As a result, out of fear of severe haemolysis, PQ has been under-used.</p><p>In view of the above, the Authors have investigated in well-informed volunteers, who were kept under close medical supervision in hospital throughout the study, two different schedules of PQ administration: (1) escalating doses (to a total of 5-7 mg/kg); (2) single 45 mg dose (0.75 mg/kg).</p><p>It is shown convincingly that regimen (1) can be used successfully to deliver within 3 weeks, under hospital conditions, the dose of PQ required to prevent P vivax relapse.</p><p>As expected, with both regimens acute haemolytic anaemia (AHA) developed in all cases. With regimen (2), not surprisingly, the fall in Hb was less, although it was abrupt. With regimen (1) the average fall in Hb was about 4 G. Only in one subject the fall in Hb mandated termination of the study.</p><p>Since the data from the Chicago group some sixty years ago, there has been no paper reporting a systematic daily analysis of AHA in so many closely monitored subjects with G6PD deficiency. The individual patient data in the Supplementary material are most informative and more than precious.</p><p>Having said this, I do have some general comments.</p><p>1. Through their remarkable Part 1 study, the Authors clearly wish to set the stage for a revision of the currently recommended PQ regimen for G6PD deficient patients. They have shown that 5-7 mg/kg can be administered within 3 weeks, whereas the currently recommended regimen provides 6 mg/kg over no less than 8 weeks.</p></disp-quote><p>We state in the abstract:“The aim was to explore shorter and safer primaquine radical cure regimens compared to the currently recommended 8-weekly regimen (0.75 mg/kg once weekly), potentially obviating the need for G6PD testing”. This is the primary goal of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Part 2 aims to show that, as was known already, even a single PQ dose of 0.75 mg/kg causes a significant degree of haemolysis: G6PD deficiency-related haemolysis is characteristically markedly dose-dependent. Although they do not state it explicitly in these words (I think they should), the Authors want to make it clear that the currently recommended regimen does cause AHA.</p></disp-quote><p>We also wanted to compare the extent of haemolysis following single dose with the extent of haemolysis following the ascending dose regimens, in the same patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Regulatory agencies like to classify a drug regimen as either SAFE or NOT-SAFE; they also like to decide who is 'at risk' and who is 'not at risk'. A wealth of data, including those in this manuscript, show that it is not correct to say that a G6PD deficient person when taking PQ is at risk of haemolysis: he or she will definitely have haemolysis. As for SAFETY, it will depend on the clinical situation when PQ is started and on the severity of the AHA that will develop.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely. Haemolysis following primaquine is inevitable. What matters is the rate and extent of haemolysis, and the compensatory response. Importantly the extent of the haemolysis, even within a specific genotype and for a given drug dose, appears to be highly variable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The above three issues are all present in the discussion, but I think they ought to be stated more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to clarify these points in a revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, by the Authors' own statement on page 15, the main limitation is the complexity of this approach. The authors suggest that blister packed PQ may help; but to me the real complexity is managing patients in the field versus the painstaking hospital care in the hands of experts, of which volunteers in this study have had the benefit. It is not surprising that a fall in Hb of 4 g/dl is well tolerated by most non-anaemic men; but patients with P vivax in the field may often have mild to moderate to severe anaemia; and certainly they will not have their Hb, retics and bilirubin checked every day. In crude approximation, we are talking of a fall in Hb of 4 G with regimen (1), as against a fall in Hb of 2 G with regimen (2), that is part of the currently recommended regimen: it stands to reason that, in terms of safety, the latter is generally preferable (even though some degree of fall in Hb will recur with each weekly dose). In my view, these difficult points should be discussed deliberately.</p></disp-quote><p>As above we have tried to clarify these important points in a revised discussion</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Page 2 para 3. The decreased haemolysis upon continued PQ administration (that originally was named the 'resistance phase' is explained by two additive factors. First, the reticulocytosis cells with higher G6PD activity pour into circulation from the bone marrow); second, the early doses of PQ has caused selective haemolysis of the oldest red cells, that had the lowest G6PD activity. This dual phenomenon is hinted at, but I think it should be stated clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have added to the Introduction (fourth paragraph in revised version):</p><p>“Continued primaquine administration to G6PD deficient subjects resulted in &quot;resistance&quot; to the haemolytic effect. The selective haemolysis of the older red cells resulted in a compensatory increase in the number of reticulocytes. Thus, the red cell population became progressively younger and increasing resistant to oxidant stress, so overall haemolysis decreased and a steady state was reached.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 4 and elsewhere. In the 'Hillmen scale' for haemoglobinuria a value &gt;6 was named a 'paroxysm'; but any value of 2 and above is already frank haemoglobinuria. Incidentally, the chart was published not in ref 17, but in NEJM 350:552, 2004.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the reference (now ref 19) to the 2004 paper by Hillmen.We used the value of 6 as clinical criterion for stopping primaquine. While &gt;2 is detectable in dilute urine, &gt;6 refers to clearly red/black urine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Table 1 and throughout the paper I am surprised that retics are given as %: absolute retic counts are more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We showed these as % counts as the majority of measurements were taken from blood slide readings where it is not possible to get an absolute count.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 10, Attenuated hemolysis with continued or recurrent doses of PQ was shown convincingly for G6PD A-. There is also one report in which the time course of AHA was extensively investigated upon deliberate administration of PQ to a subject with G6PD Mediterranean (Blood 25: 92, 1965): there was little or no evidence for a 'resistance phase'.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this suggests it might not be possible to attenuate haemolysis with the Mediterranean variant (or variants of similar severity) as even the youngest circulating red cells may be susceptible to haemolysis. More evidence is needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>S6, S7. Reticulocytes remain high until PQ is stopped; they return to normal some 17 days after stopping PQ. This should be stated in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added to the main text (section “Haemolysis and reticulocyte response”):</p><p>“It took around 2 weeks for the reticulocyte counts to re-normalise.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In subject 11 haemoglobinuria was slight on day 12; what was it before?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the caption of this Figure (Appendix 5) to:</p><p>“Day 10 urine sample from subject 11 showing slight haemoglobinuria (Hillmen score of 4). The subject had a maximum Hillmen score varying between 2 and 3 on days 4 to 9.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found individual patient data in S5 and S6 most interesting, especially since the G6PD variant was identified in each case. It would be helpful if in each case the total PQ dose were also shown, and in the interest of visual comparability the abscissa scale ought to be the same for all cases.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended Figures S5 and S6 to make them consistent with each other (now Appendix 5). We also amended the figures showing the individual subject data for consistency.</p></body></sub-article></article>
