Phagosomal membrane damage, in particular, is proposed to benefit invading pathogens. To define the innate immune consequences of this damage, we profiled macrophage transcriptional responses to wild-type <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) and mutants that fail to damage the phagosomal membrane. We identified a set of genes with enhanced expression in response to the mutants. These genes represented a late component of the TLR2-dependent transcriptional response to Mtb, distinct from an earlier component that included <italic>Tnf</italic>. Expression of the later component was inherent to TLR2 activation, dependent upon endosomal uptake, and enhanced by phagosome acidification. Canonical Mtb virulence factors that contribute to phagosomal membrane damage blunted phagosome acidification and undermined the endosome-specific response. Profiling cell survival and bacterial growth in macrophages demonstrated that the attenuation of these mutants is partially dependent upon TLR2. Further, TLR2 contributed to the attenuated phenotype of one of these mutants in a murine model of infection. These results demonstrate two distinct components of the TLR2 response and identify a component dependent upon endosomal uptake as a point where pathogenic bacteria interfere with the generation of effective inflammation. This interference promotes tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis in both macrophage and murine infection models.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>TLR2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MGH Transformative Scholar Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barczak</surname><given-names>Amy K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The pathogenic success of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> relies in part on its ability to blunt a component of the TLR2-dependent immune response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate immune recognition of invading pathogens, typically driven by the interaction of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), requires recognition of microbial products at multiple subcellular sites. While some PRRs recognize PAMPs at a single site within the cell, other PRRs have the potential to bind PAMPs and initiate signaling from multiple sites. The mechanisms through which one PRR can recognize and respond distinctly to PAMPs at different subcellular sites is best understood for TLR4/LPS interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fitzgerald et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kagan and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kagan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamamoto et al., 2003</xref>). Although principles elucidated with LPS and TLR4 are broadly thought to hold for other PAMP/PRR interactions, to date we have less insight into subcellular sites of signaling by other PRRs, the contribution of compartment-specific signaling in response to complex microorganisms, and the pathogenic strategies employed to evade such compartmentalized signaling events.</p><p>TLR2, a receptor for bacterial cell wall lipoproteins, has been suggested to signal from the plasma membrane and endosomes, similar to TLR4. Endosome-specific TLR2 signaling in response to pathogenic bacteria has been partially explored using the model of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> taken up into macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ip et al., 2010</xref>); in that work, TNF release was shown to be partially dependent upon TLR2 and dependent upon endosomal uptake. TLR2 activation has also been described to induce a type I interferon (IFN) transcriptional response from endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbalat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Musilova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stack et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, the mechanisms and physiological contexts in which compartment-specific TLR2 signaling occurs are unclear. In particular, it is unknown whether findings with <italic>S. aureus</italic> extend to other infectious agents and whether pathogens use strategies to prevent TLR2 signaling from the plasma membrane or endosomes.</p><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) represents a model to study potential mechanisms of innate immune evasion, as this pathogen co-evolved with mammals and encodes multiple strategies of host manipulation. Mtb has a complex repertoire of PAMPs, and infection with Mtb is recognized by both membrane-bound and cytosolic PRRs. The specific complement of PRRs that drive the macrophage response to the intact bacterium and the subcellular sites of recognition of those PAMPs have not been clearly defined. The canonical Mtb virulence factors phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) and ESX-1 contribute to disruption of the macrophage phagosomal membrane upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augenstreich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barczak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manzanillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quigley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simeone et al., 2012</xref>); we sought to leverage this shared pathogenic effect to gain insight into compartment-specific signaling in the macrophage response to Mtb.</p><p>To probe the relationship between Mtb-mediated phagosomal membrane damage and innate immune recognition of infection, we serially profiled the macrophage response to wild-type Mtb or PDIM and ESX-1 Mtb mutants, which fail to damage the phagosomal membrane. We found that the mutants elicited markedly enhanced expression of a cluster of inflammatory genes induced late after infection; expression was strictly dependent upon MYD88 and TLR2. TNF expression and release are commonly used as a marker of TLR activation; however, we found that induction of <italic>Tnf</italic> occurred with an earlier set of TLR2-dependent genes and differed minimally between the response to wild-type Mtb and our mutants. We thus hypothesized that infection with Mtb elicits a two-component TLR2-dependent response, and that the later component of the response is preferentially blunted by Mtb factors that damage the phagosomal membrane. Treatment of macrophages with synthetic TLR2 ligand elicited a similar two-component transcriptional response, suggesting that these components are fundamental facets of TLR2 signaling rather than pathogen-specific. Induction of the early component of the TLR2 response was similar in the presence of endosomal uptake inhibitors; in contrast, the later component was markedly diminished by inhibition of endosomal uptake. Induction of the endosome-specific response was dependent upon phagosome acidification. We found that Mtb factors known to damage the phagosomal membrane contributed to Mtb-induced limitation of phagosome acidification, which in turn limited production of the late component of the TLR2 response. Consistent with published reports, PDIM-mutant and ESX-1-mutant Mtb had attenuated virulence phenotypes in wild-type macrophages, with reduced macrophage cytotoxicity and reduced bacterial growth. Both of these attenuated phenotypes were partially reversed in <italic>Tlr2</italic>-/- macrophages, suggesting that TLR2-dependent responses contribute to the attenuation of these mutants. As expected, PDIM-mutant Mtb had attenuated infection phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice, with reduced bacterial growth and lung infiltrates. In contrast, in <italic>Tlr</italic>-/- mice PDIM-mutant Mtb grew more robustly and caused pulmonary infiltrates more similar to wild-type Mtb. These results support a model in which PDIM and ESX-1 contribute to Mtb virulence in part by blunting a protective endosome-specific component of the TLR2-dependent response to infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Macrophage infection with Mtb PDIM or ESX-1 mutants elicits enhanced expression of an inflammatory transcriptional program</title><p>The Mtb ESX-1 protein secretion system has long been known to mediate phagosomal membrane damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manzanillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simeone et al., 2012</xref>); the mycobacterial lipid PDIM was more recently found to play a similar role in infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augenstreich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barczak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quigley et al., 2017</xref>). To understand how the capacity to damage the phagosomal membrane shapes the innate immune response to Mtb, we sought to leverage the similar effects of PDIM and ESX-1-mediated secretion within the macrophage. We thus compared the response to wild-type Mtb with the response to PDIM and ESX-1 mutants, with the goal of identifying facets of the macrophage response to Mtb impacted by phagosomal membrane damage. To enable meaningful comparison, we first tested whether wild-type Mtb, PDIM mutants, and ESX-1 mutants were taken up similarly into bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). While the possibility of PDIM facilitating uptake into macrophages has been raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augenstreich et al., 2019</xref>), using either CFU or flow cytometry we found that wild-type Mtb strain H37Rv, PDIM mutants, and ESX-1 mutants were taken up at similar rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).</p><p>To define the macrophage transcriptional programs induced by Mtb, we infected BMDM with wild-type Mtb and performed comprehensive transcriptional profiling at 4, 8, 12, and 16 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Focusing on the 907 genes changed two-fold upon infection, genes could be categorized into three clusters with distinct patterns of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cluster 1 genes were progressively induced, and cluster 2 genes were progressively repressed over time after infection. Cluster 3 genes were induced upon infection and peaked at 8–12 hr before waning. To identify the facets of the macrophage response most impacted by phagosomal membrane damage, we next compared this baseline response to wild-type Mtb with the response to PDIM or ESX-1 mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For this comparison, we used PDIM mutants we had demonstrated in previous work to lack PDIM production (<italic>mas</italic> and <italic>ppsD</italic>) and an ESX-1 mutant we had demonstrated lacked ESX-1 secretion but produced and properly localized PDIM (<italic>Tn::eccCa1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barczak et al., 2017</xref>). Comparing the macrophage response to our mutants with the response to wild-type Mtb, we found that expression of genes in clusters 2 and 3 was similar in response to each of the three strains. In contrast, expression of genes in cluster 1 was markedly impacted by loss of PDIM or ESX-1. However, not all genes in the cluster responded similarly to the mutants; classifying genes in this cluster based on their response to PDIM and ESX-1 mutants clearly distinguished two subclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Induction of genes in subcluster 1A was markedly diminished in response to PDIM and ESX-1 mutants relative to wild-type Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Ingenuity pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krämer et al., 2014</xref>) of genes in this subcluster predicted STAT1, IRF3, IFN, and IFNAR as upstream regulators with high confidence, suggesting that these genes comprised the type I IFN response. Manual inspection confirmed that IFN stimulated genes were highly represented in subcluster 1A. These results were consistent with previous work demonstrating that the macrophage type I IFN response to Mtb is dependent upon ESX-1-mediated secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stanley et al., 2007</xref>) and PDIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barczak et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Macrophage infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) or ESX-1 mutants reveals two subclusters of genes differentially expressed relative to infection with wild-type Mtb.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) C57BL/6J bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were infected with wild-type Mtb H37Rv (‘WT’), the ESX-1 core complex mutant <italic>Tn::eccCa1</italic> (‘E’), or the PDIM production mutant <italic>mas</italic> (‘P’) at an MOI of 2:1.

The kinetics of overall induction and enhanced expression observed in response to the PDIM and ESX-1 mutants were independent of MOI, as the same patterns were observed infecting with MOI 2:1 and 10:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Enhanced expression was similarly elicited in BALB/c BMDM, suggesting that the enhanced response is independent of the background genetic inflammatory state of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Enhanced expression was observed regardless of the specific PDIM or ESX-1 mutation, including ESX-1 core complex mutant <italic>Tn::eccCa1</italic>, secreted effector mutants (<italic>esxB</italic> and <italic>Tn::espC</italic>), mutants in the synthetic pathway for distinct components of PDIM (<italic>mas</italic> and <italic>ppsD</italic>), and a PDIM transport mutant (<italic>Tn::drrC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Complementation of the disrupted ESX-1 or PDIM gene restored expression to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). PDIM and ESX-1 mutants are both known to be attenuated for growth in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Camacho et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stanley et al., 2003</xref>); we thus considered the possibility that any attenuated mutant would elicit enhanced expression of subcluster 1B genes. To test this possibility, we obtained a well-characterized Mtb mutant. The deleted gene, <italic>pckA</italic>, catalyzes the first step in gluconeogenesis, and the mutant is highly attenuated for growth in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marrero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Infection with the <italic>pckA</italic> mutant did not elicit enhanced expression of subcluster 1B genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), demonstrating that the enhanced response to PDIM or ESX-1 mutants is not a general response to mutants with impaired intracellular survival. These results suggest that PDIM and ESX-1 functions blunt induction of an inflammatory transcriptional program that includes multiple genes individually linked to control of tuberculosis (TB) infection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) or ESX-1 mutants elicits enhanced expression of an inflammatory transcriptional program.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FPKM from RNAseq data (MOI 2:1) for representative genes from subcluster 1B. *p-value &lt; 0.01 or #p-value &lt; 0.05 for the comparison of PDIM (16 hr) or ESX-1 (12 hr) mutant-infected with Rv-infected, unpaired two-tailed t-test.

MYD88 functions as a signaling adapter for TLRs; we next sought to identify the relevant upstream TLR.

To distinguish between surface-initiated signal and endosome-specific signal, we used the dynamin inhibitor dynasore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macia et al., 2006</xref>).

In aggregate, these data suggest that TLR2 plays a somewhat modest role in host control of TB infection.

To test this hypothesis, we compared infection outcomes in wild-type and <italic>Tlr2</italic>-/- mice. As previous profiling had demonstrated that CFU and pathology diverge by 6 weeks post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McBride et al., 2013</xref>), we selected this timepoint for study.

At the 6 week timepoint, as expected, PDIM-mutant Mtb growth was restricted relative to wild-type Mtb growth in C57BL/6J mice.

In contrast, PDIM-mutant Mtb had increased growth in the lungs of <italic>Tlr2</italic>-/- mice relative to C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting that PDIM-mediated interference with activation of components of the TLR2-dependent response contributes to the capacity of the bacterium to grow in lung. Histopathologically, the lungs of C57BL/6J mice infected with wild-type Mtb demonstrated defined areas of inflammation by 6 weeks post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), with dense inflammatory infiltrates composed of foamy and non-foamy macrophages and lymphocytes clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Multiple intracellular pathogens damage the phagosomal membrane in the course of pathogenesis, raising the question of whether this shared function reflects a convergent evolutionary strategy. While phagosomal membrane damage has been proposed to benefit the bacterium in the host-pathogen standoff, the mechanisms through which that benefit might accrue have not been well established experimentally. In the case of pathogens recognized by TLR2, our results raise the possibility that damaging the phagosomal membrane may serve as a common strategy to limit effective inflammation.</p><p>Previous work has suggested that TLR2 can signal from the plasma membrane or endosome. Investigation of the mechanisms and consequences of TLR2 signaling have primarily focused on pathogen-specific induction of type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbalat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dietrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Musilova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stack et al., 2014</xref>) and TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ip et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandt et al., 2013</xref>), largely in response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> exposure or viral infection. Our results support a model in which TLR2 activation in fact drives distinct compartment-specific pro-inflammatory transcriptional responses, reflected in both the sets of genes expressed and the kinetics of induction. Although a fundamental feature of TLR2 signaling, the two transcriptional response components are likely to have different relevance in the context of individual infections. In the case of TB, TNF, a component of the early response, is known to be critical for infection control. However, the later response component includes expression of multiple genes demonstrated to be important for both cell intrinsic control of Mtb and priming of the adaptive immune response. Our results demonstrating an interaction between TLR2 and PDIM or ESX-1 for infection outcome suggest that undermining this second component contributes to Mtb’s success as a pathogen. More broadly, our results suggest that expanding beyond TNF and type I IFNs as markers of TLR activation may offer both new insights into mechanisms and consequences of TLR signaling and into the links between TLR activation and control of pathogenic infection.</p><p>Our work suggests one potential mechanism through which PDIM and ESX-1 contribute to the pathogenicity of Mtb. PDIM has previously been shown to interfere with an effective MYD88 inflammatory response, as measured by the outcomes of macrophage recruitment to <italic>M. marinum</italic>-containing lesions in vivo and iNOS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cambier et al., 2014</xref>). In that work, this effect was hypothesized to be attributable to the unmasking of TLR agonists on the mycobacterial surface in the absence of PDIM, an abundant outer membrane lipid. Our results confirm an effect of PDIM on MYD88-dependent inflammation but point toward a different potential molecular interaction between PDIM and inflammation – namely that PDIM limits an endosomal component of the TLR2 response by limiting phagosome acidification. Two lines of evidence support the latter proposed mechanism. First, the effect we observe on TLR2-dependent inflammation is shared between PDIM and ESX-1. ESX-1-mediated secretion is not known to be required for localization of any known TLR2 agonist and in fact Mtb has multiple distinct TLR2 ligands; thus the common effect of PDIM and ESX-1 on TLR2-dependent inflammation is unlikely to be due to masking of TLR2 agonists. Second, PDIM and ESX-1 only minimally impact expression of the early TLR2-dependent gene cluster, suggesting that the inherent capacity of TLR2 to ‘recognize’ cognate ligand on the bacterium is similar between wild-type Mtb and ESX-1- or PDIM-mutant Mtb.</p><p>Together with previous work identifying Mtb factors that interfere with TLR2 activation, our work points toward an explanation for the puzzling disparity between the number of identified TLR2 ligands that Mtb possesses and the relatively modest phenotype of Mtb infection in TLR2 knockout mice. Work from other groups has identified mycobacterial strategies for interfering with TLR2 activation, primarily studied through an impact on TNF expression and release. The secreted hydrolase Hip1 has been shown to blunt the secretion of cytokines, including TNF, following infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Madan-Lala et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, the surface lipid sulfolipid-1 was shown to interfere with surface recognition of TLR2 agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanc et al., 2017</xref>). Our work suggests that the canonical Mtb virulence factors PDIM and ESX-1 function to blunt a distinct, endosome-specific component of the TLR2 response, and that this interference in fact modulates infection outcomes in macrophages and in mice. In aggregate, these results suggest that mycobacteria have evolved multiple strategies to undermine TLR2 activation from both the surface and endosome. Adding to the complexity of TLR2-dependent phenotypes in TB infection, studies of the relationship between Mtb TLR2 agonists and IFN-dependent functions have shown that TLR2 activation can dampen IFN-dependent gene expression and cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pecora et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banaiee et al., 2006</xref>). Ultimately developing new strategies for treating TB will rely on a deep understanding of the pathogenesis of infection that enables the rational selection of therapeutic targets. Host-directed therapies enhancing the host-protective components of TLR2 activation might offer a path to a more effective inflammatory response to Mtb and ultimately more effective sterilization of TB infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and culture</title><p>The indicated <italic>Mtb</italic> strains were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) with Middlebrook OADC (BD), 0.2% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween-80.

Formalin-fixed lungs were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin by the MGH histopathology core. Images were acquired on a TissueFAXS slide scanner (TissueGnostics).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in accordance with guidelines of the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Care and Use Committee, under the approved protocols 2014N000297 and 2014N000311.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Table of FPKM values for RNAseq data used to generate the heatmap for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-73984-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-73984-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>RNAseq data is accessible on the NCBI GEO website GSE144330.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barczak</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2020">2020</year><data-title>RNAseq data for murine BMDM infected with wild-type Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a PDIM mutant, or an ESX-1 mutant</data-title><source>NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE144330">GSE144330</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Drs Roi Avraham, Bryan Bryson, Sarah Fortune, and Jonathan Kagan for critical manuscript review and Dr Lenette Lu and the laboratories of Drs Marcia Goldberg and Cammie Lesser for helpful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ousman Tamgue (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed this was a very interesting study, but after much discussion decided that the manuscript requires further experiments that realistically would take more than 2 months to complete. In this case, it is <italic>eLife</italic> policy to reject the paper, encouraging the authors to resubmit a revised version that includes the experiments requested by the reviewers. The revised version in this case would be considered as a new submission. However, we understand that this is a very difficult time to address requests for experiments given the widespread laboratory shutdowns in response to COVID-19.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The article entitled &quot;<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> canonical virulence factors interfere with compartment-specific TLR-2 signaling&quot; by Hinman et al. provides insight into the TRL2 mediated two-component immune response acting through two clusters of genes at an early and late stage of infection in vitro. The authors focus on the late stage TLR2 signaling cascade, which they show is dependent on vesicle acidification. In general, the experiments were rigorously performed and well-presented.</p><p>A major concern is the variation in MOI that was used throughout the manuscript. The authors mention that &quot;the MOI used for each time point was selected to maximize signal while minimizing infection-associated cell death&quot;, but how do the authors correct for different MOIs across experiments? For example, in Figure-1, MOI 2 of infection was used for RNAseq whereas MOI 10 was used for qPCR analysis. The authors should mention the reason behind switching from a lower dose infection (MOI 2) to a higher dose infection (MOI 10). It would be interesting to see an MOI dependent expression pattern of Saa3, Lcn2, and Marco at 16h post-infection in figure 1. As another example, TNF expression was studied at different time points with MOI 10 in figure 2C which suggested that at 8hr post-infection, the expression of TNF reaches its peak. But then the authors reduced the MOI to 5 and time point to 6hr post-infection for the TNF expression analysis in Figure 3D.</p><p>For Figure 4, the authors could show a time-dependent pH measurement for each Mtb strain (eg. 12h, 24h, 48h) to more precisely coordinate the timing of acidification with the second wave of TLR signaling. It would be nice if the authors provide a representative 5 pixel expanded microscopy image as they mentioned in Material and Methods in the supplementary data for the phagosomal pH analysis of each Mtb strain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The ESX-1 type VII secretion system is critical for virulence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and has been proposed to function in part by perforation of phagosomal membrane. In a previous study, the corresponding author found that the complex lipid PDIM is linked to ESX-1 function. However, a clear mechanism for how perforation of the phagosome by ESX-1/PDIM facilitates pathogenesis is lacking. The current study by Hinman et al. centers around a detailed comparison of the transcriptional responses of macrophages to infection with wild-type, ESX-1 mutant, and PDIM mutant Mtb. Through transcriptional profiling they identify a set of genes that have increased expression levels in macrophages infected with the mutant strains. These genes are part of a module of genes that are expressed late after TLR2 stimulation. The authors propose that this late gene expression results from TLR2 signaling from the phagosomal/endosomal compartment, and that this endosomal/phagosomal signaling is enhanced by endosomal acidification. The authors propose that these genes have increased expression levels in infections with mutants lacking ESX because these mutants exist in a compartment with lower phagosomal pH, and suggest that blunting the expression of host response genes is a pathogenic strategy. The transcriptional profiling work is sound, the defined clusters TLR signaling are clear, and the manuscript itself is well written. However, it is unclear the observations reported in the study have any real significance for pathogenesis or the regulation of TLR2 signaling.</p><p>1. The idea that TLR2 might signal from the endosome/phagosome has been previously proposed. However, rigorous proof is lacking. This study does not clearly add weight to the idea that TLR2 signals from the endosome/phagosome as Dynasore data alone is not sufficient. Furthermore, even if TLR2 does signal from the endosome, this study does not demonstrate that compartment specific signaling of TLR2 has important functional consequences.</p><p>2. The findings do not advance our understanding of ESX-1 function or Mtb pathogenesis. Although some of the genes identified as being suppressed by ESX-1 have links to pathogenesis, it is not clear that the differences in expression observed in this study have any functional relevance for infection.</p><p>3. The authors claim that the perforation of the membrane results in the blunting of phagosomal TLR2 signaling, however all of the data is correlative. PDIM and ESX-1 mutants likely participate int he same pathway of membrane damage and do not represent independent confirmation. Further, ESX-1 mutants are already known to fail to arrest phagosome maturation and reside within an acidified compartment. The authors do not clearly establish that it is the physical perforation itself that results in the altered pH, as they propose. Furthermore, most attenuated mutants would be assumed to traffic to the lysosome, independent of membrane perforation. Thus one might predict that any attenuated mutant – or even heat killed bacteria – would result in enhanced expression of the same group of genes identified as highly expressed in this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this article, Hinman and al. describe a novel <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) evasion mechanism whereby the bacterium's virulence factors ESX-1 and PDIM undermine the host endosome-specific TLR2 activation through endosome membrane damage and limitation of phagosome acidification.

In new experiments, we additionally tested the impact of the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D, which has been used extensively to distinguish surface- from endosome-initiated innate immune signaling. This data is included as new Figure 5E. While a genetic approach could offer an additional window into the question, this approach is predicated upon identifying an adapter uniquely required for the response of interest. We tested all known adapters, but did not identify an adapter required for the late response to TLR2. This data testing known adapters is included as new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D. We have softened the language to indicate that the data is suggestive of/consistent with (rather than iron-clad proof of) compartment-specific signaling, and have changed the title of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, even if TLR2 does signal from the endosome, this study does not demonstrate that compartment specific signaling of TLR2 has important functional consequences.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding whether there is relevance for pathogenesis is important for the significance of our findings. To address this question, we studied the relevance of the TLR2/PDIM and TLR/ESX-1 interaction for two key outcomes of infection in macrophages- macrophage cell death and intracellular bacterial growth. We find that the relative attenuation of PDIM and ESX-1 mutants for both phenotypes is partially reversed in Tlr2-/- BMDM. This data is shown in new figures 7A-C, and is discussed in the new Results section “PDIM and ESX-1 modulate TLR2-dependent infection outcomes in macrophages”, lines 335-367. We additionally studied the relevance of the TLR2/PDIM interaction for bacterial growth and histopathology in mice and found that the relative attenuation of the PDIM mutant is partially reversed in Tlr2-/- mice.

These were the factors that drove our initial choice of C5BL/6J BMDM as a model. To experimentally address the question of whether BMDM from mice with a less inflammatory baseline state would respond similarly, we tested BALB/c BMDM for induction of the late TLR2-dependent response, and found that it was similarly induced and enhanced in response to PDIM and ESX-1 mutant-Mtb.
