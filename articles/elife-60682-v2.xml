completely understood as intermediate states remain poorly characterized by structural approaches. In a previous study on the prototypic bacterial proton-gated channel GLIC, we generated several fluorescent sensors of the protein conformation that report a fast transition to a pre-active state, which precedes the slower process of activation with pore opening. Here, we explored the phenotype of a series of allosteric mutations, using simultaneous steady-state fluorescence and electrophysiological measurements over a broad pH range. Our data, fitted to a three-state Monod-Wyman-Changeux model, show that mutations at the subunit interface in the extracellular domain (ECD) principally alter pre-activation, while mutations in the lower ECD and in the transmembrane domain principally alter activation. We also show that propofol alters both transitions. Data are discussed in the framework of transition pathways generated by normal mode analysis (iModFit). It further supports that pre-activation involves major quaternary compaction of the ECD, and suggests that activation involves principally a reorganization of a ‘central gating region’ involving a contraction of the ECD β-sandwich and the tilt of the channel lining M2 helix.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fluorescence quenching</kwd><kwd>pentameric ligand-gated ion channels</kwd><kwd>intermediate conformation</kwd><kwd>allosteric coupling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Xenopus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-BSV-0020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lefebvre</surname><given-names>Solène N</given-names></name><name><surname>Menny</surname><given-names>Anaïs</given-names></name><name><surname>Medjebeur</surname><given-names>Karima</given-names></name><name><surname>Corringer</surname><given-names>Pierre-Jean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taly</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant No. 788974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corringer</surname><given-names>Pierre-Jean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sorbonne University - Doctoral school ED3C</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lefebvre</surname><given-names>Solène N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship complement</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lefebvre</surname><given-names>Solène N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pentameric channel-receptor was studied by combining allosteric mutations, electrophysiology, fluorescent reporters and normal mode analysis, to dissect the long-range allosteric couplings specifically involved in its pre-activation and activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate fast synaptic communication in the brain. In mammals, this family includes the excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin receptors (nAChRs and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>Rs) as well as the inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and GlyRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaiteh et al., 2016</xref>). pLGICs are also present in bacteria, notably with the pH-gated channels GLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocquet et al., 2007</xref>) and sTeLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018</xref>), the GABA-gated channel ELIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmermann and Dutzler, 2011</xref>), and the calcium-modulated DeCLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>pLGICs physiological function is mediated by alternating between different allosteric conformations in response to neurotransmitter binding. Initially, a minimal four-state model could describe the main allosteric properties of the muscle-type nAChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heidmann and Changeux, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sakmann et al., 1980</xref>). In this model, the ability of ACh binding to activate the nAChR involves a resting- to active-state transition, and prolonged ACh occupancy promotes a biphasic desensitization process. Subsequently, kinetic analysis of the close-to-open transitions recorded by single-channel electrophysiology revealed multiple additional states that are required to account for the observed kinetic patterns. For activation, short-lived intermediate ‘pre-active’ states named ‘flipped’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lape et al., 2008</xref>) and ‘primed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mukhtasimova et al., 2009</xref>) were included in the kinetic schemes of the GlyRs and nAChRs, while rate-equilibrium free-energy relationship analysis of numerous mutants of the nAChR suggested passage through four brief intermediate states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, analysis of single-channel shut intervals during desensitization is described by the sum of four or five exponential components, suggesting again additional intermediate states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elenes and Auerbach, 2002</xref>). Kinetics data thus show that pLGICs go through complex structural reorganizations during both activation and desensitization. These events are at the heart of the protein’s function, allowing coupling between the neurotransmitter site and the ion channel gate which are separated by a distance of more than 50 Å.</p><p>The past decade has seen great structural biology efforts to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nemecz et al., 2016</xref>). At least one structure of each major member of prokaryotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hilf and Dutzler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2020</xref>) and eukaryotic pLGICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Althoff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gharpure et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masiulis et al., 2019</xref>) have been resolved by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). They highlight a highly conserved 3D architecture within the family. Each subunit contains a large extracellular domain (ECD) folded in a β-sandwich and a transmembrane domain (TMD) containing four α-helices, with the second M2-helix lining the pore. However, the physiological relevance of these structures or their assignment to particular intermediates or end-states in putative gating pathways remains ambiguous and poorly studied. Conversely, it is possible that intermediate conformations, unfavored by crystal packing lattice or under-represented in receptor populations on cryoEM grids, are missing in the current structural galleries.</p><p>Understanding the allosteric transitions underlying gating thus requires complementary techniques, where the protein conformation can be followed in near-physiological conditions, that is at non-cryogenic temperature on freely moving protein, and over a broad range of ligand concentrations. To this aim, we previously developed the tryptophan/tyrosine induced quenching technique (TrIQ) on GLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menny et al., 2017</xref>), a proton-gated channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parikh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bocquet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonzalez-Gutierrez et al., 2017</xref>). In this technique, the protein is labeled with a small fluorophore(bimane, and collisional quenching by a neighboring indole (tryptophan) or phenol (tyrosine) moiety is used to report on changes in distance between two residues within the protein over a short distance range of 5–15 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mansoor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mansoor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones Brunette and Farrens, 2014</xref>). Bimane-quencher pairs on GLIC combined with kinetic analysis allowed us to characterize pre-activation motions occurring early in the conformational pathway of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that they occur at lower proton concentrations than pore opening, and are complete in less than a millisecond, much faster than the rise time of the active population that occurs in the 30–150 ms range in electrophysiology recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laha et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Electrophysiological and fluorescence characterization of the quenching pairs of GLIC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme for GLIC activation, showing first a pre-activation step involving full compaction of the ECD and motion of the M2-M3 loop as monitored by fluorescence, followed by a pore opening step.

Conclusion on Bim135-W72: We unambiguously identify here Trp72 as the endogenous quenching residue of Bim135 since the mutant Bim135-W72F is functional in electrophysiology, but does not undergo pH-dependent quenching. The pH-dependent changes in fluorescence show a bell-shaped curve suggesting complex changes in distances at this level. When combined with Bim135-W72, L157A shows a decrease in pH<sub>50</sub> of the first quenching component, and a diminished amplitude of the second unquenching component. Combined with Bim135-W72, H235F, and H235Q display a phenotype with a notably much smaller amplitude of the first component. On Bim135-W72, propofol causes a decrease in pH<sub>50</sub> for the first quenching component. On Bim135-W72-H235Q, propofol restores a WT-like pH-dependent quenching curve. The observed global lower amplitude of the Bim135-W72 H235Q/F quenching curves may either result from a decrease in the extent of the reorganization responsible for the amplitude of the first component, or a rightward shift of the curve resulting in an overlap which would result in an averaging of the bimane quenching and unquenching curves. Therefore, the fluorescence data related to the Bim135-W72 pair cannot be interpreted in simple terms, although they further document the strong allosteric coupling between mutations and propofol binding and the upper part of the ECD.

We performed electrophysiological and fluorescence quenching experiments on a series of allosteric mutants of GLIC, as well as in the presence of the general anesthetic propofol. We modeled the whole data set with a three-state allosteric model comprising a resting state, a pre-active state, and an active state. To help the interpretation of the fluorescence quenching data into structural terms, we built atomistic models of the various bimane-labeled proteins, and computed their gating transition pathways using iMODfit. Our results indicate that mutations alter the function via distinct mechanisms and differentially displace the allosteric equilibria involved in fluorescence quenching and electrophysiology recordings. This supports that pre-activation involves a major quaternary compaction of the ECD, and suggests that activation involves principally a reorganization of a ‘central gating region’ involving a contraction of the ECD β-sandwich and the tilt of the channel lining M2 helix.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fluorescence and electrophysiological measurements</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Quenching pairs used in the study</title><p>In our previous fluorescence quenching experiments, a bimane fluorophore was introduced on GLIC by covalent labeling on an engineered cysteine, after mutation of the single endogenous cysteine C27S. A Trp or Tyr quenching residue was incorporated when necessary to generate a quenching pair. We created five quenching pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>): three are located across the ECD interface and report on a quaternary compaction following pH drop (Bim136-Q101W, Bim133-L103W, and Bim33-W160), one reports on a tertiary reorganization at the top of the ECD (Bim135-W72), and one reports on the outward movement of the M2-M3 loop at the ECD-TMD interface (Bim250-Y197). In the present study, we used the Bim136-Q101W as sensor of the ECD compaction, along with Bim250-Y197 as a sensor of the M2-M3 loop motion. We also investigated in detail Bim135-W72, but the complex results for this pair precluded clear conclusions. The related data are thus presented and discussed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>To accurately compare mutants, we first measured detailed pH-dependent fluorescence and electrophysiological curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Fluorescence was measured in steady-state conditions on detergent (DDM)-purified protein, and normalized to the fluorescence intensity under denaturing conditions (1% SDS), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menny et al., 2017</xref>). GLIC allosteric transitions are particularly robust in different lipid/detergent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carswell et al., 2015</xref>) and DDM-purified protein yielded similar results to that of azolectin-reconstituted protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Menny et al., 2017</xref>), while allowing better reproducibility. For both sensors, we confirmed that the pH-dependent fluorescence changes are essentially abolished when mutating the quenching partner to phenylalanine, which does not quench bimane fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mansoor et al., 2002</xref>). We also confirmed that pH-dependent quenching curves for Bim136-Q101W and Bim250-Y197 display higher sensitivity (especially for Bim250-Y197) and lower apparent cooperativity than the pH-dependent activation curves recorded by electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>The quaternary compaction at the ECD top is strongly allosterically coupled with the lower part of the ECD interface</title><p>Using the Bim136-Q101W conformational sensor, we first investigated allosteric mutants located at the inter-subunit interface in the lower part of the ECD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Interestingly, the Bim136-Q101W-E26Q fluorescence quenching curve has a remarkable feature as compared to most mutants investigated thereafter: in the pH 7–8 range, where the pH-dependent fluorescence quenching is not yet observed, the fluorescence (F/F<sub>SDS</sub>) is significantly lower (F<sub>0</sub>=0.53) as compared to the Bim136-Q101W alone (F<sub>0</sub>=0.71). This suggests that substantial quenching is present at neutral pH and that E26Q not only alters the allosteric transition, but also modifies the conformation of the resting state itself which appears to be more compact when the E26Q mutation is present.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Allosteric coupling within the ECD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of two monomers of GLIC pH 4 (4HFI) showing positions of the fluorescence sensor (Bim136-Q101W) and the two mutated residues at the bottom of the ECD resulting in a partial loss of function.

Its Bim136-Q101W pH-dependent curve shows a nearly full quenching amplitude together with a decrease in pH<sub>50</sub>, while it impairs the motion of the M2-M3 loop, with only a partial pH-dependent de-quenching at Bim250-Y197.</p><p>Thus, while those mutants do not have a measurable access to the active state, they still show allosteric motions as revealed by fluorescence.

Propofol binds to at least three main sites within the TMD: one site in the pore itself near the middle of the TMD, and two sites in the upper part of the TMD at intra- or inter-subunit locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Propofol is an inhibitor of GLIC, but it has been shown to be a potentiator of the H235Q mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourati et al., 2018</xref>). We verified that these effects are conserved in the Bim136-Q101W background, with propofol decreasing the pH<sub>50</sub> of activation of Bim136-Q101W while increasing the pH<sub>50</sub> of Bim136-Q101W-H235Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Overall, reasonable fits can be achieved in most cases. Variations in isomerization constants between mutant and parent sensors were calculated as multiplication factors for pre-activation and activation (L<sub>mutant</sub>/L<sub>sensor</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). In parallel, we performed the whole set of fits with different starting values of the H235F L<sub>pA</sub> constants (1000 and 100,000), yielding different sets of isomerization constants but in each case similar effects of the mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6s2sdata1">Figure 6—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>, all values presented below were taken from the L<sub>pA</sub>=100 fit unless indicated otherwise). A discrepancy between data points and fits is however consistently observed concerning the apparent cooperativity of most pH-dependent fluorescence curves. The pH-dependent decreases in fluorescence observed experimentally arise over a relatively large range of pHs, while theoretical curves display sharper shapes. It is possible that the pre-activation transition, modeled here by a single allosteric step, might actually involve multiple steps that are not implemented here. Despite this limitation, the model allows us to highlight clear-cut effects.</p><p>Experimentally, the most phenotypically striking mutant is Y28F, which produces a 2 orders of magnitude shift of the pH-dependent curves, and a near equalization of fluorescence and electrophysiological pH<sub>50</sub>s. Y28F is readily fitted by the simple assumption that the R-pA equilibrium is strongly displaced toward the R state, that is, the R state is thermodynamically stabilized over both the pA and A states, with no changes in the pA to A equilibrium. In this condition, the fluorescent changes are entirely caused by the apparition of the active state, and the fraction of receptors in the pA state, in these equilibrium conditions, remains below 0.1% at every pH. This does not mean that this mutant does not populate the pA state during activation, since the pA state may be kinetically favored and actually appear in a transient manner. Mutant E26Q has a milder phenotype, but the fitting also suggests it has a stronger effect on pre-activation than on activation (multiplication factors of isomerization constants of 15 for pre-activation and 10 for activation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, mutants in the lower ECD (D32E), or in the TMD (H235Q and E222Q), are found to preferentially alter the activation transition, destabilizing the A state over the pA state, with small effects on pre-activation (multiplication factor of isomerization constants for pre-activation: 2, 1.5, and 7 and for activation: 80, 40, and 700, respectively). In consequence, they show a large displacement of the activation curve than that of the fluorescence curve when compared to the parent sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). On the Bim136-Q101W sensor and H235Q mutant, propofol acts respectively as a negative and positive allosteric modulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourati et al., 2018</xref>). For both constructs, propofol is found to have a dual effect, altering principally the activation transition but also the pre-activation transition.</p><p>Finally, for total loss of function mutants, while H235F fluorescence quenching could be fitted reasonably well with a two-state R-pA model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6s2sdata1">Figure 6—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>) the best fits of L157A and L246A were of lower quality. In particular, pH-dependent curves of Bim136-Q101W-L157A and Bim136-Q101W-L246A are rather flat, the former being better represented by a straight line. The tentative fits are thus not satisfactory, suggesting that these mutants display complex phenotypes, plausibly driving the conformations into states that are not implemented in our model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Investigation of quenching pairs reorganizations using iMODfit and bimane docking</title><p>In our previous study, the various quenching pairs were designed on the basis of the comparison of the X-ray structures of GLIC solved at pH 7 and pH 4, selecting pairs of residues that undergo large changes in backbone C<sub>α</sub> distances.

In addition, the comparison of crystallographic structures alone does not inform us on the time course of the quenching process during the movement. For instance, at Bim136-Q101W and Bim250-Y197, relatively large changes in C<sub>α</sub> distance (2–5 Å) are observed between GLIC-pH 7 and GLIC-pH 4, but one can ask how the distances (and quenching) evolve during these movements.</p><p>To investigate these issues, we computed approximate trajectories between the two states using iMODfit, and then modeled on them the bimane/quencher pair using a simple docking approach. iMODfit has been originally designed to fit structures inside electron-microscopy envelopes, notably from a very different starting conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopéz-Blanco and Chacón, 2013</xref>). This flexible fitting is made via the deformation of the structure using normal mode analysis (NMA) (see Materials and methods section). NMA approximates the surface of the conformational landscape and decomposes the movements into discrete modes. It takes advantage of a simplified but physically meaningful representation of the interaction between the atoms, based on simple springs connecting close pairs of atoms in the native structure. This method provides a time-independent equation and allows the study of slow (biologically relevant) and collective conformational transitions. NMA has been shown previously to allow the study of pLGIC gating mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Taly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahar et al., 2010</xref>).

The pore reorganization happens in the second half of the trajectory and leads to the opening of its upper part which contains the activation gate, as measured at Ile233 C<sub>α</sub> (also named I9’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). This motion is associated with a central gating reorganization of the GLIC structure involving: 1/ a tilt of M2 toward M3 (as measured by a decrease in distance between His235 nitrogen and the carbonyl backbone of Ile259; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and C</xref>), 2/ an outward motion of the M2-M3 loop (measured as an increase in distance between Pro250 Cα and the phenolic oxygen of Tyr197; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and D</xref>), and 3/ a contraction of the β-sandwich at the bottom of the ECD (measured as a decrease in distance between C<sub>α</sub> of residues Asp32 and Gly159; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In addition to these two consecutive global motions, the progressive quaternary compaction of the ECD, another crucial landmark of GLIC reorganization, occurs throughout the trajectory. This compaction is quantified through measurement of inter-subunit distances at the top ECD (between C<sub>β</sub> Asp136/Gln101 and Arg133/Leu103; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A, B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the bottom ECD (measured by a decrease in the inter-subunit distance of C<sub>β</sub> Lys33/Trp160, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating a progressive decrease in the distance throughout the frames. It is noteworthy that these inter-subunit distances are highly variable, due to the asymmetric nature of the ECDs of the GLIC-pH 7 structure, where each subunit β-sandwich presents a unique orientation as well as relatively high B-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>). This variability decreases over the frames to reach the structure of GLIC-pH 4 which is compact and essentially symmetric.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Key TMD motions in trajectories A and B.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Snapshots of GLIC TMD top view in the first and last frame of the trajectory A with a Bim250-Y197 quenching pair modeled at one interface.

The central gating reorganization starts first and is associated with an increase in pore radius at Ile233, followed by the twist motion in the second half of the trajectory, the latter being associated with further fluctuations of the pore radius. The ECD compaction is also spread over the whole trajectory. In conclusion, using iMODfit we could generate two distinct trajectories that are in principle equally plausible to describe a gating transition of GLIC activation or deactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Visualization of quenching pairs on iMODfit trajectories</title><p>To relate the conformational reorganizations of GLIC to our fluorescence quenching data, we modeled the fluorophore/quenching pairs in both trajectories. To this aim, the cysteine and quencher mutations were modeled and the bimane moiety was docked into each frame while keeping it at a covalent-bond compatible distance to the sulfur atom of the cysteine. The distance between bimane centers of mass and their quenching indole/phenol moieties was then measured in each frame to follow its evolution throughout the trajectories.</p><p>For Bim136-Q101W, the procedure shows that Bim136 and the Trp101 indole ring are separated in the resting-like state (first frame of both trajectories), and are in close contact in the active-like state (last frames of both trajectories) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). These observations are in good agreement with fluorescence data that show a decrease in fluorescence intensity upon pH drop reporting a decreased distance within the pair. The trajectory A shows a progressive decrease in distance that parallels the ECD quaternary compaction movement (C<sub>β</sub> Asp136/Gln101). The trajectory B shows a different pattern, characterized by important fluctuations followed by a sharper distance decrease only in the last frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>).</p><p>For the ECD-TMD interface quenching pair Bim250-Y197, the procedure shows that Bim250 is in close contact with the Tyr197 phenol ring in the resting-like state, while both moieties are separated in the active-like state, the bimane moiety moving on the other side of loop 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). This is also in agreement with the fluorescence data that showed an increase in fluorescence upon pH-drop indicating that the Bim250 is moving away from its quencher Tyr197. Interestingly, both trajectories A and B show an abrupt change in Bim250-Y197 distances, corresponding respectively to a late versus early separation, and these changes occur during the outward motion of the M2-M3 loop (P250<sub>Cα</sub>/Y197<sub>O</sub> distance; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, visualizing the quenching pairs using a simple docking procedure shows good agreement with fluorescence.

Our data clearly support that Bim136-Q101W and Bim250-Y197 sensors are <italic>bona fide</italic> reporters of the ECD compaction and the outward M2-M3 motion, respectively. In contrast, data related to the Bim135-W72 sensor (presented and discussed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3</xref>) show complex patterns of quenching in both in silico and fluorescence experiments. We infer that, because of the buried location of Bim135 within the protein, it is sensitive to subtle structural reorganizations, the complexity of which precludes clear conclusions. This emphasizes that the fluorescence quenching approach requires screening of multiple positions to select the ones reporting on well-defined local motions.</p><p>Using these appropriate sensors, we found that a series of five loss-of-function mutations, which shift the pH-dependent electrophysiological curves to higher concentrations, also shift the pH-dependent fluorescence quenching curve of ECD-compaction at the extracellular top of the protein. The ECD-compaction is thus sensitive to mutations scattered along the protein structure down to the opposite cytoplasmic end, indicating substantial allosteric coupling. Since the conformational motions followed by fluorescence occur early in the pathway of activation, it is expected that a shift in the fluorescence curve will be reflected by a parallel shift in the electrophysiological curve. Mutations in the ECD E26Q and Y28F/C27S both present such a phenotype with similar ∆pH<sub>50</sub> in electrophysiology and fluorescence, suggesting that those mutations would mainly impact the pre-activation transition. In contrast, D32E, E222Q, and H235Q lead to a stronger pH<sub>50</sub> shift in electrophysiology than in fluorescence suggesting that these mutations would alter not only the pre-activation, but also the downstream pore-opening transitions leading to an additive effect on the pH<sub>50</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Discriminating pre-activation versus activation phenotypes through allosteric modeling</title><p>To interpret the mutant phenotypes in a more quantitative manner, we fitted the whole series of data using a three-state two-site model. We had to implement two proton binding sites to account for the separation of the fluorescence and electrophysiological curves of most constructs. This idea is supported by a mutational analysis that showed that several proton activation sites, located at multiple loci, contribute to activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nemecz et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, chimeric receptors made up of the GLIC<sub>ECD</sub> fused to the TMDs of various pLGICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duret et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laverty et al., 2017</xref>) or of the ELIC<sub>ECD</sub> fused to the GLIC<sub>TMD</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmandt et al., 2015</xref>) all preserve a proton-gated ion channel function, with the GLIC<sub>ECD</sub>-GABAρ<sub>TMD</sub> chimera showing a markedly biphasic pH-dependent activation curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that the proton activation sites, whose loci are not known, are scattered throughout the GLIC structure, in both the ECD and the TMD. In our model, we arbitrarily tuned the affinity constants of site 1 to drive the pre-activation transition, and of site 2 to drive the activation transition, to minimize the number of parameters involved.</p><p>We also postulated that the various mutants only alter the isomerization constants between states. However, the data set does not allow for the discrimination between effect on binding affinity versus isomerization constants. The effects of mutations on the isomerization constants are thus used here to evaluate the global effect of the mutations on pre-activation versus activation, but it is possible that they actually report on alteration of isomerization constants, affinity constants, or both. Among the various mutations investigated here, E26Q, E222Q, and H235F/Q neutralize the charge of titratable amino acids. It is thus possible that in these cases the mutation eliminates a proton binding site. However, a local impact of a mutation on a proton binding site, or on a set of inter-residues interactions altering the allosteric equilibria, will be equally valid in assigning local structural alterations to pre-active/active phenotypes.</p><p>The pattern of effect on L<sub>pA</sub> versus L<sub>A</sub> among the various mutants allows us to dissect their allosteric impact. As anticipated from measured ∆pH<sub>50</sub>, the fits illustrate that Y28F and E26Q principally alter the pre-activation transition and that Bim250, D32E, H235Q, and E222Q principally alter the activation transition, while propofol alters similarly both processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Concerning the total loss of function mutants, we found that they do preserve pre-activation-like allosteric motions, although with an impaired sensitivity and amplitude of the fluorescence curves. H235F is acceptably fitted according to an R-pA model, suggesting that this mutant isomerizes to a pre-active-like state but cannot isomerize further to the active state. L257A and L246A show a more complex phenotype, but fluorescence data show at least partial pre-active-like motions.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Effect of mutations on pre-activation and activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) One subunit of GLIC showing the positions of tested mutations in red spheres, with in gray the region involved in the central gating pathway identified by iModFit.

Our combined electrophysiological and fluorescence study untangles evaluating the contribution of these specific motions to the pre-activation versus activation transitions.</p><p>The ECD quenching pairs at Bim136, Bim133, and Bim33 already showed that pre-activation involves a major quaternary compaction of the whole ECD. We strengthen this idea further by showing that E26Q and Y28F/C27S, that are also located at the subunit interface in the lower part of the ECD, strongly impair the pre-activation process with weaker effects on activation. In addition, the quenching pair at Bim250 showed that the pre-activation involved a key outward movement of the M2-M3 loop. Our data indicate that pre-activation also includes motions of the TMD, since mutation H235Q, as well as propofol binding, are shown to significantly alter pre-activation.</p><p>For the activation, our mutational analysis points to a key role of the lower inner part of the ECD β-sandwich (D32E), the M2-M3 loop (Bim250), and the TMD (H235F/Q and E222Q). Interestingly, D32E is involved in strong interactions between sheets in the lower part of the β-sandwich through a salt bridge with R192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Mutation, D32E, elongating the side chain by one carbon atom is thus predicted to disfavor the β-sandwich compaction. In addition, at the middle of the TMD, H235 from M2 interacts with the main-chain carbonyl of I259 from M3 through an H-bond favoring the interaction between both helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prevost et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rienzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Its mutation into Q and F is predicted to weaken or abolish this interaction and disfavor the tilt of M2 toward M3. This assumption is consistent with the X-ray structure of the H235F and H235Q mutants which shows a ‘locally closed conformation’ where M2 and M3 are separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prevost et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourati et al., 2018</xref>). Our data thus provide evidence that the compaction of the β-sandwich and the tilt of M2 are principally involved in the activation process.</p><p>The mutational analysis also shows for most mutations mixed effects on the isomerization constants of activation and pre-activation, suggesting that both processes involve overlapping regions. The Bim250 position is noteworthy in this respect, since the bimane, reporting an outward motion of the M2-M3 loop, monitors pre-activation, while the modification itself (P250C mutation plus reaction with bimane) principally alters the activation process. It is thus plausible that the M2-M3 loop could move in two successive steps, a first one during pre-activation conditioning dequenching and a second one during activation. In either case, our data further highlight a central role for this loop in ECD-TMD coupling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Speculative interpretation of the mutant phenotypes in the context of computational trajectories</title><p>The transition pathway of GLIC has been previously studied by atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations in an explicit membrane environment. While the timescale of the transition greatly exceeds that of even the longest possible simulations, two studies addressed this issue. The first one started from the GLIC-pH 4 structure and instantly set it to neutral pH, followed by a 1 μs simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nury et al., 2010</xref>), yielding concomitant closing of the pore and twist of the whole structure. The second one is based on the string method, using the ‘swarms of trajectories’ approach, computing a trajectory between GLIC-pH 7 and GLIC-pH 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lev et al., 2017</xref>). The trajectory shows a sequence of events starting from the closed to the open conformation. A first major reorganization involves the opening of the pore, its hydration, and the compaction of the lower part of the ECD β-sandwich. This is followed by a major reorganization of the ECD, notably its twist and its quaternary compaction. This sequence of events appears hardly compatible with our quenching data, although a comprehensive integration of both sets of data would require extensive in silico investigations of the bimane-labeled mutants to analyze the reorganizations of the quenching pairs. Of note, an important limitation of the method is that it implicitly postulates the occurrence of a single trajectory. However, a coarse-grained simulation (hybrid elastic-network Brownian dynamics) predicted two possible pathways for GLIC gating, that are characterized by different compactions of the ECD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orellana et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we performed iMODfit/bimane docking calculations and generated two distinct trajectories with an inverted sequence of events. While these trajectories are coarse and do not implement fine atomistic interactions, they allow the visualization of plausible collective motions in relation to the reorganization of the quenching pairs.</p><p>Remarkably, both trajectories show complex quaternary asymmetric reorganizations of ECD compaction. As stated above, ECD compaction is critically involved in pre-activation, a feature consistent with recent work by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tiwari et al., 2020</xref>) showing a proton-induced inward tilting motion of the ECDs, and recent cryoEM work showing marked structural flexibility of the ECD in the closed-channel state at pH 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rovsnik et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, fluorescence curves of pre-activation, especially the one of Bim136-Q101W, are endowed with markedly low cooperativities. We thus speculate that this low cooperativity might arise from the contribution of multiple asymmetric intermediate states to the transition, in a manner reminiscent of the asymmetric motions recently described for the desensitization of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gielen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition, both trajectories show a ‘central gating motion’ involving several key concerted reorganizations: a compaction of the lower part of the β-sandwich, an outward movement of the M2-M3 loop, as well as a tilt of the M2 helix toward M3, that involves a marked increase in the opening of the pore. Similar structural couplings are also observed in string simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lev et al., 2017</xref>). This observation nicely parallels our finding that these motions are principally involved in activation. We can thus speculate that the central gating motion constitutes the heart of the activation transition.</p><p>Concerning the order in which reorganizations are observed, trajectory A is a better fit to the fluorescence data. It suggests a scenario involving, during pre-activation, progressive ECD compaction and beginning of the M2-M3 loop motion, generating the fluorescence variations. Then the M2-M3 loop completes its movement in concert with β-sandwich compaction and pore opening. Future computational studies are needed to explore this possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Consequences on the gating mechanism within the pLGIC family</title><p>The conservation of the general gating mechanism between bacterial and eukaryotic pLGICs is well documented by the available structures with the common allosteric regulatory sites for ligands and mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sauguet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertozzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rienzo et al., 2016</xref>), together with the allosteric compatibility between eukaryotic and prokaryotic ECD/TMD domains to form functional chimeras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duret et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moraga-Cid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laverty et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the pre-activation transition of GLIC that we characterize here might have counterparts in human neurotransmitter-gated receptors. In this line, some recent structures of eukaryotic receptors including the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polovinkin et al., 2018</xref>), the GABA<sub>A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masiulis et al., 2019</xref>) and the GlyR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2021</xref>) show pre-active-like conformations characterized by marked agonist-elicited reorganization of the ECD but a closed channel at the TMD. Additionally, the flipped or primed states, where the conformational change of the orthosteric site is predicted to be complete, but where the channel is closed, would fit the functional requirement of a pre-active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lape et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Plested, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our work also investigates the mechanism of action of allosteric mutations by measuring their effects at different levels of the protein, dissecting their phenotype along the gating pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galzi et al., 1996</xref>). Allosteric mutations of neurotransmitter-gated receptors, causing congenital pathologies including myasthenia and hyperekplexia have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Taly and Changeux, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bode and Lynch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hernandez and Macdonald, 2019</xref>). Most of the hot spots mutated here on GLIC were found associated with pathologies on human receptors. In particular, the lower part of the ECD-ECD interface is the site of a de novo S76R mutation in GABA<sub>A</sub> α1 (homologous to Glu26) causing epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johannesen, 2016</xref>) and the mutation L42P in the nAChR δ (homologous to Cys27) causing myasthenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shen et al., 2008</xref>). This latter mutation (as well as mutation of N41, homologous to E26) decreases activation kinetics and this residue was shown to be energetically coupled to Y127 on the other side of the interface. Interestingly, equivalent residues in GLIC (C27, E26, and Y111) are part of a water network at the bottom of the ECD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Another noteworthy example is the mutation P250T in GlyR α1 that causes hyperekplexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saul et al., 1999</xref>) and which is homologous to E222 in GLIC. Interestingly, on the glycine receptor α1, other mutations have been studied by single-channel recordings and are described to affect principally a flip pre-activation-like step for A52S in the loop 2 at the ECD-ECD interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Plested et al., 2007</xref>) or gating for K276E on the M2-M3 loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lape et al., 2012</xref>). These data suggest that mutations produce similar allosteric perturbations on GLIC and GlyR in those regions.</p><p>Our work on GLIC provides general mechanisms of how mutations affect pLGICs transitions and further documents conformational changes, beyond information provided by structures.

Cells were collected and resuspended in buffer A containing 20 mM Tris; 300 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 and subsequently disrupted by sonication. After membrane separation by ultracentrifugation, membrane proteins were extracted overnight in buffer A supplemented with 2% DDM. After ultracentrifugation, supernatant was incubated with amylose resin and MBP-GLIC was eluted using buffer A supplemented with DDM 0.02% and a saturating concentration of maltose. To remove the endogenous maltoporin contaminant, a first size exclusion chromatography was performed on superose 6 10/300 GL in buffer A with 0.02% DDM. GLIC-MBP concentration was measured and the protein was incubated overnight at 4°C with thrombin to cleave off MBP and with monobromobimane (mBBr) at a 1:5 (GLIC monomer:fluorophore) ratio, to label the protein. The mBBr dye being solubilized in DMSO, the sample volume was adjusted to remain below 1% DMSO final concentration.

Rabbit anti-HA-tag primary antibody was incubated for 90 min in 2% horse serum and the secondary antibody anti-rabbit coupled to Alexa Fluor 645 was incubated for 30 min. After a second PFA fixation overnight, oocytes were included in warm 3% low-melting agarose and 40 µm slices were made using a vibratome on a portion of the oocyte.

Two trajectories were generated here. In trajectory A structure, 4NPQ (GLIC-pH 7) is fitted to the density of 4HFI (GLIC-pH 4), and in trajectory B structure, 4HFI is fitted to the density of 4NPQ.</p><p>The detailed procedure is performed as follows, taking as an example trajectory A: 1/ A computed EM density map was generated for the X-ray structure of the target 4NPQ using the pdb2vol tool (called 4NPQ map). The EM density map resolution was set to 5 Å and the grid size to 0.5 Å, that is, the resolution was set at a relatively large value to avoid being locked in local minima during the iMODfit procedure.</p><p>2 / 4HFI was represented with the detailed all heavy-atoms force field (all atoms are considered except hydrogens), called the 4HFI model.</p><p>3/ The lowest-frequency NMA-modes of the 4HFI model were computed. For the subsequent steps, the range of modes considered (−n option) was set to 0.5, that is, half of the modes, corresponding to the lower frequency modes, are considered for computing the conformational changes.</p><p>4/ During the iMODfit procedure, starting from the 4HFI model, 10% of the modes are randomly selected and used to generate a very small conformational change. The new conformation is used to compute a simulated density map, and the new conformation is accepted only if the cross-correlation between the targeted 4NPQ and simulated maps improves. This process is repeated iteratively until the conformation deviates by an RMSD of 0.5 Å from the starting/previous model, in which case an intermediate structure is generated and stored. The entire process is then repeated iteratively to generate a series of intermediate states that progressively converge to the targeted structure.</p><p>The geometry of the ion channel has been computed with MOLEonline webserver (mole.upol.cz), with the ‘pore’ mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sehnal et al., 2013</xref>).

This step also allowed the introduction of point mutations. The structure of the protein and bimane was converted to pdbqt files with the software open babel 2.4.1. Covalent docking was then performed with the software smina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koes et al., 2013</xref>). The box for docking has been defined around the mutated cysteine residue, with a size of 30 Å in each direction. Covalent docking forced the bimane to be in appropriate distance with the sulfur atom of the introduced cysteine. Only the first pose was kept for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>MWC model building</title><p>To build a three-state MWC model, the following equations were used to obtain the

In a previous study (<italic>eLife</italic> 2017), this group used time-resolved fluorescence quenching experiments in a prokaryotic pLGIC, GLIC, and identified motions in the extracellular domain (ECD) that occur prior to channel opening. In this manuscript, the authors extend these studies. To interpret their previous fluorescence quenching data in structural terms, the authors used normal mode analysis to identify structural trajectories underlying GLIC closed to open channel gating transitions. The simulations yielded two pathways leading from closed to open channel end states. To monitor whether motions in the ECD are coupled to motions in the TMD (pore opening), the authors used mutations and the allosteric drug modulator propofol to perturb GLIC gating transitions and compared the effects of these perturbations on proton-induced current responses and steady-state fluorescence quenching data. Based on their data, the authors conclude that they have identified new structural conformations and possible new allosteric pathways during gating, and that GLIC and its mutants have access to a large repertoire of conformational states.</p><p>While the data are interesting, the overall concern is with interpretation of the data. The logic of the arguments is not clear enough to support the conclusions. Comparisons between theories are not precise nor quantitative enough to support claim of a new gating model. Simulation description and limitations of this approach are not well described. As written, it is difficult to follow the authors line of reasoning and authors do not discuss alternative mechanisms that can fit their data. Significant re-writing and new analyses to make the arguments clear and focused on what novel contributions the data in this paper are providing are needed. The manuscript would be significantly strengthened by addressing the following major concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A 1-D, steady state signal (quenching) is used to discern multiple states (meaning, functional conformations, division in space) because it takes multiple values. But the signal is the infinite time average over all states, in different conditions. How do we know that the signal doesn't represent different balances of occupancies of the same small number of states (such as 2 states). There are no apparent reasons why results could not be explained from mutants that change open-closed equilibrium as from new conformational states. The authors need to fully discuss and address this alternative mechanism for explaining the data.</p><p>2) What experiments provide direct evidence for intermediates? Can the intermediates states represent abstract transitional milestones, not concrete conformations? That interpretation would be consistent with what has been long established in protein folding, but would entail a major shift in how structures are interpreted, because there would not be a meaningful way to connect conformations to kinetic models.</p><p>3) Description of the iMOD fit simulations is unclear and does not provide enough detail. How many simulations were run to yield the two trajectories? It is not clear whether iMod-Fit returns two trajectories from a single calculation or whether multiple simulations were run and the trajectories were clustered. In the methods section (page 25, lines 25-26), trajectory A conformation change is from closed to open whereas trajectory B conformation change is from open to closed. However, in the figures, for both trajectories, frame 1starts at GLIC-pH7 (closed).</p><p>4) Since their previous time-resolved fluorescence quenching data (<italic>eLife</italic> 2017) demonstrated that motions monitored at Bimane-136 (ECD β sandwich compaction) and Bim-250 (M2-M3 loop motion) mainly occur prior to channel opening (activation scheme in Figure 4B), it is unclear why the authors conclude that their Bim-250 data support pathway A identified from their simulations. In pathway A, Bim-250-Y197 unquenching happens in same time frame as the increase in pore radius at the 9' position, whereas in pathway B the unquenching of Bim250-Y97 happens before complete pore radius dilation (Figure 2B, 2D). The experimental data at this position seems compatible with the B trajectory. Moreover, the unquenching of Bim-136-W101 appears consistent with either trajectory (Figure 3B) and occurs before the simulated pore dilation. It is unclear what new information the simulations are providing except that the steady-state fluorescence quenching data show good agreement with the simulated end states.</p><p>5) To monitor how motions in the ECD are coupled to motions in the TMD (pore opening), the authors used mutations and the allosteric drug modulator propofol to perturb GLIC gating transitions and compared the effects of these perturbations on proton-induced current responses and steady-state fluorescence quenching data. Since the fluorescence data are steady-state, whether a mutation causes an effect on the timing of the structural change in the gating pathway or an effect on the percentages of different conformational states in the ensemble at steady-state is not known and confounds data interpretation. The authors need to discuss this point.</p><p>5) Data supporting the statement that mutations of H235, L157 and L246 lead to new global conformations are limited. One could argue that these mutations have dramatic functional effects (eliminate current) and thus, it is not all that surprising that alternative conformations might be adopted that normally would not be visited.</p><p>6) Data to support the claim that propofol specifically affects the pre-activation step are limited. Propofol could affect open-closed equilibrium.</p><p>7) It is striking that the fluorescence quenching profile for the Q235 mutant with propofol closely mirrors that of H235 without propofol (Black vs light/dashed green lines in Figure 8D). The addition of propofol reverses the effect of the H235Q mutation on structure, not just qualitatively, but close-to-quantitatively, for both the Bim136-Q101W and Bim135-W72 sensors. This is remarkable, especially for the latter sensor where the curve is complex. Yet the discussion treated the two sensors differently despite a similar reversal of the effect of the H235Q mutation, and the authors say the data for Bim135-W72-H235Q cannot be interpreted in structural terms. This explanation is confusing, especially since the corresponding figure is given equal weight in the paper. The authors need to revisit this section to improve clarity or move the mutant results and discussion of explicit technical limitations to supplementary information.</p><p>8) The authors claim that their results &quot;challenges the conventional concept that receptor activation involves a single conformational pathway.&quot; Do the authors believe their results are inconsistent with the 4 state Heidemann and Changeux models from the 1980s?</p><p>9) TMD motions were not measured. Monitoring motion of the M2-M3 loop does not monitor changes in the TMD or pore opening. In previous work, authors used Bimane243 to monitor M2 motions. Additional reporters of TMD motions would be helpful.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mutational analysis to explore long-range allosteric coupling and decoupling in a pentameric channel receptor&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew J R Plested (Reviewer #1); Grace Brannigan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>We appreciate the authors efforts in responding to the previous critiques and in revising the original paper. The revised paper is improved and the reviewers feel that no additional experiments are required. The paper has changed considerably. The biggest concern is that the revised manuscript, as written, is still difficult to follow, even for experts in the field, making it difficult to evaluate and appreciate its impact. The manuscript requires considerable editorial work to improve clarity. The specific points are:</p><p>1. The interpretation of the data with propofol is still a weak point. For instance, the manuscript says that &quot;Our data thus shows that propofol does not act locally by altering the conformation of the TMD, but rather acts on the global allosteric transitions by displacing the equilibria and preserving ECD-TMD coupling&quot; However, the preceding discussion is minimal. I spent a while trying to piece together how the data show that propofol's mechanism of action is not local. It is clear that the binding of propofol does affect the conformation far from the TMD, but this sentence implies that the authors have shown that TMD conformational change is insufficient for action. In other words, I could not figure out how the authors showed that ECD conformational shifts were necessary for propofol to act. If I am missing something, a few more sentences spelling out the logic here would be helpful or rewording of conclusions is needed.</p><p>2. The new Figure 9 is so full of important information that it gets hard to follow. I request that all the isomerization constants be compiled in a table for ease of comparison. The caption for that table can then refer to the equations and methods from which they were derived and differentiate between normalization schemes. While it may be useful to keep them in Figure 9 as well, Figure 9 is already overwhelmingly complex. I suggest either having fewer plots or fewer elements per plot. The arrows from one plot to the next were also not intuitive. Mainly, I request that the authors look at this figure with fresh eyes and consider breaking it up or streamlining it somehow.</p><p>3. Line 37 &quot;Seminal work in the 80s showed that a minimal four-state model describes the main allosteric properties of the muscle-type nAChR (Heidmann and Changeux, 1980; Sakmann et al., 1980).&quot;</p><p>First, the word seminal is best avoided; it is rather outdated. I would not take these similarly out-of-date works as a benchmark, rather use them as a counterpoint – perhaps you can say: &quot;although xxx work in the 1980s, …&quot; and then introduce the updates?</p><p>4. Line 66 &quot;However, the physiological relevance of these structures or their assignment to particular intermediates or end-states in putative gating pathways remains ambiguous and poorly studied.&quot;</p><p>This is a very important point and underlines the importance of the work at hand.</p><p>5. Line 69 &quot;Conversely, it is likely that key conformations, unfavored by crystal packing lattice or under-represented in receptor populations on cryo-EM grids, are missing in the current structural galleries.&quot;</p><p>On the other hand, this is overstated. I would say &quot;possible&quot;, not likely. Intermediates might be missing, but are they &quot;key&quot;?</p><p>6. Line 86 &quot;much faster than ionic current measurement that occurs in the 30-150 millisecond range &quot;</p><p>Much faster than the rise time of population or ensemble currents.</p><p>7. Line 116 &quot;Two independent trajectories, A and B, were computed starting from each of the two end-state structures and divided into 12 and 11 frames respectively. &quot;</p><p>I appreciate that the authors tried to explain better now, but this is still somewhat opaque. Please just say one trajectory goes from rest to active, and the other from active to rest. The use of &quot;end-state structures&quot; is confusing. They are both end and start, depends on which trajectory it is. Or are there really four structures – two crystals and two end states? Some of the figures suggest that each trajectory does not conclude in really the right place. I can't say which one because I have no idea what figure is which (figures not numbered and some do not correspond to figure legend order).</p><p>8. With iModFit, I think it is important to discuss how plausible it is that the transitions are not ergodic. This is mentioned in the discussion. In one way, we should not take these trajectories too seriously. But it is also important to consider the possibility that they are pulling out important information from the structures. Are the authors suggesting that the isomerisations are, preferentially, not reversible? I mention below that it would be a great future insight to have non-equilibrium data that could report the non-reversible motion at some of these sites.</p><p>9. Later in the paper, the text again makes me feel like I don't understand what iModFit does.</p><p>Line 176 &quot;For the ECD quenching pair Bim136-Q101W, the simulations show that Bim136 and the Trp101 indole ring are separated in the resting-like state, and are in close contact in the active-like state (Figure 3A). &quot;</p><p>The simulations? Are you referring to the docking results? The resting and active-like states are from structures, aren't they, not from iModfit? If the states used are from structures, there is little predictive power from the docking to these structures that couldn't be deduced by eye, is there? Or are you comparing the state at the end of the iModFit run, which isn't the other crystal state?</p><p>Surely iModFit (simulations?) only tells you about the trajectories of the fluorophores? This time-order of transitions between distances is interesting. But why is it mixed up with end state information (surely known from PDB)?</p><p>At the very least, a better description is needed. Overall, I still do not understand how the iModFit trajectories help to understand the steady state fluorescence.</p><p>10. Line 155 &quot;In conclusion, using iMODfit we could generate two distinct trajectories that are in principle equally plausible to describe a gating transition of GLIC activation. &quot;</p><p>But a really key point that doesn't really come up, but I think it should, is that the different trajectories really consist of at least two steps, Twist and the central gating motion, but they occur in different orders. This is a clear appeal to the intermediate states like flip and prime, and motivates the rest of the paper. The role of the compaction is less clear. If there were not distinct movements, the hysteresis in the motions would be much harder to understand. Still, the connection of the iModFit to the steady-state data is less convincing than any non-equilibrium data would be. This is the distinction between a plausible model (as the authors present) and evidence. The change of fluorescence at given sites should have different orders for activation and deactivation, shouldn't it? This would be worth mentioning. It is something for the future of course. And this is not to diminish the insight from the steady-state measurements.</p><p>11. Additionally, the flipped state, where the conformational change of the orthosteric site is predicted to be rather complete, but where the channel is closed, would fit the functional requirement of a pre-active state (Lape et al., 2008).</p><p>This is trivial because the flip state is just the name of a non-open agonist bound state. Also, flip is not the only type of state that fits, they might all be the same, from different perspectives. I wrote a comment about this once: &quot;Don't flip out: AChRs are primed to catch and hold your attention&quot;</p><p>12 The quantitative details of the fitting and the agreement or otherwise seem reasonable but I cannot claim to check in detail, I'm afraid. The individual conformations have various proton bound states and equilibria, so the 3-state model is quite a bit more complicated than at first sight. It might be nice to include the full model (to indicate the assumptions) in a supplementary figure. If, as the authors say, a relatively complicated proton binding scheme is needed to describe even equilibrium data, this is something of a find and needn't be buried. I don't think we have many ideas about how may protons are needed to gate.</p><p>13. I did notice that the Y28F mutant has the biggest change in the Pre-open constant. This selective effect was the case for the nearby A52S mutant in the glycine receptor – a big change in flip, no change in the main gating constants (Plested et al., 2007). Quite different at the K276E below that (Lape et al., 2012). But there are tons of mutants on these positions, maybe there are better ones to compare.</p><p>14. Table 1 statistics. Multiple mutants are being compared to the same reference value. Unpaired t test is not the correct test to use for these data. Investigators should use an ANOVA with a posthoc test such as a Dunnett or Bonferroni.</p><p>15. MWC fitting of the fluorescent and current data is used to conclude that mutations at the ECD alter the pre-activation step while those at the ECD-TMD interface and TMD alter the activation step (gating). Due to the assumption that the mutations do not effect proton affinity to the sites, the authors need to be careful about overinterpreting the data. The modeling provides support but is not conclusive.</p><p>16. How the fluorescence quenching data relate to motions identified by iMODfit is not obvious. On page 10, lines 315-318, the authors state &quot;the fluorescence and electrophysiological pH-dependent curves presented in this paper underlie two major allosteric steps, pre-activation (a fast process causing the changes in fluorescence as previously identified in stopped flow experiments and activation (a slower phase). Based on their 2017 <italic>eLife</italic> paper, the bim136 fluorescence reports early pre-gating motions, and bim250 reports early pre-gating motions and some later motions. In the revised manuscript, based on iMOD fit/normal mode analyses, the authors state that bim136 is monitoring a quaternary compaction of the ECD that is occurring throughout the gating cycle and that bim250 is monitoring motion of m2-m3 loop which is part of the 'central gating reorganization' including opening of pore (see page 14, lines 452-455). Later in the paper (page 16, lines 528-529) they state 'ECD compaction is critically involved in pre-activation&quot;. This is confusing and requires additional explanation and discussion. If the fluorescent reporters at these positions are monitoring fast, early pre-gating motions then why is the quaternary compaction and m2-m3 loop motion part of the central gating reorganization? Am I missing something?</p><p>17. In the abstract, the authors state that 'preactivation involves major asymmetric quaternary motions of the extracellular domain'. It is unclear to me what experimental data support this conclusion. Is this based on the starting pH7.0 crystal structure? The authors need to clarify if the asymmetry that they are describing is at the subunit level or is based on two different motions in the ECD (twisting and compaction). Without strong experimental evidence for asymmetric motions, this conclusion should be removed from the abstract.</p><p>18. They use iModFit and NMA as synonyms in some parts of the paper, which causes confusion. iMODfit/Normal mode analysis treats the protein like a 3D elastic network. It doesn't capture interactions with solvent or specific residue-residue interactions. It superimposes multiple local low-energy fluctuations to find likely larger scale conformational fluctuations. You would get asymmetry when it costs less total energy to move a few chains by a lot, than to move all of them by a little. The more chains the protein has, the more likely it is that imodFit will find asymmetry. I'm not sure the imodfit simulations add much regarding asymmetry, but the expected behavior of these macromolecules at room temperature makes it an uncontroversial claim, albeit one without significant new evidence.</p><p>19. In revised manuscript (page 5, lines 155-157), authors state 'using iMODfit we could generate two distinct trajectories that are in principle equally plausible to describe a gating transition of GLIC activation'. Additional discussion spelling out the logic here is essential.</p><p>It is important for the reader to understand the limitations of iModFit, and for a non-computational reader to know what iModFit is not. The authors need to add further discussion in methods or result sections. It is not a physics-based simulation technique like molecular dynamics – I'd call it a numerical approach for generating hypothetical pathways, and then experiments or simulations need to distinguish between them. They have used it here as a conceptual framework. The software itself is not designed to generate trajectories, but to generate structures. Motions or trajectories generated by Normal Mode Analysis are always reversible. Then imodfit applies a bias on top of that, based on the structure, to get a directional trajectory. They applied two different biases (based on two different structures) so they ended up with two different hypothetical and reversible trajectories.</p><p>In their response letter, the authors state &quot;one simulation is starting from the closed conformation to reach the open conformation, and the other from the closed to the open. Both trajectories represent plausible pathways for activation and deactivation.&quot; It is unclear whether the authors think that simulation A describes activation (closed channel to open channel) pathway and simulation B describes deactivation pathway (open channel to closed channel) or if they think that both trajectories can describe activation (closed channel to open channel)? Please clarify.</p><p>20. The authors should discuss and compare their results from iMODfit/NMA analyses to results from Toby Allen lab (PNAS 2017) using all-atom molecular dynamics with a string method to solve for GLIC gating pathways. What new information has been gained from the iMODfit/NMA?</p><p>21. Figures 3 supplementary 1 and 2 and 3 are in in different order compared to figure legends and text on page 6 lines 174-175. Authors need to check the order of the supplementary figures. It would be helpful if figures were labeled for review purposes.</p><p>22. Abstract should state which experimental results support their conclusions and describe the novel contributions that the data are providing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60682.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the data are interesting, the overall concern is with interpretation of the data. The logic of the arguments is not clear enough to support the conclusions. Comparisons between theories are not precise nor quantitative enough to support claim of a new gating model. Simulation description and limitations of this approach are not well described. As written, it is difficult to follow the authors line of reasoning and authors do not discuss alternative mechanisms that can fit their data. Significant re-writing and new analyses to make the arguments clear and focused on what novel contributions the data in this paper are providing are needed. The manuscript would be significantly strengthened by addressing the following major concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for their evaluation and the insightful general comments. As you will see bellow, we generally agree with most comments, and thus revisited profoundly the interpretation of the data in a more quantitative manner.</p><p>To do so, we performed a modeling of the whole set of pH-dependent curves using a 3-states Monod-Wyman-Changeux Model (including resting, pre-active and active states). MWC-type models, calculating the fractional population of the different states in equilibrium conditions, is indeed well suited to simulate the steady state data of fluorescence quenching and electrophysiology (recorded at the current plateau). This modeling procedure is now extensively described at the end of the result section, including two new figures 9 and 10. The resulting set of parameters provides a reasonable and unifying description of most mutant phenotypes. It exemplifies in a quantitative manner the major conclusion that mutations at the ECD principally alter the pre-activation step, while those at the ECD-TMD interface and TMD principally alter the activation step. However, the model also accounts for the phenotype of non-functional mutant (especially H235F), challenging our initial interpretation that those mutants are stabilized in “unique intermediate conformations where motions are decoupled”. Consequently, we do not any more focus the article on “the possibility of multiple conformational pathways during gating”, but rather on the input of our experimental data on the understanding of pre-activation and activation mechanisms. In this context, we further revisited the iModfit data. We agree that the available data do not allow for the discrimination between the two generated trajectories. However, it allows for the assignment of mutant phenotypes to specific protein motions, giving overall a very coherent picture of the key reorganizations involved in pre-activation and activation. Most of the Discussion section was thus rewritten.</p><p>Finally, to simplify the flow of the text, we removed from the main text all data related to the Bim135 mutant, since the complexity of the fluorescence data at this level precludes clear conclusions. We however kept this material in the Figure 4 – Supplementary1 to further document effects of mutations and the robustness of the effect of propofol.</p><p>Overall, thanks to the referee’s comments, we think we provide now a clearer and much less speculative interpretation of the data. The revised version combines a unique and solid set of fluorescence/electrophysiological data, which are interpreted in the framework of NMA and MWC modeling and which highlight key proteins motions involved in GLIC gating.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A 1-D, steady state signal (quenching) is used to discern multiple states (meaning, functional conformations, division in space) because it takes multiple values. But the signal is the infinite time average over all states, in different conditions. How do we know that the signal doesn't represent different balances of occupancies of the same small number of states (such as 2 states). There are no apparent reasons why results could not be explained from mutants that change open-closed equilibrium as from new conformational states. The authors need to fully discuss and address this alternative mechanism for explaining the data.</p></disp-quote><p>In the first version of the article, we interpreted the phenotypes of non-functional mutants proposing that they are stabilized at low pH in new unorthodox conformations. We agree with the general comments of the referee that this idea, while plausible, is one possibility among others, the current data not allowing to draw a firm conclusion. We thus completely removed this idea in the new version.</p><p>Following the referee’s advice, we thus tried to fit the entire set of data with a three-state allosteric model, that represents the minimal number of states required to account for the separation of the fluorescence and electrophysiological curves. We show that this model reasonably accounts for the majority of mutants, except for two non-functional ones, L157A and L246A. This may suggest that indeed these mutants adopt unorthodox conformations. However, this idea, still very speculative given the current data, is no more emphasized in the new version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What experiments provide direct evidence for intermediates? Can the intermediates states represent abstract transitional milestones, not concrete conformations? That interpretation would be consistent with what has been long established in protein folding, but would entail a major shift in how structures are interpreted, because there would not be a meaningful way to connect conformations to kinetic models.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments providing direct evidence for intermediate protein “motions” are published in our <italic>eLife</italic> paper of 2017. The two major arguments being the separation of the pH-dependent fluorescence and electrophysiological curves, as well as the kinetic studies, for which a two states model can clearly not account for. The present work further expends this idea, for instance since non-functional mutants still undergo pH-dependent fluorescence changes, another direct demonstration of protein movement not directly related to activation.</p><p>The referees ask the question whether such intermediate motion underlie passage through a well-defined single allosteric state, or a multiplicity of conformational pathways. This is an interesting and complex question, that actually is relevant not only to these “intermediate motions”, but also to the end states themselves. In particular, it is more and more admitted that the resting state of GLIC displays high structural flexibility (notably from X-ray, Cryo-EM and MD simulation work cited in the paper). In other word, some of the currently called “allosteric states” actually correspond to a family of conformations. Nonetheless, allosteric models involving discrete states remain useful. While they represent a simplification of the highly complex molecular reorganizations, they are essential to interpret functional data into structural term.</p><p>In the new version of the article, we now interpret the data with a 3-state allosteric model. In addition, we discuss that the model does not account for the low cooperativity of the fluorescence curves and we propose, based on NMA analysis, that the implemented intermediate “pre-active” state could correspond to a wider family of states, for instance involving asymmetric movement of individual subunits, in a manner reminiscent of the desensitization of GABAA receptors (Gielen et al., 2020). We also attempt to emphasize in the discussion that the modelling is not meant to demonstrate the occurrence of discrete states, but to refine the interpretation of the mutant phenotypes in term of their relative effect on pre-activation versus activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Description of the iMOD fit simulations is unclear and does not provide enough detail. How many simulations were run to yield the two trajectories? It is not clear whether iMod-Fit returns two trajectories from a single calculation or whether multiple simulations were run and the trajectories were clustered. In the methods section (page 25, lines 25-26), trajectory A conformation change is from closed to open whereas trajectory B conformation change is from open to closed. However, in the figures, for both trajectories, frame 1starts at GLIC-pH7 (closed).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing that the description of the Molecular Modeling methods was not detailed enough, and we tried to fix this issue. The iMOD fit simulations are now detailed in the method section Two simulations were run and the frame numbers have been inverted for one of them in the figures which, we agree, causes confusion. One simulation is starting from the closed conformation to reach the open conformation, and the other from the closed to the open. Both trajectories represent plausible pathways for activation and deactivation. In the result section, we have chosen for clarity to represent both trajectories in the closed to open direction. We propose to clarify and add the missing information as follows:</p><p>“Each structure (4NPQ and 4HFI) was fitted, using iMODfit (Lopéz-Blanco and Chacón, 2013), to the simulated electron-microscopy envelope of the other structure. The EM density map resolution was set to 5 Å and the grid size to 0.5 Å. iMODfit was then used to compute two trajectories, fitting each structure to the density of the other structure. In trajectory A structure 4NPQ is fitted to the density of 4HFI, and in trajectory B structure 4HFI is fitted to the density of 4NPQ. The range of modes considered (-n option) was set to 0.5, i.e. half of the modes are considered for the conformational change. The geometry of the ion channel has been computed with MOLEonline webserver (mole.upol.cz), with the ’pore’ mode (Sehnal et al., 2013) We used the FreeRadius value computed at the level of the 9’ residue.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Since their previous time-resolved fluorescence quenching data (eLife 2017) demonstrated that motions monitored at Bimane-136 (ECD β sandwich compaction) and Bim-250 (M2-M3 loop motion) mainly occur prior to channel opening (activation scheme in Figure 4B), it is unclear why the authors conclude that their Bim-250 data support pathway A identified from their simulations. In pathway A, Bim-250-Y197 unquenching happens in same time frame as the increase in pore radius at the 9' position, whereas in pathway B the unquenching of Bim250-Y97 happens before complete pore radius dilation (Figure 2B, 2D). The experimental data at this position seems compatible with the B trajectory. Moreover, the unquenching of Bim-136-W101 appears consistent with either trajectory (Figure 3B) and occurs before the simulated pore dilation. It is unclear what new information the simulations are providing except that the steady-state fluorescence quenching data show good agreement with the simulated end states.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that discriminating both trajectories on the basis of the current fluorescence data was rather speculative and not clear-cut. We thus removed these considerations in the new version of the paper.</p><p>However, iMOD fit simulations still give important information. Regardless of the order in which specific protein motions are appearing in the trajectories, iMOD fit reveals two distinct conformational reorganizations, an asymmetric quaternary reorganization of the ECD, as well as what we call a “central gating motion”, which involves a compaction of the lower part of the β-sandwich, a tilt of M2 toward M3 and in marked increase in the pore radius. Notably, several of the mutations investigated in the paper are predicted to specifically alter some of the key motions involved. iMOD fit simulations thus provides a unique framework to interpret the mutant phenotypes and propose specific protein motions differentially involved in pre-activation versus activation. This analysis is now included in the discussion in the section “Structural interpretation of the mutant phenotypes in the context of NMA trajectories”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To monitor how motions in the ECD are coupled to motions in the TMD (pore opening), the authors used mutations and the allosteric drug modulator propofol to perturb GLIC gating transitions and compared the effects of these perturbations on proton-induced current responses and steady-state fluorescence quenching data. Since the fluorescence data are steady-state, whether a mutation causes an effect on the timing of the structural change in the gating pathway or an effect on the percentages of different conformational states in the ensemble at steady-state is not known and confounds data interpretation. The authors need to discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The referees are perfectly correct. In the new version of the manuscript, we interpret the whole series of data using an equilibrium 3-state MWC model, which is adequate to describe the steady state data of fluorescence and electrophysiology (at the plateau of the current). We kept the consideration about the timing of the structural changes at the end of the discussion in a single section (Structural interpretation of the mutant phenotypes in the context of NMA trajectories), that gives overall a coherent and plausible picture of key events involved in gating.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Data supporting the statement that mutations of H235, L157 and L246 lead to new global conformations are limited. One could argue that these mutations have dramatic functional effects (eliminate current) and thus, it is not all that surprising that alternative conformations might be adopted that normally would not be visited.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that data concerning these mutants are limited to conclude that they adopt new conformations. We thus reconsidered their phenotypes, and aimed at integrating them into a single MWC model accounting for all the mutant. Among non-functional mutants, H235F is the best characterized and its X-ray structure shows a well folded conformation, the so-called locally-closed, that is adopted by numerous other GLIC mutants including the WT GLIC (Sauguet et al., 2014). In the course of the fitting procedure, we found actually that we could readily account for the phenotype of this mutant (including shifts in pH<sub>50</sub>s and partial amplitude of the fluorescence curves) by increasing the L<sub>pA</sub> constant, i.e., by stabilizing the resting state over the pre-active state. Therefore, there is no need to assume a new global conformation in this case. Concerning L157 and L246, as stated in the new version of the article, fits are of lower quality, notably because some of their pH-dependent curves are rather flat and better represented by a straight line. This suggests that those mutants undergo more complex reorganizations than simulated here by a 3-state model, but the data do not allow to conclude on the mechanisms involved. Those two mutants were thus discussed mainly in their ability to preclude the activation transition to occur.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Data to support the claim that propofol specifically affects the pre-activation step are limited. Propofol could affect open-closed equilibrium.</p></disp-quote><p>To interpret the propofol data, we used the three-state allosteric model, which suggests that propofol affects both the pre-activation and activation equilibria. It is noteworthy that several propofol binding sites have been identified on GLIC by crystallography, and plausibly other unknown sites are present. It is thus difficult to drawn more precise conclusion regarding this matter. In particular our fluorescence sensor reports allosteric effect but would not sense a potential pore blocker effect of propofol suggested in other studies (Fourati et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is striking that the fluorescence quenching profile for the Q235 mutant with propofol closely mirrors that of H235 without propofol (Black vs light/dashed green lines in Figure 8D). The addition of propofol reverses the effect of the H235Q mutation on structure, not just qualitatively, but close-to-quantitatively, for both the Bim136-Q101W and Bim135-W72 sensors. This is remarkable, especially for the latter sensor where the curve is complex. Yet the discussion treated the two sensors differently despite a similar reversal of the effect of the H235Q mutation, and the authors say the data for Bim135-W72-H235Q cannot be interpreted in structural terms. This explanation is confusing, especially since the corresponding figure is given equal weight in the paper. The authors need to revisit this section to improve clarity or move the mutant results and discussion of explicit technical limitations to supplementary information.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original version of the manuscript, we have chosen to show data related to the Bim135 sensor to provide a complete description of the quenching data that we have collected. However, as discussed, data related to this position are complex, especially because of the biphasic nature of the fluorescence curve that mix two components. We agree that data related to H235Q is remarkable, but the various mutants tested at this position did not allow us to propose a reasonable interpretation, even a speculative one. Clearly, interesting reorganization are occurring at this level, but they remain mysterious, probably because Bim135 monitor subtle local changes in structure, as illustrated in the docking simulation. To clarify the text, we thus chose to move all the data related to this sensor in the supplementary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors claim that their results &quot;challenges the conventional concept that receptor activation involves a single conformational pathway.&quot; Do the authors believe their results are inconsistent with the 4 state Heidemann and Changeux models from the 1980s?</p></disp-quote><p>This claim was removed from the new version. However, not directly linked to this work, a recent paper from the group shows that for the GABAA receptor, asymmetric motions of individual subunit accounts for the biphasic desensitization kinetics (Gielen et al., 2020). It is possible that such a mechanism also applies to nAChRs and other pLGICs and those observations are not necessarily incompatible with a 4 states MWC model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) TMD motions were not measured. Monitoring motion of the M2-M3 loop does not monitor changes in the TMD or pore opening. In previous work, authors used Bimane243 to monitor M2 motions. Additional reporters of TMD motions would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>In the 2017 <italic>eLife</italic> article, we performed mutational work to generate a fluorescent sensor of pore opening. To this aim, based on the Bim243 mutant, we introduced the quenching residue tryptophan at various locations in the upper part of the TMD, nearby the channel gate (figure 3F). Unfortunately, most pairs did not show pH dependent changes in fluorescence, and the only mutant which did so was not functional by electrophysiology. It is clear that mutating this key gating region, especially introducing the bulky tryptophan residue, is detrimental to the gating process. Overall, our work shows that the TriQ technique is powerful to monitor reorganization at the level of solvent-accessible regions of the protein, but not suited to monitor motions in buried locations such as the ion channel.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The interpretation of the data with propofol is still a weak point. For instance, the manuscript says that &quot;Our data thus shows that propofol does not act locally by altering the conformation of the TMD, but rather acts on the global allosteric transitions by displacing the equilibria and preserving ECD-TMD coupling&quot; However, the preceding discussion is minimal. I spent a while trying to piece together how the data show that propofol's mechanism of action is not local. It is clear that the binding of propofol does affect the conformation far from the TMD, but this sentence implies that the authors have shown that TMD conformational change is insufficient for action. In other words, I could not figure out how the authors showed that ECD conformational shifts were necessary for propofol to act. If I am missing something, a few more sentences spelling out the logic here would be helpful or rewording of conclusions is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right in pointing out that our conclusion about propofol is somewhat overstated. Indeed, the whole study does not demonstrate that the reorganizations of the ECD are a necessary condition for TMD reorganization and channel opening, although all functional mutants tested do show almost full fluorescence changes at Bim136. We thus reword the conclusion:</p><p>“Our data thus shows that propofol does acts on the global allosteric transitions by displacing the equilibria of both pre-activation and activation. It is noteworthy that propofol is also likely to generate local effects upon binding to modulate the function, that are nor investigated here. For instance, its binding into the pore may sterically block ion translocation to produce inhibition”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The new Figure 9 is so full of important information that it gets hard to follow. I request that all the isomerization constants be compiled in a table for ease of comparison. The caption for that table can then refer to the equations and methods from which they were derived and differentiate between normalization schemes. While it may be useful to keep them in Figure 9 as well, Figure 9 is already overwhelmingly complex. I suggest either having fewer plots or fewer elements per plot. The arrows from one plot to the next were also not intuitive. Mainly, I request that the authors look at this figure with fresh eyes and consider breaking it up or streamlining it somehow.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure 9 (figure 6 is the new version) has been modified. For clarity the isomerization constants have been summarized in a table and population of the pA state is not shown anymore. To visualize the shifts in isomerization constants, the fits of the reference (Bim136-Q101W or Bim136-Q101W-H235Q in case of Bim136-Q101W-H235Q + propofol) are shown in dashed lines for both current and fluorescence quenching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 37 &quot;Seminal work in the 80s showed that a minimal four-state model describes the main allosteric properties of the muscle-type nAChR (Heidmann and Changeux, 1980; Sakmann et al., 1980).&quot;</p><p>First, the word seminal is best avoided; it is rather outdated.

Line 116 &quot;Two independent trajectories, A and B, were computed starting from each of the two end-state structures and divided into 12 and 11 frames respectively. &quot;</p><p>I appreciate that the authors tried to explain better now, but this is still somewhat opaque. Please just say one trajectory goes from rest to active, and the other from active to rest. The use of &quot;end-state structures&quot; is confusing. They are both end and start, depends on which trajectory it is. Or are there really four structures – two crystals and two end states? Some of the figures suggest that each trajectory does not conclude in really the right place.

With iModFit, I think it is important to discuss how plausible it is that the transitions are not ergodic. This is mentioned in the discussion. In one way, we should not take these trajectories too seriously. But it is also important to consider the possibility that they are pulling out important information from the structures. Are the authors suggesting that the isomerisations are, preferentially, not reversible? I mention below that it would be a great future insight to have non-equilibrium data that could report the non-reversible motion at some of these sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We perfectly agree with the referee. This is why we moved the iMODFit to the end of the result section, and presented them more carefully, emphasizing the limitation of the “rough” trajectories and “simple” docking approach. We also state that trajectories, as normal mode deformations, are fully reversible (see answer to point 7). We also agree that these simple computations are pulling out important information from the structure, for instance the “central gating region”, or more locally the reorganization of bimane when attached at position 250.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Later in the paper, the text again makes me feel like I don't understand what iModFit does.</p><p>Line 176 &quot;For the ECD quenching pair Bim136-Q101W, the simulations show that Bim136 and the Trp101 indole ring are separated in the resting-like state, and are in close contact in the active-like state (Figure 3A). &quot;</p><p>The simulations? Are you referring to the docking results? The resting and active-like states are from structures, aren't they, not from iModfit? If the states used are from structures, there is little predictive power from the docking to these structures that couldn't be deduced by eye, is there? Or are you comparing the state at the end of the iModFit run, which isn't the other crystal state?</p><p>Surely iModFit (simulations?) only tells you about the trajectories of the fluorophores? This time-order of transitions between distances is interesting. But why is it mixed up with end state information (surely known from PDB)?</p><p>At the very least, a better description is needed. Overall, I still do not understand how the iModFit trajectories help to understand the steady state fluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p>The improper term “simulation” has been removed concerning iMODFit. For this analysis, we considered the extreme intermediates of the trajectories (first and last frames), not the crystallographic structures. This is now stated. Of note, crystallographic structures would show identical results. We do not agree that iMODFit is useless in understanding quenching. For Bim136, the center of mass distances along the trajectories is indeed poorly informative since the bimane moiety, that is exposed to the solvent and rather mobile, adopts multiples poses in the docking procedure generating large fluctuation in center of mass distance. In contrast, the docking procedure is quite interesting for Bim250, which flips from both sides of loop 2, a feature that could not be identified by visual inspection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Line 155 &quot;In conclusion, using iMODfit we could generate two distinct trajectories that are in principle equally plausible to describe a gating transition of GLIC activation. &quot;</p><p>But a really key point that doesn't really come up, but I think it should, is that the different trajectories really consist of at least two steps, Twist and the central gating motion, but they occur in different orders. This is a clear appeal to the intermediate states like flip and prime, and motivates the rest of the paper. The role of the compaction is less clear. If there were not distinct movements, the hysteresis in the motions would be much harder to understand. Still, the connection of the iModFit to the steady-state data is less convincing than any non-equilibrium data would be. This is the distinction between a plausible model (as the authors present) and evidence. The change of fluorescence at given sites should have different orders for activation and deactivation, shouldn't it? This would be worth mentioning. It is something for the future of course. And this is not to diminish the insight from the steady-state measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the twist and central gating motions appear in distinctive order in both trajectories. However, we do not have sensors of the twist, so we cannot investigate this global motion in fluorescence experiments. This is why we focused the analysis and discussion on the ECD compaction, M2-M3 movement, and, indirectly from structural considerations, on β-sandwich compaction and M2 movement toward M3. It is also true that the role of the ECD compaction is unclear from iMODFit trajectories. However, the role of the ECD compaction is clear from fluorescence quenching data, that are more solid. This is another reason to present the more speculative iMODFit data at the end of the Results section, and use them only for the interpretation of the fluorescence data. Finally, concerning the hysteresis, both trajectories are theoretically fully reversible, so we think that it is too speculative to discuss the pathways of activation and deactivation in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Additionally, the flipped state, where the conformational change of the orthosteric site is predicted to be rather complete, but where the channel is closed, would fit the functional requirement of a pre-active state (Lape et al., 2008).</p><p>This is trivial because the flip state is just the name of a non-open agonist bound state. Also, flip is not the only type of state that fits, they might all be the same, from different perspectives. I wrote a comment about this once: &quot;Don't flip out: AChRs are primed to catch and hold your attention&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The mentioned reference has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The quantitative details of the fitting and the agreement or otherwise seem reasonable but I cannot claim to check in detail, I'm afraid. The individual conformations have various proton bound states and equilibria, so the 3-state model is quite a bit more complicated than at first sight. It might be nice to include the full model (to indicate the assumptions) in a supplementary figure. If, as the authors say, a relatively complicated proton binding scheme is needed to describe even equilibrium data, this is something of a find and needn't be buried. I don't think we have many ideas about how may protons are needed to gate.</p></disp-quote><p>A supplementary figure has been added with a workflow scheme illustrating the steps and assumptions used to build the MWC model. Indeed, the requirement of a second binding site is a new finding that is consistent with our previous study on GLIC proton site where we could not find a single proton site that would abolish activation when mutated (Nemecz et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. I did notice that the Y28F mutant has the biggest change in the Pre-open constant. This selective effect was the case for the nearby A52S mutant in the glycine receptor – a big change in flip, no change in the main gating constants (Plested et al., 2007). Quite different at the K276E below that (Lape et al., 2012). But there are tons of mutants on these positions, maybe there are better ones to compare.</p></disp-quote><p>In the examples of pathological mutations used in the discussion we focused on the mutation homologous to the ones used on GLIC. The papers mentioned here are studying other residues but their conclusions are in line with the residues we studied in the same regions. We added them at the end of the discussion:</p><p>“Interestingly, on the glycine receptor α1, other mutations have been studied by single channel recordings and are described to affect principally a flip pre-activation-like step for A52S in the loop 2 at the ECD-ECD interface (Plested et al., 2007) or gating for K276E on the M2-M3 loop (Lape et al., 2012). These data suggest that mutations produce similar allosteric perturbations on GLIC and GlyR in those regions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Table 1 statistics. Multiple mutants are being compared to the same reference value. Unpaired t test is not the correct test to use for these data. Investigators should use an ANOVA with a posthoc test such as a Dunnett or Bonferroni.</p></disp-quote><p>A one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett test has been performed on data where mutants were compared to a common reference (Bim136-Q101 of Bim250-Y197). To compare individually fluorescence to electrophysiological pH<sub>50</sub> for each mutant, we kept the t tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. MWC fitting of the fluorescent and current data is used to conclude that mutations at the ECD alter the pre-activation step while those at the ECD-TMD interface and TMD alter the activation step (gating). Due to the assumption that the mutations do not effect proton affinity to the sites, the authors need to be careful about overinterpreting the data. The modeling provides support but is not conclusive.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, choosing to modify isomerization constants and not affinities is a choice made in this model and conclusions were already mitigated in the discussion:</p><p>“We also postulated that the various mutants only alter the isomerization constants between states. However, the dataset does not allow for the discrimination between effect on binding affinity versus isomerization constants. The effects of mutations on the isomerization constants are thus meant here to evaluate the global effect of the mutations on pre-activation versus activation, but it is possible that they actually underlie alteration of isomerization constant, affinity constants, or both.”</p><p>We now develop further the idea:</p><p>“Among the various mutations investigated here, E26Q, E222Q, H235F/Q neutralize the charge of titratable amino acids. It is thus possible that in these cases the mutation eliminates a proton binding site. However, a local impact of a mutation on a proton binding site, or on a set of inter-residues interactions altering the allosteric equilibria, will be equally valid in assigning local structural alterations to pre-active/active phenotypes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. How the fluorescence quenching data relate to motions identified by iMODfit is not obvious. On page 10, lines 315-318, the authors state &quot;the fluorescence and electrophysiological pH-dependent curves presented in this paper underlie two major allosteric steps, pre-activation (a fast process causing the changes in fluorescence as previously identified in stopped flow experiments and activation (a slower phase). Based on their 2017 eLife paper, the bim136 fluorescence reports early pre-gating motions, and bim250 reports early pre-gating motions and some later motions. In the revised manuscript, based on iMOD fit/normal mode analyses, the authors state that bim136 is monitoring a quaternary compaction of the ECD that is occurring throughout the gating cycle and that bim250 is monitoring motion of m2-m3 loop which is part of the 'central gating reorganization' including opening of pore (see page 14, lines 452-455). Later in the paper (page 16, lines 528-529) they state 'ECD compaction is critically involved in pre-activation&quot;. This is confusing and requires additional explanation and discussion. If the fluorescent reporters at these positions are monitoring fast, early pre-gating motions then why is the quaternary compaction and m2-m3 loop motion part of the central gating reorganization? Am I missing something?</p></disp-quote><p>In our <italic>eLife</italic> 2017 paper, we showed for Bim136-Q101W and Bim250-Y197 that the majority of the changes in fluorescence occur with very fast kinetics. Bim250 indeed shows some fluorescence changes appearing with slower kinetics, but they contribute by less than 20% to the total ∆F, and thus were neglected in the present steady-state study. Still, Bim250 monitors a pre-activation motion by fluorescence, but the modifications themselves alter principally the activation transition (stronger effect on the pH<sub>50</sub> of ∆I as compared to ∆F). We now emphasize this point in the discussion by stating:</p><p>“The mutational analysis also shows for most mutations mixed effects on the isomerization constants of activation and pre-activation, suggesting that both processes involve overlapping regions. The Bim250 position is noteworthy in this respect, since the bimane, reporting an outward motion of the M2-M3 loop, monitors pre-activation, while the modification itself (P250C mutation plus reaction with bimane) principally alters the activation process. It is thus plausible that the M2-M3 loop could move in two successive steps, a first one during pre-activation conditioning dequenching and a second one during activation. In either case, our data further highlight a central role for this loop in ECD-TMD coupling.”</p><p>We then later in the text speculate about one possible succession of reorganizations:</p><p>“Concerning the order in which reorganizations are observed, Trajectory A fits much better the fluorescence data. It suggests a scenario involving, during pre-activation, progressive ECD compaction and beginning of the M2-M3 loop motion, generating the fluorescence variations. Then the M2-M3 loop completes its movement in concert with β-sandwich compaction and pore opening. Future computational studies are needed to investigate this possibility.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. In the abstract, the authors state that 'preactivation involves major asymmetric quaternary motions of the extracellular domain'. It is unclear to me what experimental data support this conclusion. Is this based on the starting pH7.0 crystal structure? The authors need to clarify if the asymmetry that they are describing is at the subunit level or is based on two different motions in the ECD (twisting and compaction). Without strong experimental evidence for asymmetric motions, this conclusion should be removed from the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>The abstract has been re-written leaving out the notion of asymmetry, which we agree is not addressed in the fluorescence experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. They use iModFit and NMA as synonyms in some parts of the paper, which causes confusion. iMODfit/Normal mode analysis treats the protein like a 3D elastic network. It doesn't capture interactions with solvent or specific residue-residue interactions. It superimposes multiple local low-energy fluctuations to find likely larger scale conformational fluctuations. You would get asymmetry when it costs less total energy to move a few chains by a lot, than to move all of them by a little. The more chains the protein has, the more likely it is that imodFit will find asymmetry. I'm not sure the imodfit simulations add much regarding asymmetry, but the expected behavior of these macromolecules at room temperature makes it an uncontroversial claim, albeit one without significant new evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>The asymmetric nature of the transition has been removed from the abstract and just discussed at the end of the discussion in the section “Speculative interpretation of the mutant phenotypes in the context of computational trajectories”<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. In revised manuscript (page 5, lines 155-157), authors state 'using iMODfit we could generate two distinct trajectories that are in principle equally plausible to describe a gating transition of GLIC activation'. Additional discussion spelling out the logic here is essential.</p><p>It is important for the reader to understand the limitations of iModFit, and for a non-computational reader to know what iModFit is not. The authors need to add further discussion in methods or result sections. It is not a physics-based simulation technique like molecular dynamics – I'd call it a numerical approach for generating hypothetical pathways, and then experiments or simulations need to distinguish between them. They have used it here as a conceptual framework. The software itself is not designed to generate trajectories, but to generate structures. Motions or trajectories generated by Normal Mode Analysis are always reversible. Then imodfit applies a bias on top of that, based on the structure, to get a directional trajectory. They applied two different biases (based on two different structures) so they ended up with two different hypothetical and reversible trajectories.</p><p>In their response letter, the authors state &quot;one simulation is starting from the closed conformation to reach the open conformation, and the other from the closed to the open. Both trajectories represent plausible pathways for activation and deactivation.&quot; It is unclear whether the authors think that simulation A describes activation (closed channel to open channel) pathway and simulation B describes deactivation pathway (open channel to closed channel) or if they think that both trajectories can describe activation (closed channel to open channel)?
