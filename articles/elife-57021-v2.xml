neuroscience is to understand the relationship between movement speed and accuracy, known as the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Here, we introduce a biomechanically realistic computational model of three-dimensional upper extremity movements that reproduces well-known features of reaching movements. This model revealed that the speed-accuracy tradeoff, as described by Fitts’ law, emerges even without the presence of motor noise, which is commonly believed to underlie the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Next, we analyzed motor cortical neural activity from monkeys reaching to targets of different sizes. We found that the contribution of preparatory neural activity to movement duration (MD) variability is greater for smaller targets than larger targets, and that movements to smaller targets exhibit less variability in population-level preparatory activity, but greater MD variability. These results propose a new theory underlying the speed-accuracy tradeoff: Fitts’ law emerges from greater task demands constraining the optimization landscape in a fashion that reduces the number of ‘good’ control solutions (i.e., faster reaches). Thus, contrary to current beliefs, the speed-accuracy tradeoff could be a consequence of motor planning variability and not exclusively signal-dependent noise.</p></abstract><kwd-group

particularly skilled at striking a balance between the speed and the accuracy of their serves. If they only focus on placing the ball in a strategic location, they may inadvertently advantage their opponent by not paying close enough attention to the speed of their serve. On the other hand, serving the ball with as much speed as possible is not desirable as the ball may fail to clear the net or land in a location that is advantageous to their opponent. This relationship, commonly known as the ‘speed-accuracy tradeoff,’ is observed not only for purely motor, but also perceptual and cognitive tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heitz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wickelgren, 1977</xref>). In laboratory settings, the speed-accuracy tradeoff, quantified by Fitts’ law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fitts, 1954</xref>), is an empirical finding that movements that require greater accuracy tend to be slower than those that do not. Fitts’ law relates the width of the target (<italic>W</italic>), the movement distance (<italic>A</italic>), and the movement duration (MD):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are subject-specific scalar parameters.

The theory proposes that if motor noise increases with the size of the control signal, then moving rapidly, which requires large control signals, increases the variability in the final movement position. Conversely, reaching to a smaller target, with low variability in the final position, requires smaller control signals that consequently produce slower movements. Thus, this theory provides an explanation for the speed-accuracy tradeoff. In the present work, we show that the speed-accuracy tradeoff, as described by Fitts’ law, emerges even without the presence of motor noise.</p><p>In support of this theory, a large body of prior work has employed simple one-dimensional linear systems or torque-driven two-joint models of the arm that are restricted to moving in a plane to study the speed-accuracy tradeoff (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flash and Hogan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fagg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris and Wolpert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeWolf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sketch et al., 2017</xref>). While it certainly is not the case that the mechanical properties of the plant being controlled explain phenomena such as Fitts’ law, the patterns of neural activity required to drive goal-directed movements are necessarily constrained by the dynamics of the plant. When musculoskeletal dynamics are modeled with sufficient fidelity, and these musculoskeletal dynamics are controlled in an optimal fashion, motor behavior that is consistent with Fitts’ law emerges and thus provides a parsimonious theory of the speed-accuracy tradeoff.</p><p>Thus, a primary innovation in this work is the development of a computational model of upper extremity movements with a more realistic model of the musculoskeletal system than previously described (three-dimensional, 47 muscles and five degrees-of-freedom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saul et al., 2015</xref>]). The musculoskeletal model proposed by Saul and colleagues was previously used to track experimental kinematics, but not synthesize movements de novo. Our computational model synthesizes three-dimensional point-to-point reaching movements that reproduce features reported in motor control studies and in our experimental data. We focus on point-to-point movements because normal voluntary movements can be described as holding still after moving from one pose to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shadmehr, 2017</xref>). The movements are synthesized by minimizing a cost function based on end-point accuracy and squared muscle activation terms. We use the squared muscle activation term as an approximation to metabolic power consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Millard et al., 2013</xref>). We show that the asymmetry in the velocity profile with movement speed can be explained in terms of optimal control theory, as opposed to it either representing some unexplained feature, or resulting from constraints in the neural architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bullock and Grossberg, 1988</xref>), or a learned strategy when approaching a target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beggs and Howarth, 1972</xref>), or time-varying cost constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagasaki, 1989</xref>), or signal-dependent noise with a minimum variance model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Guided by this computational model, we propose a new theory based on motor planning variability: Fitts’ law emerges as a consequence of the difficulty associated with finding good control solutions for challenging tasks. Concretely, our theory results from the observation that during learning of a new task, the search space for finding the control solutions is very high-dimensional and contains many local minima. In our model, we use a stochastic optimizer, which attempts to find appropriate motor plans (i.e., reach trajectories) in this search space. As a consequence of the high dimensionality of the search space and the presence of local minima, the optimizer is more likely to find locally optimal solutions (or solutions that are near locally optimal solutions) in lieu of globally optimal solutions. Our theory suggests that for more challenging tasks (e.g., reaching to smaller targets), the trajectory optimizer tends to find less effective solutions (i.e., slower reaches) than other undiscovered but possible solutions. For less challenging tasks (e.g., reaching to larger targets), the optimizer tends to find more effective solutions (i.e., faster reaches). With more challenging tasks, previously effective solutions are discarded as they do not produce trajectories that reach the target; the smaller set of effective solutions makes it more likely for the optimizer to converge to a less effective solution.</p><p>The crux of our theory is that some features of human movement are attributable to planning variability rather than execution noise (e.g., Figure 4 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchland et al., 2006a</xref> for related evidence). We analyze motor cortical neural activity from monkeys reaching to targets of different sizes. We hypothesized that if motor planning variability has a contribution to the speed-accuracy tradeoff, then we should observe a statistically significant difference in motor planning variability when reaching to large and small targets; this is not expected if the speed-accuracy tradeoff is only the result of execution noise. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the contribution of planning variability to MD variability should increase for smaller targets (i.e., as sensitivity to the motor plan increases for more challenging tasks). We test both hypotheses in this work and show that the neural analyses are consistent with our theory.</p><p>A realistic musculoskeletal model allows us to study human movement variability with greater resolution. Our theory highlights the role of motor planning rather than execution noise to explain features of human movement. That is not to say that signal-dependent noise does not exist or could not play a part in Fitts’ law. Rather, given the results here, we must re-examine the assumption that signal-dependent noise is the only factor that gives rise to Fitts’ law. Reaching to a smaller target may exhibit smaller velocities to minimize the effects of signal-dependent noise. Alternatively, slower reach trajectories for smaller targets might be ‘easier’ to find from an optimal control theory perspective. We believe our new theory provides a more complete account of the empirical observations, both behaviorally and neurally, surrounding the speed-accuracy tradeoff, without having to rely on assumptions surrounding improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Model validation</title><p>We first evaluate whether the computational model reproduces important kinematic features reported in motor control studies. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, we compare the hand positions in a center-out fast reaching task from our model and the data reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beer et al., 2000</xref>. The simulations are synthesized with trajectory optimization (see the section Trajectory optimization), specifying only the final target position and the MD, which we set to 350 ms. Note that our simulations reproduce the observation that arm reach trajectories (in humans and non-human primates) are gently curved, particularly near the targets. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, we compare the velocity profile of our simulation with the data presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soechting, 1984</xref>. The maximum unnormalized speed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> is 1.10 m/s, which falls in the range of maximal speeds reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soechting, 1984</xref> (i.e., from 0.65 m/s to 1.35 m/s). We also compare the effect of the target size on the synthesized and experimental data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>. Soechting reported that a smaller target causes the movement to have an earlier peak velocity and a velocity that decays more rapidly. We reproduce both of these features in our simulations. However, the experimental speed profiles of the large and small targets are more nearly parallel than the simulated ones. The areas of the small and large targets are 2.55 cm<sup>2</sup> and 3.54 cm<sup>2</sup>. The velocity profiles of our computational model are determined from an average of 15 runs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Center-out reaching.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Hand paths adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beer et al., 2000</xref> (<bold>A</bold>) compared to hand paths produced by our computational model (<bold>B</bold>) during a center-out fast reaching task with targets placed 150 mm away from the center position.

However, the relative MDs (i.e., how the duration varies with the index of difficulty) in our model and the experimental data are still in close agreement. For example, the mean relative MD difference between an index of difficulty of 1.5 and 3.5 is about 1 s in both our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We performed an additional experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) to show that Fitts’ law emerges even without this term in the cost function.

Fitts’ law formalizes the notion that movement time is a function of both the distance to a target and the size of that target. Taken together with a widely held theory initially proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris and Wolpert, 1998</xref>, Fitts’ law is thought to arise from the fact that signal-dependent noise governs a person’s ability to move with greater accuracy toward smaller targets by reducing movement speed. Signal-dependent noise or ‘motor noise’ has been shown across a variety of experiments, where noise scales in proportion to the size of the motor command being generated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matthews, 1996</xref>). Thus, to a first-order approximation, signal-dependent noise is a sufficient theory to explain Fitts’ law. Here, we re-examine the assumption that Fitts’ law emerges primarily as a <italic>consequence</italic> of signal-dependent noise.</p><p>We develop a computational model of three-dimensional upper extremity movements that is more biomechanically realistic than previous work. Our model replicates kinematic features reported across several motor control studies. When solving the optimal control problem, we find that some of our simulations reproduce the empirical observation that arm movement paths are nearly straight and gently curved near the targets for fast reaches. The corresponding velocity profiles are bell-shaped and have a secondary, smaller peak near the target. These features are usually interpreted as discrete, open-loop corrections to acquire the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doeringer and Hogan, 1998</xref>). While our results are consistent with this interpretation, our analyses also show that these features are present in some local minima when solving the optimal control problem. Out of 20 trials during a reaching task, we consistently note that the second or third best solution (measured with respect to the cost; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 1</xref>) has these features, while the best solution consists of a nearly straight trajectory. The curve and the secondary velocity peak at the end of the movement are a consequence of the hand reaching the target with a high velocity; the final, gentle curve, brings the hand velocity toward zero, minimizes ‘effort’, and keeps the hand inside the target.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bullock and Grossberg, 1988</xref> proposed that the speed-dependent asymmetry in the velocity profile arises due to neural dynamics and that models based on optimal control always predict symmetric velocity profiles. Our work demonstrates that asymmetric velocity profiles in reaching movements arise from optimal control methods with realistic biomechanical models, without relying on other modeling assumptions such as time-varying jerk constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagasaki, 1989</xref>). This feature did not emerge in earlier work using simplified biomechanical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guigon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris and Wolpert, 1998</xref>). The upper extremity must decelerate when approaching the target to achieve zero velocity. The elbow flexors undergoing an eccentric contraction have a larger force generating capacity at higher speeds due to the force–velocity relationship of muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Millard et al., 2013</xref>). Our hypothesis is that this explains why faster movements have a later peak velocity. We have verified that this property does not arise in a torque-driven model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which supports the hypothesis.</p><p>Reaching involves feedback control, which we did not explicitly model as this is outside the scope of our study (we are not aware of any validated feedback models on realistic upper-extremity musculoskeletal models in the literature). We do not expect that explicitly modeling feedback would influence the results. Feedback would ensure that the hand successfully reaches the target in the presence of noise, but planning variability would still impact the MD.</p><p>During motor learning, there is a shift in performance that allows movements to be performed faster and more accurately. Previous studies hypothesize that this shift in performance is a result of improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., the ability to use large control signals without large motor noise). This is perhaps possible due to expanded neural representations and/or the fine-tuning of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krakauer and Mazzoni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shmuelof et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, there is evidence of an improved signal-to-noise ratio during motor skill learning in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kargo and Nitz, 2004</xref>), but their mechanism proposes a reduction in signal-independent noise and pre-burst firing rates. If signal-dependent motor noise alone accounts for the speed-accuracy tradeoff, the mechanism that explains the shift in performance due to practice is not yet fully understood. Our analyses reveal that more stringent task constraints reduce the space of possible control solutions, thereby removing effective solutions from the search landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The controller (i.e., the central nervous system) is unable to find the global optimum solution for every task. Thus, for challenging tasks, the patterns of neural activity found during initial optimization (i.e., learning) correspond to ineffective solutions, leading to suboptimal behavior, e.g., reaching slower to smaller targets, consistent with Fitts’ law. Learning can force the motor system to explore different solutions, and if better ones are found, the internal models are updated accordingly resulting in behavioral improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haith and Krakauer, 2018</xref>). Hence, our theory does not rely on assumptions regarding improvements in signal-to-noise ratio to explain the shift in performance with practice. A testable prediction of our theory is that the neural variability during motor planning should progressively decrease as the shift in performance occurs during practice (and as the central nervous system converges to better motor plans).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Optimization landscape.</title><p>Cartoon of how different motor plans can generate movements (i.e., driven by muscle excitation patterns) with different durations. The blue and red circles are examples of control solutions for the large and small targets, respectively. The dashed lines illustrate the constraints in the optimization landscape for the smaller target. From the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, for reaches to a small target (red), movement planning variability decreases (x-axis), but movement duration (MD) variability increases (y-axis). For reaches to a larger target (blue), movement planning variability increases, but MD variability decreases. According to our theory, reaches to larger targets are faster because of the presence of good control solutions in the optimization landscape. We empirically observe that these good solutions have MDs that are only slightly larger than the global minimum solution (i.e., the fastest reach to the target). A bad control solution corresponds to a significantly slower reach. On average, reaches to the small target are slower because tighter constraints remove good solutions from the optimization landscape, which is otherwise identical to the landscape for the large target. While this decreases motor planning variability, it increases MD variability. In stochastic optimization, it is empirically found that having a large number of good local minima helps avoid bad local minima (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodfellow et al., 2016</xref>, Chapter 8).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57021-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>While our theory does not account for signal-dependent noise, the broader mechanism for motor control likely engages both the mechanism proposed here and certain aspects of signal-dependent noise. We exclude signal-dependent noise in our model to demonstrate that it is not necessary to explain the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Adding signal-dependent noise with the same cost function and optimization procedure (that includes motor planning variability) would also yield Fitts’ law-like solutions, but the signal-to-noise ratio would limit how fast the reach to the target can be achieved. One difficulty with modeling signal-dependent noise is that there is very little experimental data on the signal-to-noise ratio and how it changes with practice – if it changes at all. Future work exploring tasks where subjects learn a task across sessions could be quite useful in making more progress toward answering this question. We posit that a realistic biomechanical model, as described here, allows for more accurate estimation of the optimization landscape (i.e., how the local optima are situated with respect to the control solutions). This explains why the realistic biomechanical model produces results that are strongly correlated with prior experimental findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldberg et al., 2014</xref>), while all of our simplified models (which includes the torque-driven, fewer muscles, unrealistic force-length relationships, and unrealistic cost function models) are not statistically correlated with prior experimental findings since they are more likely to synthesize unrealistic movements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments show that Fitts’ law emerges both with a standard and a less effective optimizer. This follows from the fact that for an optimizer with a given performance (i.e., measured by the number of samples and trials that it can explore), imposing progressively more stringent accuracy constraints removes good solutions from the optimization landscape, resulting in performance degradation and thus yielding Fitts’ law. Interesting questions for future work include finding the number of samples and trials in our stochastic optimizer and exploring other forms of stochastic optimization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lillicrap et al., 2015</xref>) that yields solutions that best match the experimental data on the speed-accuracy tradeoff. A theory based purely on signal-dependent motor noise does not predict that more severe accuracy constraints cause more MD variability, as seen in the experimental data. From this perspective, our theory provides a more complete account of the speed-accuracy tradeoff.</p><p>If our theory is correct, then the muscle excitations, activations, and joint kinematics predicted for an ineffective solution should be consistent with what is empirically observed in naïve or ‘non-expert’ human participants. At the same time, our theory predicts that an effective solution would result in muscle patterns that are consistent with empirical observations of highly trained or ‘experts’ performing the task. Future studies can perform this stringent test of our theory by utilizing our modeling framework to find the control solutions for some subset of challenging tasks and compare them against muscle activity measured in a laboratory setting.</p><p>In addition to planning variability, limb dynamics play a role in the speed-accuracy tradeoff: one reason why the movement to a smaller target is slower than a larger target with the same center is that a longer distance is required to reach the smaller target; hence, the larger target contains both a larger set of feasible solutions and more effective solutions. The differences in durations between the fastest trials to the smallest and largest targets provide an indicator of the role of limb dynamics in the speed-accuracy tradeoff. The fastest trial approaches the limit of what is dynamically feasible given enough trials. In our computational experiments, this difference amounts to 0.04 s. The average difference from the experimental data is also 0.04 ± 0.03 s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The difference between the mean durations to the two targets minus the difference between the fastest reaches (65% of the total difference in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) is attributable to motor planning variability (as we have excluded the roles of limb dynamics and execution noise), which is the dominant factor behind the speed-accuracy tradeoff in our results. The proportions would likely be reversed if the target sizes were drastically different (e.g., comparing targets that were an order of magnitude apart in size).</p><p>Our analysis does not preclude the possibility that signal-dependent noise is a factor in the speed-accuracy tradeoff in addition to limb dynamics and planning variability, but it shows that it is not a necessary condition and may not be the dominant factor as previously thought. The data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> also shows that the subjects that achieved the smallest difference in durations between the two targets on their best trials also had the largest variability (see subjects 1, 2, and 3). We hypothesize that this variability could be attributed to exploration, which allows for finding better control solutions, consistent with the experimental data. This is also consistent with recent findings that learning is associated with increases in task-relevant variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Turning our attention to neural mechanisms underlying motor cortical function, a current theory suggests that movement period neural activity evolves from an initial condition (termed the neural population preparatory state) set in premotor and primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shenoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vyas et al., 2020a</xref>). Different movements have different initial conditions and generating initial conditions closer to the optimal initial condition results in behavioral benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, trial-by-trial behavior variability is strongly linked to neural variability during motor preparation, even for highly practiced movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchland et al., 2006a</xref>), and motor learning is strongly linked with systematic changes to neural activity during motor preparation, where neural activity during motor preparation plays a causal role in error-driven learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vyas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vyas et al., 2020b</xref>). Given these findings, we introduce a computational model with planning variability and demonstrate its ability to accurately recapitulate many previous results and phenomenon, including Fitts’ law, which suggests a potential role in the speed-accuracy tradeoff. If movement planning variability is a dominant factor underlying the speed-accuracy tradeoff, then the proportion of MD variability explained by preparatory variability should increase with reaches to smaller targets (otherwise motor planning does not contribute to the speed-accuracy tradeoff). We have experimentally verified this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Our results show that nearly 60% of the MD variability is attributed to planning variability when reaching to the smaller target (and that the MD standard deviation is large relative to the mean with a coefficient of variation of 0.4). When combined with the observation that MD variability increases for smaller targets, this indicates that motor planning variability impacts the scalar parameters found in Fitts’ law (see the section Introduction). Our experiments here further show that reaches to smaller targets are slower and less variable in preparatory activity than reaches to larger targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), while the MDs are more variable in smaller targets than in larger targets. If the speed-accuracy tradeoff was solely caused by execution noise, then we would expect MD variability to decrease when planning variability decreases. These results, however, are consistent with our theory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which suggests that some of the effective control solutions (i.e., motor plans for fast reaches) have to be discarded when reaching to smaller targets (i.e., variability in preparatory activity decreases, while MD variability increases). We can estimate the relative contribution of planning variability to the speed-accuracy tradeoff as follows. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the mean difference in the MD to the large and small target is 200 ms, and the standard deviation of the MD to the small target is 258 ms. Given that planning variability explains 60% of the MD variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and if we assume a normal distribution around the mean MD, then motor planning can cause the movement to the small target to be 155 ms faster (i.e., one standard deviation from the mean). This suggests that planning variability can account for more than 75% of the MD difference when reaching to the large and small target (i.e., 0.6 × 258/200). We note that this is an initial <italic>theory</italic>, and future studies will need to evaluate its range of applications under additional experimental conditions.</p><p>Our results here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and those by Churchland and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchland et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchland et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Churchland et al., 2006c</xref>), point to preparatory activity as also being a central source of movement variability, rather than execution noise alone being the key factor. Our work presumes that the movement variability resulting from motor planning variability can be modeled with the solutions found from stochastic optimization (but we do not claim that a stochastic optimization is actually being literally performed by the brain during motor planning). In other words, during stochastic optimization, many possible candidate motor plans will be explored before converging to a particular motor plan. Our account of Fitts’ law does not depend on the optimization time or of the candidate motor plans explored before convergence. Rather, our results show that, at convergence (i.e., the solutions from stochastic optimization), when reaching to smaller targets, the motor plans tend to be less effective (i.e., slower reaches) because of task constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). When comparing the reaches to a large and a small target, we have empirically verified that the reaches to the large target that also do not reach the small target are on average faster than the reaches to the small target. Our computational model implements motor planning stochasticity with covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), which operates by applying Gaussian noise on an initial motor plan. It is unknown how motor planning stochasticity arises at the individual neural and neural population level, but it could be as simple as noise on an initial motor plan (e.g., due to variability in the inputs from other brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vyas et al., 2020b</xref>]). We have approximated the trial-to-trial variability in the preparatory state in our model via sampling from a Gaussian distribution. Although we cannot describe the exact neurophysiological mechanism during preparation that produces differential effects on variability when reaching to targets of different size, our contribution lies in discovering this relationship. In summary, we know from neurophysiological findings that a large proportion of the behavioral variability occurring in highly practiced tasks can be attributed to motor planning variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Churchland et al., 2006a</xref>). When implementing planning variability in a computational model, we obtain MDs that are consistent with Fitts' law and experimental findings on MD variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This indicates a potential role for planning variability in giving rise to the speed-accuracy tradeoff, which is supported by further neurophysiological evidence introduced here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note a few important caveats and considerations regarding our theory. First, we do not have causal evidence linking neural variability during preparation and Fitts’ law (although we have a causal link between variability during preparation and Fitts’ law in our computational model). Second, we cannot assert that stochasticity in the model’s motor plan is a perfect proxy for variance in the motor cortical preparatory state, but our working hypothesis is that there is enough alignment for our theory to hold given that our simulations match well with experimental data (see the section Speed-accuracy tradeoff and Fitts’ law); future work will need to be done to explore the extent of this alignment. Finally, while the preparatory state does not encode the whole reach trajectory (as the model’s motor plan does), it does encode important parameters of the upcoming reach, such as distance, direction, and speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Messier and Kalaska, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Churchland et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Even-Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vyas et al., 2020a</xref>). One tantalizing interpretation of our results is that Fitts’ law is tightly linked to movement planning (which includes many of the aspects of the preparatory activity analyzed here) and not just movement execution. The difficulty associated with finding optimal solutions for challenging tasks could then be akin to finding the optimal preparatory neural states (as well as learning the appropriate movement period dynamics), where task constraints govern the optimization landscape, as suggested by our theory. This provides a concrete avenue for future studies to further investigate the relative contribution of signal-dependent noise and motor planning in giving rise to the speed-accuracy tradeoff.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Modeling and simulation</title><p>Our computational model uses the upper extremity biomechanical model introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saul et al., 2015</xref> and available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://simtk.org/projects/upexdyn">https://simtk.org/projects/upexdyn</ext-link>.

We perform the trajectory optimization with a fixed temporal horizon and the MD is determined when the hand position is within the target. We performed experiments to verify that prescribing the muscle excitations at every 0.05 s interval (instead of 0.1 s interval) does not have a significant impact on the computed MDs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haith et al., 2012</xref> argue that a hyperbolic cost of time objective term better accounts for the durations of saccades, but this remains a topic of investigation for other body movements. After setting the duration of the movement T for the integration, the number of time steps N in the trajectory is chosen to achieve the desired accuracy in Simbody. For the experiments with our torque-driven model, we optimize for the torques, which we limit to ±50 nm, instead of muscle excitations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Joint kinematics data</title><p>To validate our computational model, we collected three-dimensional upper extremity movement data. Right-handed subjects (n = 4, age = 27 ± 3, mean ± std, two males, two females) gave written informed consent approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board. The subjects are asked to reach for desired final end poses (e.g., with shoulder abduction 90°, shoulder flexion 90° and 180°, etc.) from different initial positions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, we show an example of an initial (A) and final position (B).

The subjects performed reaches to a target, always starting from the same initial pose with the hand on the table. Subjects were instructed to reach the target as fast as possible. The duration of the reach is measured from an accelerometer attached on their hand (Xsens MTw Awinda with a 1000 Hz sampling frequency). Subjects performed 10 reaches to a large square target (8 cm width) and to a small one (2 cm width). The movement amplitude was set to 15 cm.

The monkey performed an instructed-delay cursor task (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vyas et al., 2018</xref> for the task design and standard parameters). The monkey had two chronic 96-electrode arrays (1 mm electrodes, 1.0 mm long, spaced 400 µm apart, Blackrock Microsystems Inc, Salt Lake City, UT), one implanted in PMd and one implanted in gyral M1. The arrays were implanted 7 years prior to these experiments. Voltage signals were band-pass filtered from each electrode channel (250 Hz to 7.5 KHz). The signals were processed to detect multi-unit ‘threshold crossing’ spikes. Spikes were detected any time the voltage crossed below a threshold of −4.5 times the root-mean-square voltage.</p><p>The standard methods for an instructed-delay reaching task, including the reward structure, arm-tracking system, inter-trial-intervals, etc. have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vyas et al., 2018</xref>). The 40 targets that the animals made reaches to were arranged in ‘+’ configuration; however, only one target (chosen pseudo-randomly) was presented during each trial. The target presentations were chosen to ensure that the animal could not predict the next target and that the animal made an equal number of reaches to each target. For each of the 40 targets, two conditions were presented in a block-wise format. In one condition (block) the target had an acceptance window of size 2 cm (cyan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and in the other the acceptance window was of size 0.75 cm (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). That is to say, the animal had to bring the cursor he was controlling within the acceptance window and hold it there for 500 ms in order for the trial to succeed and for him to receive his liquid reward. A trial was failed if (1) the animal did not complete the trial in the allotted time (maximum of 2 s), (2) the animal did not hold the cursor in the center for the allotted period of time, or (3) the animal failed to initiate the trial within 500 ms. Each block contained 400 trials (10 trials per condition) and each experimental session contained about 10 blocks, 5 of each condition.</p><p>The analysis presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> was performed following the standard methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vyas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Even-Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vyas et al., 2020b</xref>.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The present paper presents a novel theory for the origin of Fitts' Law, that is, the speed-accuracy trade-off observed across movement tasks. The most prominent current theory suggests that the speed-accuracy tradeoff emerges due to the optimization of movements in the face of signal-dependent noise. The authors suggest that, under a physiologically realistic simulation of the arm, motor planning in the absence of motor noise can also give rise the speed-accuracy trade-off. The simulation predictions are coupled with behavioral data from a straightforward human reaching experiment and the simulations are linked to a potential underlying neural mechanism via single-units recordings obtained from a macaque monkey doing a similar reaching task.</p><p>All three reviewers thought that this is an interesting and provocative study that may provide an important new perspective on the origins of Fitts' Law, the implications of which would be very broad. However, all three reviewers converged on a set of common concerns about the current version of the paper that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the reviewers raised substantial concerns about how the authors handle physiological noise in their simulations. There were two related issues.</p><p>a) In the present version of the model, muscle activation terms are squared and the authors suggest that this serves as an approximation of metabolic power consumption. The reviewers raised the point that, in other contexts, minimizing squared muscle activations has been interpreted as minimizing motor noise (i.e. acts like the kind of signal-dependent noise term). It is important that the authors clarify how this term influences the ability to make a clean separation between the hypotheses being tested.</p><p>b) Physiological noise is an established phenomenon that is not included in the present model. The reviewers understand why the authors chose this route (both conceptually and practically) but thought it would be important to show what happens when physiological noise is included. In this case, would the same optimization procedure with the same cost function converge similarly on a Fitts law-like solution? How would the optimized control signals in this case differ from the ones they found presently?</p><p>2) All the reviewers raised the substantial concern that the present work does not establish a meaningful link between the optimal control model being proposed – and its reasons for showing Fitts' Law – and a sensible neurophysiological analog. That is, what neurally feasible computational mechanism occurs during movement preparation that produces greater variability for small targets. Given the present model algorithm does not seem feasible, what to the authors have in mind? At the very least, the authors need to provide more complete discussion about how their algorithm relates or does not relate to neurophysiological mechanisms.</p><p>3) The authors claim that a major factor that allows them to better investigate the origins of Fitt's Law is their physiologically realistic model of the upper limb. However the authors do not make any attempts to investigate which aspects of the model specifically are responsible, either alone, or in combination, for the observed effects. An analysis of the sort described by Lillicrap and Scott (2013, Neuron) would seem helpful here.</p><p>4) The description of the approach lacks important details. CMA-ES with a population size of 20 was used but it is not clear what parameter settings are used for sampling and how these settings influence the results. The authors refer to the solutions of the CMA-ES algorithm as local optima but this may not be mathematically correct as the number of iterations was predefined and optimality criteria were not evaluated. Also, it seems that the target was not successfully reached in all trials. For example in Figure 1B, the most rightward target is not reached. Finally, muscle excitations are prescribed every 100 ms only. This limits the set of feasible solutions. Would the results be different when increasing the number of controls (which might be more realistic physiologically)?</p><p>5) Methods related to the NHP work are lacking. In Figure 4, the authors talk about not using spike sorting and just using threshold crossings. Why? What are the implications of this approach. In general, methods associated with the monkey data are not described in the Materials and methods section. This needs substantial work to be acceptable.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;High-fidelity musculoskeletal modeling reveals a motor planning contribution to the speed-accuracy tradeoff&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Andrew Pruszynski as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Friedl de Groote (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers all thought that you did a very good job addressing their concerns and remain very enthusiastic about your work. There are however two important issues that remain outstanding, which the reviewers all believe need addressing to ensure the paper provides the advance it hopes to provide.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Previous concern #3 was not addressed and is seen by all reviewers as being very important for interpreting the findings. Specifically, the comparison is still limited to the torque-driven model and the fully complex model. The reviewers believe that it would be feasible to follow the approach of Lillicrap and Scott (2003) to assess which aspects of the model are responsible for the observed effect and that the insights gained from such assessment would be very valuable.</p><p>2) There remains a disconnect between the results of the modeling exercise and the neurophysiological data - a gap that one might expect to be bridged by a theory or model, which is still absent. In the simulations, the model behaves according to Fitt's Law because built into the model is a sort of explicit &quot;search&quot; within a subspace, a search that takes time. In the model this search happens pre-movement during what the authors call a movement planning epoch. The neural data are centered around a pre-movement time epoch as well, but clearly the brain is not literally executing an algorithmic &quot;search&quot; during this time. The reviewers all believe that, for this paper to have the desired impact, more discussion is needed to bridge the gap between the model and the nervous system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57021.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the reviewers raised substantial concerns about how the authors handle physiological noise in their simulations.

Our cost function detailed in Equation 1, includes the sum of muscle activations squared. Including this term impacts the speed of a synthesized reaching movement to a target, but it does not explain the empirical observation that movements are slower to smaller targets. Simply adding the muscle activations term (without signal-dependent noise or motor planning variability) would predict the same movement duration for a large and a small target for the same reach distance (i.e., if the smaller target is placed at the edge of the larger target). Yet, Fitts’ law predicts slower movements to smaller targets. We verify these considerations by performing additional experiments to show that Fitts’ law emerges even without the muscle activations term (setting <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> to 0 in Equation 1; see subsection “Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff and Fitts’ law”). We found that the model’s mean predictions are in close agreement with Fitts’ law (R2 = 0.955). We added the figure in the manuscript as (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><p>“Our cost function (Equation 1) includes a term to minimize the sum of muscle activations squared, which impacts the speed of reaching movements (but unlike signal-dependent noise, it does not predict different speeds based on target size).

The signal-to-noise ratio in the signal-dependent noise would limit how fast the reach to the target can be achieved. Hence, the signal-dependent noise would simply increase the movement duration, but the resulting curves would still be in agreement with Fitts’ law. Motor planning variability would still cause the movement duration variability to increase for smaller targets. Improvements that occur with practice could be explained either by improvements in the signal-to-noise ratio (which is not yet demonstrated experimentally), improvements in the motor plan itself (which has been demonstrated experimentally), or a combination of the two.</p><p>Adding signal-dependent noise would cause the optimized control signals to be smaller when reaching to the smaller target, but not to the larger target. This readily illustrates the difference between signal-dependent noise and the muscle activations term discussed in 1.a (which impacts the movements to both the smaller and larger targets). Adding signal-dependent noise alone without motor planning variability would not explain the behavior shown in Figure 3C or the neural data shown in Figure 4D-E.</p><p>“We exclude signal-dependent noise in our model to demonstrate that it is not necessary to explain the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Adding signal-dependent noise with the same cost function and optimization procedure (that includes motor planning variability) would also yield Fitts’ law-like solutions, but the signal-to-noise ratio would limit how fast the reach to the target can be achieved. One difficulty with modeling signal-dependent noise is that there is very little experimental data on the signal-to-noise ratio and how it changes with practice — if it changes at all. Future work exploring tasks where subjects learn a task across sessions could be quite useful in making more progress towards answering this question.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All the reviewers raised the substantial concern that the present work does not establish a meaningful link between the optimal control model being proposed – and its reasons for showing Fitts' Law – and a sensible neurophysiological analog. That is, what neurally feasible computational mechanism occurs during movement preparation that produces greater variability for small targets. Given the present model algorithm does not seem feasible, what to the authors have in mind? At the very least, the authors need to provide more complete discussion about how their algorithm relates or does not relate to neurophysiological mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting that our manuscript did not address these questions. First, prior to this study, there was little evidence to suggest any relationship between Fitts’ law and the preparatory state in motor cortex. We have now presented, to our knowledge, the first empirical evidence that such a relationship exits. That is, reaching to smaller targets exhibit less variability in the distribution of preparatory states in premotor cortex (Figure 4D); at the same time, for smaller targets a larger fraction (and the majority) of the trial-by-trial variability is explained by variability in the preparatory state (compared to larger targets; Figure 4E). Thus Fitts’ law is not entirely a result of signal-dependent noise, but also a function of neural variability during motor preparation. This is a new neurophysiological finding, which forms the basis of our proposed theory (see next paragraph).</p><p>We attempt to further investigate variability during preparation by engaging a computational model that by virtue of stochasticity during motor planning yields movement durations consistent with Fitts’ law. In particular, the model implements motor planning stochasticity with CMA-ES, which operates by applying gaussian noise on an initial motor plan.</p><p>We recognize this is not the source of neural variability during preparation in (monkey) motor cortex, but it could be as simple as noise on an initial motor plan (e.g., due to variability in the inputs from other brain regions [Vyas et al., 2020b]). We have approximated the trial-to-trial variability in the preparatory state in our model via sampling from a gaussian distribution. Although we cannot describe the exact neurophysiological mechanism during preparation that produces differential variability when reaching to smaller vs larger targets, our contribution lies in <italic>discovering</italic> this relationship. Furthermore, the motor plan in the model is not exactly the same as the preparatory state in premotor and primary motor cortex; they are related, but the plan encodes the full trajectory, whereas the preparatory state encodes a subset of the parameters of the upcoming movement (e.g., Messier and Kalaska, 2000; Even-Chen et al., 2019).</p><p>We also cannot assert that stochasticity in the model’s motor plan is a perfect proxy for variance in the motor cortical preparatory state, but our working hypothesis is that there is enough alignment for our theory to hold given that our simulations match well with experimental data (see subsection “Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff and Fitts’ law”); future work will need to be done to explore the extent of this alignment.</p><p>With these caveats and model assumptions in mind, the key theory being put forward here is that variability in the motor plan yields multiple candidate control solutions (Figure 5). There is less variability (Figure 4D) and fewer effective solutions when reaching to smaller targets, which yields, on average, slower reaches (see Figure 5 caption for a more thorough account of why this holds). We do not have causal evidence linking neural variability during preparation and Fitts’ law (although we have a causal link between variability during preparation and Fitts’ law in our computational model). These are important caveats and considerations regarding our theory, and we apologize for not including them in the previous version of our manuscript; this has now been addressed in the main text (as shown below).</p><p>“Our results here (Figure 4D), and those by Churchland and colleagues (Churchland et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2006c), point to preparatory activity as also being a central source of movement variability, rather than execution noise alone being the key factor. […] This provides a concrete avenue for future studies to further investigate the relative contribution of signal-dependent noise and motor planning in giving rise to the speed-accuracy tradeoff.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors claim that a major factor that allows them to better investigate the origins of Fitt's Law is their physiologically realistic model of the upper limb. However the authors do not make any attempts to investigate which aspects of the model specifically are responsible, either alone, or in combination, for the observed effects. An analysis of the sort described by Lillicrap and Scott (2013, Neuron) would seem helpful here.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for highlighting how we can improve our manuscript. We have revised the discussion to describe how a realistic musculoskeletal model allows us to better investigate the speed-accuracy tradeoff. We have shown that both a realistic musculoskeletal model and a torque-driven model produce mean movement durations that are consistent with Fitts’ law. The realistic model synthesizes movement duration means and standard deviations that are statistically correlated with experimental data (Figure 3A). The torque-driven model, however, synthesizes predicted means and standard deviations that are not statistically correlated with the experimental data. The reason is that a realistic biomechanical model allows us to more accurately estimate the optimization landscape involved in human reaching. A torque-driven model, on the other hand, can synthesize unrealistic movements (i.e., produce torques that would not have been produced by the muscles, either because it would not have been possible physiologically, or because it would have been ineffective with respect to the cost function Equation 1). More accurately estimating the optimization landscape allows us to reproduce the increase in the movement duration variability that occurs when reaching for smaller targets (Figure 3C), which we did not reproduce in our torque-driven model (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Lastly, a torque-driven or realistic musculoskeletal model with signal-dependent noise and no planning variability produces results consistent with Fitts’ law but does not make any prediction on how movement duration variability changes with the index of difficulty. We have included a table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref>) to summarize our results.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Model Parameters.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Fitts’ Law</th><th>Behavior Results Correlated with Experimental Data (movement duration means and standard deviations)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Torque or Musculoskeletal Model with Signal-Dependent Noise and without Planning Variability</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Torque Model with Planning Variability</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Musculoskeletal Model with Planning Variability</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>“We posit that a realistic biomechanical model, as described here, allows for more accurate estimation of the optimization landscape (i.e., how the local optima are situated with respect to the control solutions).

CMA-ES with a population size of 20 was used but it is not clear what parameter settings are used for sampling and how these settings influence the results. The authors refer to the solutions of the CMA-ES algorithm as local optima but this may not be mathematically correct as the number of iterations was predefined and optimality criteria were not evaluated. Also, it seems that the target was not successfully reached in all trials. For example in Figure 1B, the most rightward target is not reached. Finally, muscle excitations are prescribed every 100 ms only. This limits the set of feasible solutions. Would the results be different when increasing the number of controls (which might be more realistic physiologically)?</p></disp-quote><p>a) The reviewer is correct that the solutions of CMA-ES may not be local optima, and we revised the terminology in the paper to refer to effective/ineffective “control solutions”. We have also revised the manuscript to include the details requested by the reviewers, including all the parameters in CMA-ES. Our optimization does not require careful initialization: we set all the muscle excitations to 0.1 and all the standard deviations in the normal distribution to 0.3. We performed the following additional experiment to empirically verify that the optimization converges to similar solutions when setting the muscle excitations to 0.3 and the standard deviations to 0.5. In an average of ten trials, the average movement duration difference between the two CMA-ES parameters were 0.03 s and 0.0005 s for the smallest and largest targets (i.e., small values compared to the predicted mean movement durations in Figure 3C). We also empirically found that the movement would not successfully reach the target if the standard deviations are set too low (e.g., 0.025) or too high (e.g., 1.5). This indicates that our results are not sensitive to small changes to the reported CMA-ES parameters. It might be desirable to choose thousands of different initializations to further test the sensitivity of the results to these parameters; unfortunately, this would take months of computer time on a substantial computer cluster and was infeasible.</p><p>b) We updated Figure 1B to show that the rightward target can be reached (we had incorrectly specified the target size in the earlier figure).</p><p>c) We have performed the following additional experiment to show that doubling the number of controls (prescribing muscle excitations every 50 ms) does not affect the results. We performed ten reaches to the smallest (index of difficulty: 4.41) and largest targets (index of difficulty: 0.9) and compare the movement durations differences when prescribing the controls every 100 ms and every 50 ms. The average movement duration difference to the smallest target is 0.01 s and 0.0009 s for the largest target, which indicates that increasing the number of controls would not change the results in the paper (i.e., these are small values compared to the predicted mean movement durations in Figure 3C of 0.28 s and 0.08 s for the smallest and largest targets, respectively). We also added a target in between the smallest and largest targets (with an index of difficulty of 2.5) and again only noted a small average movement duration difference of 0.016 s when prescribing the controls every 100 ms and every 50 ms.</p><p>We have included the data and code, to be shared openly and freely, for all of our original and additional experiments described here on the following web site which we maintain: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://simtk.org/projects/ue-reaching/">https://simtk.org/projects/ue-reaching/</ext-link>.</p><p>“We performed experiments to verify that prescribing the muscle excitations at every 0.05 s interval (instead of 0.1 s interval) do not have a significant impact on the computed movement durations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Methods related to the NHP work are lacking. In Figure 4, the authors talk about not using spike sorting and just using threshold crossings. Why? What are the implications of this approach. In general, methods associated with the monkey data are not described in the Materials and methods section. This needs substantial work to be acceptable.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of detailed methods for the NHP work. We relied too heavily on a previously published paper by one of the senior author’s group, but realize now that it is much better for this paper to be much more self-contained. Reproduced below are the new Methods for the NHP work. We have made clear when and where previously published techniques and experimental protocols were followed.</p><p>First, regarding spike sorting verses threshold crossings. In this work, we elected to use threshold crossings in lieu of spike sorting. That is, we do not assign individual spikes to individual neurons. Primarily, this allows us to consider all the data on the Utah electrode arrays, not just the well-isolated units. We (Trautmann et al., 2019) have recently established that there is a great deal of signal present on recording channels that do not contain well-isolated single units (i.e., so called “hash”). Thus, it is perhaps less biased to consider all the data that are available, rather than restrict the analysis to only well isolated single units. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewers that this approach could have undesirable implications. In particular, it is not fully known what effect threshold crossing have on the raw estimation of the captured variance; perhaps threshold crossings yield a <italic>more</italic> biased estimate of the variance. However, it is worth noting that spike sorting itself is riddled with inaccuracies, especially when cells do not present with prototypical waveforms. Spike sorting also often results in large inter- and intra-operator variability (Wood et al., 2004). Regardless, any mis-estimation of the variance due to threshold crossing is not an issue for the primary claims of this paper for three key reasons. First, multi-units will not artificially affect the captured variance preferentially for any one condition; if anything, potentially lower SNR will make the two conditions appear more similar. Second, Figure 4 shows that the fraction of the trial-by-trial variability explained by preparatory state variability (for the large target) is ~0.5. This is essentially identical to the results found by Churchland et al., 2006a, where spike sorting was performed. Finally, and perhaps more importantly, we are not interested in the absolute values of the captured variance. We are primarily interested in assessing if there is a significant difference between the small and large target conditions; note in 4D-E, we used normalized variance instead of absolute variance.</p><p>“Recordings were made from the dorsal aspect of the premotor cortex (PMd) and the primary motor cortex (M1) of one male adult monkey (Macaca mulatta) who was 15 years old and weighed 16 kg at the time of these experiments. […] The analysis presented in Figure 4D was performed following the standard methods described in (Vyas et al., 2018; Even-Chen et al., 2019; Vyas et al., 2020b).

Specifically, the comparison is still limited to the torque-driven model and the fully complex model. The reviewers believe that it would be feasible to follow the approach of Lillicrap and Scott (2003) to assess which aspects of the model are responsible for the observed effect and that the insights gained from such assessment would be very valuable.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for highlighting how we can improve our manuscript. We performed additional experiments and analyses to address this concern and identify which components of the model are responsible for the observed effects. Following the approach of Lillicrap and Scott (2003), we introduce six different models: a torque-driven model, a musculoskeletal model missing 14 important muscles (e.g., deltoid anterior, deltoid posterior, infraspinatus, teres minor, etc.), a musculoskeletal model with unrealistic muscle force-length relationships, a musculoskeletal model with an unrealistic cost function, a realistic musculoskeletal model with an effective optimizer, and a realistic musculoskeletal with a less effective optimizer. For each of these models, we tested whether the predicted movement durations are in agreement with Fitts’ law and experimental data. Our results indicate that all models produce movement durations in agreement with Fitts’ law, but only the realistic musculoskeletal models with the effective and less effective optimizers synthesized movement duration means and standard deviations that are statistically correlated with experimental data (Figure 3A).</p><p>Our hypothesis is that a realistic biomechanical model and a realistic cost function allows us to more accurately estimate the optimization landscape involved in human reaching. The other models tend to synthesize unrealistic movements (i.e., produce torques that would not have been produced by the muscles, either because it would not have been possible physiologically, or because it would have been ineffective with respect to the cost function Equation 1). More accurately estimating the optimization landscape allows us to reproduce the increase in the movement duration variability that occurs when reaching for smaller targets (Figure 3C), which we did not reproduce in our torque-driven model (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Thus, our work points to the importance of accurately modeling the optimization landscape, which includes at least the following components: the biomechanical model, the cost function and the optimization parameters. We note that our results on the speed-accuracy tradeoff are robust to the optimization parameters (both the effective and less effective optimizers are statistically correlated with experimental data). An open problem for future work would be investigate other optimization algorithms and parameters and determine which ones are most consistent with experimental data. Lastly, from the literature (e.g., Harris and Wolpert, 1998), we know that a torque-driven with signal-dependent noise and no planning variability produces results consistent with Fitts’ law but does not make any prediction on how movement duration variability changes with the index of difficulty.

In the simulations, the model behaves according to Fitt's Law because built into the model is a sort of explicit &quot;search&quot; within a subspace, a search that takes time. In the model this search happens pre-movement during what the authors call a movement planning epoch. The neural data are centered around a pre-movement time epoch as well, but clearly the brain is not literally executing an algorithmic &quot;search&quot; during this time. The reviewers all believe that, for this paper to have the desired impact, more discussion is needed to bridge the gap between the model and the nervous system.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for highlighting how we can improve the presentation and discussion of our theory. Our modeling exercise and the subsequent non-human primate experiments are suggestive of a new theory, one that hopefully will inspire much more future work on the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Our new proposal can be better understood if placed side-by-side with the prevailing theory (Harris and Wolpert, 1998).</p><p>Prevailing theory:</p><p>Harris and Wolpert suggest that on a trial where you reach to a small target, you need to modify your control signal to be smaller if you wish to minimize your variability in the endpoint position. This naturally slows down your reaches, thus yielding (some of) the empirical aspects of Fitts’ law. In this theory, if the neural control signal is corrupted by noise that scales with the size of the control signal, then in order to minimize endpoint variability, motor cortex issues commands with smaller overall mean to accomplish the task.</p><p>Our proposal:</p><p>At its core essence, our theory relies on motor planning variability and questions whether signal-dependent noise is the <italic>only</italic> factor that ultimately gives rise to Fitts’ law.</p><p>1) We start with previous findings by Churchland and colleagues that demonstrate that trial by-trial movement duration variability, even during highly practiced tasks, can be accounted for by motor planning (but more specifically preparatory) variability.</p><p>2) Given these findings, we introduce a computational model with planning variability and demonstrate its ability to accurately recapitulate many previous (and sometimes puzzling) results and phenomenon, including Fitts’ law. In our opinion, this alone is a non-trivial contribution.</p><p>a) We focus on the modeling assumption that the movement variability resulting from motor planning variability can be modeled with the solutions found from stochastic optimization (though note, we do not think that the brain literally performs a stochastic optimization during motor planning). Our model’s account of Fitts’ law does not rely on the optimization time or the explicit search before finding the motor plans. The optimization search will explore many possible motor plans before converging to a set of possible solutions. Our theory only relates to the final (converged) solutions. Our model needs to perform a search to converge to this set of possible solutions, but the central nervous system does not.</p><p>b) Our model shows that for more stringent task constraints, effective solutions are rendered inaccessible (Figure 5). When comparing the reaches to a large and a small target, we have empirically verified that the reaches to the large target that also do not reach the small target are on average faster than the reaches to the small target. This yields on average slower reaches to smaller targets. We hypothesize that this also occurs in the brain when reaching to targets of different sizes.</p><p>3) We test this hypothesis by analyzing motor cortical activity of monkey reaching movements. First, we replicate the findings by Churchland and colleagues 2006, and both extend them for harder tasks (i.e., reaching to smaller targets) and show that variability in the preparatory state in motor cortex is associated with some of the empirical aspects of Fitts’ law.</p><p>4) Having established that there is a relationship between movement duration variability and planning variability, let’s consider what happens when making reaches to a small target. Empirically, more (and the majority) of the trial-by-trial movement duration variability is accounted for by variability in the preparatory state (compared to a larger target). At the same time, there is less variability in the preparatory state in motor cortex and more movement duration variability. For reaches to a larger target, there is more variability in the preparatory state in motor cortex and less movement duration variability.</p><p>5) This new empirical evidence indicates that motor planning variability has a significant contribution to the speed-accuracy tradeoff and is consistent with our theory, which predicts that reaches to larger targets are on average faster because the brain has access to a larger set of effective motor plans compared to smaller targets.</p><p>When viewed in this manner, it is the combination of previous neurophysiology, new behavior and neurophysiology, and computational modeling that gives rise to this theory. Our proposal does not require signal-dependent noise. Our proposal explains many of the confusing looking responses seen in previous studies that signal-dependent noise cannot explain. Perhaps the reviewers would agree that this meets the bar for publication at this time. Indeed, significant future work will be needed to pin down an <italic>exact</italic> neurophysiological mechanism. To put it succinctly, we have proposed a new hypothesis, one that is very different from the prevailing theory, and our succinct hope is that future studies will either deepen or disprove our proposal.</p><p>We also added the following testable prediction of our theory. With practice, there’s a shift in in performance that allows movements to be performed faster and more accurately. Our theory predicts that the neural variability during motor planning should progressively decrease as the shift in performance occurs (and as the central nervous system converges to better motor plans).</p><p>We have revised the Discussion to clarify the presentation of our theory:</p><p>“Turning our attention to neural mechanisms underlying motor cortical function, a current theory suggests that movement period neural activity evolves from an initial condition (termed the neural population preparatory state) set in premotor and primary motor cortex (Shenoy et al., 2013, Vyas et al., 2020a).
