id="abs1"><title>Background:</title><p>Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP) is a severe and deadly adverse event following ERCP.

The PEP occurrence rate was 0% among low-risk patients (≤0 points), 5.5% among moderate-risk patients (1–3 points), and 20.2% among high-risk patients (4–7 points). In the validation cohort, the C statistic of the risk score model was 0.71 (95% CI 0.64–0.78), which was considered acceptable. The PEP risk classification (low, moderate, and high) was a significant predictive factor for PEP that was independent of intraprocedural PEP risk factors (precut sphincterotomy and inadvertent pancreatic duct cannulation) (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.8–6.3; p&lt;0.01).</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The PEP risk score allows an estimation of the risk of PEP prior to ERCP, regardless of whether the patient has undergone pancreatic duct procedures.

Among endoscopic procedures, ERCP-related procedures are relatively risky. The high-risk adverse events of ERCP include duodenal perforation and bleeding after endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). The rate of PEP occurrence is 3.1–13.0% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andriulli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freeman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glomsaker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katsinelos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kochar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loperfido et al., 1998</xref>). PEP can even become life-threatening. The fatality rate of PEP is 0.1–0.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andriulli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kochar et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the decision to perform ERCP should be made carefully, considering each patient’s risk factors for PEP.</p><p>To predict an individual patient’s PEP risk, six scoring systems have been devised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archibugi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiba et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiMagno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedland et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujita et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). The first risk scoring system for PEP occurrence was established in 2002. In that study, pain during the procedure, pancreatic duct cannulation, a history of PEP, and the number of cannulation attempts were identified as risk factors for PEP. After the first scoring system was reported, each new scoring system used risk factors that were extracted via multivariate analyses. These included various patient characteristics before ERCP and postprocedural risk factors. Postprocedural risk factors, such as precut sphincterotomy, procedure time, and difficult cannulation, have been proposed, but it is difficult to predict these risk factors and determine the PEP risk before ERCP. Thus, a new prediction scoring system for PEP before ERCP is desirable. If the risk of PEP can be predicted before ERCP, then the expert endoscopist can perform ERCP from the start, and high-PEP-risk procedures (e.g., precut sphincterotomy, multiple cannulation attempts, and inadvertent pancreatic duct cannulation) can be avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Testoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). If biliary cannulation without the use of at least one high-PEP-risk procedure is difficult, other treatments (e.g., percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage [PTBD] or endoscopic ultrasound [EUS]-guided biliary drainage [EUS-BD]) could be considered.</p><p>Therefore, we aimed to establish a PEP prediction model using only risk factors that can be gathered before ERCP. Our model was developed and validated with multicenter data from Japan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a multicenter retrospective study at six institutions in Japan. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Fukushima Medical University and that of each partner medical institution (number 2453). The analysis used anonymous clinical data obtained after all the participants agreed to treatment with written consent; thus, patients were not required to provide informed consent for the study. The details of the study can be found on the homepage of Fukushima Medical University.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Among 2176 patients who underwent ERCP between November 2020 and October 2022, 2074 were included in this study. The other 102 patients were excluded for the following reasons: history of choledochojejunostomy, acute pancreatitis, choledochoduodenal fistula, difficulty finding the Vater papilla, history of pancreatojejunostomy, or history of pancreatogastrostomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The predictive PEP score is not necessary for the excluded patients. The reasons were as follows. Biliary duct cannulation was not attempted in patients for whom it was difficult to identify the Vater papilla. The biliary tract was separated from the pancreas in patients with a history of choledochojejunostomy, pancreatojejunostomy, or pancreatogastrostomy. PEP risk was thought to be clearly low in these patients and patients who underwent bile duct cannulation via the choledochoduodenal fistula. PEP diagnosis is difficult in patients with acute pancreatitis, whose diagnosis is currently in progress.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flowchart of the inclusion criteria.</title><p>ERCP, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101604-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>We randomly sampled 50% of the patients as the development cohort and 50% as the validation cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the development cohort, we established a risk scoring system for predicting PEP before ERCP, which was named the support for PEP reduction model (SuPER model). The validation cohort was used to confirm the effectiveness of the scoring system. PEP diagnosis and severity were assessed according to Cotton’s criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cotton et al., 1991</xref>). Patients who experienced abdominal pain and had hyperamylasemia (more than three times the normal upper limit) at least 24 hr after ERCP were diagnosed with PEP. Mild PEP was defined as pancreatitis that required prolongation of the planned hospitalization by 2–3 days. Moderate PEP was defined as pancreatitis that required 4–10 days of hospitalization. Severe PEP was defined as pancreatitis that required more than 10 days of hospitalization or intervention or hemorrhagic pancreatitis, phlegmon, or pseudocysts.</p><p>To establish the risk score, the risk factors for PEP were investigated via data from the development cohort. To determine the PEP risk score, factors that might be associated with PEP occurrence were investigated. To predict the PEP risk score before ERCP, factors related to patient characteristics and previously scheduled procedures, as reported in the Japanese guidelines for acute pancreatitis and PEP, were selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Itoi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takada et al., 2022</xref>). The patients’ risk factors included age &lt;50 years, female sex, a history of pancreatitis, a history of PEP, a history of gastrectomy, pancreatic cancer, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), a native papilla of Vater, absence of chronic pancreatitis (CP), normal serum bilirubin (≤1.2 mg/dl), and periampullary diverticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freeman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujita et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujita et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). Pancreatic divisum was excluded from the patient risk factor list because pancreatic divisum was observed in only two patients. Pancreatic calcification and a diameter of the main pancreatic duct &gt;3 mm were considered to indicate CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beyer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sarner and Cotton, 1984</xref>). These imaging findings were confirmed by CT, MRI, and EUS before ERCP. The CT and MRI findings were reviewed by radiologists. IPMNs were diagnosed according to the results of CT, MRI, and EUS. As pre-ERCP prophylaxes for PEP, protease inhibitors (gabexate mesilate or nafamostat mesilate), intravenous hydration, and NSAID suppositories have been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujita et al., 2022</xref>). As planned procedure-related risk factors, EST, endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD), endoscopic papillary large balloon dilation (EPLBD) using a ≥12 mm balloon catheter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Itoi et al., 2018</xref>), biliary stone removal, ampullectomy, biliary stent material (plastic stent, self-expandable metallic stent [SEMS], or covered SEMS [CSEMS]), inside stent placement, and procedures on the pancreatic duct were evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freeman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harewood et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kato et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masci et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Testoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). A biliary stent above the Vater papilla was also assessed as a prophylactic measure against PEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishiwatari et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To demonstrate the independence of the established risk classification, the relationships between it and intraprocedural PEP risk factors (including precut sphincterotomy and inadvertent pancreatic duct cannulation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Testoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) were investigated. Because of the retrospective nature of the data, the exact number of cannulations and the number of cannulation attempts were not available. Therefore, multiple cannulation attempts and a prolonged cannulation time could not be investigated as intraprocedural PEP risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sample size</title><p>The primary aim of this study was to establish a PEP prediction model that could be used to calculate a risk score before ERCP. To construct a prediction model via logistic regression analysis, 10 events per explanatory variable were needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wynants et al., 2015</xref>). Seven variables were evaluated in the development cohort, so 70 PEP patients were included. Five variables were evaluated in the validation cohort, so 50 PEP patients were necessary. According to a previous systematic review, the rate of PEP occurrence was 9.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kochar et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, at least 722 and 521 patients were included in the development and validation cohorts, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In the development cohort, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for PEP. The factors that had a p-value&lt;0.10 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. To construct the scoring system for PEP risk, the factors with p&lt;0.10 in the multivariate analysis were ultimately included in the risk score model. The factors selected in the multivariate analysis were assigned points according to the regression coefficient (each variable’s risk points = the ratio of the variable’s regression coefficient/minimum regression coefficient). The sum of the assigned points was calculated for each patient, and the patients were classified into three groups (low risk, moderate risk, and high risk) according to the expected rate of PEP occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedland et al., 2002</xref>). The risk classification system (SuPER model) was also applied to the validation cohort.</p><p>With respect to both the development and validation cohorts, the effectiveness of the risk score model was evaluated as follows. The correlations between the risk score, risk classification, and PEP occurrence were evaluated via the Cochran–Armitage trend test. The predictive accuracy of the risk score was assessed via the C statistic. The goodness of fit of the model was evaluated via the Hosmer‒Lemeshow test. The independence of the established risk classification from the unexpected intraprocedural PEP risk factors was assessed via multivariate logistic regression analyses.</p><p>Patients with missing data for variables selected in the risk score model were removed from the final cohort.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using EZR version 1.62 (Saitama Medical Centre, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan) and SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).

On the other hand, precut sphincterotomy and inadvertent pancreatic duct cannulation were not significantly associated with the occurrence of PEP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this multicenter study, we aimed to establish a preprocedural PEP prediction model. As a result, we created a risk scoring system (the SuPER model) using five items that could be measured before performing ERCP. The term ‘pancreatic duct procedures’ was ‘planned pancreatic duct procedures’ in the model. When unintended pancreatic duct procedures are considered, we can calculate both the PEP risk score with pancreatic duct procedures and that without pancreatic duct procedures. With this score, PEP occurrence can be accurately predicted to some degree. Although the development cohort and validation cohort had significantly different patient characteristics and ERCP outcomes, the risk score was good in both cohorts. In addition, the established PEP risk classification was associated with PEP occurrence independent of unpredictable intraprocedural PEP risk procedures.</p><p>This risk scoring and classification of PEP have several advantages. First, the score is calculated using only five items, all of which can be easily assessed via medical interviews and imaging (e.g., CT). One scoring system included sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) as a test item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiMagno et al., 2013</xref>). The diagnosis of SOD requires sphincter of Oddi manometry and fulfillment of the criteria for biliary pain, but sphincter of Oddi manometry is not widely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cotton et al., 2016</xref>). The diagnostic criterion for biliary pain included 8 items, and that for SOD included 15 items. Among the items of the SuPER risk scoring system, pancreatic calcification was assigned –2 points. Its low weighting could be explained by the following. The international conceptual model of CP can be divided into four stages: acute pancreatitis–recurrent acute pancreatitis, early CP, established CP, and end-stage CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whitcomb et al., 2016</xref>). Established CP patients have already passed the acute pancreatitis–recurrent acute pancreatitis course, and pancreatic calcification has been reported in established CP patients. Acinar dysfunction has also been observed in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whitcomb et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, patients with pancreatic calcification may have a lower incidence of PEP.</p><p>Second, the SuPER risk score can be determined before the ERCP procedure, as the established risk classification was found to be the sole significant factor predicting the occurrence of PEP independent of intraprocedural PEP risk factors. As described in the Background section, precut sphincterotomy, multiple cannulation attempts, and a cannulation time greater than 10 min were identified as high-risk factors that cannot be accounted for prior to ERCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Testoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Although the established PEP risk classification was independent of the included intraprocedural risk factors (precut sphincterotomy and inadvertent pancreatic duct cannulation), detailed data on the number of cannulation attempts and the cannulation time were not available. Therefore, to avoid intraoperative procedures associated with a high risk of PEP occurrence, an expert endoscopist can initially perform ERCP for high-PEP-risk patients. In addition, PEP prophylaxis can be administered beforehand for high-PEP-risk patients. As effective prophylaxes for PEP, rectal non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and pancreatic stent placement have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akshintala et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elmunzer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koshitani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murray et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sperna Weiland et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sugimoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). In this report, rectal NSAID use was not identified as a significant factor preventing PEP. One reason for this is that in past reports describing the use of rectal NSAIDs to prevent PEP, patients at high risk for PEP were often treated. In contrast, this study included all patients who underwent ERCP. Another reason might be the difference in dose. 100 mg of rectal diclofenac have been used in most past reports, whereas the efficacy of low-dose rectal diclofenac (25–50 mg) for preventing PEP is under discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maeda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Okuno et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Otsuka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takaori et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tomoda et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, 12.5–50 mg of diclofenac was used. In Japan, the approved diclofenac dose covered by insurance is 50 mg or less, with the dose typically being lower for elderly patients. Therefore, diclofenac doses ranging from 12.5 to 50 mg were prescribed by the doctors depending on the age and size of the patients. Pancreatic stent placement itself is one of the procedures performed on the pancreatic duct and is a higher-risk procedure for PEP than endoscopic biliary procedures without an approach to the pancreatic duct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Moreover, pancreatic stent placement has become a prophylactic treatment for PEP in patients who have undergone pancreatography or wire placement to the pancreatic duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mazaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sugimoto et al., 2019</xref>). As described above, pancreatic stent placement was performed along with high-risk-PEP procedures (i.e., guidewire placement to the pancreatic duct or pancreatography); therefore, pancreatic stent placement was grouped with the other endoscopic retrograde pancreatography procedures as ‘procedures on the pancreatic duct’. In a recent randomized trial involving 1950 patients, the combination of rectal NSAIDs and prophylactic pancreatic stents was more effective for preventing PEP than NSAIDs alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elmunzer et al., 2024</xref>). For high-PEP-risk patients with high scores, the combination of prophylactic methods might be desirable.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the study was retrospective, and there were missing data. However, the results reported are trustworthy. The percentage of patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria was not greater than 5%, and the percentage of missing data was not greater than 1%. As described in the ‘Methods’ section, patients with missing data for the variables selected in the risk score model were removed from the final cohort. The reliability of the SuPER risk score model was also statistically confirmed. Second, some factors cannot be assessed before ERCP. Additional procedures can be conducted during ERCP, and unplanned pancreatography is often performed in patients who are scheduled for endoscopic cholangiography or biliary treatment. However, the established PEP risk classification was independent of the included intraprocedural risk factors. A planned procedure for accessing the pancreatic duct is listed in the SuPER risk model. Therefore, we can predict the SuPER risk score and classification of patients regardless of whether they have undergone pancreatic duct procedures. Third, this study was performed in a single country. In the future, prospective validation studies over wider geographical regions are needed.</p><p>In conclusion, a simple and useful PEP scoring system (SuPER model) with only five clinical items was developed in this multicenter study. This scoring system may aid in predicting and explaining PEP risk and in selecting appropriate prophylaxes for PEP and endoscopic pancreatobiliary procedures for each patient.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Fukushima Medical University (number 2453).

This study discusses a new preprocedural score for post-ERCP pancreatitis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for evaluating our manuscript and raising a strength of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Depending on this score that identifies low, moderate, and high-risk patients for post-pancreatitis, so from the start, experienced and well-trained endoscopists can do the procedure or can refer patients to tertiary hospitals or use interventional radiology or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for evaluating our manuscript and raising a strength of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The number of patients in this study is sufficient to analyze data correctly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for evaluating our manuscript and raising a strength of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) It is a single-country, retrospective study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. It’s exactly as you said. This is a limitation (Lines 326-327).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Many cases were excluded, so the score cannot be applied to those patients.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment. The predictive PEP score is not necessary for the excluded patients. The reasons were as follows. Biliary duct cannulation was not attempted in patients for whom it was difficult to identify the Vater papilla. The biliary tract was separated from the pancreas in patients with a past history of choledochojejunostomy, pancreatojejunostomy, or pancreatogastrostomy. PEP risk was thought to be low in these patients and patients who underwent bile duct cannulation via the choledochoduodenal fistula. PEP diagnosis is difficult in patients with acute pancreatitis, whose diagnosis is currently in progress. We added these explanations (Lines 98-106).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Many other studies, e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00464-021-08491-1">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00464-021-08491-1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36344369/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36344369/</ext-link>, that have been published before discussing the same issue, so what is the new with this score?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising the new reference written by Archibugi et al. in 2023. The novelty of our score is that it is calculated using the factors that are investigated before ERCP procedures. The study written by Archibugi et al. involved procedure time and cannulation attempts for PEP prediction. These two factors are unknown before ERCP procedures. Therefore, a preprocedural predictive risk model for PEP was not created before our study was performed. We added the content of the past study written by Archibugi and included the report as a reference (Lines 65-67, 73-74).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The discussion section needs reformulation to express the study's aim and results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment. I have rewritten the first paragraph of the discussion. In the paragraph, we showed that the study achieved the aim on the basis of the results (Lines 245-255).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Why did the authors select these items in their scoring system and did not add more variables?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment. We selected the items listed in the Japanese guidelines for acute pancreatitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis. We added this description (Lines 123-126). The original references of the guidelines were cited in the first draft version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Comment1. Please revise these documents: copyright, disclaimer, ethics approval, consent to participate, consent for publication, data and material availability, competing interests, funding, authors' contributions, and acknowledgments.</p></disp-quote><p>First, thank you for reviewing our manuscript. We have already described the required information in the “author information” section. The sentences containing this information were proofread in English.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Comment 1. It would be best if you did this study in a Prospective way for more validation.</p></disp-quote><p>First, thank you for reviewing our manuscript. We have revised our manuscript according to your comments. It’s exactly as you said. These points are limitations (Lines 312-318, lines 326-327). We hope that future validation studies over wider geographic regions will prove our opinions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2. The model name should be Acronyum (the first letter of the five items in the risk model).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment. Sorry, we could not create a memorable model name using the first letter of the five items.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3. You say that you include the pre-procedure criteria that predict PEP. You state one of the items, pancreatic duct procedure. Do you mean it is a history?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment. This means that the main purpose is the pancreatic duct. Therefore, the pancreatic duct procedure is listed as “planned pancreatic duct procedures” in Figure 2 (Lines 40-41, 231-234). When an unintended pancreatic duct procedure is performed, we can calculate the risk score by adding two points for “planned pancreatic duct procedures” (Lines 48-49, 247-250).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4. Regarding calcification, do you mean chronic pancreatitis? It needs more clarification regarding its degree.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment. We regard pancreatic calcification as a finding of chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic calcification was defined as the degree that was confirmed by imaging, such as CT, MRI, and EUS. These definitions have been written in the first draft version (Lines 134-137).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5. Why don't you include young age in the model? Your result found that age less than 50 is significantly associated with PEP.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment. We selected the PEP risk factors listed in the Japanese guidelines for acute pancreatitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis. Age less than 50 years was listed as a PEP risk factor in the Japanese guidelines for acute pancreatitis. We added this description (Lines 123-126).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6. There is an ancient reference, some of them in 1994,1996.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the old references. These references were written by Cotton et al. 1991, Freeman et al. 1996, and Loperfido et al. 1998. These are still important today. The diagnostic criteria for PEP were determined in the report written by Cotton et al., which is Cotton’s criteria. The other two references are representative reports that described risk factors for PEP, and these two reports were cited in the Japanese guidelines for pancreatitis written by Takada et al. 2022 (Lines 123-126).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7. In the introduction, you say that the first score includes one of the items for PEP pain during the procedure. It is a little bit strange.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. The first PEP risk score did not involve PEP pain but involved pain during the procedure (Line 68).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 8. We know that once ERCP is indicated, you justify the importance of the risk model, stating that if one or more risks are found, we can do EUS or PTD. It is not reasonable to abort the procedure in case of frequent pancreatic duct cannulation or cancel ERCP if pt has one or more risk factors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment. If ERCP is performed for high-risk patients, prophylaxes for PEP, such as procedures by experts, pancreatic stent placement, and NSAID suppository insertion, should be performed as much as possible (Lines 281-287, 308-311).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 9. Regarding ERCP pancreatitis criteria, does it include amylase 3t or lipase?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We used Cotton’s criteria for diagnosing PEP. Cotton’s criteria include hyperamylasemia (more than three times the normal upper limit) at least 24 hours after ERCP (114-116).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 10. It is well known that pr with functional biliary disorder has a high incidence of PEP; it doesn't need a manometer for diagnosis. It needs to be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Moreover, functional biliary disorders are difficult to diagnose before ERCP procedures (Lines 259-262). The factor that is not apparent before ERCP could not be included in the predictive PEP scoring system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 11: What is gabexare and nafamost.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, and sorry for our insufficient explanation. These compounds include gabexate masilate and nafamostat masilate, which are protease inhibitors. In some institutions, protease inhibitors are used as prophylaxis for PEP. We added “protease inhibitors” (Lines 138-139, Tables 1 and 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Comment 1. The sample size needs clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>First, thank you for reviewing our manuscript. The sample size has been included in the “Methods” section (Lines 157-165).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2. They need to be mentioned cause they depend on old references in discussion and background.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. The previous references were written by Cotton et al. 1991, Freeman et al. 1996, and Loperfido et al. 1998. These are still important today. The diagnostic criteria for PEP were determined in the report written by Cotton et al., which is Cotton’s criteria. The other two references are representative reports that described risk factors for PEP, and these two reports were cited in the Japanese guidelines for pancreatitis written by Takada et al. 2022 (Lines 122-126). In the background and discussion, we added new recent references and information related to the references (Lines 65-67, 285-287, 291-295, 308-311).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3. Case definition should be added to the methodology.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We added patient information. Please refer to the response against the eLife assessment, weakness, (2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4. Do you include all who met the inclusion criteria, or was there any random sampling technique?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we did not use random sampling techniques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5. What is the value of comparing the development and validation groups? I do not think it adds anything new as if you want to exclude confounders. Has the comparison revealed that a confounder does exist? What was your point of view concerning that?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment, and sorry for the insufficient explanation. The differences between the development cohort and the validation cohort are important because the goodness of fit for the score could be confirmed in significantly different groups. We added this explanation (Lines 197-199, 251-253).</p></body></sub-article></article>
