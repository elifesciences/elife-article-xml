is a cellular mechanism of learning and memory storage. Studies have demonstrated a requirement for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in L-LTP produced by a diversity of temporal stimulation patterns. Multiple signaling pathways converge to activate ERK, with different pathways being required for different stimulation patterns. To answer whether and how different temporal patterns select different signaling pathways for ERK activation, we developed a computational model of five signaling pathways (including two novel pathways) leading to ERK activation during L-LTP induction. We show that calcium and cAMP work synergistically to activate ERK and that stimuli given with large intertrial intervals activate more ERK than shorter intervals. Furthermore, these pathways contribute to different dynamics of ERK activation. These results suggest that signaling pathways with different temporal sensitivities facilitate ERK activation to diversity of temporal patterns.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ERK</kwd><kwd>SynGap</kwd><kwd>LTP</kwd><kwd>signaling pathway</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>epac</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH 117964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blackwell</surname><given-names>Kim T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1515686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blackwell</surname><given-names>Kim T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ERK activation during induction of long-term synaptic plasticity is enhanced by synergistic interactions among signaling pathways mediated by the synaptically located GTPase-activating protein, and each pathway contributes to different ERK temporal dynamics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Temporal patterns are a key feature of the environment. The speed of traversing space is indicated by the time between spatial cues. In classical conditioning, adaptive changes in behavior require an animal to respond to a cue in an appropriate time frame to gain a reward or avoid punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delamater and Holland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mauk and Ruiz, 1992</xref>). In these and other tasks, environmental cues, i.e., sensory inputs, are converted into spatio-temporal patterns of activation. Pattern discrimination requires that neurons are able to discriminate and respond differently to these different temporal input patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhalla, 2017</xref>); conversely, neurons need to be able to learn <italic>despite</italic> a difference in temporal patterns.</p><p>Long-term potentiation (LTP), the activity-dependent and persistent strengthening of synapses, is widely considered to be a cellular mechanism underlying memory storage. The temporal pattern sensitivity of neurons is evident from the wide range of synaptic plasticity induction protocols, with some protocols producing LTP and some producing weakening of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Malenka and Bear, 2004</xref>). Memory consolidation is also affected by temporal patterns: it has been shown that theta oscillations, which emerge during learning, and sharp-wave ripples can influence LTP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Çalışkan and Stork, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sadowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), demonstrating a role for temporal patterns during memory consolidation.</p><p>In the hippocampus, two ‘phases’ of LTP are distinguished. Late-phase LTP (L-LTP), induced by repetitive stimulation, can last more than 8 hr and involves de novo protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sweatt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tang and Yasuda, 2017</xref>). In contrast, early-phase LTP does not require protein synthesis and typically does not persist for more than 2 hr. It is also important to distinguish between induction and maintenance of L-LTP. Induction of L-LTP refers to the processes occurring during and shortly after the induction stimulation, whereas maintenance of L-LTP refers to the processes occurring tens of minutes to hours after induction.</p><p>A critical molecule in induction of L-LTP and memory is extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">English and Sweatt, 1997</xref>). Numerous studies have demonstrated that ERK contributes to L-LTP induction by controlling the transcription and protein translation necessary for L-LTP (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miningou and Blackwell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peng et al., 2010</xref>), as well as increasing cell excitability by phosphorylating potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schrader et al., 2006</xref>). ERK is activated by a cascade of kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buscà et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Terrell and Morrison, 2019</xref>), which are activated by Ras family GTP binding proteins, which are controlled by diverse Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Several of these GEFs and GAPs play a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopmental disorders, but their role in ERK activation during induction of L-LTP has not been demonstrated.</p><p>In the hippocampus, synaptic stimulation leads to activation of these GEFs and GAPs. Influx of calcium activates the calcium-sensitive GEF, RasGRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feig, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schwechter et al., 2013</xref>), and, via CaMKII, enhances activity of the synaptically localized GAP, SynGap, while dispersing it from the spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gamache et al., 2020</xref>). The intracellular second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activates two key molecules upstream of ERK activation: protein kinase A (PKA) and the GEF exchange factor activated by cAMP (Epac) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Rooij et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Enserink et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmitt and Stork, 2002</xref>). However, the contribution of calcium and cAMP pathways to ERK activation during L-LTP induction is unclear. A critical question is to what extent those signaling pathways work synergistically to activate ERK, whether they are redundant or whether they operate in different temporal regions.</p><p>A second critical question is how patterns of synaptic input determine which set of signaling pathways activate ERK leading to the induction of L-LTP. Key ERK activators, such as PKA and CaMKII, exhibit different temporal sensitivity: cAMP/PKA favors spaced LTP stimulation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scharf et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Woo et al., 2003</xref>), while calcium/CaMKII prefers massed LTP stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajay and Bhalla, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Both of these signaling pathways converge on ERK, allowing the neuron to learn despite a variation in temporal pattern; on the other hand, temporal pattern can still influence the response of the neuron by controlling the temporal pattern of ERK activation. For example, transient ERK leads to proliferation, while sustained ERK leads to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sasagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">von Kriegsheim et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To answer these questions about temporal pattern and synergy, we developed a single-compartment computational biochemical model of postsynaptic signaling pathway underlying L-LTP induction in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Simulations reveal that ERK pathways work synergistically, that the contribution of cAMP increases while the calcium contribution decreases with spaced stimuli, with ERK activity favoring spaced stimuli. The calcium- and cAMP-activated pathways have distinct temporal dynamics, providing a mechanism whereby different temporal patterns can activate different downstream effectors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Model validation</title><p>To investigate how temporal pattern of synaptic activity determines which pathway in the ERK signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">5</xref>) dominates in dendritic spines of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, we developed a single-compartment, stochastic reaction–diffusion model of pathways activating ERK.

As the stimulus duration increases, the ppERK response is slightly lower than the sum of responses to cAMP direct and indirect activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Sublinear summation is due to two loci of competition. First, competition was observed between the PKA phosphorylation of Src and Giβγ activation of Src. PKA has a higher affinity for Src than does Giβγ; therefore, Src is trapped by PKA, reducing available Src for Giβγ. This sublinear response is observed with 2× and 4× increases in Src quantity (results not shown), demonstrating that the sublinear summation is not due to Src depletion but indeed due to Giβγ and PKA competition with Src. The second competition was observed between Epac and the Giβγ/Crk-C3G for Rap1GDP. Rap1GDP is utilized by Epac, which reduces the Rap1GDP availability for Giβγ/Crk-C3G. Blocking Epac allows more Rap1GDP to bind Crk-C3G, prolonging ppERK activity as observed with Giβγ alone. In conclusion, competition between PKA and Giβγ for Src, and between Epac and Crk-C3G for Rap1GDP, affects summation in the cAMP pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Non-linear activation by calcium pathways: SynGAP dispersion and phosphatase activity control ERK activation by calcium</title><p>Model simulations show a non-linear activation with either calcium duration or concentration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> reveals that low calcium inputs produce little to no ppERK, whereas with higher calcium inputs, ppERK reaches a plateau and the duration of ppERK is prolonged.

The effect of CaMKII phosphorylation is complex, including enhanced SynGap activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walkup et al., 2015</xref>) and SynGap dispersion from the spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2015</xref>). We evaluated the contribution of these processes by eliminating them individually. Simulations reveal that persistent activation of ERK requires phosphorylation of SynGap by pCaMKII and dispersion of pSynGap to the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). A lower ppERK total activity results when pSynGap remains anchored in the spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, no pSynGap dispersion trace). Blocking the phosphorylation of SynGap was implemented using two approaches. In one, CaMKII can bind to SynGap but does not phosphorylate it. This reduces the available SynGap, which doubles ppERK concentration compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, pCK bound to SynGap). In the second approach, CaMKII is unable to bind to SynGap. This increases the available SynGap, resulting in a reduction of ppERK below basal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, no pCK bound to SynGap). These data suggest that the quantity of free SynGap in the spine, which is controlled by CaMKII, regulates ERK activation. To verify that the results were not an artifact of the binding affinity implemented in the model, simulations were repeated using 10× and 100× lower affinity of pCaMKII for SynGap. Simulation results show a similar relation of ppERK to pSynGap, reinforcing the hypothesis that CaMKII regulates ppERK total activity through its modulation of SynGap.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Overall ppERK response is a linear combination of response to calcium and cAMP</title><p>Simulations reveal that both pathways (calcium, cAMP) combine linearly to activate ERK. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that the response to stimulating both pathways overlaps with the sum of the single pathway responses.

Results show that the greatest total ppERK occurs at 80 s (using 18% PP1 and 1 µM calcium) or 300 s (using 50% PP1-1 µM calcium or 18% PP1-0.5 µM calcium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Though the change in optimal ITI varies little, the total quantity of ppERK greatly depends on calcium and PP1 concentration. In these simulations, the contribution of the cAMP pathway to ppERK is independent of calcium, in part because cAMP, calcium, and Giβγ are specified independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). To address the question of which pathway contributes more to ppERK and whether different temporal patterns use different pathways, we calculated the percent ppERK produced by each pathway. cAMP is responsible for a majority of the ppERK with below threshold calcium, but only responsible for a third of the ppERK for above threshold calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Analyzing the five pathways separately reveals ppERK increases with ITI for all pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Nonetheless, the relative contribution of SynGap decreases with ITI, as the other pathways increase more with ITI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

CaMKII modulation of SynGap with above threshold calcium may be responsible for the supralinear summation as SynGap dispersion enhances RasGTP and Rap1GTP in response to cAMP.</p><p>To further investigate responses to synaptic input, we simulated our model with five different L-LTP protocols. Two of them, bath-applied isoproterenol (ISO) followed by either 1 s of 100 Hz stimulation or 180 s of 5 Hz, experimentally elicit LTP, whereas giving 100 Hz, 5 Hz, or ISO alone do not.

This shows, for the first time, that overexpression of Rap1 can compensate for Ras activity in ERK activation.</p><p>A unique aspect of our model is that full activation of Raf1-RasGTP requires dimerization; thus, we evaluated the impact of dimerization on ERK activation. Dimerization reduces the temporal sensitivity of ppERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4A</xref>), as the difference in ppERK between 3 s and 300 s ITIs is much larger when dimerization does not occur. The biggest effect is a reduction in ppERK at short ITIs; thus, dimerization enhances ppERK mostly for short ITIs.</p><p>In summary, these results demonstrate that ERK signaling pathways integrate multiple inputs synergistically. In fact, ppERK activity in response to the combination of calcium and cAMP is always greater than the response to either calcium or cAMP alone. For high calcium inputs, as likely occur during L-LTP induction, these inputs combine supralinearly. Synergy is attributable to CaMKII phosphorylation of SynGap, as dispersion of SynGap from the spine enhances RasGTP and RapGTP in response to both calcium and cAMP inputs. Furthermore, our simulations suggest that Raf dimerization enhances Raf1 activation of ERK in response short ITI, thereby reducing the temporal sensitivity of ERK activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Robustness</title><p>In computational models, it is critical to ensure the robustness of the results to variation in parameter values. The main result of the model is that ERK signaling pathways, no matter the protocol used, favor spaced stimuli. To assess the robustness of the temporal sensitivity of ERK signaling pathways to small variations in parameters, simulations were repeated using concentrations of ±10% of the control value. The concentrations were changed either individually or collectively with changes drawn from a uniform distribution (between −10% and +10%). These simulations show that total ERK increase with ITI, similar to control results. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref> shows that the optimal ITI was 80 or 300 s (spaced) 80% of the time. We also evaluated the mean ppERK (across all ITIs) and the degree of temporal sensitivity, quantified as the difference between maximum ppERK and minimum ppERK (across ITIs). Results show that a 10% change in a single-molecule quantity rarely produced more than 20% change in mean ppERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), with changes evenly distributed about 0%. In contrast, temporal sensitivity was more sensitive to parameter variations, with most parameter changes increasing temporal sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).

ERK is activated through numerous pathways; however, it is unclear why so many pathways converge on ERK. Furthermore, some pathways are required, whereas other pathways can be compensated. Due to complicated interactions, models of signaling pathways are crucial for understanding the molecular foundations of L-LTP. Using a computational model of signaling pathways underlying L-LTP in hippocampus CA1, we evaluated temporal sensitivity and synergy between the ERK pathways utilized by different L-LTP stimulation protocols. Our data demonstrate that calcium and cAMP work synergistically to activate ERK, and we show for the first time the role of SynGAP in mediating the synergy between pathways. SynGAP mutations are associated with a variety of syndromes, such as autism and intellectual disability. Our simulations suggest that this phenotype might be in part caused by dynamics of ERK activation following closely the dynamics of SynGAP dispersion from the spine. Our data also show that stimuli spaced in time activate more ERK than stimuli massed in time, a temporal sensitivity similar to PKA but different than CaMKII. These ERK activation pathways are not redundant as each has a distinct dynamic, contributing to different time frames of ERK activation. For example, Epac contributes to an early transient ERK activation, whereas PKA contributes to a later transient ERK activation. With massed stimuli, calcium produces a rapid and sustained ERK activation, whereas with spaced stimuli, calcium only produces small transient ERK responses. The difference in dynamics and contribution of each pathway reinforce how neurons are able to recognize and discriminate different patterns in learning protocols.</p><p>The model elucidates that CaMKII contributes to ERK activation through phosphorylation of SynGap. This synaptic RasGap, selectively expressed in the brain, regulates ERK activity by inactivating RasGTP and Rap1GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gamache et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pena et al., 2008</xref>). CaMKII phosphorylation of SynGap both increases its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walkup et al., 2015</xref>) and causes dispersion to the dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2015</xref>). To investigate the role of dispersion, we repeated simulations without dispersion of pSynGap and observed that the ppERK amplitude was decreased by half. This effect is observed because its activity is doubled in the spine, reducing the available quantity of RasGTP and Rap1GTP. Thus, the dispersion of pSynGap attenuates its activity in the spine, which allows a long-lasting spine enlargement as observed in experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2015</xref>). We also showed that blocking CaMKII binding to SynGap greatly reduced ppERK activity, whereas allowing CaMKII to bind but not phosphorylate SynGap greatly increased ppERK activity. This result is consistent with experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>) showing that overexpression or depletion of SynGap significantly reduced and enhanced ERK activity, respectively. Thus, CaMKII-dependent SynGAP dispersion from the spine controls ERK recruitment.</p><p>One of our main conclusions is that feedforward loops can support ERK activation for L-LTP induction without PKC. Induction refers to the transient events that trigger the formation of L-LTP, while maintenance refers to the persistence of biochemical signaling that supports L-LTP. Our results showed that ppERK decays in less than an hour, suggesting that ERK is required during induction of L-LTP, but not during maintenance, which lasts for multiple hours. These results are consistent with experiments showing that inhibition of ERK 30 min after induction does not block LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kelleher et al., 2004</xref>). PKMζ, the atypical form of PKC, participates in a feedforward loop to support L-LTP maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajay and Bhalla, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajay and Bhalla, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tsokas et al., 2016</xref>) however, the evidence that PKC is required for L-LTP induction is weak, and thus we did not include it in our model. Similarly, we did not include metabotropic glutamate receptors, which activate PKC, because structural plasticity, a correlate of LTP, is independent of mGluR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhai et al., 2013</xref>). An alternative feedforward loop involves PKA inhibiting ERK inactivation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neves et al., 2008</xref>), but PKA is not required for all forms of L-LTP induction. Our model reveals an additional feedforward loop, connecting CaMKII to SynGap to ERK, which is activated during L-LTP induction. This pathway may be critical for induction of L-LTP in CA1 for protocols resistant to inhibition of PKA and PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sweatt, 1999</xref>). In summary, our study supports prior results showing that feedforward loops are sufficient to activate ERK but reveals a novel feedforward loop involving SynGap.</p><p>Temporal selectivity is an important characteristic of learning and memory formation. Animals can learn to respond similarly to a variety of temporal patterns or can respond differently depending on the temporal pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delamater and Holland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mauk and Ruiz, 1992</xref>). In some cases, synaptic input can produce either LTD or LTP depending on the temporal frequency of the input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hawes et al., 2013</xref>). In other words, neurons can discriminate and respond differently to these different temporal input patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhalla, 2017</xref>), but also need to be able to learn despite a difference in temporal patterns. We showed that ERK is activated for a wide range of temporal input patterns, but what are the differences allowing temporal pattern discrimination?</p><p>One mechanism for temporal pattern discrimination is the temporal pattern of ERK itself, which can determine whether a cell differentiates or divides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sasagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">von Kriegsheim et al., 2009</xref>) and whether LTP and LTD occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thiels et al., 2002</xref>). We have summarized kinase activity as area under the curve, but some downstream molecules may be more sensitive to dynamics or peak activity. Indeed, our data show repeated transients of ppERK with 300 ITI versus a sustained ppERK with 80 and smaller ITIs, and the peak activity of ERK has a different temporal sensitivity than total activity. Total activity increases with ITI while peak decreases with ITI, implying that processes sensitive to peak versus AUC could distinguish these temporal patterns. We predict that these temporal patterns can be decoded by the nucleus to produce different gene expression patterns, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jain and Bhalla, 2014</xref>). Our model prediction of different ERK dynamics could be tested using the new EKAR sensor to image ERK activation in hippocampal slices after L-LTP induction using different ITIs, and the prediction of different gene expression patterns could be tested using some of the newer gene expression techniques, e.g., TRAP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McKeever et al., 2017</xref>), to determine whether short ITIs produced different gene expression patterns than long ITIs.</p><p>A second mechanism for temporal pattern discrimination is that pathways activating ERK have other targets essential for L-LTP induction. Our results show that the CaMKII and calcium contribution to ERK decreases with ITI, whereas the PKA and cAMP contribution to ERK increases with ITI. The opposite temporal sensitivity of these critical kinases, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajay and Bhalla, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajay and Bhalla, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Woo et al., 2003</xref>), can contribute to pattern discrimination by the neuron, through activation of other downstream molecules that are required for LTP. For example, re-organization of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borovac et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Honkura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Obashi et al., 2019</xref>) is required to increase the size of the spine to allow for more glutamate receptors. In particular, both CaMKII and PKA control actin binding proteins, such as cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Havekes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, even in cases where ERK activity cannot distinguish temporal patterns, the temporal sensitivity of other key kinases can contribute to temporal pattern sensitivity.</p><p>Our results suggest that numerous signaling pathways activate ERK to enhance sensitivity to a range of temporal patterns, but there are other differences between the pathways that suggest they are not redundant. If those pathways were redundant, then, contrary to experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gelinas et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gelinas et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scharf et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Woo et al., 2003</xref>), blocking one of them should not block ERK-dependent L-LTP. In addition, our model predicts that Rap1 and Ras are not interchangeable: Rap1 can compensate for Ras, but Ras cannot compensate for Rap1. Instead of redundancy, multiple pathways may be needed to control ERK dynamics and allow it to perform multiple tasks. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sasagawa et al., 2005</xref> demonstrated that there are two distinct dynamics of ERK, transient and sustained, due to the distinct timeframe of Ras and Rap. Similarly, we observed that each ERK activation pathway has a distinct dynamic, each contributing to a different time frame of ERK activation. For example, Epac contributed to an early transient ERK activation, whereas PKA contributed to a later transient ERK activation, and CaMKII produced a sustained ERK activation. Thus, our model predicts that an Epac knockout would lead to slower ERK activation. These different time frames of ERK may phosphorylate different targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keyes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). For example, Epac, a molecule of emerging importance in neurodevelopmental disorders, may have a role in disorders in cAMP degradation by enhancing the early activation of ERK. SynGap may be critical for a pool of ERK in the spine, whereas PKA may be essential for a pool of ERK that translocates to the nucleus. In this context, we predict that overexpression of SynGap would not reduce ERK activity in the nucleus but only in the spine. An experimental test of this prediction could use EKAR imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harvey et al., 2008</xref>) to quantify ERK expression in the spine versus nucleus or measure gene expression with overexpression of SynGap.</p><p>Different temporal patterns may produce different outcomes by activating different pools of ERK. Studies have shown that scaffolding proteins, such as Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dougherty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shalin et al., 2006</xref>) and β-arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourquard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeFea et al., 2000</xref>), can create multi-protein complexes of ERK, MEK, and Raf and dictate the subcellular location of ERK activity. Thus, a critical question is whether the spatial pool of ERK depends on which signaling pathways are activated during induction of LTP. These different pools of ERK may perform different functions, such as translocating to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription, staying in the cytoplasm to initiate local changes in excitability, or allowing stimulated spines to capture newly synthesized proteins to enable persistence of L-LTP (as in synaptic tagging and capture) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frey and Morris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Redondo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sajikumar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Young et al., 2006</xref>). This leads to a second question regarding what limits the spatial spread of molecules involved in marking spines as having been stimulated. In this context, a possible role for SynGAP dispersion would be to limit diffusion of active Ras family proteins to nearby, non-stimulated spines, thereby creating microdomains of ERK. Spatial models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhalla, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) have shown that buffering and other inactivation mechanisms can produce spine-sized microdomains of calcium and cAMP, but not PKA or CaMKII, suggesting additional mechanisms may be needed to produce spine-sized microdomains of ERK. Taking those questions together it will be quite interesting to implement a spatial model to investigate mechanisms that govern spatial pools of ERK and spatial and tagging specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Computational methods</title><p>To investigate how temporal pattern of synaptic activity determines which pathway in the ERK signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">5</xref>) dominates in dendritic spines of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, we developed a single-compartment, stochastic reaction–diffusion model of pathways activating ERK. The model was built by merging and adapting two existing models of synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. One of those models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017</xref>) explains how different temporal patterns activate different kinases such as CaMKII and PKA that are critical for L-LTP induction, and the other model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jain and Bhalla, 2014</xref>) demonstrates that protein synthesis is the result of synergistic activation of different pathways such as ERK and mTOR to generate unique patterns in response to different L-LTP stimuli. These previously published models were modified by adding several molecules and reactions critical for ERK activation.</p><p>One major change to the merged model is C-Raf dimerization. Dimerization regulates C-Raf activation and its subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Desideri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garnett et al., 2005</xref>). Full activation of C-Raf, but not BRaf, requires dimerization. RasGTP binds to C-Raf to form an inactive complex, C-Raf-RasGTP, which then homodimerizes to become active, thus able to phosphorylate MEK that activates ERK. Another major change is the addition of two important molecules, RasGRF and SynGap, involved in hippocampal LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darcy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jin and Feig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2006</xref>). RasGRF is activated by binding to calcium-calmodulin; once activated, RasGRF binds to RasGDP and allows the exchange of GDP for GTP. SynGap inactivates Rap1GTP and RasGTP with low affinity. Once phosphorylated by CaMKII, SynGAP affinity doubles toward RasGTP and Rap1GTP and causes SynGAP dispersion from synapses to the dendrite.</p><p>Initial conditions and rate constants are either taken from previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jain and Bhalla, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017</xref>) or adjusted to reproduce experimentally measured concentrations of molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata6">6</xref>) or to match time course data, for example rate constants governing CaMKII autophosphorylation. The concentration of some species was adjusted to produce an intracellular concentration of calcium of ~50 nM and cAMP of ~30 nM, among others. For example, the concentration of PDEs was adjusted to produce a 30 nM basal cAMP. Calcium extrusion mechanisms and the low affinity and immobile calcium buffer were adjusted to obtain a steady state of about 50 nM of internal calcium. To match the in vitro data on basal concentration, we ran the model for about an hour to obtain steady-state concentrations for all molecules.</p><p>Several simulations use a compartment with a volume comparable to a spine head (about 0.1–0.8 µm<sup>3</sup>). To minimize noise inherent in stochastic models, most simulations used a larger compartment, of volume 4 µm<sup>3</sup>. Other than the level of noise, no differences in temporal sensitivity were observed between the small and large volume models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stimulation protocols</title><p>In brain slices, presynaptic stimulation results in calcium influx through NMDA receptors, and norepinephrine (NE) or dopamine, which bind to Gs-coupled metabotropic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017</xref>) is required for L-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang and Kandel, 1995</xref>). To investigate the effect of calcium distinct from cAMP produced by NE, the model is activated using three independent inputs leading to ERK activation: calcium (through RasGRF and SynGap), cAMP (through Epac and PKA), and βγ subunit of inhibitory G protein (Gi) (through implicit PKA phosphorylation of βAR). βARs are mostly coupled with stimulatory G protein (Gs). However, when phosphorylated by PKA, βARs decouple from Gs and couple with inhibitory G proteins (Gi). Both Gs-activated and βAR coupled with Gi-activated signaling pathways converge to activate ERK using different pathways. To determine whether maximal ERK activation requires multiple pathways, the contribution of each pathway was tested singly and in combination using either a duration or amplitude protocol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Duration protocols used a sustained concentration of calcium, cAMP, and Giβγ. Amplitude protocols used transient (1 s duration) elevations of different concentrations of the inputs. Calcium and cAMP each have several different pathways to ERK activation; thus, to determine the contribution of each of the (sub)pathways, the above simulations were repeated with one of the rates set to zero, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>. To investigate whether different L-LTP temporal patterns select different signaling pathways for ERK activation, simulations were performed using stimulation protocols identical to the experimental protocols used to induce L-LTP. Therefore, we stimulated the model with four trains of 100 Hz for 1 s at five different intertrial intervals: 3, 20, 40 s (massed) or 80 and 300 s (spaced) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Each stimulation pulse triggered a transient elevation of either calcium, cAMP (direct action and in combination with Giβγ) singly, or in combination.</p><p>We also tested different forms of stimulation patterns that induce L-LTP. The additional stimulation protocols are bath-applied ISO followed by 1 train of 100 Hz (ISO+100 Hz) or 5 Hz (ISO+5 Hz). The inputs used to run these simulations are derived from simulations of a spatial model response to glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Simulation and analysis</title><p>The model is implemented using a stochastic reaction–diffusion simulator NeuroRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jȩdrzejewski-Szmek and Blackwell, 2016</xref>), version 3.2.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jędrzejewski-Szmek and Blackwell, 2018</xref>), using the adaptive (asynchronous tau-leap) numerical method and tolerance of 0.1. Even though stochastic fluctuations observed using small compartments do not impact the results, the stochastic algorithm is extremely fast, especially for stiff systems; thus, there would be no advantage to switching to a potentially less accurate deterministic simulator. All model files needed to run the simulations, including molecule quantities, reaction rate constants, and stimulation quantities, are available on GitHub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miningou Zobon et al., 2021</xref>) and on modelDB, accession number 267073.</p><p>Biochemical experiments assess kinase activity by measuring the change in concentration of the product after a specific time. Thus, in these simulations, the kinase activity is quantified as total activity over simulated time compared to the activity under conditions of no stimulation, also known as area under the curve (AUC). To account for stochastic variation, simulations were repeated five times (each using a different random seed) and results presented are the mean and standard error over the trials. The sample size is based on previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jȩdrzejewski-Szmek and Blackwell, 2016</xref>), which found this sample size sufficient to show differences between conditions. Analysis was done in Python 3, using nrdh5_analV2.py available on GitHub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackwell and Miningou Zobon, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Statistical analysis was done in Python3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/neurord/ERK/tree/master/Analysis">https://github.com/neurord/ERK/tree/master/Analysis</ext-link>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miningou Zobon and Blackwell, 2021</xref>. To assess whether the response was linear, the AUC versus stimulation duration or concentration was fit to a line, a Hill equation, and a logarithmic equation (the latter two selected subjectively as matching the shape of the curve). The response was considered non-linear if both adjusted R<sup>2</sup> and Akaike information criteria were better for one of the non-linear equations. To determine whether two pathways combined linearly, analysis of variance was used, with AUC of doubly ppERK as the dependent variable, and intertrial interval and stimulation type (combination or summation) as independent variables (N = 5 in each group). Random forest regression was used to analyze the robustness simulations, to determine which parameter values had the most influence on the change in ppERK AUC. Random forest is a non-linear method of regression that creates multiple decision trees. Each tree is made by randomly selecting features, for example molecule concentration, that best predict the dependent variable, that is ppERK. By using a large number of decision trees (100 for this analysis), the results are quite robust. The outcome of the random forest is a weight for each feature, indicating its usefulness in predicting the dependent variable. By design, the sum of weights for all features equals 1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported through the joint NIH-NSF CRCNS program through NSF grant 1515686 and NIMH grant R01MH 117964.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Writing - review and editing, model simulations</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64644-transrepform-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All model files are freely available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/neurord/ERK/releases/tag/1.0.0">https://github.com/neurord/ERK/releases/tag/1.0.0</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:rev:27db0c5f79d5a1a7922b06e2a0b258102dec9670">https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:rev:27db0c5f79d5a1a7922b06e2a0b258102dec9670</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional simulations and analyses are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at eLife&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study takes on the question of the roles of the many pathways leading to ERK activation in long-term potentiation. This is an advance since few models consider timing roles of more than a couple of input pathways to ERK or in plasticity. The authors consider two aspects: how pathways sum to give strong responses, and distinct temporal pattern selectivity. They show that both summation linearity, and pattern selectivity, are strongly governed by which pathways are engaged in driving the response.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>A key point discussed by the reviewers was whether the temporal pattern selectivity represented sufficient interest and novelty. Could the authors make a strong case for this? In addition the reviewers felt that the following points would be essential to address in a revision:</p><p>1. Could the authors provide extensive comparisons to experiment? All the reviewers felt that the parameterization was inadequately validated, specially as the model was a significant change from its original sources.</p><p>2. Could the authors bring a more complete account of activation of the chosen pathways by synaptic input? It should be possible to simulate how all the pathways are triggered, presumably in an overlapping way, by different kinds of input.</p><p>3. While ERK is important, there are numerous other pathways that play a key role in plasticity. The authors should specify the role of ERK and relate it to other pathways.</p><p>4. The analyses of summation and linearity should be done in a more statistically complete manner.</p><p>5. The authors should provide better documentation of their reaction system through diagrams and standard formats.</p><p>6. What testable predictions does the model make?</p><p>In addition, the reviewers brought up other relevant points in their individual reviews.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study takes on the question of the roles of the many pathways leading to ERK activation in long-term potentiation. This is an advance: few models consider more than a couple of input pathways. The authors consider two aspects: how pathways sum to give strong responses, and distinct temporal pattern selectivity.</p><p>The model and analysis is potentially interesting, but the paper would be much strengthened if there were more convincing validation of the properties of the model by way of simulations to compare with experiments. I also bring up a couple of points about how better to link synaptically-driven responses to the properties of the model.</p><p>1. I was looking to see some model validation before diving into the predictions of the model. Specifically, it would have been useful to compare the model ERK responses to each of the individual stimulation pathways that the authors implement.</p><p>Around line 531 the authors describe how parameters were chosen. These seem to rely on previous work or on steady-state levels in the absence of stimulation. Since the model is quite different from the source models, it is important to provide additional validation. Further, time-series responses and dose-response curves give far tighter constraints on system behavior than single-point steady-state readouts. A figure with a range of such validation runs would be very helpful.</p><p>1b. There is a nice analysis (Table 2) of effects of KO on responses. Surely there are physiological experiments to compare with this? In the para around line 137 several experiments are mentioned but it would be useful to show simulations to compare with the data.</p><p>2. What is the relative strength of contributions by each of the proposed 5 pathways to ERK regulation? How was this ascertained?</p><p>3. It is interesting to see differences in linearity between cAMP and Ca pathways. However, these are themselves downstream of the synaptic input. Could the authors explore how these differences would manifest upon synaptic input to a typical synapse having AMPAR, NMDAR, and mGluR? Won't they be rather overlaid on each other?</p><p>4. While it is nice to see a model with as many as 5 pathways driving ERKII, I am curious about the choice of these input pathways. From synaptic input one would expect to see an mGluR component. Do the authors envision that this folds into Gbg? Further, one sees other signals such as BDNF as major players in plasticity.</p><p>4b. I bring this up also in the context of the reported time-courses. Experimental time-courses of other pathway inputs can be quite different from those explored here, BDNF tending to be quite slow.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>There are, however, a couple of points that I feel should be addressed, in order for me to enthusiastically recommend this manuscript for publication.</p><p>1. There needs to be additional technical detail on how the original models were expanded. The model presented here was developed by merging Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017 and Jain and Bhalla, 2014 models. These models were developed based on experimental data and validated with independent experimental datasets in a rigorous manner. It is not clear how the combining these two models, and the additional molecules and reactions added have affected the dynamics of ERK activation, and how comparable they are to the original experimental data used for model development in the previous modeling efforts. It is not clear if the model was reparametrized.</p><p>2. Beyond the ERK activation traces, it would be useful for clarity sake to also include the simulated traces for the activation of the upstream molecules (PKA, RAS, RAP, etc). Given how additional changes have been made additional information should be provided to ensure that the contribution of each pathway is accurately represented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper is primarily about modeling the ERK pathway during the induction of synaptic plasticity. This pathway has been previously modeled, and this is cited in the paper. The main addition here is the addition of the effect of SynGap which is necessary in some form of LTP. This is a very detailed study, and what it seems to primarily show is that the ERK pathway favored spaced vs. massed stimulation protocols. This is a very detailed paper, but no conceptually new ideas are presented here. The paper adds to an existing foundation, but fails to make the case that this is a very significant addition. What is the significant consequence at a higher level of these added details?</p><p>The ERK pathway is just one component of a much larger set of pathways that control synaptic plasticity, how much do we learn from studying this pathway in isolation? Also, the paper cites the importance of this pathway to L-LTP, is it the induction phase of L-LTP? It seems so because ppRRK decays in less than an hour. How then does this pathway contribute to the maintenance of L-LTP, these processes such as a possible upregulation of protein synthesis are not part of this model either.</p><p>This paper studies in detail different pathways that influence ERK activation is synapses. This is a very detailed study, but how many details do we actually know? For a detailed paper though it seems that many of the details are missing. Is there a detailed diagram of reactions, or set of equations for all these reactions? Some coefficients are named in figure 1, and this might be sufficient for a schematic description of the model in the paper, however there must be somewhere a detailed description of all reactions. How many species are there here, how many coefficients? How are coefficient values known? How many coefficients are directly estimated? The paper does carry out an extensive robustness analysis, though it is not well explained.</p><p>What are the major takeaways from this paper, and what experiments could test this model?</p><p>To summarize, the paper is very detailed carefully constructed and executed, it fails to convince that the problem it addresses is very significant, and it makes no conceptual breakthroughs.</p><p>The induction protocols seem to include not only calcium pulses, but also cAMP and g-protein coupled pulses, what is the cellular origin of these other pulses? Is the G protein activation due to β-adrenergic activation, is this activation necessary for plasticity? What is the cellular origin of the cAMP and Gi activation in slice? Similarly, what primarily activated cAMP in real synapses?</p><p>Is ERK required for all forms of LTP? Some references indicate it might not be. Is ERK necessary for early LTP induced by 100Hz stimulation?</p><p>I get lost in the details of the introduction, description of different pathways should be in results and relate to figure 1. It looks like a shopping list, why is this significant?</p><p>Why is it important that this is a stochastic diffusion reaction model rather than a deterministic model? Nothing about fluctuations, except for small error bars are mentioned in this paper.</p><p>Do not reference Zhang et al. Nature Neuro 2012, its' not a mammalian LTP model, still there are similarities (and differences), especially as ERK pathways are studied and since it relates to spaced learning.</p><p>229 – where do we see autophosphorylation in figure 3F?</p><p>Figure 6B – hard to see shape of symbols.</p><p>No model diagrams or equations here, for example how in CaMKII autophosphorylation implemented? Figure 6C – what is old CaMKII? They give a reference, but we do not know what the new model is.</p><p>Narrow picture by looking only at ERK. – For example, increasing PP1 can enhance ppERK, however it might reduce overall LTP due to dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors. What wins?</p><p>Figure 7 – what in figure 7 shows super linearity? It's in the title, where else? This applies to paragraph starting in line 368 as well. Where do we see these results. We can try to eyeball it. It would be useful to show a plot of combined model/(sum of individual models). By eyeballing this it seems (but might be wrong) that the super-linearity is minimal.</p><p>403 – the first time random-forest was mentioned in line 403, and this method is not explained or defined prior to this or even in this paragraph. For <italic>eLife</italic> type of readers this needs to be explained in simple terms.</p><p>423 – typo – &quot;Molecules were randomly simultaneous(ly)&quot;</p><p>What to weights in table 5 mean? This relates to the random forest analysis which is not explained.</p><p>Similar problems with figure 8, what is shown here? What is the analysis used here? This is totally unclear. Are molecules here changed one at a time? How much are they changed? Is this the 10% discussed earlier? It would also be more instructive to show relative range changes.</p><p>How is this paper related to the recent Maki-Marttunen paper from the same lab which appeared recently (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.921254v1.abstract), it is not referenced here. That is a more general paper but seems to exclude ERK. If ERK is so significant how can it be excluded in one paper and included in another from the same lab?</p><p>Discussion starts OK, but again devolves into excessive details.</p><p>Does this model possibly explain induction of L-LTP, or its maintenance phase? It seems the prior since ppERK activity returns to baseline; these should be distinguished.</p><p>In summary – this paper fails to convince that it is of general interest beyond a narrow community. However, the comments in this section show that there are changes to be made even for the specific community of scientists interested in the signaling pathways of LTP.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Temporal pattern and synergy influence activity of ERK signaling pathways during L-LTP induction&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Ronald Calabrese (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Summary points from the previous decision:</p><p>Point 1: Comparisons to experiments and validation of parameterization.</p><p>The authors have partly addressed this point, with comparisons of simulations to several additional experiments. They have also provided tables of data sources but many parameters are linked to previous models rather than to experiments. It would be helpful if the authors could explicitly address the point about _parameter_ validation, and to what extent systems level experiments provide validation for rate terms.</p><p>Point 2: Activation of pathways by synaptic input.</p><p>Here the authors use the model from their 2017 paper to generate Ca and cAMP waveforms, and report results consistent with experiments. It is just a single figure though, and only reports ppERK. We don't see the upstream pathways and their responses. Since the authors have now added these upstream pathways, it would be good to see the time-courses for upstream key molecules indicated in figure 1. These include Ca, Gbg, cAMP, as well as CaMKII, PKA, synGap, Ras and Rap1. It would be useful to have a figure with these time-courses for the major stimulus patterns used in the figures. In Figure 8 – supplementary Figure 2B the authors provide some time-courses for a few molecules. A complete set would be desirable.</p><p>Point 4: Linearity. Here the authors report ANCOVA analysis for figures 3, 5, 6. This addresses the point.</p><p>Point 5: Source data now provided. Unfortunately it isn't in SBML. If the authors can apply a conversion program to their model, an SBML version would be valuable.</p><p>Point 6: Predictions: These are now provided.</p><p>Responses to reviewer 1: OK.</p><p>Responses to reviewer 2: OK</p><p>Responses to reviewer 3: We recommend that the response to the point about induction protocols would be best addressed with graphs of the time-courses mentioned above in Point 2.</p><p>Also, the response to the reviewer's point about the use of a stochastic method would be good to include in the text. We did not see this statement there.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64644.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This study takes on the question of the roles of the many pathways leading to ERK activation in long-term potentiation.

The speed of traversing space is indicated by the time between spatial cues. In classical conditioning, adaptive changes in behavior require an animal to respond to a cue in an appropriate time frame to gain a reward or avoid punishment (Delamater and Holland, 2008; Mauk and Ruiz, 1992). In these and other tasks, environmental cues, i.e., sensory inputs, are converted into spatio-temporal patterns of activation. Pattern discrimination requires that neurons are able to discriminate and respond differently to these different temporal input patterns (Bhalla, 2017); conversely, neurons need to be able to learn despite a difference in temporal patterns.”</p><p>We also explain the relevance of temporal pattern discrimination for LTP (lines 46-51) and other cell functions (lines 83-88). In summary, temporal pattern of synaptic inputs can influence the response of the neuron by controlling the temporal pattern of ERK activation. Temporal pattern has been shown to affect numerous aspects of neuron function, including whether LTD or LTP occurs. In other word, temporal pattern and timing of the inputs regulate learning and memory.</p><p>We discuss the importance of temporal pattern in the discussion, lines 444-492.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Could the authors bring a more complete account of activation of the chosen pathways by synaptic input? It should be possible to simulate how all the pathways are triggered, presumably in an overlapping way, by different kinds of input.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, these pathways are triggered by both synaptic and neuromodulator input. Neuromodulators such as dopamine and norepinephrine are released during LTP stimulation and activate Gs coupled receptors to produce cAMP. Calcium influx through NMDA receptors not only activates the calcium pathways in our model but also can activate adenylyl cyclases to produce cAMP. To better investigate ERK activation during L-LTP induction, we have generated calcium and cAMP input by simulation of our published model of those pathways (Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017), and then measured the ERK response to calcium and cAMP using several LTP induction protocols. These simulations were done by Joanna Jedrzejewska-Szmek, who has been added as a co-author. These results, lines 309-319 and new Figure 9, show that isoproterenol followed by either 100 Hz or 5 Hz produce greater ppERK than ISO, 100 Hz or 5 Hz alone, consistent with the experimental observation that the combination stimuli are needed to produce L-LTP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We have related ERK to other pathways in the context of temporal pattern sensitivity, lines 451-483. Specifically, both PKA and CaMKII phosphorylate molecules involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (lines 465-469).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

What testable predictions does the model make?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added several predictions to the discussion.</p><p>We predict that these temporal patterns can be decoded by the nucleus to produce different gene expression patterns. Our model prediction of different ERK dynamics could be tested using the new EKAR sensor to image ERK activation in hippocampal slices after L-LTP induction using different ITIs, and the prediction of different gene expression patterns could be tested using some of the newer gene expression techniques, e.g.TRAP-seq (McKeever et al., 2017), to determine whether shorter ITIs produced different gene expression patterns than long ITIs (lines 452-458).</p><p>We observed that each ERK activation pathway has a distinct dynamic, each contributing to a different time frame of ERK activation. For example, Epac contributed to an early transient ERK activation, whereas PKA contributed to a later transient ERK activation, and CaMKII produced a sustained ERK activation. Thus, our model predicts that an Epac knockout would lead to a slower ERK activation (lines 480-484).</p><p>These different time frames of ERK may phosphorylate different targets (Keyes et al., 2020; Zhai et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2018). For example, Epac, a molecule of emerging importance in neurodevelopmental disorders, may have a role in disorders in cAMP degradation by enhancing the early activation of ERK. SynGap may be critical for a pool of ERK in the spine, whereas PKA may be essential for a pool of ERK that translocate to the nucleus. In this context, we predict that overexpression of SynGap would not reduce ERK activity in the nucleus but only in the spine. An experimental test of this prediction could use EKAR imaging (Harvey et al., 2008a) to quantify ERK expression in the spine versus nucleus or measure gene expression with overexpression of SynGap (lines 484-492).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1.

But we also use basal concentrations as constraint, which is not always done. We now add tables of parameters which shows that most parameters were taken from the two models and identifies the parameters that were newly derived or re-parameterized. We provide the URL to the code on github that implemented parameter optimization for CaMKII and SynGap. In addition, we provide additional validation figures comparing model responses with published data (for ppERK and RasGTP).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1b. There is a nice analysis (Table 2) of effects of KO on responses. Surely there are physiological experiments to compare with this? In the para around line 137 several experiments are mentioned but it would be useful to show simulations to compare with the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it would be much better to compare our KO experiments with physiological experiments. We now add these comparisons to data for the SynGap KO, but we cannot find data for the effect of Epac KO. We have also added additional KO experiments, comparing the effect of Raf, Ras and Rap KO with experiments (Figure 8 – Supplementary Figure 3, lines 320-339). The effect of an Epac KO is now a prediction of the model as explained in the discussion on lines 481-486.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What is the relative strength of contributions by each of the proposed 5 pathways to ERK regulation? How was this ascertained?</p></disp-quote><p>We now present a more complete pathway analysis. Figure 8C shows the contribution of each pathway as the percentage of total activity (the ratio of ppERK AUC for a single pathway divided by ppERK AUC with all pathways), and shows that the sum of the pathways exceeds 100%. We also added additional figures (Figure 7 – Supplementary Figure 2B, Figure 6 – Supplementary Figure 1B) showing ppERK responses to single pathways, which also show that the pathways contribute to different time frames of ERK activation. We also show the dynamics of the pathways in response to single pulse stimulation in Figure 5C and D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is interesting to see differences in linearity between cAMP and Ca pathways. However, these are themselves downstream of the synaptic input. Could the authors explore how these differences would manifest upon synaptic input to a typical synapse having AMPAR, NMDAR, and mGluR? Won't they be rather overlaid on each other?</p></disp-quote><p>The simulations using 4 trains of both calcium and cAMP are meant to represent the response to 4 trains of synaptic activation (line 285-286). In addition, to better evaluate the response to more typical synaptic activation, we added simulations in response to the cAMP and calcium concentration dynamics that occur in response to glutamate plus neuromodulators during L-LTP induction, as determined by our published model of those pathways (Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017). These simulations were done by Joanna Jedrzejewska-Szmek, who has been added as a co-author. These results, new figure 9, shows that isopropanol followed by either 100 Hz or 5 Hz produce greater ppERK than ISO, 100 Hz or 5 Hz alone, which corresponds to experimental data showing that only isopropanol plus 100 Hz or 5 Hz produce L-LTP. The purpose of simulating these pathways separately is to understand their different contributions. Figure 8-supplementary Figure 2 shows that even when these pathways are correlated, they contribute to different time frames of ERK activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. While it is nice to see a model with as many as 5 pathways driving ERKII, I am curious about the choice of these input pathways. From synaptic input one would expect to see an mGluR component. Do the authors envision that this folds into Gbg? Further, one sees other signals such as BDNF as major players in plasticity.</p><p>4b. I bring this up also in the context of the reported time-courses. Experimental time-courses of other pathway inputs can be quite different from those explored here, BDNF tending to be quite slow.</p></disp-quote><p>mGluR would provide a Gq component leading to activation of PKC. This pathway is quite important for LTP in other systems (striatum, neocortex), and PKC is critical for maintenance of synaptic plasticity; however, this research is focused on induction of LTP, which is generally found to be independent of PKC. In addition, published data (Zhai et al., 2013) shows that structural plasticity, a correlate of LTP, is independent of mGluR stimulation. We now discuss this on lines 426-428.</p><p>Regarding BDNF, we agree that it contributes to ERK activation through the canonical pathways. However, as the reviewer points out, this pathway is quite slow, and thus is unlikely to contribute to temporal sensitivity. Because this research is focused on temporal sensitivity, BDNF was excluded from the model. To completely predict whether ppERK is sufficient for plasticity, ideally, we would include the BDNF-TrkB pathway; however, the concentration profile of BDNF is not well characterized, making this aspect of the model problematic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>There are, however, a couple of points that I feel should be addressed, in order for me to enthusiastically recommend this manuscript for publication.</p><p>1. There needs to be additional technical detail on how the original models were expanded. The model presented here was developed by merging Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017 and Jain and Bhalla, 2014 models. These models were developed based on experimental data and validated with independent experimental datasets in a rigorous manner. It is not clear how the combining these two models, and the additional molecules and reactions added have affected the dynamics of ERK activation, and how comparable they are to the original experimental data used for model development in the previous modeling efforts. It is not clear if the model was reparametrized.</p></disp-quote><p>We now add tables of parameters which includes which parameters taken from the two models and which parameters were newly derived or re-parameterized. In addition, we provide additional validation figures (Figure 2, Figure 9, and Figure 8 – Supplementary figure 3) comparing model responses with published data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Beyond the ERK activation traces, it would be useful for clarity sake to also include the simulated traces for the activation of the upstream molecules (PKA, RAS, RAP, etc). Given how additional changes have been made additional information should be provided to ensure that the contribution of each pathway is accurately represented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional graphs showing dynamics of RasGTP (Figure 2A), active Epac (Figure 8 – Supplementary Figure 2B), active RasGRF (Figure 8 – Supplementary Figure 2C), and phosphorylated SynGap (Figure 8– Supplementary Figure 2D), to provide more insight into the pathways and demonstrate their contribution. These molecules were selected as showing contribution to different time frames of activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper is primarily about modeling the ERK pathway during the induction of synaptic plasticity. This pathway has been previously modeled, and this is cited in the paper. The main addition here is the addition of the effect of SynGap which is necessary in some form of LTP. This is a very detailed study, and what it seems to primarily show is that the ERK pathway favored spaced vs. massed stimulation protocols. This is a very detailed paper, but no conceptually new ideas are presented here. The paper adds to an existing foundation, but fails to make the case that this is a very significant addition. What is the significant consequence at a higher level of these added details?</p></disp-quote><p>We have completely rewritten the introduction and the discussion to emphasize the novelty of our results. Aside from demonstrating the role of SynGap, we also show that different signaling pathways contribute to different time frames of ERK activation. Thus, while ERK can respond to either spaced or massed stimulation (though we higher total activity with spaced), two of the pathways (RasGRF and Epac) are active early, SynGap is activated a bit later but prolonged, and the two other pathways are active later but transient (PKA and Gbg). These different time frames of ERK can serve allow temporal pattern discrimination. We now explain the consequence of temporal pattern discrimination in the discussion (444-492).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ERK pathway is just one component of a much larger set of pathways that control synaptic plasticity, how much do we learn from studying this pathway in isolation? Also, the paper cites the importance of this pathway to L-LTP, is it the induction phase of L-LTP? It seems so because ppRRK decays in less than an hour. How then does this pathway contribute to the maintenance of L-LTP, these processes such as a possible upregulation of protein synthesis are not part of this model either.</p></disp-quote><p>We now clarify in the introduction that ERK is involved in induction of L-LTP, which includes triggering the protein synthesis (lines 59-62) The evidence for ERK in maintenance phase has not been demonstrated. In fact, very few molecules, with the exception of atypical forms of PKC, are involved in maintenance. We now explain that our time frame of ERK activation is consistent with experiments, and that ERK is not needed for maintenance (418-426).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper studies in detail different pathways that influence ERK activation is synapses. This is a very detailed study, but how many details do we actually know? For a detailed paper though it seems that many of the details are missing. Is there a detailed diagram of reactions, or set of equations for all these reactions? Some coefficients are named in figure 1, and this might be sufficient for a schematic description of the model in the paper, however there must be somewhere a detailed description of all reactions. How many species are there here, how many coefficients? How are coefficient values known? How many coefficients are directly estimated? The paper does carry out an extensive robustness analysis, though it is not well explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide table of reactions and rate constants, which also indicate which coefficient values were known, and which were estimated (Figure 1 –Source Data 1-6). As is evident from these tables, very few of the coefficient values were changed.</p><p>We have re-worked the explanation of the robustness analysis (lines 366-370 and 604-609).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To summarize, the paper is very detailed carefully constructed and executed, it fails to convince that the problem it addresses is very significant, and it makes no conceptual breakthroughs.</p></disp-quote><p>The observation that different signaling pathways contribute to different time frames of ERK activation is a conceptual breakthrough in highlighting that, as observed in other cells, different ERK dynamics may have different functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The induction protocols seem to include not only calcium pulses, but also cAMP and g-protein coupled pulses, what is the cellular origin of these other pulses? Is the G protein activation due to β-adrenergic activation, is this activation necessary for plasticity? What is the cellular origin of the cAMP and Gi activation in slice? Similarly, what primarily activated cAMP in real synapses?</p></disp-quote><p>The cellular origin of these other pulses are Calcium, norepinephrine and dopamine. Both the locus coeruleus and the ventral tegmental area project to the hippocampus, and electrical stimulation is known to release norepinephrine, as explained in (Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017). Some early publications (Huang and Kandel, 1995) show that blocking dopamine will block L-LTP. Both Dopamine D1 and β-adrenergic activation produces GsGTP in the slice, which synergistically enhances the activation of adenylyl cyclase by calcium-calmodulin, to produce cAMP. I.e., in real synapses, both calcium and GsGTP produce cAMP. Regarding Gi activation, most of the research on Gs-Gi switching has been done in cell cultures (Daaka et al., 1997; Martin et al., 2004) however there is evidence that inactivated β adrenergic receptors can recruit ERK in the hippocampus (Havekes et al., 2012). The switching pathway is explained in Jȩdrzejewska-Szmek et al., 2017, and we summarize this in the methods, (lines 557-560).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is ERK required for all forms of LTP? Some references indicate it might not be. Is ERK necessary for early LTP induced by 100Hz stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified the difference between E-LTP and L-LTP (lines 52-58). Indeed, ERK is not required for E-LTP (Winder et al., 1999), hence we focus on induction protocols for L-LTP. We have now added simulations of E-LTP using 1 train of 100 Hz, and this shows that ppERK is much lower with these protocols.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I get lost in the details of the introduction, description of different pathways should be in results and relate to figure 1. It looks like a shopping list, why is this significant?</p></disp-quote><p>We have completely re-written the introduction and added more emphasis on the goal of our research, especially the importance of multiple pathway to ERK with respect to temporal pattern discrimination. We have removed many signaling pathways details and focus more on the relevant factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is it important that this is a stochastic diffusion reaction model rather than a deterministic model? Nothing about fluctuations, except for small error bars are mentioned in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>When we began this study, we did not know whether stochastic fluctuations would impact our results. We tested that by doing some simulations in very small compartments, but saw no differences (except for increased noise). Though we could have switched to deterministic, the stochastic algorithm is extremely fast, especially for stiff systems; thus, there would be no advantage to switching to a potentially less accurate deterministic simulator.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do not reference Zhang et al.

The figure is not showing the autophosphorylation of ppERK but shows the effect of CaMKII phosphorylation of SynGap on ERK activation. We now state on lines 197-199:</p><p>“Simulations reveal that persistent activation of ERK requires phosphorylation of SynGap by pCaMKII and dispersion of pSynGap to the dendrite (Figure 4F)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6B – hard to see shape of symbols.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the size of the symbols bigger (now Figure 7B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No model diagrams or equations here, for example how in CaMKII autophosphorylation implemented? Figure 6C – what is old CaMKII? They give a reference, but we do not know what the new model is.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a table with all reactions and rate constants. In summary, the new CamKII was created using automatic parameter optimization and fitting to time-course data of DeKoninck and Shulman, 1988. The reaction diagram also was modified slightly because NeuroRDv1 only allowed uni- and bi-molecular reactions, whereas NeuroRDv2 allowed higher-order reactions. In both cases, the higher-order phosphorylation reactions allow a single subunit model of CaMKII to exhibit a phosphorylation response of the dodecameric/hexameric in situ CaMKII. We have renamed this to alt CaMKII for alternative CaMKII model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Narrow picture by looking only at ERK. – For example, increasing PP1 can enhance ppERK, however it might reduce overall LTP due to dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors. What wins?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not explained the effect of PP1 concentration clearly. Increasing PP1 does not enhance ppERK; on the contrary, it reduces ERK activation (Figure 4D), because an increase in PP1 results in less phosphorylated CaMKII. Thus, PP1 would both reduce ppERK and reduce AMPA phosphorylation. This section was meant to show that PP1 concentration changes ppERK temporal sensitivity. We have now clarified that increasing PP1 reduces total ERK activity (Figure 4D), and it decreases the steepness of the ultrasensitivity of ppERK to calcium (Figure 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 – what in figure 7 shows super linearity? It's in the title, where else? This applies to paragraph starting in line 368 as well. Where do we see these results. We can try to eyeball it. It would be useful to show a plot of combined model/(sum of individual models). By eyeballing this it seems (but might be wrong) that the super-linearity is minimal.</p></disp-quote><p>We now add a statement in the caption (now Figure 8) that “Supralinearity is indicated by the response to the combination of cAMP and calcium (Combo) is greater than the sum of responses to calcium and cAMP separately.” In addition, we now plot contribution of each pathway separately, and show the sum of contributions exceeds 100% of the response to the combination (Figure 8C) to help show the supralinearity. We agree that the supralinearity is not dramatic. We have also enhanced our statistical analysis (Table 5) to provide a more complete picture of linear versus non-linear pathway interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>403 – the first time random-forest was mentioned in line 403, and this method is not explained or defined prior to this or even in this paragraph.

It would also be more instructive to show relative range changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide better explanation of parameter analysis and changed the presentation of the results. We now show relative change in ppERK, averaged across all ITIs, and the relative change in temporal sensitivity, quantified as the difference between maximum ppERK and minimum ppERK (across ITIs). Instead of showing the change for each parameter, we show a histogram of these values as better representing the robustness to parameter change. Using this presentation, we show that the temporal sensitivity of ppERK is quite robust, and in fact most of the parameter variations would increase, rather than decreasing temporal sensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How is this paper related to the recent Maki-Marttunen paper from the same lab which appeared recently</p><p>(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.921254v1.abstract), it is not referenced here.

If ERK is so significant how can it be excluded in one paper and included in another from the same lab?</p></disp-quote><p>Maki-Marttunen is studying STDP in the neocortex. There are several major differences between STDP and L-LTP. Protein synthesis dependence of STDP has not been demonstrated. This coupled with the duration of follow-up (1 hour or less due to using whole-cell patch) makes it is difficult to determine whether STDP corresponds to E-LTP or L-LTP. Regardless of whether STDP represents E-LTP or L-LTP, the requirement for ERK has not been shown. Because of the size of the synaptic plasticity field, we tried to limit our references to ERK-dependent plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion starts OK, but again devolves into excessive details.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now re-worked the discussion, removed many details, and focus most on important aspects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does this model possibly explain induction of L-LTP, or its maintenance phase?

We have updated out tables to include the experimental data sources used in the previous models, to show that many of the parameters were constrained by experimental data. In addition, we provide supplementary figures (Figure 2- supplementary Figure1) showing the fit of the model to data for CaMKII and SynGap (which are the results of parameter optimization), and cAMP-bound Epac and phosphorylation of PKA substrates (which are systems level validations). Since publication of time course data is not common, we are unable to provide direct validation of additional parameters. As the tables illustrate, most of the parameters come from well-validated models, in which parameters were constrained experimentally (e.g. Sasagawa et al., Nature Cell Biology, 2005) or which made predictions that were experimentally tested. The fact that those published parameters are sufficient to reproduce phosphoERK from additional published experiments (Figure 2B) provides yet another systems level validation for the parameters in the published models. Systems level validation is common with these types of models in part due to the difficulty in accurately measuring on rates (compared to affinity) using biochemical experiments.
