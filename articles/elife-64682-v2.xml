network composed of seven ‘master’ regulators and hundreds of target genes evolved over a span of approximately 70 million years. The network controls biofilm formation in several <italic>Candida</italic> species, a group of fungi that are present in humans both as constituents of the microbiota and as opportunistic pathogens. Using a variety of approaches, we observed two major types of changes that have occurred in the biofilm network since the four extant species we examined last shared a common ancestor. Master regulator ‘substitutions’ occurred over relatively long evolutionary times, resulting in different species having overlapping but different sets of master regulators of biofilm formation. Second, massive changes in the connections between the master regulators and their target genes occurred over much shorter timescales. We believe this analysis is the first detailed, empirical description of how a complex transcription network has evolved.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcriptional

<italic>Candida</italic> genus. These microbes are part of the human microbiota, but under specific circumstances — such as imbalances in components of the microbiota or suppression of the immune system of the host — they can proliferate as opportunistic pathogens and cause disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calderone and Clancy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turner and Butler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kullberg and Arendrup, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Romo and Kumamoto, 2020</xref>). These diseases, which were already documented by the ancient Greeks, range from mild cutaneous disorders to systemic infections with high mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lynch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calderone and Clancy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kullberg and Arendrup, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nobile and Johnson, 2015</xref>). Although they are usually studied in planktonic (suspension) cultures in the laboratory, <italic>Candida</italic> species, like many microbes, are often found in nature as biofilms, communities of cells associated with surfaces. For <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, the best studied and most clinically relevant of the <italic>Candida</italic> species, biofilms consist of a lower sheet of cells in the yeast form (spherical, budding cells) overlaid by a layer of filamentous cells (hyphae and pseudohyphae) and surrounded by an extracellular matrix composed of proteins and secreted polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blankenship and Mitchell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nobile and Johnson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lohse et al., 2018</xref>). The matrix, together with specific gene expression changes within biofilms (e.g., the upregulation of drug efflux pumps), provides protection from environmental stresses including antifungal drug treatment. The ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to form biofilms has been associated both with its versatility in occupying different niches in the human host and its inherent resistance to antifungal drugs. These features are especially important for individuals with implanted medical devices, which provide substrates for biofilm formation and where often the only effective treatment is replacement of the device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donlan, 2001</xref>). Biofilms also shed live yeast-form cells and thereby serve as reservoirs for further colonization in the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nobile and Johnson, 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation begins with the adhesion of yeast cells to a surface, followed by cell division and morphological differentiation to form an upper layer of filamentous cells. The biofilm matures through the secretion of the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blankenship and Mitchell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nobile and Johnson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lohse et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>C. albicans</italic>, a complex transcription network regulates this process; it consists of seven ‘master’ transcription regulators (Bcr1, Brg1, Efg1, Flo8, Ndt80, Rob1, and Tec1) that control each other’s expression and, collectively, bind to the control regions of more than a thousand target genes — around one-sixth of the total number of genes present in the genome of this species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox et al., 2015</xref>). All of the seven regulators appear to be positive regulators that are required for normal biofilm development. Despite the complexity of the biofilm regulatory network, several lines of evidence suggest that this network originated relatively recently. For example, genes that are highly expressed during biofilm formation are enriched for genes that are relatively young, meaning that they only have a clear ortholog in species closely related to <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>). Apart from the literature available for <italic>C. albicans</italic>, most of the work to understand biofilm formation in <italic>Candida</italic> species has been carried out with <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding and Butler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connolly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> diverged from a last common ancestor with <italic>C. albicans</italic> nominally 70 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mishra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2009</xref>). Although six of the seven master regulators of biofilm formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic> have clear orthologs in <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>, only two of them are required for biofilm formation in the latter species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Candida dubliniensis</italic> and <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> are more closely related to <italic>C. albicans</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and are also known to form biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ramage et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pujol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araújo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dominguez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumari et al., 2018</xref>), but the regulatory circuits that control this process are largely unknown.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The biofilm transcription network in <italic>Candida albicans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The seven master transcription regulators identified in genetic screens and the interactions among them as determined by ChIP-chip and ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox et al., 2015</xref>).

A comparison of the extant networks showed that the two main components of the network, master regulators and target genes, moved in and out of the network at very different rates over evolutionary time.

The large-scale changes in connections observed between closely related species did not appear to have a major impact on biofilm phenotypes, at least as monitored <italic>in vitro</italic>.

This clade, which includes but extends beyond <italic>Candida</italic> species, was traditionally named CTG due to its unusual property of decoding the CTG codon as serine instead of the usual leucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Recently, this clade has been renamed CTG-Ser1 because other Ascomycota clades were discovered to also have unusual codon usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krassowski et al., 2018</xref>). To define an optimal growth medium for these assays, we tested biofilm formation under several conditions typically used to study biofilms of <italic>Candida</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">García-Sánchez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Richard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kucharíková et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lohse et al., 2017</xref>). For the initial tests, we focused on <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the three species that are most closely related to it and that commonly inhabit humans, <italic>C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis,</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turner and Butler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gabaldón et al., 2016</xref>). The estimated divergence time for <italic>C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis,</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> from the last common ancestor with <italic>C. albicans</italic> is approximately 20, 45, and 70 million years, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mishra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moran et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. tropicalis,</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> have been previously shown to form biofilms, while less is known about biofilm formation in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araújo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dominguez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumari et al., 2018</xref>). Biofilms were grown <italic>in vitro</italic> on silicone squares at 37°C for 48 hr with shaking and were monitored by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM), as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>). We tested eight different growth media, and only Spider medium with glucose (rather than mannitol) as the carbon source allowed all four species to form thick, well-structured biofilms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Our results also showed that environmental conditions are important determinants of biofilm formation for some of these species. While <italic>C. albicans</italic> formed thick biofilms in all media tested, <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> biofilm formation, for example, depended very much on carbon source (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).</p><p>Given that there could be differences in the speed at which different species form biofilms, we also assessed biofilm formation as a function of time for the same four species. Biofilms were formed as described above and were monitored at seven different time points from 30 min to 96 hr after cell adhesion under the confocal microscope. Although <italic>C. albicans</italic> formed biofilms more rapidly, by 48 hr all four species had formed mature biofilms that did not significantly change at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Once we had defined an optimal biofilm growth medium (Spider + glucose) and time point (48 hr), we extended our analysis to other species of the CTG clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maguire et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to CSLM as described above, we monitored biofilm formation in two additional ways: we determined the biomass dry weight of biofilms formed on the bottoms of polystyrene plates, and, using a microfluidic flow cell, we continuously monitored biofilm formation by time-lapse photography using an optical microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lohse et al., 2017</xref>). The three methods are complementary: biomass determination is a quantitative method that reduces biofilm formation to a single number, confocal microscopy is qualitative, but allows detailed characterization of the structure of the biofilm, and the microfluidic assay reveals biofilm formation in real time under a defined flow; the flow rate was adjusted to mimic that of an average catheter implanted in a vein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gulati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lohse et al., 2017</xref>). Because some of the species we tested are known to grow poorly at 37°C, we performed the assays at 30°C for those species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurtzman et al., 2011</xref>). Although not all species were tested in the three assays, overall, of the 15 species analyzed, those closest to <italic>C. albicans</italic> formed the thickest biofilms and, in general, the greater the phylogenetic distance from <italic>C. albicans</italic> the thinner the biofilm formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Only the two species closest to <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>) formed biofilms that are structurally very similar to <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms, with a basal layer of yeast cells underlying a thick layer of filamentous cells (hyphae and pseudohyphae). Biofilms formed by <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> appeared similar at low resolution, but a closer examination showed that the layer of filamentous cells is composed largely of pseudohyphae rather than a mixture of true hyphae and pseudohyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Under these conditions, <italic>Lodderomyces elongisporus</italic> formed thinner biofilms composed only of yeast cells. Moving further away from <italic>C. albicans, Spathaspora passalidarum, Meyerozyma guilliermondii,</italic> and <italic>Clavispora lusitaniae</italic> form even thinner biofilms, while <italic>Scheffersomyces stipites, Debaryomyces hansenii, Metschnikowia bicuspidate, Hyphopichia burtonii,</italic> and <italic>Candida tenuis</italic> did not form biofilms under the conditions we tested; only a few cells were observed adhering to the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also performed CSLM assays in an additional medium (RPMI) with a selection of the species, and the results generally agreed with those described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our results with the microfluidic assays showed a similar trend: only those species that are phylogenetically closest to <italic>C. albicans</italic> were able to rapidly form biofilms under flow conditions in the microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>As a reference, we also characterized biofilm formation in two other ascomycetous yeast species that lie outside the CTG clade, <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Although not closely related to the CTG clade (despite its name), <italic>C. glabrata</italic> is an important opportunistic human pathogen, while <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is used extensively in the food and beverage industries and is a widely employed model organism. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, neither of these species formed biofilms that resembled those formed by <italic>C. albicans</italic> and its close relatives in the assays and conditions that we tested.</p><p>To assess whether the results observed <italic>in vitro</italic> can be recapitulated <italic>in vivo</italic>, we tested the ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis,</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> to form biofilms in the rat catheter model, a well-established <italic>in vivo</italic> biofilm model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andes et al., 2004</xref>). All four species were able to form biofilms, although the biofilms formed by <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> were considerably thicker and more filamentous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results agree with previous <italic>in vivo</italic> characterizations performed for <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connolly et al., 2013</xref>) and provide new information on the intermediate species.</p><p>In summary, our results show that the ability to form biofilms that resemble those of <italic>C. albicans</italic> is limited to its most closely related species. In terms of biomass, there is a sharp drop off outside <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> while, in terms of biofilm structure, only <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> form biofilms similar to those of <italic>C. albicans,</italic> in terms of all three morphological cell types being represented. Of all the species studied, <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation is the most rapid and most robust to environmental changes as it formed similar biofilms in all media tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>); moreover, the biofilms formed by this species are the most stable to physical manipulation (results not shown). When interpreting these results, it is important to note that the biofilm assays employed here have been developed for <italic>C. albicans</italic> and its closely related species. Therefore, it is possible that our observations may not only reflect differences in the intrinsic ability to form biofilms, but could also be due to changes in the ways the species have adapted to the different environments they inhabit. The species that were not observed to form biofilms in our study could, in principle, be able to form biofilms in other conditions, but, to our knowledge, there is no evidence for this even in well-studied species such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The regulatory core of the biofilm transcription network changed gradually over time</title><p>To gain insight into the evolutionary changes that occurred in the transcription network that controls biofilm formation at a molecular level, we first studied the function of the seven master regulators of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given the phenotypic results described above, we centered the analysis on <italic>C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis,</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>. All four of these species are common in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turner and Butler, 2014</xref>), and the first three form similar structural types of biofilms. As described above, <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> also forms biofilms, but its biofilms show more pronounced differences. All seven master regulators of the network in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) have clear orthologs in the other three closely related species, with the exception of Rob1. Rob1 has a patchy phylogenetic distribution, with syntenic orthologs present in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. dubiniensis,</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, but apparently absent from <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> and closely related species. However, Rob1 orthologs are present in other more distantly related CTG species, which supports the hypothesis that Rob1 was either lost or was evolving sufficiently rapidly in the <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> lineage that it cannot be recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maguire et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the orthologs of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> master regulators are involved in biofilm formation in the other species, we generated gene deletion knockouts in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>. The knockouts in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> had been previously generated as part of large transcription regulator deletion projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Homann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2014</xref>). To make the knockouts in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis,</italic> we used amino acid auxotrophic strains and employed a gene knockout strategy similar to that previously used for <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mancera et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The ability of the different gene knockout strains to form biofilms was monitored by biomass dry weight determination and CSLM. As can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, all seven master regulators identified in <italic>C. albicans</italic> were also required for biofilm formation in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>. The results were different for <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>; here, only five of the seven were required, with Rob1 and Flo8 appearing dispensable for biofilm formation under our laboratory conditions. The biofilms formed by the <italic>rob1</italic> and <italic>flo8</italic> deletion mutants in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> were actually slightly heavier and the hyphal layer was denser than biofilms formed by the parental (wildtype) strain, suggesting that these two regulators may have assumed a subtle inhibitory role in this species. For <italic>C. parapsilosis,</italic> it was previously shown that, of the seven master biofilm regulators in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, only Bcr1 and Efg1 are indispensable for biofilm formation. The Ntd80 deletion in <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> fails to form biofilms but also has a general growth defect, making it difficult to ascertain its precise role. Previous work also established that deletion of <italic>CZF1</italic>, <italic>UME6</italic>, <italic>CPH2</italic>, <italic>GZF3,</italic> and <italic>ACE2</italic> all exhibit biofilm-specific defects in <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> but not in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, our results, together with previous observations, show that the group of master regulators underlying biofilm formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic> is different than in other <italic>Candida</italic> species with the degree of difference roughly paralleling their evolutionary distance from <italic>C. albicans.</italic></p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Roles of orthologs of the seven <italic>C. albicans</italic> master regulators in biofilm formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phenotypic characterization of biofilms formed by the gene deletion knockouts of orthologs of the seven master <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm regulators.

To this end, we tagged each of the regulators with a Myc epitope tag that can be immunoprecipitated using a commercially available antibody. This strategy has the advantage that a single antibody with the same affinity could be used in all experiments, and control experiments could be performed with untagged strains. All the ChIP-seq experiments were performed in mature biofilms grown for 48 hr at 37°C in the optimal medium described above. For unknown technical reasons, not all regulators could be immunoprecipitated in all species. Of all the ChIP-seq experiments performed, protein-DNA interactions could be reliably determined for 18 regulators across the four species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). We believe that this coverage, although not complete, is more than sufficient to uncover the general trends of biofilm network evolution. In the following sections, we consider how the biofilm network (defined as the set of master regulators and connections between them and their target genes) differs among <italic>Candida</italic> species and what these differences reveal about the evolution of the network.</p><p>To compare gene targets between species, we assigned each ChIP occupancy site to the ORF with the nearest downstream start codon. To compare the changes in master regulator-target gene connections across species, we first examined the target genes that are conserved across the species. The overall percentage of one-to-one orthologs between the four species ranged from a high of 91% between <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> to a low of 74% between <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maguire et al., 2013</xref>). If we consider only the one-to-one orthologs, it becomes clear that the connections between master regulators and conserved target genes vary greatly across these species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Between the two most closely related species (<italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>), the master regulator that showed the highest conservation of target gene connections was Ndt80, but the overlap was only about 50% (634 of 1,297). Between <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis,</italic> this value drops to about 26% (722 of 2,725). Although only 12% (371 of 3,016) of Ndt80 target gene connections are common to all four species, the overlap for each species pair is larger than expected by chance (hypergeometric test, p&lt;0.05). This conclusion does not necessarily mean that selective constraints preserve such overlaps over evolutionary time. Although selection could be responsible, drift is also a possible explanation, particularly given the phylogenetic proximity of the species. The other master regulators show an even lower degree of conserved regulator-target gene connections. For example, Rob1 shares only about 12% (2 of 17) of its target gene connections between the two most related species, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis,</italic> but the overlap is still greater than expected by chance (hypergeometric test, p&lt;0.05).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Connections between master regulators and target genes are highly divergent across species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pairwise comparison of shared target genes for Ndt80, Efg1, and Rob1 between species.

Although the gross number of regulator-target gene connections decreased as the stringency of the filtering criteria increased, the high proportion of differences across <italic>Candida</italic> species described above did not significantly change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Another potential caveat that could confound our analysis concerns our conclusions being based on the specific conditions under which we induced biofilm formation. To test whether this concern is significant, we performed the ChIP-seq experiments for Ndt80 in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. dubliniensis,</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> in biofilms grown in an alternative growth media. In all species, the binding intensities of the regulator in all the intergenic regions of the genome were highly correlated between the two media tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This finding indicates that there are no significant changes in Ndt80 binding when the growth media is modified.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>High connectivity of the biofilm network is observed in all four species</title><p>The initial characterization of the biofilm transcription circuit in <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed that many target genes were directly connected (by binding) to more than one master regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>), and this general feature of the network architecture is observed across the <italic>Candida</italic> species studied here, despite the low conservation of individual regulator-target gene connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Perhaps the most notable example is seen by comparing the target genes of Ndt80 and Efg1 across the four species. The set of target genes of Ndt80 is considerably larger, but over 75% of the Efg1 target genes are also Ndt80 targets in all four species. In addition, the binding motifs of these two regulators are enriched in each other’s binding locations in all four species studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These observations indicate that, in all species, Efg1 binds in conjunction with Ndt80 even though the target genes of the regulator combination differ greatly across species. The association between Efg1 and Ndt80 agrees with previous planktonic ChIP-seq experiments of Efg1 performed in <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> where the most enriched binding motif found was that of Ndt80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connolly et al., 2013</xref>). The DNA-binding motifs of these two regulators have also been shown to co-occur in the binding regions of Sfl1 and Sfl2, two regulators of filamentation in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Znaidi et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the Efg1-Ndt80 association is ancient with respect to the <italic>Candida</italic> species studied here and that it remains preserved across them despite large species-to-species differences in the target genes bound by the two regulators. Analysis of the other master regulators indicates that combinational control of target genes is very common in all species, although the other examples do not seem as deeply conserved as the Efg1-Ndt8o example.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Master regulators retain their DNA-binding specificity while there is considerable variation in gene expression across species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Logos of the most enriched motif in the binding locations of the different master regulators, determined by ChIP-seq across species.

The extent of conservation of the binding connections between one master regulator and the others varies from regulator to regulator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), with Ndt80 showing the highest conservation. In all four species, Ndt80 binds to its own control region as well as those of all six other regulators, with the exception of the control region of <italic>FLO8</italic> in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>ROB1</italic> in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>. Efg1, Brg1, and Tec1, in that order, follow Ndt80 in their degree of connection conservation, with Rob1 and Bcr1 having the least conserved set of connections. However, we note that the binding data for these two regulators is also the least complete (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Ndt80 and Efg1 each bind to their own control regions in all the four species analyzed, while Brg1 exhibits this interaction only in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>. The binding of the other regulators to their own upstream intergenic regions appears less conserved. Overall, our findings show that high connectivity between the master regulators is conserved in the four <italic>Candida</italic> species analyzed. Thus, despite the extensive changes in the network across species, the high connectivity among regulators remains a structural feature of the network in each species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Changes in master regulator-target gene interactions are due to changes in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions</title><p>A possible mechanistic explanation for the high rates of change among the target genes of the biofilm network is that these changes are due to modifications in the <italic>trans</italic> components of the network, for example, changes in the DNA-binding specificity of a master regulator. This type of change has the potential to dramatically change the network over relatively short evolutionary timescales. To explore this possibility, we examined the ChIP-seq binding data for motifs recognized by the master regulators. Performing <italic>de novo</italic> motif searches, we found that the enriched DNA-binding motifs found in the binding regions of the biofilm master regulators were very similar across the four species we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>de novo</italic> generated DNA-binding motifs for Efg1 and Ndt80 are similar to those previously reported for their orthologs in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nocedal et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As an additional test of whether the DNA-binding specificity of the regulators changed over the evolutionary time considered here, we used the <italic>de novo</italic> motifs generated from the ChIP-seq data for Efg1 or Ndt80 in each species and identified the occurrence of these motifs in the upstream regions of the orthologous genes from the other species. The overlap of potential targets between species varied from 51 to 100% depending on the exact motif used, but was never low enough to account for the differences determined directly from the ChIP-seq experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For example, the lowest overlap observed when using motif scoring was of 51% for the Efg1 motifs in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> compared with <italic>C. parapsilosis,</italic> while the actual gene target overlap of ChIP-seq data for this regulator was only 13% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In other words, the large differences in regulator-target interactions across species observed in the ChIP-seq data cannot be accounted for by slight differences in the binding motifs generated in each individual species. Although we cannot fully disregard that small differences in binding affinity contribute to differences in master regulator-target gene connections observed across the species, overall, all the analyses show that the DNA-binding specificity of at least some of the master regulators has not changed significantly across these species. This conclusion is further supported by analysis of a <italic>C. albicans–C. dubliniensis</italic> hybrid, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Biofilm-specific gene expression changed rapidly over evolutionary time</title><p>A strong prediction of the vast number of species-to-species differences in master regulator-target gene connections documented above is that the genes transcriptionally induced during biofilm formation should differ substantially among species. To test this prediction, we generated genome-wide transcription profiles of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. dubliniensis,</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> under biofilm-forming conditions. To reveal biofilm-specific changes, we compared these profiles to expression data obtained when the species were grown in suspension cultures in the same medium. As a reference, we also performed the biofilm expression profile in a second <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolate. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the pairwise differences in the transcription profiles across the three species are significant and reflect their phylogenetic position: the further apart the two species are from one another, the less correlated their transcription profiles are. If we use a lax cutoff of twofold over/underexpression to define genes that change their expression during biofilm formation, the overlap between pairs of species is relatively low. For example, only 29% of the genes that change their expression during biofilm formation are shared between <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, and only 24% are shared between <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>. The overlap of differentially expressed genes between the two <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates was 48%. This result is consistent with previous work showing that clinical isolates differ in their biofilm-forming abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirakawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). As noted in the 'Discussion', we believe that many of the differences among clinical strains arose after the <italic>C. albicans–C. dubliniensis</italic> branch.</p><p>To test whether the large differences in the gene expression profiles were specific to the media conditions used, we also performed the transcription profiles in different media, namely Spider for <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, and RPMI for <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>. In the alternative media, the conservation between the sets of genes that changed their expression at least twofold during biofilm formation is even lower, 22 and 11%, respectively, for <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, and <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>. Despite these major differences, all the interspecific pairwise overlaps are greater than would be expected by chance (hypergeometric test, p&lt;&lt;0.05), although we cannot distinguish if this is due primarily to selection or to the shared ancestry of their promoter sequences. Overall, the low degree of conservation in genome-wide gene expression agrees well with the low conservation of regulator-target gene connections across species described above.</p><p>To further understand the relationship between gene expression and the binding of the biofilm regulators in each species, we assessed whether differentially expressed genes were directly bound by the biofilm regulators. Considering genes that change their expression at least twofold during biofilm formation in the same conditions in which the ChIP-seq experiments were performed, the fraction of these genes bound by one or more regulators ranges from 30% in <italic>C. albicans</italic> to 51% in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>. Combining our data with previous transcriptional profiling experiments performed in <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> during biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2014</xref>), we estimated that 67% of differently expressed genes in this species were bound by at least one of the biofilm regulators under the experimental conditions tested. The overlap between differential gene expression and regulator binding in all species is larger than what would be expected by chance (hypergeometric test, p&lt;&lt;0.05), suggesting that direct binding is an important factor in gene regulation in the biofilm network.</p><p>DNA binding of a regulator is not expected to always produce a change in mRNA production, but we did observe a correlation between these two properties. Pairwise comparisons of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. dubliniensis,</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> showed that most genes that are expressed differentially between species (as defined above) are genes whose intergenic region is bound by at least one regulator in one species, but not in the other species. This association is statistically significant (Fisher’s two-tailed exact test, p&lt;&lt;0.05) again suggesting that the majority of differences in biofilm-specific gene expression between species can be explained by differences in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences of target genes that alter binding of the regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Analysis of an interspecies hybrid independently supports the conclusions from the species-to-species comparisons</title><p>Many challenges exist in mapping and comparing regulator-target gene connections in transcription networks between yeast species and, more generally, between any species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). These difficulties include technical issues such as differential nucleic acid recovery and signal-to-noise ratios, which can vary considerably from one species to the next. However, probably the most difficult problem to circumvent arises from different species having different physiological responses to the same external environment. For example, 30°C could be the optimal temperature for one species but might induce a stress response in a closely related species. Therefore, a network comparison between these species at 30°C might be dominated not by evolutionary changes in the transcription circuitry per se but simply by the fact that only one species has induced a stress response. This problem can be overcome to a large extent by creating and analyzing interspecies hybrids, where the genomes of two different species are present in the same cell and thus exposed to the same physiological state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>). This approach, which can only be carried out between closely related species, specifically reveals the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes that have accumulated between the two genomes since the species last shared a common ancestor.</p><p>We took advantage of the fact that it is possible to mate <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> (each diploid) to generate tetraploid hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pujol et al., 2004</xref>). These hybrids form biofilms similar to those formed by <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We performed ChIP-seq of Ndt80 in this hybrid, immunoprecipitating the <italic>C. albicans</italic> Ndt80 protein in one set of experiments and the <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> Ndt80 in another set. The results showed that — in the hybrid — the target genes bound by the <italic>C. albicans</italic> Ndt80 and the <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> Ndt80 were highly correlated, similar to two biological replicates carried out in the same species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In other words, we obtained the same target genes in the hybrid regardless of which Ndt80 was tagged for immunoprecipitation. Importantly, the binding positions on the <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> genome in the hybrid were characteristic of the results in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, specifically 97% of the targets in the hybrid are targets in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, and the positions on the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome were characteristic of <italic>C. albicans</italic> with 96% of the targets in the hybrid being targets in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Although we only carried out this experiment with one master regulator, the results independently validate our earlier conclusions based on the much more extensive species-to-species comparisons. These observations confirm our previous conclusion that the extreme differences in regulator-target gene connections observed across these <italic>Candida</italic> species are due to changes in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences in the target genes rather than changes in the regulators themselves or differences in the physiological state of the species at the time of analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Ndt80 ChIP-seq in a hybrid and rate of conservation change of the different network components.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome-wide comparison of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> Ndt80 binding in the hybrid strain.

The phenotype is biofilm formation by <italic>Candida</italic> species, a group of fungi that colonize humans, sometimes leading to disease. We documented phenotypic differences in biofilm formation across many fungal species and mapped the transcriptional networks underlying biofilm formation in four of them, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, <italic>C. tropicalis,</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>. All four species form complex biofilms both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in a rat catheter model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Using <italic>C. albicans</italic> as a reference species, our analysis leads to the following five main conclusions. (1) As we move away from <italic>C. albicans</italic>, biofilms become less complex, both in terms of structure and of composition; that is, fewer cell types are involved and the resulting biofilm is less regular. At larger evolutionary distances, fungal species did not form biofilms at all under the conditions we tested. (2) Of the seven master transcriptional regulators of biofilm formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, all seven are needed in the most closely related species (<italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>), but, as we move further away evolutionarily, fewer are required for biofilm formation. For example, two of the master regulators (Rob1 and Flo8) are dispensable for biofilm formation in the next most closely related species (<italic>C. tropicalis)</italic>, and three of the seven are not required in <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>. As shown by Holland and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2014</xref>), other transcriptional regulators (present in <italic>C. albicans</italic> but not required for biofilm formation in this species) have assumed the role of master regulators in <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>. If other master biofilm regulators exist in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and are identified in the future, their analysis in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> will allow a more complete model of the biofilm regulatory network across the four species considered here. (3) In contrast to the relatively slow evolutionary substitutions of master regulators, the connections between the master regulators and their target genes have changed very rapidly over evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This conclusion is most obvious when we compare the two most closely related species, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, estimated to have last shared a common ancestor 20 million years ago. Depending on the regulator, fewer than 50% of the master regulator-target gene connections were observed to be conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This conclusion was independently verified for one regulator — Ndt80 — by analyzing its binding distribution across the two genomes in a <italic>C. albicans–C. dubliniensis</italic> hybrid; here, the binding distribution of Ndt80 across one genome differed considerably from that of the other, and each resembled that seen in the cognate individual species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This result strongly supports the conclusion that the differences in regulator-target gene connections across species are due largely to changes in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences of the target genes rather than changes in the regulators. (4) As predicted from the extensive changes in regulator-target gene connections, mRNA expression during biofilm formation differs considerably from one species to the next. Like the other changes we have documented in this paper, mRNA expression divergence becomes greater as the phylogenetic distance increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). (5) Despite the extensive changes in the transcription networks underlying biofilm formation across the species we examined, several key features of the overall architecture of the network appear to be preserved. For example, all species show high connectivity in the sense that many target genes are directly connected (by binding) to more than one master regulator. The high connectivity observed is dominated by the DNA binding of Ndt80 and Efg1, and we note that these regulators are also involved in several other cellular functions and have been suggested to cooperatively regulate their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sellam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Znaidi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mancera et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, many of the master regulators bind to their own control regions as well as those of the other master regulators. We have argued elsewhere that these two features are likely to be common to many complex transcription networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sorrells and Johnson, 2015</xref>), and the results presented here show that, despite many changes in individual regulator-target connections, the basic ‘structural features’ of the network are preserved across the biofilm networks of the four species examined.</p><p>The large amount of new genome-wide protein-DNA interaction and gene expression data reported here will be useful in future studies of biofilm formation in these <italic>Candida</italic> species. Very few ‘structural’ genes have been implicated in biofilm formation, and the ChIP-seq and transcriptional profiling results obtained across species could greatly facilitate the identification of key non-regulatory genes required for biofilm formation. For example, specific master regulator-target gene connections that are preserved across multiple species may point to target genes that are notably important for biofilm formation in these <italic>Candida</italic> species. Such a hypothesis could be tested in future studies by deleting these target genes of interest and assessing their roles in biofilm formation across species.</p><p>To place our findings in context, it is also instructive to compare our analyses of biofilm formation across species with recent studies where biofilm formation has been analyzed across different isolates of a single species, <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirakawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirakawa et al., 2015</xref> determined the genome sequences of 21 clinical isolates of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and examined their abilities to form biofilms. The genome comparisons revealed many differences among strains including aneuploidies, losses of heterozygosity, and mutations in coding sequences; moreover, the strains differed substantially in their abilities to form biofilms. Among the strains analyzed, the one used in our study (SC5314) was among the thickest biofilm producers as assayed by dry weight; the majority of isolates formed thinner biofilms. One clinical isolate that formed very poor biofilms was found to have an inactivating mutation in <italic>EFG1</italic>, one of the biofilm master regulators, indicating a relatively recent change. Because the <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> strain used in our study (CD36) formed biofilms that are similar to those of strain SC5314, we believe that SC5314 is a good representative of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and that most of the clinical isolates probably acquired mutations (including aneuploidies and losses of heterozygosity) relatively recently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2019</xref> examined five of the previously sequenced strains in much more detail including the dependence on individual transcriptional regulators for biofilm formation. Although the magnitude of the effect of transcriptional regulator deletions on biofilm formation varied across strains, SC5314 again appears to be a good representation of the ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> as a species to form thick, complex biofilms.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine in detail how a complex transcription network changes over a relatively short evolutionary time — 70 million years — represented by four different species. During that time, the master transcription regulators controlling biofilm formation have undergone slow substitutions, but their connections to the target genes they control have changed rapidly. We do not know which, if any, of these changes were adaptive; in this regard, it is important to note that, although the biofilms produced by the <italic>Candida</italic> species have many similarities, they do differ from species to species in at least subtle aspects. Even considering the two most closely related species (<italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>), it is possible to distinguish their biofilms. Although they appear very similar under the confocal microscope, the <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilms form faster and under a greater range of conditions; once formed, they are more difficult to disrupt than those of <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>. Although these differences may help to explain why <italic>C. albicans</italic> is a greater problem in the clinic than <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, it is difficult to reconcile these subtle differences in phenotype with the large differences in the underlying transcriptional circuitry. Given the large magnitude of changes underlying such similar phenotypic output, we propose as a default hypothesis that many of the changes in transcription circuitry result from neutral evolution, more specifically, constructive neutral evolution whereby molecular complexity can change without an increase in fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stoltzfus, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wagner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sorrells and Johnson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunet and Doolittle, 2018</xref>). This study clearly shows that complex transcription networks responsible for the same basic phenotype can undergo evolutionary changes that appear much greater in magnitude than the resulting differences in phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Characterization of biofilm formation</title><p>Visualization of biofilms by CSLM of the different species and strains was performed on silicone squares as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>).

For each of the four species observed (<italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis,</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>), seven independent silicone squares were used for biofilm formation as described above and the biofilms at each square were visualized at 30 min, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 96 hr after the adhesion phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Determination of the biomass dry weight of biofilms of the different species and strains was performed by growing biofilms on the bottoms of 6-well polystyrene plates pretreated with BSA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>). The cells were adhered for 90 min. These assays were performed in a modified Spider medium that contained 1% glucose rather than mannitol as the carbon source. After 48 hr of biofilm formation, supernatants were aspirated and biofilms were scraped and placed to dry on top of a filter paper. Dried biofilms were weighed on an analytic scale subtracting the weight of a filter paper in which the media without cells was filtered. Five technical replicates were performed per strain as it has been previously done for large screens using this assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>). As was performed for CSLM visualization, strains that do not grow well at 37°C were grown at 30°C.</p><p>Biofilm formation in a Bioflux microfluidic device (Fluxion Biosciences) was assayed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gulati et al., 2017</xref>). The medium used was Spider with 1% glucose and without mannitol, and assays were performed at 37 and 30°C for 24 hr.</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic> biofilm formation assays were performed using the rat central-venous catheter infection model as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andes et al., 2004</xref>). After 24 hr of infection by the four species tested, biofilm formation on the intraluminal surface of the catheters was observed by scanning electron microscopy.

Construction of these strains was performed using the <italic>SAT1</italic> flipper strategy as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mancera et al., 2019</xref>). All the strains employed and generated in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>. In brief, the two alleles of each regulator in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> were subsequently deleted using the <italic>C. albicans HIS1</italic> and <italic>LEU2</italic> genes. In <italic>C. tropicalis,</italic> the first allele was deleted using the <italic>C. albicans LEU2</italic> gene while the second was deleted using the <italic>CaHygB</italic> gene that confers resistance to hygromycin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basso et al., 2010</xref>). To generate the gene deletion cassettes, ~350 bp flanking 5′ and 3′ regions of each regulator were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and fused to the corresponding auxotrophic/drug resistance marker by fusion PCR. Transformation was performed by electroporation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Porman et al., 2011</xref>). Verification of correct integration of the gene deletion cassettes was performed by colony PCR with primers directed to both flanks of the disrupted gene. Final gene deletion confirmation was performed by colony PCR with primers that anneal at the ORF of each regulator. Two independent isolates of each deletion mutant originating from two separate transformations were generated for each regulator deletion. The regulator knockout strains of <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> had been previously generated as part of efforts to generate collections of regulator gene knockout strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Homann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holland et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing</title><p>ChIP-seq to identify the target genes of the seven regulators was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernday et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lohse and Johnson, 2016</xref>) and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2500 or 4000 platforms. Each of the seven regulators in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> was tagged in the wildtype strain background with a 13× Myc epitope tag at the C-terminus from the pADH34 or pEM019 plasmids, respectively, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernday et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mancera et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> Myc-tagged strains had been similarly generated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> Brg1, Ndt80, and Tec1 were tagged using a 6× C-terminal Myc tag amplified from plasmid pFA-MYC-HIS1 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connolly et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> Efg1 had been previously tagged with the same 6× C-terminal Myc epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connolly et al., 2013</xref>). We were not able to tag the regulator Bcr1 in this species. Genotype details for all the strains generated and used are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>. All the tagged regulator strains were tested for their abilities to form biofilms on the bottoms of 6-well polystyrene plates as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>), and no biofilm defects were observed.</p><p>To generate the <italic>C. albicans</italic>/<italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>-tagged hybrid strains, the α or <bold>a</bold> allele of the mating-type-like (<italic>MTL</italic>) locus was deleted in the Ndt80-tagged strains described above. These deletions allowed the strains to become capable of white-opaque switching, and thus mating competent. In <italic>C. albicans,</italic> the α allele of the <italic>MTL</italic> locus was deleted by replacing it with <italic>ARG4</italic> using the plasmid pJD1 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lohse et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>C. dubliniensis,</italic> the <bold>a</bold> allele of the <italic>MTL</italic> locus was deleted using a cassette containing the <italic>SAT1</italic> nourseothricin resistance marker from plasmid pSFS2A flanked by ~300 bp homology regions identical to the 3′ and 5′ upstream/downstream regions of the <italic>MTL</italic> locus. pSFS2A is a plasmid derived from pSFS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reuss et al., 2004</xref>) that contains the <italic>SAT1</italic> reusable cassette in the backbone of vector pBC SK+ instead of pBluescript II KS and that was kindly provided by Joachim Morschhauser (U. Würzburg). The deletion of the α or <bold>a</bold> alleles was verified by colony PCR of the two flanks. Generation of the hybrid strains was done by overlaying the mating competent wildtype and Myc-tagged strains on a YPD plate for 48 hr at 30°C. Single colonies were then streaked out and hybrids were selected by growing on media containing nourseothricin and lacking arginine. The hybrid strains were further verified measuring DNA content using FACS. As controls, the two wildtype untagged mating competent strains were hybridized.</p><p>All immunoprecipitation experiments were performed under biofilm growth conditions in 6-well polystyrene plates as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nobile et al., 2012</xref>). After 48 hr of biofilm growth in Spider 1% glucose at 37°C and 200 rpm, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. Cell disruption and immunoprecipitation were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernday et al., 2010</xref>) using a c-Myc tag monoclonal antibody (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2536303">AB_2536303</ext-link>). After crosslink reversal, instead of performing a phenol/chloroform extraction, we used a MiniElute QIAGEN kit to purify the immunoprecipitated DNA. Library preparation for Illumina sequencing was performed using an NEBNext ChIP-Seq Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina sequencing. Between 12 and 24 samples were multiplexed per lane. As controls, immunoprecipitations were performed in matched strains that lacked the Myc tag. In agreement with the ChIP-seq guidelines and practices of the ENCODE consortia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landt et al., 2012</xref>), two biological replicates were performed for each regulator in the four species.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Identification of regulator directly bound target genes by ChIP-seq</title><p>ChIP-seq reads were mapped to their corresponding genome using Bowtie 2 with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>).

The SAMtools package was used to convert, sort, and index the sequenced reads to BAM format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2009</xref>). We observed that the peak calling algorithm was more specific and sensitive if the number of reads in the treatment and control datasets was similar. Therefore, we adjusted the number of reads in the different treatment-control dataset pairs using SAMtools view -s function prior to peak calling. Peak calling was performed using MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) with a q-value cutoff of 0.01; the shiftsize parameter was determined using the SPP package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kharchenko et al., 2008</xref>). Peaks were considered as true binding events only if the peak was identified in both biological replicates.

To determine enrichment of these consensus motifs in peaks identified for each ChIP-seq experiment, the number of consensus motifs in the union of the sequence under the peaks of both biological replicates was compared to the number of motifs in intergenic regions for that species. A Fisher’s one-tailed exact test was performed to generate a p-value representing enrichment of the motif in peaks compared to equivalent length random intergenic sequences.</p><p>To determine potential gene targets based on motif presence, we scored the presence of the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA-binding motifs of Efg1 or Ndt80 generated for each species described above in all the intergenic regions of the four species using the Motif scoring function of MochiView (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Homann and Johnson, 2010</xref>). Potential gene targets were defined as those having at least one motif in their upstream intergenic region.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bin He (Reviewer #1); Mira Edgerton (Reviewer #2); Sadri Znaidi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mancera and colleagues examine the evolution of the regulatory circuitry involved in biofilm formation in Candida and other closely related species. Using a combination of genomics approaches that they apply in a comparative manner across closely related species, they show that this network has changed significantly while some features have been conserved.</p><p>Three experts with complementary expertise have evaluated your manuscript. They all identified key issues that would need to be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript. I added the list of comments below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The first reviewer suggests many approaches that would help anchor the results and analysis in an evolutionary framework. Some of them are critical to the paper, for instance considering the species non-independence when performing comparative analysis. Other issues related to statistical analysis are also critical. The changes requested will significantly strengthen the quality and impact of your work.</p><p>2. One reviewer was more critical about the inclusion of more distantly related species because the conditions associated with biofilm formation differ for those. However, another reviewer found these experiments important. I suggest you keep them in the paper but include a discussion of these points in the manuscript.</p><p>3. The third reviewer suggests ways in which the text can be clarified and made easier to follow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This work produced highly valuable phenotypic and molecular binding datasets for an important phenotype, namely biofilm formation, which will have significant impact both for the medical community in terms of better understanding and potentially advancing the treatment for candida infections, and also in the evolution of complex transcriptional networks. The major weakness of the manuscript as noted in the detailed review below is that it didn't connect the molecular binding differences with the differences in gene expression and phenotype, and some of the statistical tests didn't properly account for the phylogenetic relationships between the species and thus are likely invalid.</p><p>In this work Mancera and co-authors built upon a series of significant findings from the Johnson lab on the architecture and evolution of the biofilm network, and produced highly valuable datasets for future research. The key question in this work is how a complex network such as the one controlling biofilm formation could evolve over a relatively short amount of time. To do so, they focused on two closely related species of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to determine the evolution of the key biofilm regulators and their targets. By performing detailed phenotypic comparisons and collecting large amount of functional genomics data, they reached five main conclusions, including 1) enhanced and more robust biofilm forming abilities in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, followed by its close relatives, 2) the slow substitution of the regulators, their DNA specificity and interacting partners, and yet fast divergence in their targets. The latter, namely trans factors evolved more slowly than their cis counterparts is consistent with previous studies in other systems, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> species and mammals (Wilson et al. 2008, the human chromosome 21 placed in a mouse cell). This paper made several important contributions. First, it performed careful phenotypic assays to characterize the biofilm phenotypes under different inducing conditions in a group of closely related and medically relevant species. Second, it provided a rich set of molecular binding and gene expression data for future studies to identify and test the importance of individual regulators and their targets' role in biofilm.</p><p>While reading the manuscript, I had a number of concerns and what I see as missed opportunities for the authors to realize the full potential of their work. First and foremost, this work produced three categories of comparative data and yet failed to connect them. These three data categories are phenotypic (biofilm characteristics), gene expression (RNA-seq) and regulators binding (ChIP). An obvious causal relationship among the three categories exists, namely divergence in regulator binding leading to changes in gene expression, which in turn results in phenotypic divergence. However, in the most part the authors analyzed and presented the data as separate entities, not allowing an examination on their causal relationships. I acknowledge that it is difficult to make explicit correlations between the three given the complexity of the network. However, certain analyses should be attempted and seem feasible. For example, one could analyze the extent to which the observed differences in regulator binding correlate with the divergence in gene expression during biofilm formation. Without such analyses, the three categories of data are disconnected and don't allow for a deep understanding of how the complex network evolved.</p><p>A related issue is that the results are primarily descriptive, without inferences about the ancestral state and the direction of evolution. This is particularly true of the binding data, where the major types of analyses were about overlaps between the species. This feeds into the issue above as it is not clear how those differences in binding relate to the differences in the biofilm phenotype. Notably, the authors used the words &quot;evolve&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; in several context, which to me imply a direction in evolution, while the presented analyses only concern differences between species.</p><p>A second concern is that in most of the analyses the authors considered a gene as a &quot;target in the biofilm network&quot; if orthologs of one of the seven major regulators of biofilm formation in <italic>C. albicans</italic> bound in its upstream region (as evidenced by ChIP). It is well known that TF binding is not always productive, that is, leading to gene induction or repression, which in turn don't always affect the phenotype. This raises a serious question in my mind: how much of the observed binding difference actually relates to the biofilm phenotype vs stochastic changes due to neutral evolution? I could imagine a model in which only a small percentage of the binding events are functional, while the rest represent spurious binding motifs that evolve more or less neutrally. The observed difference could then be due to genetic drift in the gain and loss of short DNA motifs. The authors did include a few additional criteria in their comparative analyses, including the requirement for a high scoring motif in the binding region and a two-fold change in the gene's expression under biofilm forming conditions. These do not completely address the concern above and were also presented towards the end of the Results section, leaving me as a reader pondering on the above question for most of the manuscript. In my opinion, the issue of binding ≠ function should be addressed head-on and controlled for using complementary data, such as RNA-seq of the wild type and TF-KO strain under biofilm formation conditions. If that's not possible, the authors should attempt to estimate the proportion of ChIP identified sites as being truly in the biofilm network.</p><p>Third, I have doubts about the statistical tests behind a number of conclusions in the paper, e.g. on lines 337-340, the authors said &quot;the overlap for each species pair is larger than expected by chance (hypergeometric test, P &lt; 0.05), indicating that a small but significant group of Ntd80-target gene connection have been preserved across these species&quot;, and on lines 407 to 410, the authors said &quot;the number of connections observed between the regulators is greater than what would be expected by chance (P &lt;&lt; 0.05).… high connectivity between the master regulators is conserved in the four <italic>Candida</italic> species analyzed&quot;. Based on the description, I think the authors performed the tests under the null hypothesis that the regulator-target relationships evolved independently in these species, while they were actually non-independent due to the species sharing a common ancestor. The concept of phylogenetically independent contrast and a number of statistical tests based on it was developed so as to take into account the relatedness among the species being compared. One would need to specify a neutral rate at which a trait evolves, and compare the observed level of divergence to the expected level in order to make conclusions about their conservation due to selective constraint.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This comprehensive study describes the relatedness and evolution of biofilm specific genes among several Candida strains. The strength and impact of this study is elucidating the transcriptional regulators controlling biofilms with resulting functional differences in biofilm formation among closely and distantly related <italic>Candida</italic> species.</p><p><italic>Candida</italic> species differ in their relative ability to form biofilms, and this study documents differences in the transcriptional networks among species that influence this phenotype. This work shows that among seven master transcriptional regulators needed for robust <italic>C. albicans</italic> biofilm formation, fewer are involved in biofilm formation in more distantly related species and this accompanies less organized or poorer biofilm production. The authors find that this network of regulator-target connections are predictive of evolutionary changes across species and provide insight into key components involved in biofilm formation.</p><p>This manuscript comprises an impressive breadth of experiments, yet the data is easy to follow and the figures are understandable synthesis of an enormous amount of data. The biofilm conditions selected are comprehensive and resulting gene expression data well validated and statistically supported. There are major formatting errors in Suppl Figure 4 , and minor errors in Suppl Figure 1 (top legend) and Suppl Figure 2 ( species names below blank ?).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work highlights similarities and differences in the way pathogenic <italic>Candida</italic> species control biofilm formation, contributing to our understanding of how pathogenic traits evolved in species of the Candida lineage. Although this study is limited to four related species, with some overstated conclusions, it could serve as a nice example for how transcriptional circuits operate in microbial pathogens that recently shared a common ancestor.</p><p>An important virulence trait of fungal pathogens is their ability to form biofilms, which are communities of adherent cells encased in a polymeric matrix acting as protective structures. Transcriptional control of biofilm development is a complex process, involving a plethora of regulators with variable impact on both structure and function of biofilms. Here authors build on their previous findings to further map the transcriptional regulatory network that controls biofilm formation in four pathogenic <italic>Candida</italic> species of medical importance, namely <italic>C. albicans</italic>, <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>. They provide interesting clues as to how such a circuitry operates in these species. Although authors attempted to include some additional species from the Candida and Saccharomyces lineages in their analyses, they are faced with the complexity of the environmental cues/specificities that trigger biofilm formation in these more distantly-related organisms, reflecting the challenge of studying and explaining the evolution of some traits over extended evolutionary time scales. This study could've been certainly more impactful and comprehensive if some technical issues had been addressed/resolved (e.g. failure of tagging/expressing a subset of transcription factors in the species being analyzed/compared) or if some conclusions had been tempered. Collectively, authors present a valuable work on the transcriptional control of an important pathogenicity trait in medically-important <italic>Candida</italic> species and extend the reach of the regulatory circuitry operating during biofilm formation in fungal pathogens.</p><p>In this work, Mancera and colleagues investigate the transcriptional circuitries that control biofilm development in four medically-important <italic>Candida</italic> species using functional genomics. They characterize a subset of regulators that were already studied in <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> in major publications by the groups involved in this study (Nobile et al. 2012, Holland et al. 2014) in two additional related species from the Candida lineage, namely <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> and <italic>Candida dubliniensis</italic>. Although authors attempted to include some additional species from the Candida and Saccharomyces lineages in their analyses, they are faced with the complexity of the environmental cues/specificities that trigger biofilm formation in these more distantly-related organisms, reflecting the challenge of studying and explaining the evolution of some traits over extended evolutionary time scales. Still, authors provide interesting clues as to how the transcriptional circuitry that controls biofilm development operates in the four phylogenetically-close species being compared. This study could have been more impactful and comprehensive if some technical issues had been addressed/resolved (e.g. failure of tagging/expressing a subset of transcription factors and getting ChIP-seq data in the species being analyzed/compared) or if some non-useful data (e.g. other CTG species, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>/<italic>C. glabrata</italic>) had been removed and conclusions tempered (see some examples from specific comments).</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– Authors should rather focus on biofilm development in the 4 <italic>Candida</italic> species, because conditions have been optimized for the set of 4 species.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Patricia Wittkopp (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues identified by one of the two reviewers that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. Regarding the new text added on page 21-22, lines 506-570 (there is a jump from 506 to 560), I understand that the goal is to determine whether trans-changes, specifically the DNA binding specificity, could explain part of the observed binding target divergence. However, I can't quite follow the text, as it is not clear to me which species' motif was used to predict in which species' genome, and how were the overlaps actually calculated. I did look for additional information in the Methods section and couldn't find any.</p><p>2. Regarding the new text from lines 619-632: am I correct in that the new results were meant to determine the relationship between binding and gene induction *in each species*, rather than attributing gene induction *differences between species* to differences in TF binding in those species? The reason for the question is because I came in expecting answers to the latter question and got confused for a moment.</p><p>3. In lines 646-649, the authors laid out the challenges involved in between-species comparison, which I fully agree with. But I don't think the Ca-Cd hybrid experiment can address that.

In Figure 6B, there are more than one data points for the two binding and one expression change datasets in the middle and right time points. Are those biological replicates?</p><p>6. In the Discussion section, the authors stated that this work examined how a complex transcriptional network underlying a specific phenotype (biofilm formation) evolved over a span of ~70 million years. I think it would be useful to point out, the authors did this to some extent later, that to fully reconstruct the evolutionary history of this network, it is critical to identify all the regulators in the other three species, and that the data in this work constitutes a partial picture for the three non-albicans species.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64682.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>While reading the manuscript, I had a number of concerns and what I see as missed opportunities for the authors to realize the full potential of their work. First and foremost, this work produced three categories of comparative data and yet failed to connect them. These three data categories are phenotypic (biofilm characteristics), gene expression (RNA-seq) and regulators binding (ChIP). An obvious causal relationship among the three categories exists, namely divergence in regulator binding leading to changes in gene expression, which in turn results in phenotypic divergence. However, in the most part the authors analyzed and presented the data as separate entities, not allowing an examination on their causal relationships. I acknowledge that it is difficult to make explicit correlations between the three given the complexity of the network. However, certain analyses should be attempted and seem feasible. For example, one could analyze the extent to which the observed differences in regulator binding correlate with the divergence in gene expression during biofilm formation. Without such analyses, the three categories of data are disconnected and don't allow for a deep understanding of how the complex network evolved.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have included an analysis of the overlap between the DNA binding data of the regulators and the gene expression of their target genes (ln. 619). Additional analyses will require extensive experimentation, especially given the number of regulators and species considered in the current study; we have plans to carry such experiments in future studies, where their findings can be published in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related issue is that the results are primarily descriptive, without inferences about the ancestral state and the direction of evolution. This is particularly true of the binding data, where the major types of analyses were about overlaps between the species. This feeds into the issue above as it is not clear how those differences in binding relate to the differences in the biofilm phenotype. Notably, the authors used the words &quot;evolve&quot; and &quot;diversity&quot; in several context, which to me imply a direction in evolution, while the presented analyses only concern differences between species.</p></disp-quote><p>We think it is not currently possible to infer accurately a specific ancestral state from the type of data presented in this paper. In Tuch et al. 2008 (PLoS Biology 6(2):e38) we inferred, using a maximum likelihood approach, the size of an ancestral circuit, but there was no credible way to accurately infer the details of the circuit. In the case of this work it is clear that an ancestral circuit existed and that it changed over time to give rise to the extant species we analyzed. Although we cannot provide specific details, there is no doubt that evolution has occurred, with the “direction” being ancestral to modern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second concern is that in most of the analyses the authors considered a gene as a &quot;target in the biofilm network&quot; if orthologs of one of the seven major regulators of biofilm formation in C. albicans bound in its upstream region (as evidenced by ChIP). It is well known that TF binding is not always productive, that is, leading to gene induction or repression, which in turn don't always affect the phenotype. This raises a serious question in my mind: how much of the observed binding difference actually relates to the biofilm phenotype vs stochastic changes due to neutral evolution? I could imagine a model in which only a small percentage of the binding events are functional, while the rest represent spurious binding motifs that evolve more or less neutrally. The observed difference could then be due to genetic drift in the gain and loss of short DNA motifs. The authors did include a few additional criteria in their comparative analyses, including the requirement for a high scoring motif in the binding region and a two-fold change in the gene's expression under biofilm forming conditions. These do not completely address the concern above and were also presented towards the end of the Results section, leaving me as a reader pondering on the above question for most of the manuscript. In my opinion, the issue of binding ≠ function should be addressed head-on and controlled for using complementary data, such as RNA-seq of the wild type and TF-KO strain under biofilm formation conditions. If that's not possible, the authors should attempt to estimate the proportion of ChIP identified sites as being truly in the biofilm network.</p></disp-quote><p>As also suggested by reviewer 3, we have moved the section where we integrated different criteria to determine gene targets after we first present the results about the target gene connections so that the issue is addressed early on in the manuscript (ln. 403).</p><p>In our experience, determining whether the binding of a regulator is functional is one of the most challenging aspects of analyzing a transcriptional network in any species. As mentioned above, given the number of regulators and species considered in this study, experiments to rigorously establish this point for each piece of binding data are currently beyond what is feasible in our laboratories. We believe that the integration of motif presence and gene expression change during biofilm formation, combined with the binding data, give an adequate estimation of the target gene connections that are most important for biofilm formation in the conditions assessed.</p><p>In addition, even with the incorporation of additional experimental data, it is not always possible to show that a binding site is functional; for example, it could only be functional under very specific conditions. Therefore, its modification would only result in a measurable phenotype in those conditions. Given that it is not possible to evaluate every possible condition, there will always be some uncertainty regarding the functionality of binding events in genome-wide binding studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, I have doubts about the statistical tests behind a number of conclusions in the paper, e.g. on lines 337-340, the authors said &quot;the overlap for each species pair is larger than expected by chance (hypergeometric test, P &lt; 0.05), indicating that a small but significant group of Ntd80-target gene connection have been preserved across these species&quot;, and on lines 407 to 410, the authors said &quot;the number of connections observed between the regulators is greater than what would be expected by chance (P &lt;&lt; 0.05).… high connectivity between the master regulators is conserved in the four <italic>Candida</italic> species analyzed&quot;. Based on the description, I think the authors performed the tests under the null hypothesis that the regulator-target relationships evolved independently in these species, while they were actually non-independent due to the species sharing a common ancestor. The concept of phylogenetically independent contrast and a number of statistical tests based on it was developed so as to take into account the relatedness among the species being compared. One would need to specify a neutral rate at which a trait evolves, and compare the observed level of divergence to the expected level in order to make conclusions about their conservation due to selective constraint.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that is worth clarifying in the manuscript. The aim of these statistical tests was not to evaluate whether the binding connections are evolving under a selective constraint. Although we would be very interested in testing this, with the available data, we do not think this is feasible; there is simply not enough information to credibly estimate a neutral rate at which binding connections are evolving to see whether the rate of change that we are observing deviates from it. Instead, these tests were aimed at assessing whether the binding connections have changed at such a fast rate that there is no evidence of common decent anymore, independently of whether they are evolving by natural selection or drift. We have now clarified this point in lines 337-340 (now ln. 360) and also when we discuss the overlap between differentially expressed genes (ln. 613).</p><p>In Figure 6B we compared how the different datasets that we estimated change as a function of substitutions in DNA sequence within ORFs. In lines 387-399 we also compare the rate of binding connection change to the rate of gene loss/gains in the four species. Although these comparisons cannot be used to assess selective constraint, it allows us to place the rate of change in the network in context of the other measures of evolutionary change in the species analyzed.</p><p>Regarding the randomizations to test whether the connections between the regulators are prevalent (previously lns. 407 – 410), we think that the test does not contribute significantly to our general conclusions and therefore have removed it from the current version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript comprises an impressive breadth of experiments, yet the data is easy to follow and the figures are understandable synthesis of an enormous amount of data. The biofilm conditions selected are comprehensive and resulting gene expression data well validated and statistically supported. There are major formatting errors in Suppl Figure 4 , and minor errors in Suppl Figure 1 (top legend) and Suppl Figure 2 ( species names below blank ?).</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above in the response to Reviewer 1, this is probably an issue related to the files provided to the reviewers since the figures in the files that we are able to download from the <italic>eLife</italic> system are properly formatted. We will make sure that the figures are properly formatted in the proof review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this work, Mancera and colleagues investigate the transcriptional circuitries that control biofilm development in four medically-important <italic>Candida</italic> species using functional genomics.

All tagged strains formed biofilms that could not be distinguished from the biofilms formed by the WT strains; we have added a note in the Methods section to that respect (ln. 900).

We have expanded the legend of the table so that it is easier to understand what the different values in the table mean, including the experiments that failed or that were not attempted (ln. 1170). We did perform experimental variations in the ChIP-seq experiments in an attempt to map the binding sites of the regulators for which the standard ChIP-seq experiments did not work. For example, for the <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> regulators, we performed the experiment under planktonic conditions, but with no success. As the reviewer suggested, we also considered using other epitopes for tagging. However, we decided not to proceed with this strategy since it complicates the comparison to other DNA binding results as the antibodies and ChIP-seq conditions that would be used are different, bringing their own biases. In addition, since we needed to tag 27 regulators, using a variety of tags to optimize the ChIP-seq for each regulator was not a viable option. It is important to point out that tagging the strains and ensuring that they work for ChIP-seq is quite time and resource consuming; the only way to know whether the tagged regulator can be precipitated for ChIP-seq in a new species is by actually tagging and performing the ChIP-seq experiment.</p><p>Most importantly, our major conclusions would most likely not change with the addition of the DNA binding data from the regulators that were not precipitated successfully. As this reviewer noted below, most of our DNA binding data comes from Efg1 and Ndt80, both of which we were able to successfully ChIP in all four species. Therefore, the general patterns that we observed would most likely hold true with the addition of other binding data from other regulators ChIPed in a selection of species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Supp Table 2 is a key table and should be included in the main text.

We do think that the ChIP-seq experiment in the hybrid addresses most of the problems associated to species having different physiological responses to the same external environment, at least for Ndt80. In the hybrid, Ndt80 from <italic>C. albicans</italic> is subject to the same upstream stimuli and signaling pathways as Ndt80 from <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic>, and therefore the differences in regulator binding have to be mostly due to differences in the regulators binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 6A, I wonder if the authors can comment on the concave shape of the point cloud on the left.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting observation. It would seem that Ndt80 from <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> has a higher occupancy in most of the intergenic regions of the genome, but the trend reverts for the genes that are overall most strongly bound by Ndt80. Unfortunately, without further experimentation we think it would be difficult to establish a mechanistic explanation for the observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 6B, there are more than one data points for the two binding and one expression change datasets in the middle and right time points. Are those biological replicates?</p></disp-quote><p>For the conservation of master regulators there are three estimates because comparisons were performed between <italic>C. albicans</italic> and each of the other three species. On the other hand, there are six estimates of binding target and gene expression conservation since comparisons were performed in pairs between all four species. We have explained this in the corresponding figure legend (ln. 1085).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In the Discussion section, the authors stated that this work examined how a complex transcriptional network underlying a specific phenotype (biofilm formation) evolved over a span of ~70 million years. I think it would be useful to point out, the authors did this to some extent later, that to fully reconstruct the evolutionary history of this network, it is critical to identify all the regulators in the other three species, and that the data in this work constitutes a partial picture for the three non-albicans species.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a sentence in the Discussion to clarify that further work will be needed to identify all biofilm regulators in <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> and <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> to have a more complete picture of the network in these two species (ln. 648). In <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>, a screen of gene deletion mutants to find biofilm regulators has already been performed and we do mention the regulators found in these analyses throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
