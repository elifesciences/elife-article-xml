Such models downplay other projections to the mammillary bodies, leaving them largely ignored. The present study challenged this dominant view by removing, in rats, the two principal inputs reaching the mammillary bodies: the postcommissural fornix from the hippocampal formation and Gudden's ventral tegmental nucleus. The principal mammillary body output pathway, the mammillothalamic tract, was disconnected in a third group. Only mammillothalamic tract and Gudden's ventral tegmental nucleus lesions impaired behavioral tests of spatial working memory and, in particular, disrupted the use of extramaze spatial landmarks. The same lesions also produced widespread reductions in immediate-early gene (c-<italic>fos</italic>) expression in a network of memory-related regions, not seen after postcommissural fornix lesions. These findings are inconsistent with previous models of mammillary body function (those dominated by hippocampal inputs) and herald a new understanding of why specific diencephalic structures are vital for memory.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00736.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00736.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00736.002</object-id><title>eLife Digest</title><p>The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped structure in the brain and its role in memory has been recognized since the 1950s. However, much less is known about two small structures called the mammillary bodies that are found near the hippocampus. These bodies are part of the limbic system—a network of brain regions that also includes the hippocampus and the amygdala—and this system is known to be involved in the regulation of emotion and the formation of long-term memories.</p><p>In 1937, James Papez injected rabies virus into the hippocampus and, by tracing its movement through the brain, identified a distinct circuit within the limbic system. This circuit, which is today known as Papez’ circuit, consists of projections from the hippocampal formation to the mammillary bodies, and from the mammillary bodies on to another region called the anterior thalamus. From here, projections form a loop via several other regions back to the hippocampus.</p><p>It is widely thought that the mammillary bodies are required for memory formation due to their role in relaying projections from the hippocampus. However, the mammillary bodies also receive projections from other regions, including Gudden's ventral tegmental nucleus, and it is possible that these could contribute to the role of the mammillary bodies in memory.</p><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, Seralynne Vann compared the performance of three groups of lesioned rats in tests of spatial short-term memory. The first group had lesions of the hippocampal inputs to the mammillary bodies; the second had lesions of the ventral tegmental inputs to the mammillary bodies; and the third group had lesions of the mammillary body outputs to the thalamus. Vann found that the third group was impaired in the memory tasks, consistent with the idea that outputs sent from the mammillary bodies to the thalamus are required for memory formation. Surprisingly, however, blocking signals sent from the hippocampal formation to the mammillary bodies had little impact on the formation of memories, whereas blocking inputs from Gudden's ventral tegmental nucleus led to significant impairments in memory.</p><p>By revealing that limbic midbrain inputs to the mammillary bodies have an essential role in the formation of memories, these new results challenge dogma in the field, and highlight the importance of looking beyond the hippocampus when considering memory.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00736.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00736.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>mammillary bodies</kwd><kwd>Gudden's tegmental nuclei</kwd><kwd>retrosplenial cortex</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT090954AIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vann</surname><given-names>Seralynne D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In contrast to current models, inputs from midbrain limbic structures, but not from the hippocampus, are necessary for mammillary body contributions to memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the first neuroanatomical circuits of emotion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papez, 1937</xref>) and memory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbizet, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delay and Brion, 1969</xref>), the perceived contributions of the mammillary bodies have been dominated by their direct inputs from the hippocampal formation (via the fornix). Consequently, the mammillary bodies are principally seen as a relay of hippocampal projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei and, from there, to the cingulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbizet, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delay and Brion, 1969</xref>) and prefrontal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Warrington and Weiskrantz, 1982</xref>) cortices. The notion that the mammillary bodies form part of such an ‘extended hippocampal system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton and Brown, 1999</xref>) is seemingly supported by the unidirectional nature of the hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aggleton et al., 2005</xref>), along with clinical evidence of the importance for memory of the mammillary body projections to the thalamus, via the mammillothalamic tract (MTT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlesimo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van der Werf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vann and Aggleton, 2003</xref>). However, these standard models suffer two major shortcomings. First, they provide no real function for the mammillary bodies and second, they ignore other mammillary body afferents. The mammillary bodies receive dense inputs from Gudden's tegmental nuclei (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takeuchi et al., 1985</xref>), making it possible that these midbrain inputs are functionally important for memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vann, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Three groups of rats contrasted the standard model with an alternative model of mammillary body function based on its tegmental inputs. Rats with lesions blocking either of the two main mammillary body afferents (hippocampus formation or ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden) were tested alongside rats with lesions of the main mammillary body efferent pathway, the mammillothalamic tract. Only by comparing these separate lesions within the same study is it possible to measure their relative contributions. In one group the descending postcommissural fornix (PCF) was lesioned, a procedure that disconnects the hippocampal formation projections to the mammillary bodies whilst leaving other hippocampal connections intact, including those with the septum, striatum and anterior thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vann et al., 2011</xref>). A second group received neurotoxic lesions of Gudden's ventral tegmental nucleus (VTNg). Although the lateral mammillary nucleus receives dense inputs from Gudden's dorsal tegmental nucleus, the VTNg was targeted because of its inputs to the medial mammillary nucleus. Previous clinical and behavioral evidence highlights the particular importance of the medial mammillary nucleus for memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vann, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vann and Albasser, 2009</xref>). A third group received mammillothalamic tract lesions while a fourth group underwent control surgery. Rats were tested on three behavioral tasks, the first two of which are sensitive to hippocampal damage: T-maze alternation, a working memory task in the radial-arm maze, and a geometric discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggleton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vann, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to impairing spatial memory, MTT lesions also result in widespread neural hypoactivity, as measured by expression of the immediate-early gene c-<italic>fos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vann and Albasser, 2009</xref>).

There did not appear to be any loss of raphe neurons at any level other than that of the VTNg. At just this level there was a restricted loss of cells in the most dorsal part of the median raphe nuclei, that is, limited to just that part directly adjacent to the VTNg. There was no evidence that the lesions extended into either Gudden's dorsal tegmental nuclei or the laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, both of which stained intensely for acetylcholinesterase.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00736.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Photomicrographs depicting typical lesions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Acetylcholinesterase-stained section showing ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden lesion.

The observation that the laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, and subsequently their cholinergic projections, were intact was confirmed by assessing the level of acetylcholinesterase staining in the anteroventral thalamic nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) and interpeduncular nucleus. The mean gray values ± standard deviation for the anteroventral thalamic nuclei were: VTNx, 75.8 ± 9.05; Sham, 79.3 ± 4.17, <italic>t</italic> &lt; 1. The interpeduncular nucleus values (rostral part) were: VTNx, 73.4 ± 10.9; Sham, 75.8 ± 12.8 (<italic>t</italic> &lt; 1).</p><p>The PCFx and MTTx lesions were assessed using Nissl stained sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>); any cases with unilateral or bilateral sparing were removed from further analyses. It has been repeatedly shown that fornix section leads to shrinkage of the mammillary bodies (due to loss of white matter). Mammillary body area measurements were, therefore, made to determine the impact of the PCFx lesions. The mean mammillary body area (±SEM) for the PCFx group was 1.34 mm<sup>2</sup> ± 0.031, making them significantly smaller than the Sham group measurements of 1.79 mm<sup>2</sup> ± 0.058 (<italic>t</italic>(13) = 6.44; p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Furthermore, the reduced mammillary body volumes of the present PCFx lesion cohort did not differ from a previous cohort where retrograde tracers had been used to confirm the postcommissural fornix disconnection (<italic>t</italic>(14)=1.67; p&gt;0.1) or from rats with complete fornix lesions (<italic>t</italic> &lt; 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vann et al., 2011</xref>). These findings demonstrate quantitative changes in mammillary body status, consistent with a complete tract section. The mammillary bodies were also assessed in the MTTx and VTNx lesion groups (MTTx = 1.38 mm<sup>2</sup> ± 0.045; VTNx = 1.50 mm<sup>2</sup> ± 0.026). When considering the mammillary body cross-sectional area of all four groups in the study there was a main effect of group (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3,27)</sub> = 22.3, p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.001). Post-hoc comparisons revealed the mammillary bodies to be larger in the Sham group than all lesion groups (all p&lt;0.001) while none of the lesion groups differed significantly from each other (all p&gt;0.05). To determine whether the reduced medial mammillary bodies volumes represented loss of white matter, as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loftus et al., 2000</xref>), cell counts were made (cell counts per mm<sup>2</sup> ± SEM: Sham = 3530.4 ± 77.6; PCFx = 4054.7 ± 96.6; MTTx = 3405.4 ± 89.8; VTNx = 3361.1 ± 134,3). There was an overall group effect (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3,27)</sub> = 9.96, p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.001) which reflected a significant increase in the cell packing in the PCFx lesion group compared to all three other groups (Sham, p&lt;0.01; MTTx, p&lt;0.005; VTNx, p&lt;0.001) there was no difference in cell packing in any of the other groups (all comparisons, p&gt;0.5). This is consistent with the reduced mammillary body volume in the PCFx group reflecting loss of white matter and not an overall change in neuronal numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). In contrast, lack of difference in cell packing in the MTTx and VTNx groups, combined with reduced cross-sectional area, would be consistent with some medial mammillary body cell loss in these groups. It is important to note that these counts are not stereological so cannot be used to determine total cell counts for the mammillary bodies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Behavioral results</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Experiment 1: reinforced spatial alternation in the T-maze</title><p>Rats can use multiple cue-types to perform spatial alternation tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dudchenko, 2001</xref>), including visual allocentric cues, intra-maze cues (e.g., odor trails), directional cues (i.e., bearing), and egocentric cues (i.e., body turns).

Initial training on the task (Stage 1) permitted the use of multiple strategies supporting alternation, that is allocentric, intra-maze, idiothetic, direction alternation (with reference to a known bearing). The task was then systematically modified in order to prevent the use of intra-maze cues (Stage 2) or the use of intra-maze and distal allocentric cues (Stage 3).

Models of MB function have inevitably focused on their dense hippocampal inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton and Brown, 1999</xref>) so that the MBs are principally thought to relay hippocampal information to the anterior thalamic nuclei (via the mammillothalamic tract), and then beyond (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbizet, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delay and Brion, 1969</xref>). However, the MBs have heavy, reciprocal connections with Gudden's tegmental nuclei whose functional significance has been largely overlooked. The present study contrasted the relative contributions of these two, principal MB inputs for (i) spatial memory and (ii) control of the expression of the immediate early gene c-<italic>fos</italic> in distal limbic sites. The second goal arose because mammillothalamic tract lesions cause c-Fos hypoactivity in numerous sites including the hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and prelimbic cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vann and Albasser, 2009</xref>). The present study determined whether it is the loss of hippocampal or tegmental inputs that is the main cause of this neural hypoactivity. For these joint reasons, rats with either lesions of the descending postcommissural fornix (PCFx), which carries the hippocampal formation projections, or lesions of Gudden's ventral tegmental nucleus (VTNx) were tested alongside mammillothalamic tract lesion rats (MTTx), that is, the major efferent tract by which the MBs have their principal effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vann and Aggleton, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The present study focused on the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden as it is reciprocally connected with the medial mammillary nucleus while the dorsal tegmental nucleus connects with the lateral mammillary nucleus. Although the lateral mammillary nucleus forms part of the head-direction network (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vann and Aggleton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hopkins, 2005</xref>), it is the loss of the medial mammillary system that appears principally responsible for the spatial memory impairments associated with complete lesions of this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vann, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vann and Albasser, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, it is the medial mammillary nucleus that is always atrophied in the amnesic Korsakoff's syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Victor et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kopelman, 1995</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the predictions of traditional models of MB function (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delay and Brion, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaffan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton and Brown, 1999</xref>), only the MTTx and VTNx groups were impaired on the behavioral tasks relative to the Sham groups. At no stage did these two lesion groups significantly differ from one another. The only comparison where just one of these two groups was impaired was for Stage 1 of T-maze alternation where the VTNx, but not MTTx, group made significantly more errors than the Sham group. This apparent exception makes sense when the results from Stage 2 are considered. In Stage 1 of the T-maze alternation task both the sample and test runs were in the same maze; in Stage 2 the sample and test runs were in adjacent mazes to prevent the use of intra-maze cues. The performances of the VTNx and MTTx groups in Stage 2 were equivalent, with both groups impaired relative to the Sham group, suggesting the MTTx group had been using intra-maze cues to solve Stage 1, so masking their spatial memory impairments. The MTTx and VTNx groups were also equivalently impaired on the radial-arm maze task. Although all groups showed an improvement across training, it appears that in the VTNx and MTTx groups this reflected a greater reliance on the use of intra-maze cues given the disruptive effect of rotating the maze midway through the trial. Thus both behavioral tasks indicated that the MTTx and VTNx rats were less able to use allocentric cues and more reliant on intra-maze cues. In contrast, the PCFx animals were not impaired relative to the Shams on any of the behavioral tasks. Consequently, the PCFx animals performed significantly better than both the VTNx and MTTx groups on both the radial-arm maze and T-maze tasks despite producing MB shrinkage (resulting from loss of fiber inputs) equivalent to that found after complete fornix lesions. The present PCFx lesions were indistinguishable from those that had previously been demonstrated to completely disconnect the hippocampal formation-MB projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vann et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The pattern of behavioral impairments was paralleled by the c-Fos findings. Both the VTNx and MTTx groups had significantly fewer c-Fos positive cells in the hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and prelimbic cortex. Reduced levels of c-Fos have also been found in this same network of brain regions following anterior thalamic nuclei lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jenkins et al., 2002</xref>). However, unlike the c-Fos reduction following anterior thalamic lesions, the current changes reflect ‘indirect’ effects, as the MTT and VTNg lesions do not result in direct de-afferentation of any of these sites. Although reduced activity in this memory-related network seems to be a consistent marker of damage to the medial diencephalon, in animal models and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joyce et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kapur, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reed et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Savage et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caulo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anzalone et al., 2010</xref>), it is not known whether this reduced activity contributes to mnemonic deficits or whether it simply a symptom of the system no longer working effectively. Evidence for the former account comes learning and memory deficits found after infusions of antisense that block c-Fos activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seoane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katche et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The present PCFx lesion findings were remarkably similar to those found previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vann et al., 2011</xref>), for example, they resulted in a 5% reduction in accuracy of T-maze alternation. The lack of effect of PCFx lesions is quite surprising and does raise the question of what does this pathway do. It is possible that the tasks used in the present study did not sufficiently tax this pathway and that greater task demands could result in lesion-induced impairments. In addition, it may be that these projections contribute to memory under normal conditions but the general lack of effects following PCFx lesions are due to redundancies in this pathway, given the direct projections from the hippocampal formation to the anterior thalamic nuclei. While complete fornix lesions disconnect the hippocampal formation from a number of sites, including their projections to both the MBs and anterior thalamic nuclei, selective lesions of the descending PCF will spare all but the MB projections. The hippocampal projections to the MBs and anterior thalamic nuclei arise from different cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wright et al., 2010</xref>) so it is not clear whether the same information is being conveyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsanov et al., 2011</xref>) and, therefore, how much replication there is in the system. Those examples where fornix lesions appear more disruptive than MB lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaffan et al., 2001</xref>) are consistent with the idea that the direct hippocampal-thalamic inputs are supportive, but there are some situations where anterior thalamic or MB lesion effects can be greater than those of fornix lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tonkiss and Rawlins, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenkins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggleton et al., 2009</xref>), so highlighting the potential functional importance of additional information streams, for example, from the limbic midbrain.</p><p>The present findings clearly suggest that the more crucial inputs for MB spatial function are from VTNg rather than the hippocampal formation. Questions immediately arise about the information provided by these tegmental nuclei and how might this relate to spatial memory. VTNg cells fire rhythmically and coherently with hippocampal theta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kocsis et al., 2001</xref>), and theta-related cells in the medial mammillary nucleus have been linked to memory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Alonso and Llinas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Bland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kirk et al., 1996</xref>). It is also the case that the VTNg have been linked to vigilance states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bassant and Poindessous-Jazat, 2001</xref>), and so might additionally modulate hippocampal activity. The presumption, based on their dense interconnectivity, is that the VTNg lesion effects are primarily via the MBs. The VTNg does, however, innervate a number of other sites, including the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, medial septum, parts of the reticular pontine nucleus, median raphe nuclei, supramammillary nucleus and ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petrovicky, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leichnetz et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayakawa et al., 1993</xref>). These other VTNg efferents appear light (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayakawa and Zyo, 1984</xref>), and in some instances not been confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barone et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vertes, 1988</xref>), a contribution from their disconnection must be considered, particularly because some of these other sites have hippocampal connections. However, lesions of these alternative sites rarely result in the pattern of spatial memory impairments seen following VTNg lesions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sarihi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan and McNaughton, 2002</xref>). In addition, the lack of Fos changes in the supramammillary and septal nuclei following VTNg lesions provides some evidence that they are not having their effects via these routes, while the striking similarity of the VTNg and MTT lesion effects in the present study provides further support for the VTNg-MB pathway.</p><p>In rats, the MTT and VTNg lesion effects appear to be selective for spatial working memory and not due to non-specific effects such as loss of arousal or motivation. Both MTTx and VTNx groups were able to acquire a geometric discrimination task at the same rate, and to the same level, as the Sham group. This task may be particularly sensitive to lesions within the head-direction system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggleton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vann, 2011</xref>). As the MTT lesions in the present study are most likely to disconnect the medial MB efferents, while leaving many lateral MB efferents largely intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vann and Albasser, 2009</xref>) this sparing provides further support for the dissociation of two memory systems within the MBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allen and Hopkins, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vann and Aggleton, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Clinical studies show that both the MBs and the MTT are important for human memory, and recollective memory in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dusoir et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van der Werf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlesimo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsivilis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vann et al., 2009</xref>).

To date, there is only one reported amnesic patient with restricted damage in the VTN area, but this study is limited in that only CT images were available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberg et al., 1981</xref>).</p><p>The current findings support a novel model of limbic brain interactions. They show that the MBs have important roles in memory that can be independent of their hippocampal inputs; instead, the results highlight the VTNg. Not only do MTT and VTNg lesions result in strikingly similar spatial memory impairments but they also both result in widespread hypoactivity across a memory-related network. These findings highlight the importance of looking beyond the hippocampus to larger networks of brain regions that contribute to memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vann and Albasser, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and surgery</title><p>Subjects were 40 male, pigmented rats (Dark <italic>Agouti</italic> strain; Harlan, Bicester, United Kingdom) weighing between 214 g and 245 g at the time of surgery. Animals were housed in pairs under diurnal light conditions (14 hr light/10 hr dark) and testing was carried out during the light phase. Animals were given free access to water and a large cardboard tube and wooden chew-stick were available in the home-cage throughout. For all behavioral experiments other than the water-maze, where food was available ad libitum<italic>,</italic> the animals were placed on a food restricted diet where they were still able to gain weight; their weights did not fall below 85% of their equivalent free feeding weight. All experiments were carried out in accordance with UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and associated guidelines.</p><p>Prior to surgery, all animals were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium salt; Sigma-Aldrich, United Kingdom). The 12 rats receiving Gudden's ventral tegmental nuclei lesions (VTNx) were then placed in a stereotaxic headholder (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA), with the nose bar at 0.0; the scalp was cut and retracted to expose the skull. The lesions were made by injecting 0.09M N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; Sigma Chemical Company Ltd, United Kingdom), dissolved in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Injections (0.18 μl) were made in one site per hemisphere using a 1 μl syringe (Hamilton Bonaduz AG, Switzerland). The injection was made over 10 min and the needle was then left in situ for a further 10 min. The stereotaxic ‘arm’ was set at 20° from vertical so that the needle entered the same hemisphere for both injections. The stereotaxic co-ordinates of the lesion placements relative to bregma were anteroposterior (AP) −8.8, lateral (L) +2.6/+3.0 and the depth, from top of cortex, was −7.2 mm. For the mammillothalamic tract lesions (MTTx; n = 11) and descending postcommissural fornix lesions (PCFx; n = 12), the nose bar was set at +5.0. These lesions were made by radiofrequency using a thermocouple radiofrequency electrode (0.7 mm active tip length, 0.25 mm diameter; Diros Technology Inc., Toronto, Canada). For both lesion types, the electrode was lowered vertically and the tip temperature was raised to 60°C for 15 s using an OWL Universal RF System URF-3AP lesion maker (Diros Technology Inc., Toronto, Canada). The stereotaxic coordinates for the MTT lesions were: AP, −1.2; L, ±0.9 (both relative to bregma); and the depth, from top of cortex, was −6.9 mm. For the PCF lesions the coordinates were: AP, −0.2, L, ± 1.2, and the depth, from top of cortex, was −8.2 mm. There were three surgical control rats for each lesion type (Sham; n = 9) and for these surgeries the same procedures were used except the probe/needle was lowered to +1.0 mm above the lesion site; the temperature of the probe was not raised nor was any injection made.</p><p>During surgery, rats were maintained on oxygen and given an analgesic (Meloxicam; Boehringer Ingelheim, Rhein, Germany). At the completion of surgery, the skin was sutured and an antibiotic powder (Acramide; Dales Pharmaceuticals, Skipton, UK) was applied topically. Animals also received subcutaneous injections of 5 ml glucose saline. All animals recovered well following surgery. Behavioral testing began four weeks following the completion of surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Apparatus and behavioral training</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Experiment 1: reinforced spatial alternation in the T-maze</title><sec id="s4-2-1-1"><title>Apparatus</title><p>Two identical cross-mazes were used during the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When both mazes were in use, they were placed side-by-side, with the ends of the two arms touching each other. Details of the mazes and the room have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vann, 2011</xref>). Access to an arm could be prevented by placing an aluminum barrier at the entrance of that arm.</p><p>During the initial habituation and training in the ‘light’ stages (Stages 1 and 2), lighting was provided by two standard ceiling lights giving a mean light intensity of 140.8 lx (measured at the center of the two mazes). During training in the ‘dark’ stage (Stage 3), lighting was provided by a standard lamp, equipped with a 60W red light bulb (giving a mean light intensity of 1.4 lx at the center of the mazes), which was placed on the floor of the test room under the centre of the table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>Prior to testing, animals were given 5 days of maze habituation. During each habituation session, reward pellets (45 mg; Noyes Purified Rodent Diet, United Kingdom) were placed in the maze and continuously replaced so that no arm was found to be empty on return. The start arm was separated from the choice arms so that the rats were allowed to run up and down the separate arms during habituation but not turn a corner. The rats were equally habituated to both mazes. Training on the forced-choice alternation rule commenced after the last day of habituation. The procedure used was the same as that previously used for rats with retrosplenial cortex lesions and lateral mammillary body lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pothuizen et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vann, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-3"><title>Basic procedure for stages 1–3</title><p>Throughout the entire experiment, the rats received eight trials per daily session. Each trial consisted of a forced ‘sample’ run followed by a ‘choice’ run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). All testing was carried out in a cross-maze, which was modified by placing a barrier blocking access to the arm directly in line with the start arm (effectively transforming it into a T-maze).</p><p>During the forced sample run, one of the side arms of the maze was blocked by an aluminum barrier. After the rat turned into the preselected arm, it was allowed to eat the two reward pellets that had been previously placed in the food well. The rat was then picked up from the maze and immediately returned to the start arm, either in the same maze (Stage 1) or in the second maze (Stages 2–3)—see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Approximately 3 s after the end of the sample phase the choice phase began. The rat was allowed to run up the start arm and was now given a free choice between the left-turn and right-turn arms. The rat received two reward pellets only if it turned in the direction opposite to that in the sample run (i.e., non-matched). The arm (left or right) that the animal was ‘forced’ to go down during the sample stage varied pseudo-randomly. The rats were transported between the holding room and the experimental room in an opaque aluminum traveling box. Groups of either three or four rats were tested together, with each rat having one trial in turn, so that the inter-trial interval was approximately 3 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-4"><title>Stage 1 (standard T-maze alternation; all cue types available)</title><p>In Stage 1 (six sessions collapsed into three, two-session blocks), both the sample and choice run were carried out in the same maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Both mazes were used equally and the use of each maze alternated between sessions. The maze not in use was removed from the experimental room. All sample runs started from the South. For half of the standard alternation trials the rat was forced to the West in the sample run, and rewarded for going into the east arm on the choice run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For the remaining standard alternation trials the rat was forced to go East in the sample run, and rewarded for going West on the choice run. For these standard alternation trials all cue types could be used to support performance (i.e., visual allocentric, intra-maze, direction, and egocentric). Testing was counterbalanced with four trials per session, half to the West and half to the East.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-5"><title>Stage 2 (visual allocentric, direction and egocentric cues available; intra-maze cues removed)</title><p>In Stage 2 (eight sessions, collapsed into four, two-session blocks), the sample and choice runs were conducted in different, adjacent mazes to prevent the use of intra-maze cues. The number of sample and choice runs was counterbalanced across the two mazes. The eight trials per session were equally divided across two distinct trial types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For one trial type (‘different place’) the correct choice took the rat further away from the arm used in the sample run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For the other trial type (‘same place’), the rats were rewarded for choosing the arm leading to a goal that was located very close to the absolute position of the food well in the sample run. Thus for ‘different place’ trials all strategies except intra-maze cue use should show full transfer from Stage 1, while for ‘same place’ trials the visual allocentric cues could potentially interfere with arm choice. In contrast to Stage 1, equal numbers of sample runs (and choice runs) began from the North and the South start point (note, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> only shows trials starting from the South). However, to promote the use of direction (e.g., bearing) cues, the same start point (North or South) was always used for the sample and choice run on any given trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-6"><title>Stage 3 (direction and egocentric cues available; visual allocentric and intra-maze maze cues removed)</title><p>Stage 3 (eight sessions, collapsed into four, two-session blocks) was identical to Stage 2 except testing was carried out in the dark to prevent the use of visual allocentric cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Experiment 2: radial-arm maze (acquisition and rotation)</title><p>Testing was carried out in an eight-arm radial maze. The maze consisted of an octagonal central platform (34 cm diameter) and eight equally spaced radial arms (87 cm long, 10 cm wide). The base of the central platform and the arms were made of wood and panels of clear Perspex (24 cm high) formed the walls of the arms. At the start of each arm was a clear Perspex guillotine door (12 cm high) attached to a pulley. The maze was positioned in a room (255 × 330 × 260 cm) that contained salient visual cues such as geometric shapes and high contrast stimuli on the walls.</p><p>Pre-training for the radial-arm maze began 3 days after the completion of testing in the T-maze and involved two habituation sessions where the animals were allowed to explore the maze freely for 5 min with the guillotine doors raised and food pellets (45 mg; Noyes Purified Rodent Diet, United Kingdom) scattered down the arms. The animals were then trained on the standard radial-arm maze task (see below). A time limit of 10 min was placed on each session. Animals were tested until they had completed 15 sessions in Stage 1 and 6 sessions in Stage 2.</p><p>Stage 1 (sessions 1–15; collapsed into five, three-session blocks): At the start of a trial all eight arms were baited with two food pellets. The animal was allowed to make an arm choice and then return to the central platform. All the doors were closed for about 10 s before they were re-opened, permitting the animal to make another choice. This procedure continued until all eight arms had been visited or 10 min had elapsed. Only trials where animals made a minimum of eight arm choices were included in the analyses.</p><p>Stage 2 (sessions 16–21; collapsed into two, three-session blocks) tested for the possible use of intra-maze cues when performing the task. The start of the session was as before but after the animal had made four different arm choices it was contained in the center of the maze while the maze was rotated by 45° (clockwise/anticlockwise on alternate days). The remaining food pellets were moved so that they were still in the same allocentric room locations but the actual arms had changed; the experimenter pretended to bait each arm while moving the pellets so not to inadvertently cue the animal. The session then continued until all reward pellets had been retrieved.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Experiment 3: geometric discrimination in the water-maze</title><p>The apparatus and general procedures are the same as previously described (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vann, 2011</xref>). Briefly, rats were given one session of pre-training in a circular pool where a landmark was attached to the platform and the platform was in a new position for each trial. The rats then received 12 sessions (analyzed as six, two-session blocks) with the rectangular insert. For this training there was no landmark and two platforms were present, one in each of the correct corners (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The rectangular insert was rotated between trials so the platform positions did not remain fixed relative to external cues. The correct corners were balanced across groups. For all training the animals received four trials per day. The trials lasted a maximum of 120 s; if the rat had not located the platform by this time it was guided to the platform. At the end of the trial the rats remained on the platform for 30 s before being removed from the pool. A curtain was drawn closed around the pool for all pre-training and training. On day 13, the rats received three trials as normal but on the fourth trial the platforms were removed from the pool and the rats were allowed to swim for 60 s. The amount of time the animals spent in the correct and incorrect corners was noted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Experiment 4: <italic>c-fos</italic> expression following a radial-arm maze task</title><p>Approximately one week following completion of Experiment 3, rats were trained on a forced-choice radial-arm maze task for three days. The same maze and room were used as for Experiment 2 but the task differed; the experimenter controlled which arm the animals visited by using a pulley system to open the guillotine door at the start of the arm, that is, the animals were only allowed access to one arm at any one time. When all eight arms had been visited (i.e., the trial had been completed) the rat was placed in an aluminum traveling box for approximately 2 min while all arms were re-baited with sucrose pellets. Each session consisted of multiple trials in the radial-arm maze, one after the other, and lasted 20 min. Different randomized arm sequences were used on successive trials. On the final test day the animals performed the same task, in an identical radial-arm maze, but in a novel room (255 cm × 330 cm × 260 cm); the two radial-arm maze rooms were markedly different (i.e., size, shape, lighting) and contained distinct, salient visual cues such as geometric shapes and high-contrast stimuli on the walls. Animals were placed in a holding box in a quiet, dark room for 30 min before and 90 min after each radial-arm maze session. This time window was chosen as peak levels of the Fos protein are found approximately 90 min after activation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharp et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhuri et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Histological and immunohistochemical procedures</title><p>90 min after completing the final radial-arm maze session in the novel room, rats were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg; Euthatal, Rhone Merieux, United Kingdom) and transcardially perfused with 0.1 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (PFA). The brains were removed and postfixed in PFA for 4 hr and then transferred to 25% sucrose overnight at room temperature with rotation. Sections were cut at 40 μm on a freezing microtome in the coronal plane. One series (one-in-four sections) was collected in PBS. Sections were processed for c-Fos immunostaining using c-Fos rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:3000; SC-52; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

To assess the integrity of the cholinergic efferents from the laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, intensity measures were taken (following acetyl cholinergic staining) from the anteroventral thalamic nuclei and interpeduncular nucleus. Intensity measures were taken across four sections for the anteroventral and interpeduncular nuclei sections (i.e., eight total measures for the anteroventral thalamic nuclei for both hemispheres). Intensity measures were also taken from white matter adjacent to the nuclei of interest for each section: the stria medullaris of the thalamus for the anteroventral nucleus and the cerebral peduncle for the interpeduncular nucleus. The white matter value was then subtracted from the nucleus value, for each section separately, and the mean values calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Areas for c-Fos counting</title><p>The regions sampled for c-Fos counts were chosen either because they have previously been reported to be affected by mammillothalamic tract lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vann and Albasser, 2009</xref>), because they receive efferents from the VTN or because they were ‘control’ regions to test the specificity of any findings. The hippocampus counts were taken at the level of 4.5 mm behind bregma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paxinos and Watson, 1997</xref>); the counts included the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1, that is, not the subiculum complex. The retrosplenial cortex counts were taken at a level approximated 6 mm behind bregma and involved retrosplenial granular a and b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wyss and Van Groen, 1992</xref>). Two frontal cortical regions were also examined: prelimbic cortex (PL) and infralimbic cortex (IL) taken at a level of 2.7 mm in front of bregma. The supramammillary nuclei (−4.3 mm from bregma), medial and lateral septum (+0.7 mm from bregma) were assessed as these regions have been reported to receive inputs from VTN. Finally, counts were taken from the primary somatosensory area (−2.5 mm from bregma) as any difference in this region might reflect abnormal sensorimotor patterns following surgery or non-specific lesion effects.</p><p>For all areas, other than the primary somatosensory cortex, the entire extent of the target region within the selected coronal sections was assessed. These counting procedures were not stereological, and so while providing information about relative numbers of cells they do not provide accurate counts of absolute cell numbers. All analyses were carried out using the raw cell counts. For all brain areas analyzed, counts were taken from at least four consecutive sections from each hemisphere and these counts were averaged to produce a mean.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Group comparisons were carried out using parametric tests (ANOVA and <italic>t</italic>-test). The probability level of &lt;0.05 was treated as significant. Significant group effects were further investigated using post-hoc comparisons (Tukey). When tests involved several sessions, repeated measure analyses were applied with appropriate corrections for any violations of sphericity using the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment. Statistical analyses were carried out using PASW Statistics 18.0 running on Mac OS X 10.6.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to John Aggleton, Moira Davies and Heather Phillips.</p></ack><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The author declares that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>SDV, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All experiments were carried out in accordance with UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and associated guidelines.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers (one of whom, Paul Dudchenko, wants to reveal his identity).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript that explores limbic functional connections by means of lesion and c-Fos studies of pathways involved in learning and memory in rats. For convenience, the authors use the rubric of the so-called Papez circuit to subsume under one umbrella circuits that focus on connections with the hippocampal formation.</p><p>The present study expands on several studies by these authors that are directed to determining the types and relative contributions of the components these behaviours (e.g., spatial memory, theta rhythms, and head direction) and the notion that there are two, or perhaps three, separate systems segregated with respect to the mammillary nuclei connections.</p><p>The authors show with very precise lesions that when the MB (reciprocal) connections with the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VTNg) or the connections of the ascending mammillothalamic tract (MMT) to the anterior thalamus are eliminated, large deficits in spatial memory occur while, in contrast, elimination of connections provided by the postcommissural fornix (PCF) have little effect.</p><p>The remarkable finding, in our view, is in the effects of the rotating the maze halfway through the animal's sampling of the different maze arms. This rotation causes the local cues of the maze to be dissociated from the extramaze cues available in the room. For the sham and PCFx lesioned animals, this rotation has no effect. This suggests, as one would expect, that extramaze cues are used in identifying which arms have been visited and which have not.</p><p>Please address the comments below in preparing a revised submission: 1) The authors show with very precise lesions that when the MB (reciprocal) connections with the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden (VTNg) or the connections of the ascending mammillothalamic tract (MMT) to the anterior thalamus are eliminated, large deficits in spatial memory occur while, in contrast, elimination of connections provided by the postcommissural fornix (PCF) have little effect.

These are interesting and important results. In a more classical view of these structures, the lack of effect of PCF lesions can be considered surprising. What then is the role of the PCF?

While it does not appear that this input is necessary for the tasks that have been used in the present study, it is possible that there are more sensitive tasks that would reveal effects and this needs further investigation. It is also possible that under normal circumstances this input stream does support aspects of these tasks, but these functions can be supported by other pathways when the PCF is lesioned, i.e., there is some redundancy in the system. This had previously been mentioned in the Discussion and has now been discussed further.</p><p><italic>2) The effects on behaviour were correlated with reduced c-Fos expression in the retrosplenial cortex, the hippocampal formation, and the prelimbic cortex.

None of the lesions with reduced c-Fos levels would be directly deafferented by the lesions in the present study. The changes, therefore, seem to reflect a dysfunction within a wider memory system. This has been re-iterated in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>3) With respect to the MB and the anatomical substrates of the results, we think more detailed anatomical analyses are warranted.

The MBs are also significantly smaller in these groups compared to the Sham groups, although none of the lesion groups significantly differ from each other. Cell counts have now been provided and these are consistent with the MB atrophy in the PCFx lesion groups arising from loss of white matter and not cell loss.</p><p>An improved figure has now been provided that demonstrates the increased neuronal packing in the MBs of the PCFx lesion group compared to the Sham group.</p><p>Unfortunately in our laboratory we have never found reliable Fos staining in the mammillary bodies using selective antibodies, e.g., see page 984 of Vann, Brown and Aggleton, Neuroscience, 101:983-991, 2000. The counts are so low that a floor effect would be a major concern. To illustrate, please see the following photomicrograph of Fos staining in a control animal.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="elife-00736-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>4) The hippocampus (e.g., hippocampus and dentate gyrus) are lumped together but no mention is made of, nor illustrations provided of, which neurons and layer are or are not c-Fos positive</italic>.</p><p>The difference in hippocampal counts seems to largely reflect changes in the CA1 subfield. The cell counts for the subfields CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus are now provided. Fos-positive cells were only found in the stratum pyramidale of the CA fields and in the dentate gyrus Fos-positive cells were restricted to the stratum granulosum.
