Here, we focused on Seipinopathy, a dominant motor neuron disease, based on the finding that its causal gene product, Seipin, is a protein that spans the ER membrane twice. Gain-of-function mutations of Seipin produce non-glycosylated Seipin (ngSeipin), which was previously shown to induce ER stress and apoptosis at both cell and mouse levels albeit with no clarified mechanism. We found that aggregation-prone ngSeipin dominantly inactivated SERCA2b, the major calcium pump in the ER, and decreased the calcium concentration in the ER, leading to ER stress and apoptosis in human colorectal carcinoma-derived cells (HCT116). This inactivation required oligomerization of ngSeipin and direct interaction of the C-terminus of ngSeipin with SERCA2b, and was observed in Seipin-deficient neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells expressing ngSeipin at an endogenous protein level. Our results thus provide a new direction to the controversy noted above.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>neurodegenerative disease</kwd><kwd>UPR</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>calcium pump</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AMED-CREST, Japan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20gm1410005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>Kazutoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When non-glycosylated, Seipin, which spans the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane twice, forms aggregates in an oligomerization-dependent manner, distorts the shape of the ER, and incorporates SERCA2b via direct interaction, inactivation of which results in induction of ER stress and apoptosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>BSCL1</italic> and <italic>BSCL2</italic> genes have been identified as the causal genes of congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) or Berardinelli–Seip congenital lipodystrophy syndrome (BSCL), a rare autosomal-recessive disease characterized by insufficiency of adipose tissue from birth or early infancy and by severe insulin resistance. The <italic>BSCL1</italic> gene encodes 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2), which is present in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in phospholipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garg et al., 1999</xref>), whereas the <italic>BSCL2</italic> gene encodes Seipin, a protein which spans the ER membrane twice and whose function was unknown at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Magré et al., 2001</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations of the <italic>BSCL2</italic> gene appear to produce more severe symptoms than those of the <italic>BSCL1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Van Maldergem et al., 2002</xref>). Since the discovery that Seipin is involved in lipid droplet morphology in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Szymanski et al., 2007</xref>), the role of Seipin in the biogenesis of lipid droplets has gained extensive attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To our interest, two missense mutations of the <italic>BSCL2</italic> gene, namely, N152S and S154L of Seipin, were found to dominantly cause distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) or distal muscular atrophy, which is characterized almost exclusively by the degeneration of motor nerve fibers, predominantly in the distal part of limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Windpassinger et al., 2004</xref>). Because N<sup>152</sup>, V<sup>153</sup>, and S<sup>154</sup> of Seipin match the triplet code (Asn-X-Ser/Thr; X: any amino acid except Pro) for <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation, neither N152S nor S154L Seipin are glycosylated, leading to the proposal that the production of these aggregation-prone mutants results in neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Windpassinger et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Seipin was first identified as a protein of 398 aa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Magré et al., 2001</xref>), and later found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lundin et al., 2006</xref>) to have two splice variants, a short form of 398 aa and long form of 462 aa (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which are translated from three Seipin mRNA isoforms of 1.6 kb, 1.8 kb, and 2.2 kb.

Productive folding of newly synthesized secretory and transmembrane proteins is assisted by ER-localized molecular chaperones and folding enzymes (ER chaperones hereafter). In contrast, proteins unable to gain their correct three-dimensional structures are dealt with by ER-associated degradation (ERAD), in which unfolded or misfolded proteins are recognized, delivered to the transmembrane complex termed the retrotranslocon, and retrotranslocated to the cytosol for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.</p><p>Under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, however, this quality control system misfunctions, resulting in the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER. This ER stress is quite detrimental to the cell and may eventually cause cell death. In response, ER stress is immediately and adequately counteracted by a cellular homeostatic mechanism termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). In vertebrates, the UPR is triggered by three types of ubiquitously expressed ER stress sensors and transducers – PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 – which in turn lead to general translational attenuation to decrease the burden on the ER; transcriptional upregulation of ER chaperones to increase productive folding capacity; and transcriptional upregulation of ERAD components to increase degradation capacity.</p><p>Daisuke Ito and colleagues showed for the first time that expression of non-glycosylated mutant Seipin by transfection in HeLa cells evokes ER stress, as evidenced by induction of the two major ER chaperones BiP and GRP94, the ERAD component Herp, and CHOP. HeLa cells expressing non-glycosylated mutant Seipin by transfection are subject to more extensive apoptosis (18%) than those expressing wild-type (WT) Seipin (6%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ito and Suzuki, 2007</xref>). Based on these findings, they proposed the designation of mutant Seipin-linked dominant motor neuron disease as Seipinopathy, which represents a novel ER stress-associated disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito and Suzuki, 2009</xref>).</p><p>They further constructed a transgenic mice overexpressing human non-glycosylated mutant Seipin under the control of the neuron-specific murine Thy-1 promoter.

Interestingly, Sei1 and dSeipin do not have potential <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites, and dSeipin was shown to function as a dodecamer of non-glycosylated monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sui et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, Seipin orthologs in vertebrates have gained one <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site (Asn<sup>152</sup>Val<sup>153</sup>Ser<sup>154</sup>) in the luminal region, and one of the two <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamines proximal to Asn<sup>152</sup> (Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-Asn) was shown to interact with Arg<sup>199</sup> and Gly<sup>200</sup> in the same molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yan et al., 2018</xref>) with reference to Protein Data Bank: 6DS5. This presence of <italic>N</italic>-glycan at the interface of each vertebrate Seipin protomer to the next vertebrate Seipin protomer in the same direction is likely to prevent dodecamer formation and to instead induce undecamer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In this sense, non-glycosylated vertebrate Seipin is speculated to function as a dodecamer. Indeed, ngSeipin expressed at an endogenous protein level in Seipin-KO cells (transfection at 0.52 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A(c)</xref>; compare lane 4 with lane 1) rescued [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER, which was mitigated in Seipin-KO cells compared with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A(a, b)</xref>; compare bar 4 with bars 1 and 2), suggesting that the putative dodecamer of non-glycosylated human Seipin is functional. These results suggest that non-glycosylation of human Seipin itself is not detrimental to the cell.</p><p>However, the presence of ngSeipin in Seipin-KO cells at a higher level (transfection at <underline>&gt;</underline>2.60 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>) causes serious problems, namely, a more profound decrease in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER than the presence of the equivalent amount of wtSeipin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A(a, b)</xref>; compare bars 6, 8, and 10 with bars 5, 7, and 9). ngSeipin decreased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER in a dominant manner over wtSeipin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with its disease-causing phenotype. The decrease in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER in turn induced ER stress and activation of the UPR, leading to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>; compare bars 6, 8, and 10 with bars 5, 7, and 9), as ER-localized molecular chaperones require Ca<sup>2+</sup> for their function; it was indeed shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion destabilizes BiP-substrate complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Preissler et al., 2020</xref>). The decrease in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER also likely detrimentally affects intracellular signaling and synaptic transmission in the nervous system.</p><p>Furthermore, we unraveled the underlying molecular mechanism: ngSeipin expressed at a higher level decreases [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER by inactivating SERCA2b, for which two independent phenomena are prerequisite, namely, oligomerization-dependent aggregation and C-terminal region-dependent direct association with SERCA2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, the prevention of oligomerization by mutating the six amino acids in the luminal region required for oligomerization (ngSeipin<sup>L</sup>(M6), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) abolished aggregation of ngSeipin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E(a, b)</xref>; compare dot blot 10 with dot blot 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A(a, c)</xref>; compare bar 10 with bar 8), the ngSeipin-mediated decrease in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), induction of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, deletion of the C-terminal region of Seipin (ngSeipin<sup>L</sup>(ΔC), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) abolished the ngSeipin-mediated decrease in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, compare bar 13 with bar 4), induction of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), even though this ngSeipin<sup>L</sup>(ΔC) exhibited a propensity for aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A(a, b)</xref>; compare dot blot 4 with dot blot 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A(a, b)</xref>; compare bar 3 with bar 2), indicating that the aggregation of ngSeipin is not sufficient to induce ER stress. These results in turn mean that ngSeipin expressed at a higher level cannot maintain the putative dodecamer structure, aggregates and distorts the ER morphology, and then incorporates SERCA2b into aggregates via direct interaction of its C-terminus, resulting in inactivation of SERCA2b.</p><p>Of note, SH-SY5Y cells appears to be more vulnerable to the effect of ngSeipin expression than HCT116 cells; expression of ngSeipin by transfection at an endogenous protein level was sufficient to cause a decrease in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), distortion of the ER morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), induction of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), and induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), in a dominant manner.</p><p>Importantly, the increase in the level of SERCA2b mitigated ngSeipin-mediated induction of ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and subsequent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>) even though ngSeipin was still severely aggregated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility that a potent SERCA2b activator could be used as a therapeutic for Seipinopathy and other ER stress-associated neurodegenerative diseases. In this connection, it was reported that high levels of ER stress markers were observed in motor neurons derived from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a severe motor neuron disease, carrying the A4V mutation in superoxide dismutase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiskinis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wainger et al., 2014</xref>); and that oral administration of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol, chemical chaperones that mitigate ER stress, significantly slowed functional decline in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paganoni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paganoni et al., 2020</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers were divided in their perception of the significance attributed to the changes in SERCA activity and calcium metabolism observed in cells expressing wild type and ngSeipin. However, in consultation a consensus emerged whereby it was deemed essential that the perturbations arising from ectopic expression of ngSeipin were also examined in a system mimicking the genetics of the diseases namely a mutant endogenous allele of ngSeipin. Thus, <italic>ELife</italic> set as a condition for further consideration of the manuscript that the authors use modern tools of gene editing to re-create the disease-associated ngSEIPIN heterozygous state in a suitable cellular system (of their choice) and confirm that the phenotype arising from this physiologically expressed model approaches the consequences of the over-expression system used here in terms of calcium handling, association of ngSEIPIN with SERCA and its oligomerisation.</p><p>2) Much rests on the claim that ngSeipin is more aggregation prone than the wild type. Yet the experimental evidence for this rests on interpretation of a proximity based ligation assay, which is deemed by our expert reviewers to be a weak assay for this purpose. Therefore, this key conclusion must be convincingly buttressed by an assay orthogonal to PLA.</p><p>3) The consensus amongst the reviewers is that the paper has not shown that MND caused by ngSeipin is a consequence of the calcium perturbation and ER stress. Thus, the title, which suggests this causative relationship should be revised. A more apt title would make the case for a correlation, for example: &quot;The MND-associate mutation in Seipin encodes a protein that inhibits SERCA, etc.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To improve the manuscript, and its suitability for <italic>eLife</italic>, two aspects should be included/discussed:</p><p>1. The authors should (at least) discuss why in wtSeipin deletion of the N-terminus and modification of the TM helices has a very large effect on ER calcium levels (Figure 6C). A mechanistic explanation would be a plus.</p><p>2. As a complement to Figure 3-S1D(c), the authors should also provide the number of LD per cell, in addition to their diameter. In fact, seipin-KO cells normally result in a phenotype with few supersized LDs and many very small LD. However, quite surprisingly, in Figure3-S1D(c) no such supersized LDs are observed even though they can be spotted in Figure3-S1D(a).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Seipin has two transmembrane segments with an extended ER luminal domain and the N and C termini in the cytosol. Defining it as a &quot;hairpin-like transmembrane protein in the ER&quot; is misleading and likely incorrect.</p><p>2. Figure 1D. The difference in the amounts of wt and ngSeipin co-precipitated by SERCA are unimpressive, considering the overexpression conditions mentioned above and the lack of a specificity control.</p><p>3. The calcium changes are modest. It would be interesting to see whether endogenous SERCA localization changes upon expression of wt and ngSeipin.</p><p>4. The expression levels of some proteins are not well described. For example, in figure 4C all Seipin mutants appear to be expressed to the same level (even if a loading control is not shown) however in Figure 5A ngSeipin M6 looks much less abundant.</p><p>5. Figure 3Ab, shows that the best rescue of Seipin KO cells with WT seipin is observed with low DNA transfections (0.52ng). It is unclear why much larger amounts (10.4ng) are used in most experiments.</p><p>6. The rescue of calcium levels observed by SERCA overexpression is modest and there are alternatives for the experiment. For example, WT and mutant SERCA can be expressed to different levels, as these have not been examined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Seipinopathy is a rare neurodegenerative disease. An introduction or discussion about current evidence linking cellular calcium homeostasis with neurodegenerative diseases may help to further strengthen the manuscript and draw broader interest.</p><p>2. The authors provided extensive biochemical and genetic evidence from HCT116 cells for the function of non-glycosylated Seipin in ER calcium homeostasis, ER stress, cell apoptosis. Seipinopathy-causal mutants can be directly created by CRISPR/Cas9 system. Further studies in neuron cells or SH-SY5Y cells will help to understand the role of non-glycosylated Seipin in Seipinopathy</p><p>3. An important finding for this manuscript is that non-glycosylated Seipin causes ER stress and cell apoptosis through inactivating ER calcium pump SERCA. A more detailed method for how ER or cytosol calcium levels was quantified should be provided. The name of ER ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator is &quot;G-CEPIA1er&quot; but not &quot;Cepia1er&quot;. The authors should clarify it and keep it consistent in the manuscript. Literature associated with ca<sup>2+</sup> quantification and ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators applied should also be cited in the manuscript.</p><p>4. A short exposure image for Myc-wt/ngSeipin blots in Figure1E(c) may help to interpret the result.</p><p>5. The authors showed that overexpression of SERCA2b, but not SERCA2b(Q108H), restored calcium levels in ER. SERCA2b(Q108H) expression is also suggested to be set as a negative control in the following cleaved caspase 3 assays of Figure 9D.</p><p>6. The black and red bars in Figure 10 should be annotated in the main Figure instead of in the figure legends.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thanks for submitting a revised version of your paper 'A Motor Neuron Disease-associated Mutation Produces Non-glycosylated Seipin that Induces ER Stress and Apoptosis by Inactivating SERCA2b'.</p><p>I have looked over your revised version and compared it to the decision letter and am satisfied that in all respects but one your paper addresses the key points. The remaining point of uncertainty relates to the extent to which the differences observed between the wildtype and disease-associated mutant Seipin are manifest in a physiologically relevant concentration regime. This issue was flagged in the review as the most critical. To recapitulate: the reviewers accepted your claim that expression of the wildtype and mutant proteins have different consequences in terms of ER calcium metabolism and stress response. They also accepted that these may be plausibly related to different biophysical properties of the two proteins. However, for these features to be plausibly linked to the disease phenotype, they must be manifest at a physiological concentration regime. In other words, the reviewers were legitimately concerned by the possibility that the very real differences you observe between the wildtype and mutant were dependent on an abnormally high concentration in the cell and thus represent an over-expression experimental artifact of uncertain relevance.</p><p>The reviewers insisted that this issue must be addressed by studying the consequences of the mutation at endogenous levels of expression and suggested modifying the endogenous Seipin gene to that end. From your cover letter, I understand that this was attempted, but failed. The alternative approach you took – to cover the null with wild-type or mutant Seipin, in trans – is also acceptable, in principle. However, it remains essential to be able to relate the levels of expression achieved by this alternative approach to the endogenous levels of expression in the cell line in which the experiments were performed (SH SY5Y cells in this case). Perhaps I missed it, but to my reading Figure 10 shows comparability in expression of the wildtype and mutant Seipin transgenic protein in the Seipin∆ cells. I could find no assay that compares this to the expression of endogenous Seipin in the parental wild-type cells.</p><p>If I missed this critical piece of data, kindly direct me to it.</p><p>If the measurement is missing from the paper, please endeavour to complete it and submit a revised version with this critical piece.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74805.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers were divided in their perception of the significance attributed to the changes in SERCA activity and calcium metabolism observed in cells expressing wild type and ngSeipin.

Furthermore, simultaneous expression of ngSeipin and wtSeipin by transfection each at a half amount of the above plasmid evoked the same phenotype (text p. 19-21, Figure 10).</p><p>We will keep working on knock-in experiments and hope to publish the positive results as a Research Advance in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Much rests on the claim that ngSeipin is more aggregation prone than the wild type.

Expression of ngSeipin(DC) but not ngSeipin(M6) produced double-negative regions in the ER. These results are consistent with those of PLA. Thus, ngSeipin is aggregation-prone and oligomerization-dependent aggregation of ngSeipin incorporates SERCA2b into aggregates, resulting in inactivation of SERCA2b (text p. 16-18, Figure 8, 8-S1, 8-S2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The consensus amongst the reviewers is that the paper has not shown that MND caused by ngSeipin is a consequence of the calcium perturbation and ER stress.

The alternative approach you took – to cover the null with wild-type or mutant Seipin, in trans – is also acceptable, in principle. However, it remains essential to be able to relate the levels of expression achieved by this alternative approach to the endogenous levels of expression in the cell line in which the experiments were performed (SH SY5Y cells in this case). Perhaps I missed it, but to my reading Figure 10 shows comparability in expression of the wildtype and mutant Seipin transgenic protein in the Seipin∆ cells. I could find no assay that compares this to the expression of endogenous Seipin in the parental wild-type cells. If I missed this critical piece of data, kindly direct me to it.</p><p>If the measurement is missing from the paper, please endeavour to complete it and submit a revised version with this critical piece. For my part, I'll accelerate the handling of the paper as much as I can, as I realise it has now been under review for over one year.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added quantified data of immunoblotting to Figure 10A(c).</p><p>We have estimated transfection efficiency to be approximately 15% by transfecting</p><p>SH-SY5Y cells with plasmid (104 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>) to express G-CEPIA1er.
