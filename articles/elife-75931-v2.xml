has been challenging to establish. We used interference reflection microscopy to make improved measurements of microtubule growth rates and growth fluctuations in the presence and absence of GTP hydrolysis. In the absence of GTP hydrolysis, microtubules grew steadily with very low fluctuations. These data were best described by a computational model implementing slow assembly kinetics, such that the rate of microtubule elongation is primarily limited by the rate of αβ-tubulin associations. With GTPase present, microtubules displayed substantially larger growth fluctuations than expected based on the no GTPase measurements. Our modeling showed that these larger fluctuations occurred because exposure of GDP-tubulin on the microtubule end transiently ‘poisoned’ growth, yielding a wider range of growth rates compared to GTP only conditions. Our experiments and modeling point to slow association kinetics (strong longitudinal interactions), such that drugs and regulatory proteins that alter microtubule dynamics could do so by modulating either the association or dissociation rate of tubulin from the microtubule tip. By causing slower growth, exposure of GDP-tubulin at the growing microtubule end may be an important early event determining catastrophe.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubule dynamics</kwd><kwd>biochemistry</kwd><kwd>bovine brain</kwd><kwd>fluctuation</kwd><kwd>kinetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1615938</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Tae</given-names></name><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>Lauren A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>Luke M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM135565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>Lauren A</given-names></name><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>Luke M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM139568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cleary</surname><given-names>Joseph M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hancock</surname><given-names>William O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM108563</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cleary</surname><given-names>Joseph M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM008297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Tae</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>State-of-the-art measurements of microtubule growth combined with computational models provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying microtubule elongation, including a role for GDP on the growing microtubule end.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The microtubule cytoskeleton is essential for the proper organization of the interior of eukaryotic cells: microtubules build the mitotic spindle that mediates faithful chromosome segregation during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prosser and Pelletier, 2017</xref>), they mediate organelle positioning and help establish cellular polarity, and they form tracks for motor-based transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>). Microtubules are dynamic, multi-stranded polymers that grow and shrink by addition and loss of αβ-tubulin subunits from the ends of the hollow, cylindrical polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cleary and Hancock, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howard and Hyman, 2003</xref>). The dynamic properties of microtubules are central to their function, and result from the structural and biochemical properties of individual αβ-tubulin subunits and how they interact with the microtubule lattice. It has been challenging to define the quantitative mechanisms of microtubule dynamics, because the microtubule end is a complex biochemical environment where individual tubulins adopt different conformations and can contact variable numbers of neighboring subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brouhard and Rice, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gudimchuk and McIntosh, 2021</xref>). Consequently, there is yet to be a consensus about the fundamental mechanisms governing microtubule growing, shrinking, and switching. This lack of understanding in turn limits our ability to understand how microtubule regulatory factors and/or microtubule-targeting drugs modulate polymerization dynamics.</p><p>An established approach for studying microtubule dynamics is to fit biochemical or mechanochemical models to measurements of microtubule growing and shrinking rates and frequencies of catastrophe and rescue. Early analyses of microtubule growth performed linear fits to measured concentration-dependent microtubule growth rates to estimate the apparent association and dissociation rate constants for tubulin:microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergen and Borisy, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Walker et al., 1988</xref>) reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cleary and Hancock, 2021</xref>. This ‘1D’ model provides a simple, phenomenological way to describe changes in microtubule dynamics caused by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McAlear and Bechstedt, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Strothman et al., 2019</xref>). However, the 1D model assumes that all tubulin interactions at the microtubule end are equal, whereas it is well established that the microtubule end presents multiple binding sites that differ in affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atherton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chrétien et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McIntosh et al., 2018</xref>). 2D ‘lattice’ models explicitly represent the microtubule protofilaments and thereby can provide a more realistic biochemical model for the microtubule end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Hill, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Margolin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piedra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">VanBuren et al., 2002</xref>). Using a small number (~4–5) of fitting parameters, these models can recapitulate measured growing and shrinking rates, and catastrophes emerge naturally as a consequence of GTPase activity. These biochemical models do not capture all observed aspects of microtubule dynamics (e.g. the concentration dependence of catastrophe, and the ability of depolymerizing microtubules to do mechanical work), but they provide a relatively simple minimal framework for the molecular mechanisms that underlie microtubule dynamics.</p><p>In principle, fluctuations in microtubule growth rate contain complementary information to constrain models. Early attempts to measure the fluctuations in microtubule growth used an optical trap assay in which the elongating end of the microtubule was grown against a barrier so that movements of the microtubule reflected growth or shrinkage at the end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kerssemakers et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schek et al., 2007</xref>). These studies revealed that growth episodes were punctuated by small phases of rapid shrinking that had not previously been observable by light microscopy. Microtubule growth fluctuations were subsequently studied by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in a study that argued for a model where tubulin interactions at the tip occur rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In prior work, we measured interactions between individual αβ-tubulin and the microtubule end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mickolajczyk et al., 2019b</xref>) using a combination of nanogold-labeled yeast αβ-tubulin and interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ortega-Arroyo and Kukura, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Young and Kukura, 2019</xref>). Those measurements revealed that the association and dissociation of individual αβ-tubulins occurred more slowly than had been expected based on an earlier analysis of microtubule growth rates and fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>). However, the extent to which these apparently contradictory findings were in conflict was difficult to assess: in addition to using different methods to determine growth fluctuations, the two studies used different sources of αβ-tubulin (fungal for the single-molecule measurements, mammalian brain for the study of fluctuations).</p><p>In the present study, we used interference reflection microscopy (IRM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahamdeh and Howard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahamdeh et al., 2018</xref>) to observe the in vitro growth rates and fluctuations of bovine brain microtubules at high temporal resolution. We performed measurements in the presence of GTP (where the microtubules can undergo catastrophe as a consequence of GTPase activity) and in the presence of the hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog GMPCPP (to provide biochemically simpler measurements for analysis). Growth in GMPCPP showed a very small critical concentration, reflecting high affinity interactions between αβ-tubulin subunits and the microtubule end, as well as small concentration-dependent fluctuations in growth. These characteristics were recapitulated in a biochemical model featuring slow association and dissociation kinetics and in which relatively strong head-to-tail interactions between αβ-tubulins dictate more ragged and tapered microtubule end configurations. Meanwhile, growth in GTP resulted in substantially larger concentration-dependent fluctuations in growth rate than expected from extrapolation of the GMPCPP measurements. These larger magnitude fluctuations could not be recapitulated by the ‘GTP only’ model of microtubule elongation that provided a good description of the GMPCPP measurements. However, when it allowed for GTP hydrolysis, the model produced fluctuations in growth rates comparable to those observed experimentally. These larger, GTPase-induced fluctuations in simulations resulted from transient, growth inhibitory effects of GDP-tubulin at the end of one or more protofilaments. Collectively, these results support a model of microtubule growth in which tubulin binding dynamics are relatively slow and dominated by longitudinal interactions, and in which exposure of terminal GDP-tubulin regulates the addition of incoming tubulin subunits at the plus-end.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>When GTPase activity is blocked, microtubules show very low fluctuations in growth rate</title><p>We used IRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahamdeh and Howard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahamdeh et al., 2018</xref>) to measure the dynamics of bovine brain microtubules with high temporal resolution (10 frames/s) and good signal-to-noise ratio (exceeding 4).

Longitudinal interactions are predicted to be strongest (K<sub>D</sub><sup>long</sup> ~1 μM affinity or stronger) for the smallest k<sub>on</sub> value tested.

This variation in the magnitude of fluctuations as a function of k<sub>on</sub> suggests that the fluctuations are reflecting some property of the microtubule end that varies with longitudinal affinity. To compare the (noise-free) fluctuations obtained from the simulations to those measured in experiments, we added to the simulated values the ‘noise offset’ of 0.97 nm<sup>2</sup>/s obtained from measuring the fluctuations of GMPCPP seeds that were not detectably elongating.

The inability to recapitulate fluctuations is notable in light of the fact that the higher tubulin concentration (which gives a faster rate of association) and weaker corner affinity (which increases the rates of dissociation compared to the GMPCPP simulations) might have been expected by themselves to give much larger fluctuations. Altering the model (see Materials and methods) to use different on-rate constants for longitudinal, corner, and ‘bucket’ binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castle and Odde, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>) also did not improve predictions of fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in contrast to what we observed for elongation in GMPCPP, the GTPase-free model cannot recapitulate the growth fluctuations measured in GTP. Instead, some other mechanism or state that is missing from the minimal model must be needed to generate larger fluctuations.</p><p>We simulated microtubule dynamics in the presence of GTPase activity to test whether GTPase could represent this missing, fluctuation-increasing mechanism. We assume GTP acts in trans to stabilize the lattice because this is most consistent with biochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piedra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2008</xref>) and structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Incorporating GTPase activity required two additional parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Rice, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piedra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">VanBuren et al., 2002</xref>; see Materials and methods): the rate constant for GTP hydrolysis and the weakening effect of GDP on the strength of tubulin:tubulin interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Because of the potential degeneracy in parameter values mentioned above, we focused on trends with increasing GTPase rate rather than focusing on one particular value of the GTPase rate. As the rate of GTPase activity was increased in successive simulations, microtubule growth rates decreased and their fluctuations increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). It is notable and somewhat counterintuitive that the fluctuations increased as growth rates decreased, because slower growth would normally be expected to produce smaller fluctuations (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The magnitude of the fluctuations increased sufficiently to match or even exceed the experimental measurements (dashed red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, GTPase activity and its introduction of a second biochemical state allows the simulations to recapitulate the experimentally observed magnitude of fluctuations.</p><p>GTPase activity cannot occur in the terminal plus-end subunits because GTPase activity requires that a longitudinal interface be formed ‘above’ the GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nogales et al., 1998</xref>). So how does GTPase activity affect microtubule growth rates and fluctuations, which are dictated by the binding and unbinding of subunits at the microtubule end? GDP-bound tubulins can be exposed on the microtubule end as a consequence of the dissociation of more terminal subunits (closer to the protofilament end). Instantaneous growth rates calculated from simulations without GTPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, top left) vary in a relatively narrow range, whereas those calculated from simulations with GTPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, top right) show much larger variations. In the simulations with GTPase, the largest decreases in growth rate occur when multiple protofilaments have a terminal GDP (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> top and bottom). Even a relatively low average frequency of GDP exposure shows demonstrable effects on microtubule growth rates, and even more so on fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Improved methods for measuring microtubule growth rates and fluctuations</title><p>We used IRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahamdeh and Howard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahamdeh et al., 2018</xref>) to measure microtubule dynamics with high time resolution and without the need for fluorescent labeling, which allowed for longer recordings.

Kinetic simulations implementing a minimal biochemical model for microtubule elongation recapitulated the observed growth rates using a range of association rate constants, with slower association rates compensated for by stronger longitudinal interactions.

A slow on-rate and strong longitudinal affinity produce small fluctuations in growth and a large taper because the protofilaments grow somewhat independently of one another. A fast on-rate and weak longitudinal affinity produce small fluctuations in growth and a small taper because only corner interactions contribute to productive growth. The middle range produces the largest fluctuations in growth rate and best matches the measured fluctuations. The reason that this regime produces the largest fluctuations is because is where the average taper is itself varying the most, which leads to episodes of faster or slower growth depending on the end configuration. (Right) When GTPase activity is present, the growth fluctuations are much larger than in GMPCPP where hydrolysis is absent. The growth rate fluctuates more drastically due to switching between fast growth phases, when all terminal tubulins contain GTP, and slow growth phases resulting from one or more exposed GDP-tubulin at the tip. When the exposed GDP-tubulin either dissociates or is buried by an incoming GTP-tubulin, an all-GTP tip with a corresponding fast growth rate is restored.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75931-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In our minimal model for microtubule dynamics, the parameters that gave the best fit to the GMPCPP growth rates and growth rate fluctuations corresponded to relatively slow associations and relatively strong longitudinal associations.

It is also consistent with the emerging view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erickson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gudimchuk and McIntosh, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McIntosh et al., 2018</xref>) that microtubule protofilaments can elongate somewhat independently of each other.

To fit the observed growth rates with a GTPase-free kinetic model required weaker longitudinal and corner binding affinities compared to the GMPCPP data, reflecting the more elevated critical concentration of the dynamic microtubules (growing in GTP), and revealing a significant biochemical difference between GMPCPP and GTP in the interactions that drive elongation. The affinities that best fit observed growth rates in the present work are in the same general range (K<sub>D</sub><sup>corner</sup> ~ 3 μM, K<sub>D</sub><sup>long</sup> ~ 2 mM) as those obtained fitting similar models to different datasets (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Rice, 2019</xref>). The GTPase-free model, which only considers the GTP state of tubulin, could not recapitulate the growth fluctuations of dynamic microtubules. Because the GTPase-free model could recapitulate both the growth rates and fluctuations of microtubules growing in GMPCPP, it seemed likely that the fluctuations of dynamic microtubules reflect contributions from at least one additional biochemical state. Our modeling showed that exposure of GDP-bound αβ-tubulin on the end of protofilaments increases the variability in microtubule growth by transiently ‘poisoning’ elongation, yielding fluctuations comparable to those observed experimentally. Thus, the fluctuations of growing dynamic microtubules do not solely reflect properties of GTP-tubulin. The notion that growing microtubule ends expose GDP is not widely accepted, but we argue that it should be considered as an important factor. Indeed, the decrease in growth rate that accompanies GDP exposure(s) may represent an early event in the initiation of catastrophe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piedra et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations of the modeling</title><p>We chose to use biochemically simplified models in the hopes of identifying the minimal set of parameters capable of recapitulating a given set of observations. Consequently, we did not attempt to explicitly account for either the assembly-dependent conformational changes that accompany αβ-tubulin incorporation into the microtubule and that probably alter the strength of lattice contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brouhard and Rice, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brouhard and Rice, 2018</xref>), or for ‘mechanochemical’ effects that consider spring-like properties of αβ-tubulin conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brouhard and Rice, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gudimchuk and McIntosh, 2021</xref>). Incorporation of these different conformational states and/or transitions may improve the model’s ability to simultaneously recapitulate growth rates, growth rate fluctuations, and end tapers. Because we refine the longitudinal and corner affinities independently (without imposing a fixed relationship between the two), some of these effects might be captured implicitly. We also did not allow for the possibility of GDP to GTP exchange on the microtubule end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piedra et al., 2016</xref>). This is a lesser limitation because a finite rate of exchange would only modulate the amount of GDP on the microtubule end for a given GTPase rate; it would not eliminate the ‘poisoning’ effect of GDP exposure that increases fluctuations in growth rate. Whatever the limitations of our model, our results clearly show that (i) there are ‘excess’ fluctuations for microtubules with GTP compared to GMPCPP and (ii) a simple ‘one-state’ model can recapitulate the growth rates and fluctuations in GMPCPP, but an additional state is required to generate the larger fluctuations observed with GTP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for mechanisms of dynamics and regulation</title><p>Our findings have three general implications for the mechanisms of microtubule dynamics and regulation. First, they support a model in which the association kinetics are relatively slow, with longitudinal associations correspondingly strong. This view is consistent with a recent single-molecule study of yeast microtubule growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mickolajczyk et al., 2019b</xref>), and it also resonates with structure-based evidence that microtubule protofilaments can elongate somewhat independently from one another (so-called flared ends) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erickson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gudimchuk and McIntosh, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McIntosh et al., 2018</xref>). Second, although GDP-tubulin is not widely thought to be present on growing microtubule ends, our results indicate that transient exposure of GDP-tubulin on protofilament ends causes larger fluctuations in microtubule growth rate than would be expected from ‘all GTP’ elongation. Because the size of the GTP cap decreases with slower growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duellberg et al., 2016</xref>), this consequence for GDP-terminated protofilaments provides a possible mechanism for the initiating events of microtubule catastrophe. Finally, our findings provide new ways of thinking about potential mechanisms that regulatory factors use to control microtubule dynamics. The relatively slow association kinetics we observe imply that modulating the rate of αβ-tubulin association or dissociation each provide viable strategies for controlling microtubule elongation rates. Indeed, Stu2/XMAP215 family polymerases are thought to accelerate microtubule growth by increasing the rate of αβ-tubulin associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>). More speculatively, it seems plausible that a regulatory factor might be able to control microtubule elongation or catastrophe by altering the lifetime of GDP-tubulin on the microtubule end, either by altering the rate of nucleotide hydrolysis or exchange, or by altering the rate at which the GDP-bound subunits dissociate from the growing end.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tubulin purification and labeling</title><p>PC-grade bovine brain tubulin was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Uppalapati et al., 2009</xref>), cycled twice, quantified by A<sub>280</sub> (ε = 115,000 M<sup>–1</sup> cm<sup>–1</sup>), diluted to either 80 or 15 μM in BRB80 (80 mM K-Pipes, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 6.9), aliquoted, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Briefly, microtubule backbones were generated, with an average size of 6.5 μm, following a 3-start helix B-lattice model. The radius of the microtubule was set to 25 nm and the tubulin dimer length was set to 8.2 nm. Tapered microtubule plus-ends were designed as a uniform distribution of protofilament lengths with stepwise increases in length occurring linearly from the 1st and 13th protofilament, making the center protofilament the longest. The average photon emission per tubulin subunit was determined by measuring the magnitude of the microtubule signal (1160 arbitrary intensity units, corresponding to a 5.2% contrast signal) relative to the average signal from back reflected light (22,300 units) on a 16-bit image (65,535 units maximum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mickolajczyk et al., 2019a</xref>). A mask was defined and the microtubule placed randomly along a 1024 × 1024 pixel image (59.4 × 59.4 μm<sup>2</sup>). Then photons were generated and distributed to various positions along the artificial image according to the Gaussian standard deviation calculated from the full-width half maximum (250 ± 90 nm) measured using the cross-section of the microtubule backbones in the images. Photon shot noise was then added based on the standard deviation of the background (181 units out of 65,535; this corresponds to a signal to noise of 6.2). The final image was then inverted and converted to an 8-bit image following the post-processing procedure used on the experimental videos and the microtubule tip was tracked using the same tracking algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Demchouk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prahl et al., 2014</xref>) used for the experimental measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Simulating microtubule growth</title><p>We used the simulation code and analysis algorithms described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Rice, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mickolajczyk et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piedra et al., 2016</xref>), with minor modifications. Briefly (diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), the code performs kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of microtubule polymerization dynamics. The overall approach is similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">VanBuren et al., 2002</xref>, with some differences described below. Microtubule dynamics are simulated one biochemical reaction at a time (αβ-tubulin subunit association or dissociation, and GTP hydrolysis), with the microtubule lattice represented by a 2D array with a periodic boundary condition that mimics the cylindrical wall and ‘seam’ of 13 protofilament microtubules. Association reactions are allowed at the end of each protofilament, and assumed to occur at a rate given by k<sub>on</sub>[αβ-tubulin], where k<sub>on</sub> denotes the assumed on rate constant (but see below for a site-dependent association rate constants). Dissociation reactions occur at a rate given by k<sub>on</sub> × K<sub>D</sub>, where K<sub>D</sub> is the affinity determined by the sum of longitudinal and lateral contacts for the dissociating subunit. In practice, this means that dissociations occur almost exclusively from terminal subunits. As described previously, (i) we do not allow pure lateral associations, and consequently the model parameter describing the strength of lateral contacts does not account for the entropic cost of subunit immobilization, and (ii) we do not allow completely surrounded subunits to dissociate. The GTPase reaction is assumed to occur at a rate given by k<sub>GTPase</sub> on all non-terminal subunits. Our parameterization assumes that the nucleotide (GTP or GDP) acts in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Piedra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rice et al., 2008</xref>) to modulate the strength of longitudinal contacts. The modulation is represented as a multiplicative factor X such that K<sub>D</sub>(GDP) = X*K<sub>D</sub>(GTP), where X is a large, positive number, and K<sub>D</sub>(GDP) and K<sub>D</sub>(GTP) represent the affinity of a given interaction with GDP or GTP, respectively, at the longitudinal interface. An ‘execution time’ for each possible event is chosen by randomly sampling an exponential distribution e<sup>-rate*t</sup>, where rate denotes the characteristic rate for that type of event. At each step of the simulation, the fastest event (shortest execution time) is implemented, meaning that the microtubule configuration is updated, the list of possible events and rates refreshed accordingly, and the simulation time advanced by the execution time. In this way, different kinds of reactions occur with relative probability determined by their relative rates. The simulations output lists of user-specified quantities (such as the number of tubulins in the microtubule, or the lengths of each protofilament, or the number of GTP-tubulins in the microtubule, or others) as a function of time.

The discrepancy between chosen simulation outputs (normally growth rates but in some cases also fluctuations in growth rate), averaged over the independent simulations, was minimized by varying the longitudinal and corner affinities. For simulations that included GTPase activity, we first identified the ‘GDP weakening factor’ that gave shrinking rates for all GDP microtubules that were comparable to the measured shrinking rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Allowing site-dependent on-rate constants</title><p>We modified the model to allow for different on-rate constants for different kinds of binding sites (longitudinal, corner, or bucket sites, which correspond to a longitudinal contact with 0, 1, or 2 lateral contacts).

We set the association rate constant into corner sites to be identical to that used in the simpler, single association rate constant simulations, and then scaled the longitudinal and bucket associations to be faster and slower, respectively. This way of doing things minimized the differences in the strength of longitudinal and corner interactions between the single and multiple association rate constant simulations.

analysis, the authors find that microtubule growth fluctuations are less pronounced than previously reported and that GTP hydrolysis in microtubules increases these fluctuations. A mathematical model of microtubule growth suggests that occasionally exposed GDP at the microtubule end can be responsible for increased growth fluctuations. This work provides new mechanistic insight into the molecular mechanism of microtubule growth.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75931.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Surrey</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03wyzt892</institution-id><institution>Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG)</institution></institution-wrap><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Mogilner</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0190ak572</institution-id><institution>New York University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.11.24.469935">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.24.469935v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alex Mogilner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide more context and a broader motivation for the study in the Introduction making sure relevant literature is cited and shorten the summary of the results in the Introduction to avoid repetition.</p><p>2) Model: Please explain if/why a 2D model is needed for microtubule growth (instead of only single filament model).</p><p>3) Discussion: Please compare the model and the parameters used here to the relevant previous modelling studies, including a recent study of the authors (see reviewers' comments).</p><p>4) Please make sure that all error bars are provided and clearly stated.</p><p>5) Please make other editorial changes where appropriate to improve clarity of presentation, considering the suggestions made by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The Introduction currently provides a long summary of the results after a rather short introduction of previous work addressing the question of microtubule growth fluctuations. The topic could be introduced in a more comprehensive and a more conceptual manner and the summary of the results could in turn be shortened.</p><p>2. The Discussion could more clearly explain the difference between previous exclusively taper-shape dependent growth models and the model here which is a mixture of a taper shape and GTP hydrolysis model. Particularly why previous taper shape-dependent models that could explain even larger growth fluctuations now seem to fail for the reduced growth fluctuations of GTP microtubules as measured here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I am not a serious experimental expert, but from my limited perspective the experiments are done very well. The model, simulations and comparison with the data are flawless.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is rough and needs significant revisions:</p><p>– The Introduction devotes too much text to summarizing the results (all of page 3 basically) and too little text to introducing the question and the state of the debate. It's really only the 2nd paragraph that introduces pertinent papers. The authors should reach further back than Gardner 2011, because Gardner 2011 was itself part of a series of studies whose intent was to measure the kinetics of polymerization. E.g. Kerssemakers et al., Nature 2006 and Schek et al., Curr Biol 2007 come to mind. Classic citations relating to association kinetics, like Northrup and Erickson PNAS 1992, would help contextualize the tubulin results in a broader biochemical context. As it stands, the motivation for the paper appears to be &quot;confirm Mickolajczyk but with bovine tubulin&quot;, and that's an under-sell.</p><p>– Several key figure panels not referred to in the text at all. E.g., I could not find a call out to Figure 1D and 1E, even though these figure panels are complex and difficult to understand. Please ensure that every figure panel is explained and called out individually. Figure 1D in particular is challenging for non-specialists.</p><p>– Many data points are missing error bars. See the bottom half of Figure 2. There should be error bars on the computational output as well, because stochastic simulations produce variable results. If the error is smaller than the displayed data point, please state so in the figure legend.</p><p>In addition, I recommend the following specific changes:</p><p>– The raw data kymographs are far too small (Figure 1B and Figure 3A). The quality of the raw IRM data looks very good, but it cannot be clearly assessed from such shrunken examples.</p><p>– When I compare Figure 1B (GMPCPP, low fluctuations) to Figure 3A (GTP, higher fluctuations), it's actually Figure 3A that appears to have smoother length vs. time plots. The issue is probably related to y-axis scaling, and I recommend consistent y-axes. In fact, it would be excellent to place GMCPP traces directly adjacent to GTP traces (perhaps in Figure 3), because that would allow for direct visualization of the core comparison being made in the manuscript. Figure 1-S1 does a nice job showing a side-by-side of pixel corrected vs. sub-pixel corrected.</p><p>– There is some inconsistency in the units used to describe bonds. E.g., Figure 2C uses molar affinities but Figure 2-S2 uses kT. I think in kT personally, but it's also fine if Figure 2-S2 shows affinity. Then the red arrow would point to 25 nM.</p><p>– Figure 2 S2 shows that the lateral bond strength parameter is not well specified, in the sense that the fitting residual is constant and minimal over at least a 4 kT range. Thus, the choice of lateral affinity (25 nM) is somewhat arbitrary, and the lateral affinity could be described as a &quot;sloppy&quot; parameter. Lateral bonds were also shown to be sloppy parameters that could be compressed out of a computational model of dynamic instability by Hsu et al., Biophys J 2020.</p><p>– Merge Figure 2 S4 and S5 --I understand the awkwardness there is that the other 3 show scaling of both k-on and K-D, while the best fit keeps the k-on of the &quot;red&quot; model and differs in K-D only. But right now I find it confusing, like there's a shadow parameter set that is not shown in some figures (main Figure 2, Figure 2 S3), but which is actually the most important parameter set. I encourage the authors to present all 4 parameter sets in a single, consistent format.</p><p>– In Figure 4, I recommend putting all of the model parameters in the figure itself. The parameters are currently found in the legend (4A), but the reader would find them more easily in the figure itself, and it would be clearer that the new parameters are NOT taken from previous figures, because of the new fitting to the GTP-growth data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75931.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide more context and a broader motivation for the study in the Introduction making sure relevant literature is cited and shorten the summary of the results in the Introduction to avoid repetition.</p></disp-quote><p>We had internal discussions about the structure of our introduction before submitting the paper, so this comment did not exactly come as a surprise. We overhauled the introduction to provide more context about prior work and thinking, and to better motivate our experiments and analyses. As part of the re-write, we discussed the 1D model and explained why it is inadequate. We also shortened the summary of the results as suggested to limit repetition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Model: Please explain if/why a 2D model is needed for microtubule growth (instead of only single filament model).</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this point in our updated introduction. The 1D model oversimplifies the biochemistry because it assumes that there is only one kind of binding site on the microtubule end. But we know this is not true – the microtubule end can present multiple binding sites that differ in the number of contacts to neighboring tubulins. These different binding sites are expected to have substantially different affinities, but those different affinities cannot be obtained from the on- and off-rate constants obtained from a 1D model. We elaborate on this point in our response to one of the questions from reviewer 1, below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Discussion: Please compare the model and the parameters used here to the relevant previous modelling studies, including a recent study of the authors (see reviewers' comments).</p></disp-quote><p>In responding to this comment, we focused on fits to the growth rates measured in GTP, because there are very few measurements of, and fits to, growth rates in GMPCPP.</p><p>We added a sentence in the Discussion to provide more commentary comparing our model to prior work in the area (from us and others), and to point out that we did not attempt to capture any mechanochemical features. Around line 422.</p><p>We expanded a second paragraph to compare the parameters obtained from fitting the growth rates in the presence of GTP to our prior fittings to other datasets. The fitted parameters are in the same general range that we and others have obtained, but more detailed comparison seems unwarranted because of differences in the measured growth rates between fitted sets and because of the different on-rate constants used (which are coupled to the longitudinal affinity).

There is the question of how fluctuations are determined from measurements. As we state in the text, our study used a more robust method to determine fluctuations than was available at the time of the earlier study <italic>(Gardner et al., “Rapid microtubule assembly kinetics”, Cell 2011)</italic> that we presume that the reviewer is referring to. That earlier study also used ‘concatenated’ growth episodes, which we showed leads to inflated estimates of fluctuations (Figure 1 —figure supplements 1-3). The earlier study introduced an on-rate penalty for lagging protofilaments – the way this was implemented generated ‘canyons’ (described in Castle and Odde, “Brownian dynamics of subunit addition-loss kinetics and thermodynamics in linear polymer self-assembly”, Biophys J 2013) that might contribute to elevated variations in microtubule growth rate for at least two reasons: first, because the presence of a canyon effectively reduced the number of protofilaments, and second because the presence of a canyon interrupted the pseudo-helical nature of the microtubule lattice (thereby introducing a barrier to elongation).</p><p>We added some text to be clearer about differences between models (around lines 311 and 364).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript is rough and needs significant revisions:</p><p>– The Introduction devotes too much text to summarizing the results (all of page 3 basically) and too little text to introducing the question and the state of the debate.

To try to provide a more intuitive view of the magnitude of fluctuations, we added a new set of panels to Figure 3 that we hope provides a more intuitive view. This panel shows the fluctuations around the mean growth from the traces shown in Figure 1B and Figure 3A. We chose 1.5 μm GMPCPP and 7.5 μm GTP to because they had the closest growth rate rates of 2.6 nm/s and 5.04 nm/s respectively. As shown in figure 3 E, the faster the microtubule growth the higher the fluctuations. Here, we can see that a 2-fold change in velocity results in a &gt;3fold change in fluctuations.
