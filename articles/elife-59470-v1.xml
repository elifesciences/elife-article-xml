subset of neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) that express galanin play crucial roles in regulating parental behavior in both sexes. However, little information is available on the function of galanin in social behaviors in other species. Here, we report that, in medaka, a subset of MPOA galanin neurons occurred nearly exclusively in males, resulting from testicular androgen stimulation. Galanin-deficient medaka showed a greatly reduced incidence of male–male aggressive chases. Furthermore, while treatment of female medaka with androgen induced male-typical aggressive acts, galanin deficiency in these females attenuated the effect of androgen on chases. Given their male-biased and androgen-dependent nature, the subset of MPOA galanin neurons most likely mediate androgen-dependent male–male chases. Histological studies further suggested that variability in the projection targets of the MPOA galanin neurons may account for the species-dependent functional differences in these evolutionarily conserved neural substrates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aggression</kwd><kwd>androgen</kwd><kwd>galanin</kwd><kwd>medaka</kwd><kwd>medial preoptic area</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17J08702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Junpei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H04979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okubo</surname><given-names>Kataaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okubo</surname><given-names>Kataaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okubo</surname><given-names>Kataaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In medaka fish, galanin-expressing neurons in the medial preoptic area occur nearly exclusively in males and mediate androgen-dependent male–male aggressive chases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Almost all animals interact socially with conspecifics at some stage of their lives (e.g. for territorial/resource disputes, mating, and parenting) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Hong, 2018</xref>). A group of reciprocally connected brain regions that regulates social behaviors in concert with sex steroids and neuropeptides, sometimes referred to as the ‘social behavior network’, has been highly conserved over the 450 million years of vertebrate evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Newman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Connell and Hofmann, 2012</xref>). The preoptic area (POA) is the most highly conserved node of this network, containing subsets of steroid receptor- and neuropeptide-expressing neurons that regulate a wide range of social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Connell and Hofmann, 2012</xref>). While the social behavior network seems to be fundamental to the expression of social behaviors in all vertebrate species and both sexes, a large variation in social behaviors is apparent across species and sexes. This suggests that there is a degree of underlying variation—at either the structural or chemical level—in behaviorally relevant neural circuits, which in turn has spurred a growing interest in uncovering the neural substrates underlying species- and sex-dependent differences in social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang and Shah, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Hong, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recent evidence in mice demonstrates that a subset of neurons in the medial POA (MPOA) that express the pleiotropic neuropeptide galanin (abbreviated as GAL or Gal depending on species) play a crucial role in regulating parental behavior in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). GAL-expressing neurons are commonly found in the MPOA of vertebrates, including teleost fish, the majority of which do not provide parental care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer and O'Connell, 2017</xref>). This raises the question of the role of these neurons in such non-parental species. Curiously, studies in several teleost species have consistently shown that males have many more MPOA Gal neurons than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornbrooks and Parsons, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodríguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tripp and Bass, 2020</xref>). This contrasts with the situation in mammals, where either there is no sex difference in the number of these neurons, or the direction of the sex difference (if any) varies among species and even within strains in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloch et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mathieson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Based on this distinctive feature, Gal neurons in the teleost MPOA are assumed to be involved in some male-biased behavior. Indeed, studies in midshipman fish (<italic>Porichthys notatus</italic>) have shown that MPOA Gal neurons are activated during mating, thereby suggesting that they have a role in mating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tripp and Bass, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tripp et al., 2020</xref>). To our knowledge, however, no attempt has been made to directly test these ideas. Furthermore, the mechanism that causes the male-biased sex difference in teleost Gal neurons remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In recent years, the teleost fish medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) has emerged as an effective model organism for studying social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okuyama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiraki-Kajiyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yokoi et al., 2020</xref>). In medaka, females spawn once daily over the spawning period, whereas males can spawn multiple times a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weir and Grant, 2010</xref>). Neither males nor females provide parental care after spawning. Adult males compete aggressively for territories and access to food and mates, whereas females engage in far less aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grant and Foam, 2002</xref>). Here, we have identified a specific population of neurons in the medaka MPOA that express <italic>gal</italic> nearly exclusively in males, extending the findings in other teleost species. We have further explored the mechanism underlying this differential <italic>gal</italic> expression and provide direct evidence that Gal indeed has a male-biased, but unexpected, behavioral role in medaka.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Male-biased sexual dimorphism exists in <italic>gal</italic> expression in the MPOA</title><p>Screening of a full-length cDNA library constructed from the medaka brain facilitated the isolation of a cDNA whose deduced protein had the best BLAST hits to GAL in other species (deposited in GenBank with accession number LC532140) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Faint-to-moderate expression of <italic>gal</italic> was also seen in the pineal gland (data not shown). Although there were no sex differences in these spatial patterns, striking sexual dimorphism was observed in pPMp, where <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons occurred much more abundantly in males than in females (p&lt;0.0001, <italic>t</italic> = 12.1, <italic>df</italic> = 8; unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and G</xref>).

First, we estimated the magnitude of chromosomal and gonadal influences on the pattern of <italic>gal</italic> expression by producing sex-reversed medaka and examining <italic>gal</italic> expression in the brain. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that sex-reversed XX males exhibited the same high level of brain <italic>gal</italic> expression as typical XY males, whereas sex-reversed XY females showed a much lower level (p&lt;0.0001, <italic>t</italic> = 17.2, <italic>df</italic> = 28 versus XY males; p&lt;0.0001, <italic>t</italic> = 15.8, <italic>df</italic> = 28 versus XX males; Bonferroni’s post hoc test), comparable to that in typical XX females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In accordance with these results, in situ hybridization revealed that castration caused a significant reduction in the number of <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons in pPMp (p=0.0048, <italic>t</italic> = 3.79, <italic>df</italic> = 16; Bonferroni’s post hoc test), which was restored by KT treatment (p=0.0052, <italic>t</italic> = 3.75, <italic>df</italic> = 16; Bonferroni’s post hoc test) but not by E2 treatment (p=0.28, <italic>t</italic> = 1.79, <italic>df</italic> = 16; Bonferroni’s post hoc test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>), although E2 treatment increased the number of <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons in aPMp/pPPa (p=0.013, <italic>t</italic> = 3.33, <italic>df</italic> = 16; Bonferroni’s post hoc test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In females, no significant changes in the level of brain <italic>gal</italic> expression after ovariectomy or steroid treatments were detected by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, in situ hybridization revealed that ovariectomy caused a significant increase in the number of <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons in pPMp (p=0.020, <italic>t</italic> = 3.11, <italic>df</italic> = 16; Bonferroni’s post hoc test), which was further enhanced by subsequent KT treatment (p=0.0008, <italic>t</italic> = 4.63, <italic>df</italic> = 16; Bonferroni’s post hoc test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). Conversely, the increase was significantly attenuated by E2 treatment (p=0.040, <italic>t</italic> = 2.79, <italic>df</italic> = 16; Bonferroni’s post hoc test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). Together, these results indicate that high circulating levels of androgen derived from the testis cause a marked increase in <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons in pPMp in adult males, whereas the absence of androgen stimulation in adult females means that these neurons remain at basal levels. In addition, these neurons are diminished in adult males deprived of androgen and, conversely, are induced in adult females deprived of estrogen and supplemented with androgen.</p><p>To assess whether androgen and estrogen could exert direct actions on sexually dimorphic <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons in pPMp, we analyzed gene expression of the androgen receptor (AR; <italic>ara</italic> and <italic>arb</italic>) and estrogen receptor (ER; <italic>esr1</italic>, <italic>esr2a</italic>, and <italic>esr2b</italic>) in these neurons by double in situ hybridization. <italic>ara</italic> was expressed in a large proportion of <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons in males and in some of the sparse <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons in females, whereas none of these neurons were positive for <italic>arb</italic> expression in either sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>esr1</italic> was expressed in a large proportion of <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons in both sexes, whereas <italic>esr2a</italic> and <italic>esr2b</italic> were expressed in these neurons only in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that androgen and estrogen may directly act on <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons in pPMp and that, if so, the stimulatory action of androgen is mediated via <italic>ara</italic>, while the inhibitory action of estrogen seen in females is mediated via <italic>esr1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genetic ablation of <italic>gal</italic> specifically suppresses male–male chases</title><p>The above results, together with the behavioral effects of Gal observed in mice, led us to assume that the male-predominant expression of <italic>gal</italic> may mediate a male-typical behavior in medaka.

Two independently derived knockout lines (Δ2 and Δ10) were tested to ensure the reproducibility of the results and to eliminate the possibility of off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9. Successful ablation of <italic>gal</italic> was confirmed by the complete loss of Gal immunoreactivity in homozygous knockout brains from both lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>); the specificity of the anti-GAL antibody used was verified by simultaneous application of immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, which showed that the antibody selectively labeled neuronal cell bodies expressing the <italic>gal</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The mating behavior tests revealed that most heterozygous and homozygous knockout males from the Δ2 and Δ10 lines spawned successfully, similar to wild-type males.

Activation of Galr1 caused a 9.8-fold reduction in intracellular cAMP levels, with a Gal concentration for half-maximal effect (EC50) of 21 pM. By contrast, activation of Galr2 increased cAMP levels 3.3-fold with a much higher EC50 value of 6.8 nM. Activation of both Galr1 and Galr2 increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with fairly similar EC50 values (130 and 800 nM, respectively), but Galr2 activation evoked a much higher maximal level as compared with Galr1 activation (76-fold versus 3.3-fold). Activation of both Galr1 and Galr2 also moderately stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity (respectively, 6.2- and 16-fold maximal stimulation; and 40 and 72 nM EC50). In medaka, therefore, Gal signaling via Galr1 is primarily inhibitory, causing marked suppression of the cAMP pathway, whereas that via Galr2 is excitatory, mediated mainly through a robust stimulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. These findings are consistent with studies in mammals showing that GALR1 and GALR2 are primarily coupled to inhibitory Gi/Go and excitatory Gq/G11 proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In situ hybridization revealed differential patterns of <italic>galr1</italic> and <italic>galr2</italic> expression in the medaka brain. <italic>galr1</italic> was expressed in the following nuclei: Dm, Dl, Dc/Dd, and Dp in the dorsal telencephalon; Vv and Vs/Vp in the ventral telencephalon; PMp, PPa, PMm, and PPp in the POA; VM and DP/CP in the thalamus; NVT, NAT, NRL, and NPT in the hypothalamus; PGZ3 in the optic tectum; TS, LV, and is in the midbrain tegmentum; gc in the brain stem; and RM/RI and NFS/LX in the medulla oblongata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

There were no apparent sex differences in the spatial expression patterns of either receptor.</p><p>Collectively, these results indicate that Gal can have both inhibitory and excitatory effects in the medaka brain via the activation of, respectively, Galr1 and Galr2, which are widely but differentially distributed throughout the brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that the pPMp population of medaka MPOA neurons expresses Gal nearly exclusively in males. Although not specifying the exact neuronal population, studies in several other teleosts have also demonstrated a male-biased abundance of MPOA Gal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornbrooks and Parsons, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodríguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tripp and Bass, 2020</xref>), suggesting that the sexual dimorphism in pPMp Gal neurons is conserved in teleosts. This differs substantially from the situation in mammals, where sex differences in MPOA GAL neurons are species-specific and even strain-specific in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloch et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mathieson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the mechanism underlying sex differences in MPOA GAL neurons also seems to differ between medaka and mammals. In mammals, sex differences in MPOA GAL neurons are established during fetal life; this process is mediated by testicular testosterone, largely through its aromatase-mediated conversion in the brain to E2, which subsequently binds to ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloch et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 1997</xref>). By contrast, we found that the sex difference in pPMp Gal neurons in medaka emerges at the onset of puberty and is mediated by testicular KT (a non-aromatizable androgen), which acts directly via AR without conversion to E2. In addition, examination of sex-reversed medaka revealed that this sex difference is independent of sex chromosome complement and, more importantly, treatment of adult females with KT induced a significant increase in pPMp Gal neurons. This is in stark contrast to the findings in rats and ferrets, where treating adult females with testosterone/E2 did not increase GAL neurons or their axons in the MPOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Polston and Simerly, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the sex difference in MPOA Gal neurons in medaka depends largely or even perhaps solely on the pubertal/adult sex steroid milieu and can be reversed in adulthood, whereas that in mammals is irrevocably established early in life and, as a result, is robust in adulthood.</p><p>Furthermore, we detected the expression of <italic>ara</italic> in pPMp Gal neurons, suggesting that androgen directly acts on these neurons via Ara to stimulate <italic>gal</italic> expression. However, transgenic medaka carrying a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) with a GFP cassette in-frame with <italic>gal</italic> failed to recapitulate the male-biased expression pattern of endogenous <italic>gal</italic> in pPMp, although it gave an accurate representation of the sex-unbiased expression of <italic>gal</italic> in other brain nuclei. This result was unexpected because the BAC included a large segment of genomic DNA (54 kb upstream and 23 kb downstream of <italic>gal</italic>) that was considered to contain all regulatory elements for <italic>gal</italic> expression. It is possible that the regulatory element that directs androgen-dependent <italic>gal</italic> expression lies many tens or even hundreds of kilobases away from the <italic>gal</italic> gene body.</p><p>The question then turns to the specific role of the male-biased MPOA Gal neurons in teleosts. We demonstrated that genetic ablation of <italic>gal</italic> in medaka resulted in a marked reduction in aggressive chases, but no differences in other aggressive acts and parameters of mating behavior. Importantly, this behavioral deficit was observed exclusively in males, while females displayed hardly any chases or other aggressive acts regardless of their genotype. It thus seems reasonable to assume that the male-biased pPMp Gal neurons are responsible for this deficit. We further demonstrated that, while treatment of female medaka with androgen-induced male-typical aggressive behaviors, genetic ablation of <italic>gal</italic> in these females specifically attenuated the effect of androgen on chases. Given that pPMp Gal neurons were found to be the only population of Gal neurons that was male-biased and androgen-dependent, this result further supports the role of this neuronal population in chases. Taken together, our findings indicate that MPOA Gal neurons probably play an exclusive behavioral role in mediating male–male chases under the control of androgen/AR signaling in medaka. It seems likely that different aggressive acts are regulated by separate, albeit interacting, neural circuits and that MPOA Gal neurons may be specifically embedded within the circuit mediating chases, acting downstream of androgen/AR signaling, which seems to affect most, if not all, circuits. This assumption is compatible with the view that sexually dimorphic social behaviors are regulated in a modular manner by multiple sexually dimorphic genes acting downstream of sex steroid signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our results also show that heterozygous and homozygous males displayed similar defects in chases. Although we do not have additional data to clarify this finding, the level of the Gal peptide conferred by a single allele may be insufficient for normal male–male chases. Haploinsufficiency causing similar behavioral phenotypes in heterozygotes and homozygotes has been reported for several genes relevant to social interaction and communication, including <italic>Shank3</italic> (encoding an excitatory synapse scaffolding protein) and <italic>Sh3rf2</italic> (encoding a putative ubiquitin E3 ligase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bozdagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>gal</italic> may also be haploinsufficient in medaka with regard to its function in male–male chases. Alternatively, the mutated <italic>gal</italic> allele may exert a dominant-negative influence over the wild-type allele, but this seems unlikely since the mutant alleles encode functionally inert products due to introduced frameshifts in the signal peptide-coding region.</p><p>It should be noted that, in mice, MPOA GAL neurons promote the motivation to engage in parenting in part by suppressing aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). This is in marked contrast to our findings in medaka, where MPOA Gal neurons were found to promote aggression, suggesting that an evolutionarily conserved subset of neurons in the social behavior network can serve different, even opposite (affiliative versus agonistic), functions across species. The phenotypic variation in social behaviors across species has been assumed to be due largely to the different spatial distribution of neuropeptide expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Connell and Hofmann, 2012</xref>). There is scant but compelling evidence that differences in neuropeptide receptor distribution can also be the cause of behavioral variation. For example, differences in the regional densities of vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, particularly in the ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens, respectively, underlie variation in pair bonding in closely related monogamous and non-monogamous vole species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>). Similarly, vasopressin and oxytocin receptor densities in the lateral septum correlate well with variation in the propensity of different finch species to flock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kelly and Goodson, 2014</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that the altered functional role of neuropeptides can underlie the behavioral variation. Of note, this functional alteration may result from differences in the sites of action of neuropeptides. We found that, in medaka, the male-biased pPMp Gal neurons project extensively to various areas of the brain, especially to the dorsocaudal part of the telencephalon, thalamus, midbrain, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata, suggesting that these areas are the primary sites of action of the Gal that is produced male-predominantly. This notion is further supported by the presence of Gal receptors in these areas. In mice, MPOA GAL neurons also project to many areas of the brain. Interestingly, however, their primary projection targets seem to be rather different from those in medaka: these neurons in mice intensely project to, for example, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and supraoptic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). This species difference suggests that the projection targets of MPOA GAL neurons have diversified during evolution to such an extent as to facilitate species variation in the functional role of GAL.</p><p>We found that, in medaka, pPMp Gal neurons project densely to Dm and Dl in the dorsocaudal part of the telencephalon, where Galr1 is most widely and abundantly expressed. Dm and Dl are considered homologous to the mammalian basolateral amygdala and hippocampus, respectively, which lack direct projections from MPOA GAL neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Connell and Hofmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>). There is persuasive evidence both in teleosts and in mammals that these brain regions affect the decision to engage in social behaviors, including aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demski, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leroy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diaz and Lin, 2020</xref>). Given this, Gal produced in pPMp may exert its effects on chases primarily by influencing the activity of these brain regions. In Syrian hamsters, overexpression of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein in the basolateral amygdala enhances the acquisition of conditioned defeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jasnow et al., 2005</xref>). In African cichlids (<italic>Astatotilapia burtoni</italic>), neural activity in Dm and Dl is negatively correlated with the frequency of aggressive territorial defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weitekamp and Hofmann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weitekamp et al., 2017</xref>). Based on those observations, it is possible that Gal promotes chases by reducing the activity of these brain regions to block the acquisition of conditioned defeat via the inhibitory receptor Galr1, which robustly suppresses the cAMP pathway. The direct functional connection between pPMp Gal neurons and these brain regions may explain the difference in Gal function between medaka and mice.</p><p>What, then, is the significance of the exclusive behavioral role of Gal in male–male chases? Studies in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) have shown that chases are unique among aggressive acts in being initiated specifically by dominant males toward their subordinates after dominance relationships are established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliveira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zabegalov et al., 2019</xref>). In view of this, Gal may help to establish and maintain a dominance hierarchy among males by inducing chases. Here, however, we observed that male medaka perform chases immediately after the first encounter (and thus before dominance relationships are established) and mutually rather than unilaterally; therefore, this possibility seems unlikely. An alternative hypothesis is that Gal may facilitate territoriality rather than aggression per se. Chases are commonly exhibited by many different species to evict intruders from the territory. The stimulatory effect of Gal on chases without affecting other aggressive acts may be the result of an increased sense of territoriality rather than enhanced aggression to achieve dominance. This latter view is supported by the observation in African cichlids, sunfish (<italic>Lepomis macrochirus</italic>), and midshipman fish that males of the territorial morph exhibit higher levels of brain <italic>gal</italic> expression as compared with non-territorial males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Renn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Partridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tripp et al., 2018</xref>). Territoriality and associated chases are costly, requiring significant time and energy and increasing the risk of injury or death, but at the same time facilitate a monopolization of limited resources, including food and potential mates. This potential benefit may have led to strong preservation of the relevant male-biased Gal neurons in teleost evolution.</p><p>The current findings are also of interest in terms of the sexual lability of the brain in teleost fish. In teleosts, including medaka, experimental manipulations that alter the sex steroid milieu can lead to the reversal of sex-typical mating behaviors even in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Okubo et al., 2019</xref>). That observation has been further extended by the present finding that treating adult female medaka with androgen readily induced male-typical aggressive behaviors. Hence, brain and behavior of teleosts are highly sexually labile throughout their lifetime. Because of its behavioral role and reversible sexual dimorphism in response to sex steroids, the pPMp population of Gal neurons may be a critical element of the long-sought neural mechanism underlying the labile nature of teleost brain and behavior.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that a subset of GAL neurons within the MPOA, the most highly conserved node of the social behavior network, serve very different, even opposite, behavioral roles across species, probably due to their varying functional connections with the rest of the brain. Our findings provide a striking example of how chemically conserved neural substrates give rise to variation in social behaviors across species. Presumably, the species variation in neuronal functioning has arisen under different evolutionary selective pressures in distinct species. Because males and females of the same species also often experience different evolutionary pressures and consequently display distinct behavioral patterns, sex differences can also occur in behaviorally relevant neurons. Our findings indicate that this has indeed happened to MPOA Gal neurons in teleosts. Further comparative studies across a range of species and between sexes should help to elucidate the origin and adaptive evolution of neural mechanisms underlying social behaviors and provide novel insights into how specific social behaviors are encoded in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

In brief, whole brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and embedded in paraffin. Serial coronal sections of 10 μm thickness were cut and hybridized with the DIG-labeled <italic>galr1</italic> or <italic>galr2</italic> probe or the same DIG-labeled <italic>gal</italic> probe used for Northern blot analysis. Hybridization signals were visualized by using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) substrate (Roche Diagnostics). Color development was allowed to proceed for more than 5 hr, or was stopped after 15 min (for quantification of <italic>gal</italic> expression in males that were castrated and treated with sex steroids) or 1 hr (for quantification of <italic>gal</italic> expression in females that were ovariectomized and treated with sex steroids) to avoid saturation. All sections in each comparison were processed simultaneously under the same conditions. For <italic>galr1</italic>, for which hybridization signals were detected throughout the brain and thus the specificity of the staining was somewhat uncertain, in situ hybridization was also performed using a sense probe under conditions identical to those used for the antisense probe. No signal was obtained by the sense probe, confirming that the signals obtained by the antisense probe represented specific staining.</p><p>To obtain quantitative data, the number of <italic>gal</italic>-expressing neurons in each brain nucleus was counted manually. In some brain regions, <italic>gal</italic> neurons were continuously distributed across two or more nuclei such that it was difficult to count the number of the neurons separately in each nucleus. In this case, the total number of the neurons in the nuclei was counted. Only intensively labeled neurons with a clearly defined cell body were counted to reduce, if not eliminate, the likelihood of double counting of the neurons split between sections. Although the resulting counts may still slightly overestimate the actual number of the neurons, the same counting procedure was used throughout, so that the results are comparable. Medaka display a sex difference in mean adult body size, with females being larger than males. The mean weight of the adult female brains was also found to be significantly greater than that of the adult male brains (data not shown). However, since the difference was only 1.12-fold and much smaller than the individual variation, the sex difference in brain size was not controlled for in examining the number of the neurons.

Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescent images were acquired by using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP8; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The following excitation and emission wavelengths were used for detection: DAPI, 405 nm and 410–480 nm, respectively; fluorescein, 488 nm and 495–545 nm, respectively; and Fast Red, 552 nm and 620–700 nm, respectively.</p><p>Generation of knockout medaka <italic>gal</italic> knockout medaka were generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. A CRISPR RNA (crRNA) was designed to target the second exon, which encodes the signal peptide of the Gal precursor protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The crRNA and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) were chemically synthesized by Fasmac (Kanagawa, Japan). Cas9 mRNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription of the linearized pCS2+hSpCas9 plasmid (Addgene plasmid number 51815; Addgene, Cambridge, MA) using the mMessage mMachine SP6 Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The crRNA, tracrRNA, and Cas9 mRNA were co-microinjected into the cytoplasm of embryos at the one-cell stage. Potential founders were screened by outcrossing to wild-type fish and testing progeny for mutations at the target site using a mismatch-sensitive T7 endonuclease I assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2009</xref>) followed by direct sequencing. Two founders were identified that yielded a high proportion of progeny carrying deletions that caused frameshifts leading to premature truncation of the Gal precursor protein: the progeny of one founder carried a 2 bp deletion (Δ2) and progeny of the other carried a 10 bp deletion (Δ10). These progeny were intercrossed to establish knockout lines (Δ2 and Δ10 lines). Each line was maintained by breeding heterozygous males and females to obtain wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous siblings for use in behavioral tests.

The sequence begins with the male approaching and following the female closely. The male then performs a courtship display, in which he swims quickly in a circular pattern in front of the female. If she is receptive, the male grasps her with his fins (termed ‘wrapping’), and they quiver together (‘quivering’) until eggs and sperm are released (‘spawning’). If the female is not receptive, she either rapidly moves away from the male or assumes a rejection posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walter and Hamilton, 1970</xref>).</p><p>The mating behavior test was performed essentially as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiraki-Kajiyama et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, on the day before behavioral testing, each focal male and female (from Δ2 and Δ10 knockout lines) was placed with a stimulus fish of the opposite sex (wild-type d-rR strain) in a 2-l rectangular tank, separated by a perforated transparent partition. The partition was removed 1 hr after onset of the light period of the following day, and fish were allowed to interact for 10 min. All interactions were recorded with a digital video camera (iVIS HF S11, Canon, Tokyo, Japan, or HC-W870M, Panasonic, Osaka, Japan).</p><p>In each test, wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous siblings reared under the same conditions were used as the comparison group to control for genetic and environmental factors. The percentage of females that spawned within the test period was calculated for each genotype. The following behavioral parameters were also calculated from the video recordings: latency to the first following by the male, the first wrapping, and the wrapping that resulted in spawning; number of courtship displays prior to spawning and wrapping attempts refused by the female; and duration of quivering. Females that did not spawn were not included in the analysis of these parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Aggressive behavior test</title><p>The aggressive behavior of teleosts, including medaka, involves the following five types of behavioral act that can be reliably identified: (1) ‘chase’, whereby the fish swims rapidly toward the opponent, causing the latter to flee; (2) ‘fin display’, whereby two fish present their lateral sides toward each other while spreading their fins; (3) ‘circle’, whereby two fish orient head-to-tail and rapidly circle each other with their fins spread; (4) ‘strike’, whereby the fish strikes the opponent with its caudal fin; and (5) ‘bite’, whereby the fish snaps at the opponent with its teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oliveira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagawa, 2013</xref>).</p><p>All behavioral procedures were conducted in 2-l rectangular tanks contained within a large recirculating water system with a constant influx of dechlorinated tap water. Fish of each sex and genotype were randomly distributed into four tanks a week before behavioral testing. Four fish of the same sex and genotype (which were all taken from different tanks and thus did not encounter one another for a week), with each separated from the others by opaque partitions, and allowed to acclimatize to the tank for 10 min. The partitions were then removed, and the fish were allowed to interact for 20 min while their behavior was recorded as described above. All recordings were taken 1–2.5 hr after onset of the light period.</p><p>In each test, wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous siblings reared under the same conditions were used as the comparison group. The total number of each aggressive act (chase, fin display, circle, strike, and bite) performed by the four fish in the tank was counted manually from the video recordings. In addition, the total number of chases by the four fish in the tank was calculated for each 5 min interval during the test period. The number of chases initiated and received by each individual fish was also calculated. Analysis of the video recordings at reduced speeds allowed us to track individual fish and quantify their behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Double labeling with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization</title><p>A rabbit anti-GAL antibody that recognizes teleost Gal with high specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodríguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2009</xref>) was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2051473">AB_2051473</ext-link>).
