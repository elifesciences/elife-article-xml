elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). However, the molecular mechanisms governing the transitions between these forms are unknown. Here, we present evidence that cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a key factor in triggering the transition from RB to EB (i.e., secondary differentiation) in the chlamydial developmental cycle. By overexpressing or knocking down expression of c-di-AMP synthase genes, we made strains producing different levels of c-di-AMP, which we linked to changes in secondary differentiation status. Increases in c-di-AMP resulted in an earlier increase in transcription of EB-associated genes, and this was further manifested in earlier production of EBs. In contrast, when c-di-AMP levels were decreased, developmental cycle progression was delayed. Based on these data, we conclude there is a threshold level of c-di-AMP needed to trigger secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. This study identifies a mechanism by which secondary differentiation is initiated in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and reveals a critical role for the second messenger signaling molecule c-di-AMP in this process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Chlamydia</italic></kwd><kwd>cyclic di-AMP</kwd><kwd>c-di-AMP</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM124798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouellette</surname><given-names>Scot P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21AI180574</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouellette</surname><given-names>Scot P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>For the first time, a function for the second messenger molecule, cyclic di-AMP, in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> has been described, revealing its role in regulating chlamydial developmental cycle progression.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> species are major pathogens of humans and animals. These obligate intracellular bacteria share one key feature: their unique developmental cycle (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelrahman and Belland, 2005</xref>). During this cycle, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> transitions between two different functional and morphological forms: the elementary body (EB), an infectious but non-dividing cell, and the reticulate body (RB), a dividing but non-infectious cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A third form, the intermediate body (IB) is a transitional form from the RB to EB. Besides these characteristics, EBs and RBs differ in other ways. For example, EBs are small (~0.3 μm), have a highly disulfide-crosslinked outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Everett and Hatch, 1991</xref>), and have DNA condensed by histone-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hackstadt et al., 1991</xref>). In contrast, RBs are larger (~1 μm), have a Gram-negative cell envelope that lacks peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moulder, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fox et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbour et al., 1982</xref>), and have a dispersed chromosome. RBs divide by an asymmetric polarized division mechanism dependent on MreB-directed peptidoglycan synthesis specifically at the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdelrahman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liechti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ouellette et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Not surprisingly, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> expresses genes in a temporally defined manner that corresponds broadly with its developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ouellette et al., 2006</xref>). ‘Early’ genes (e.g., <italic>euo</italic>) are expressed immediately upon entry into a target host cell and are likely involved in establishing the intracellular niche of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, the inclusion, and mediating primary differentiation from EB to RB. ‘Mid’ cycle genes (e.g., <italic>mreB, clpPX</italic>) facilitate RB replication and division and inclusion growth. ‘Late’ genes (e.g. <italic>hctA</italic>, <italic>omcB</italic>) are expressed when secondary differentiation is initiated to trigger EB formation. Although developmental gene expression has been characterized for decades, the signals or events that initiate differentiation from one form to the other are not known.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cyclic di-AMP accumulation is linked to secondary differentiation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Defining characteristics of chlamydial elementary bodies (EBs) and reticulate bodies (RBs).

Barker et al. studied how IFNβ production is activated in cells infected with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. The authors identified a role for the innate immune response protein, STING, which recognizes c-di-AMP. <italic>Chlamydia</italic> encodes a diadenylate cyclase enzyme, DacA, associated with c-di-AMP production, that had not been characterized. As part of their study, the authors determined that c-di-AMP accumulates over the course of the chlamydial developmental cycle, that EBs have high levels of this molecule whereas RBs have low levels, and that DacA is a diadenylate cyclase. It is unlikely that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> produces c-di-AMP only to signal host immune responses. Rather, the parsimonious interpretation is that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> uses this signaling molecule to regulate some aspect of its physiology and that activation of host signaling is ‘accidental’ – similar to activation of NOD2 by chlamydial peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Girardin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Packiam et al., 2015</xref>). However, no direct function of c-di-AMP in chlamydial biology has been defined.</p><p>Diverse functions of c-di-AMP have been reported in Gram-positive bacteria. For example, c-di-AMP is implicated in the response to changes in osmotic pressure. When the extracellular solute level is high, bacteria prevent dehydration by importing both extracellular solute molecules and cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Booth and Higgins, 1990</xref>). In these mechanisms, c-di-AMP binds to proteins associated with K<sup>+</sup> uptake systems such as Ktr/Trk, KimA, Kup, and Kdp and inhibits their activities in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gibhardt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quintana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moscoso et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, K<sup>+</sup> export mechanisms are also regulated by c-di-AMP. In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the cation/proton antiporter A (CpaA) is activated by binding c-di-AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corrigan et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, c-di-AMP binds to the riboswitch upstream of the genes encoding the K<sup>+</sup> transporters and controls their transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). With these mechanisms, osmotic stress is controlled by c-di-AMP. Of note, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks annotated orthologs of K<sup>+</sup> transporters. In addition to osmotic homeostasis, c-di-AMP has been reported to affect DNA replication and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bejerano-Sagie et al., 2006</xref>). When DNA damage is detected, DisA, a diadenylate cyclase, forms a DNA repair complex with RecA and RadA, resulting in inhibition of diadenylate cyclase activity in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Subsequently, c-di-AMP levels decrease, and DNA replication and sporulation are arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bejerano-Sagie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oppenheimer-Shaanan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang and He, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gándara et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Given the differences in c-di-AMP levels between EBs and RBs and its function as a diffusible second messenger signaling molecule, we hypothesized that the accumulation of c-di-AMP during the developmental cycle might be a trigger for secondary differentiation in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Once a threshold concentration of c-di-AMP has been reached in a given RB, it will begin the differentiation process to an EB. Importantly, we do not propose that c-di-AMP is necessarily required for RB replication or growth. We predicted that, if our hypothesis were correct, then we should be able to alter the levels of c-di-AMP in the organism and affect its differentiation kinetics accordingly. For example, if we increase c-di-AMP production, then we anticipate prematurely triggering RB-to-EB conversion with a concomitant reduction in overall growth and replication (since only RBs divide). Conversely, if we prevent c-di-AMP production, then we anticipate delaying EB production without impacting growth rate (i.e., normal replication with reduced RB-to-EB conversion).</p><p>There are three principal mechanisms to regulate c-di-AMP levels: through synthesis by diadenylate cyclase, through degradation by a phosphodiesterase (PDE), and through secretion by a transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corrigan and Gründling, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> only encodes the synthesis mechanism as it possesses the genes for diadenylate cyclase (<italic>dacA</italic>) and its regulator (<italic>ybbR</italic>) within a bicistronic operon, but no annotated PDEs or c-di-AMP transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stephens et al., 1998</xref>). Both DacA and YbbR are predicted to contain transmembrane domains (3 for DacA and 1 for YbbR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2013</xref>). To test our hypothesis, we genetically manipulated the levels of DacA and/or YbbR using recently developed strategies in the field. In the present study, we characterized the growth and developmental cycle state of chlamydial strains producing high or low levels of c-di-AMP. Our data show that higher levels of c-di-AMP are directly linked to increased transcript levels of late genes associated with secondary differentiation as well as the concomitant production of EBs at an earlier stage in the developmental cycle. In contrast, in cells with reduced c-di-AMP levels, chlamydial growth was impaired, and the developmental cycle was significantly delayed. Based on these data, we conclude that there is a threshold level of c-di-AMP necessary to trigger secondary differentiation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>. This is the first study to identify a physiological function for c-di-AMP in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> as well as a signaling mechanism by which secondary differentiation is initiated in these unique bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cyclic di-AMP levels increase at later stages of the developmental cycle and in bacteria that overexpress both DacA and YbbR</title><p>To verify that EBs have higher levels of c-di-AMP compared to RBs, we infected HeLa cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 with a transformant of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 carrying a shuttle plasmid with inducible mCherry. This strain serves as a control for subsequent overexpression experiments, and we induced mCherry expression with 5 nM aTc at 10 hr post-infection (hpi). We collected uninfected and infected HeLa cell lysates at 16 and 24 hpi and measured c-di-AMP levels by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, only basal amounts (&lt;100 pg/mL) of c-di-AMP were detected in uninfected HeLa cells at either timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In infected cells, the 16 hpi timepoint is characterized by predominantly an RB population whereas the 24 hpi timepoint is characterized by ongoing secondary differentiation and a mixture of RBs, IBs, and EBs. We observed that c-di-AMP levels were significantly higher at 24 hpi (~1700 pg/mL) compared to 16 hpi (~250 pg/mL) and increased approximately sevenfold over this timeframe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results are in agreement with the Barker et al. study indicating higher levels of c-di-AMP in EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barker et al., 2013</xref>). From these data, we infer that the concentration of c-di-AMP in our culture conditions necessary to trigger conversion of RBs to EBs is at most 1700 pg/mL.</p><p>To test the link between c-di-AMP levels and chlamydial developmental cycle progression, we made a collection of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> strains carrying anhydrotetracycline (aTc)-inducible constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These included strains to overexpress a wild-type or a catalytically dead (D164N) DacA isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Girardin et al., 2003</xref>), wild-type or mutant isoforms of DacA lacking transmembrane domains (ΔTM), YbbR_6xH, or both wild-type or mutant DacA and YbbR_6xH (<italic>dacA</italic>op or <italic>dacA</italic>opMut). For all of these overexpression strains, we emphasize that the chromosomal expression of wild-type <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> is maintained. In addition to the overexpression constructs, we also made a conditional knockdown construct for <italic>dacA</italic> (<italic>dacA</italic>-KD), targeting its promoter region, to decrease the expression of <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic> using a dCas12/crRNA-based CRISPRi system that our group developed for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ouellette et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, we made a complementation construct for <italic>dacA</italic>-KD by introducing <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic>_6xH (<italic>dacA</italic>-KDcom) 3’ to dCas12 such that induction of dCas12 results in the coexpression of DacA and YbbR_6xH during knockdown of endogenous <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic> transcripts.</p><p>To assess whether we could alter c-di-AMP levels in our various strains, we first measured c-di-AMP levels from infected cell lysates at 16 and 24 hpi after inducing overexpression or knockdown of the target genes at 10 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Overexpressing DacA resulted in ~ fourfold increase in c-di-AMP levels as compared to the mCherry-expressing strain at 16 hpi (~1,000 pg/mL) and ~ threefold increase at 24 hpi (~5000 pg/mL). Of note, the level of c-di-AMP in the DacA overexpressing condition at 16 hpi was below the 24 hpi level for EBs (EB threshold line in graphs: ~1700 pg/mL). Overexpressing YbbR_6xH did not impact c-di-AMP production. When overexpressing the catalytically inactive mutant of DacA(D164N), c-di-AMP levels were ~ twofold lower at 16 hpi (~115 pg/mL) and, at 24 hpi (~320 pg/mL), was similar to the 16 hpi mCherry control, indicating a severe reduction in c-di-AMP accumulation. Overexpressing ΔTMDacA phenocopied the effect of overexpressing full-length DacA on c-di-AMP production. Interestingly, the negative effects of overexpressing full-length DacA(D164N) associated with reduced c-di-AMP levels were lost when expressing ΔTMDacA(D164N), which phenocopied the mCherry-expressing control.</p><p>When DacA and YbbR_6xH were co-overexpressed, c-di-AMP levels increased by approximately 30-fold at 16 hpi (~8000 pg/mL) and 120-fold at 24 hpi (~340,000 pg/mL) compared to that of the mCherry-expressing control strain. Of note, the levels of c-di-AMP at 16 hpi in the <italic>dacA</italic>op strain (~8000 pg/mL) were higher even than the control strain at 24 hpi (~1700 pg/mL; EB threshold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To confirm whether DacA enzyme activity is critical for the high levels of c-di-AMP in the <italic>dacA</italic>op strain, we co-overexpressed DacA(D164N) and YbbR_6xH (<italic>dacA</italic>opMut). Here, c-di-AMP levels were reduced compared to the control at 16 (~100 pg/mL) and 24 hpi (~400 pg/mL), suggesting that c-di-AMP synthase activity was blocked in this strain similar to overexpressing the DacA(D164N) alone.</p><p>For the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain, the c-di-AMP level was unchanged at 16 hpi and reduced a statistically significant ~ fivefold at 24 hpi (~500 pg/mL; roughly twice the level of the 16 hr mCherry-expressing control but below the EB threshold). The loss of c-di-AMP production in this strain was restored in the complemented <italic>dacA</italic>-KDcom strain, which showed a phenotype similar to the <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression strain with c-di-AMP levels above the EB threshold at both timepoints assessed (~3700 pg/mL at 16 hpi;~10,000 pg/mL at 24 hpi). Based on these data, we conclude that both DacA and YbbR are necessary for optimal c-di-AMP synthesis in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Importantly, our collection of strains that are high or low producers of c-di-AMP give us an opportunity to test our overarching hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Overexpression of membrane-localized DacA isoforms, but not YbbR, disrupts chlamydial growth and development</title><p>To begin exploring the impact of altering <italic>dacA</italic> and/or <italic>ybbR</italic> expression on chlamydial growth, we performed a series of experiments to assess their protein localization in chlamydiae.

To quantify IFUs, a lysate from a primary infection is prepared and used to infect a fresh monolayer of cells. Any inclusions in the secondary infection are derived from viable EBs present in the primary infection. The vector control strain showed no differences in IFUs when overexpressing mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). At 24 hpi, both IFUs and genome copy numbers were significantly decreased in the DacA overexpression strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). We obtained similar results when overexpressing wild-type DacA with a 6xHis tag in wild-type or STING KO cells, indicating that a C-terminal tag does not impact these phenotypes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). We also performed the same experiments with the inactive isoform of DacA, DacA(D164N). Like overexpression of the wild-type DacA, overexpression of DacA(D164N) also negatively affected IFU production and resulted in reduced genome copy numbers even though c-di-AMP levels were reduced under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). YbbR_6xH overexpression did result in a statistically significant, ~ twofold decrease in IFU production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This reflects one division cycle difference from the uninduced control and, in the absence of any other phenotypic discrepancy, is not considered biologically relevant. No differences were noted in genome copy number when overexpressing YbbR_6xH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate impacts of overexpression of these proteins on developmental cycle progression, we quantified transcripts by RT-qPCR for a canonical early-cycle gene, <italic>euo</italic>, and two late-cycle genes, <italic>hctA</italic> (an ‘early’ late gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiarelli et al., 2020</xref>) and <italic>omcB</italic> (a canonical late gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belland et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with the genome copy numbers and IFU data, overexpression of DacA resulted in elevated <italic>euo</italic> transcripts and a reduction in the amounts of the late gene transcripts at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Similar effects on these transcripts were noted when overexpressing DacA(D164N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Therefore, we evaluated the effects of overexpression of wild-type or mutant DacA lacking its transmembrane domains (ΔTM). As noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, overexpression of wild-type ΔTM DacA yielded the same level of c-di-AMP as overexpression of the full-length wild-type DacA. In contrast, c-di-AMP levels measured from chlamydiae overexpressing the mutant ΔTM DacA(D164N) were the same as the mCherry-expressing strain but reduced in chlamydiae overexpressing the full-length DacA(D164N). By IFA, both ΔTM isoforms localized to the cytosol, and there were no observable differences in inclusion or bacterial morphology as compared to the uninduced control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We did not quantify effects of overexpression on inclusion or bacterial size since the measured phenotypes indicated no differences from the uninduced control.

Although genome copy numbers were the same, IFUs decreased by approximately 80% compared to that of the uninduced sample at 24 hpi in the knockdown strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), suggesting more RBs are present in the sample. IFUs and genome copies showed an approximate twofold reduction at 24 hpi in the complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). The data for the knockdown strain suggest that low levels of c-di-AMP are detrimental for secondary differentiation. As genome copies alone cannot assess the ratio of RBs to EBs, we performed RT-qPCR to quantify transcripts of relevant gene targets. When dCas12 was induced, both <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> transcript levels decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Since <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> are transcribed in an operon, this result is not surprising. Consistent with reduced EB yields, transcripts of the late genes <italic>omcB</italic> and <italic>hctA</italic> were decreased at 24 hpi. In contrast, transcripts of the early gene <italic>euo</italic> were slightly elevated at 24 hpi. We have previously observed no effects on genome levels or transcription of these genes when overexpressing the dCas12 gene alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ouellette et al., 2021</xref>), indicating these effects are specific to <italic>dacA</italic>-KD and that <italic>dacA</italic> knockdown reduces or delays expression of late gene transcripts. For the complemented strain, both <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> transcripts were increased compared to the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), and transcript levels for these genes were increased beyond the ‘wild-type’ uninduced control levels, again suggesting the ‘complemented’ strain did not return to a wild-type phenotype. Nonetheless, transcripts for the early gene <italic>euo</italic> were indistinguishable to levels measured in the uninduced strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>hctA</italic> transcripts were increased ~10 fold at 14 hpi compared to that of the uninduced sample, and <italic>omcB</italic> transcripts were slightly, but not significantly, increased at 14 and 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These data suggest that overexpressing DacA and YbbR_6xH, with associated increases in c-di-AMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), may alter the timing of secondary differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>High levels of c-di-AMP induce late gene expression</title><p>To clarify the effect of DacA and YbbR_6xH overexpression on secondary differentiation, we next evaluated the phenotype of the <italic>dacA</italic>op strain in contrast with the <italic>dacA</italic>opMut strain, in which the active site residue of DacA has been mutated. When we induced expression of the wild-type constructs, we confirmed the induction of DacA and YbbR_6xH and their colocalization at the membrane <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.713±0.109 from 20 inclusions measured by JACoP Plugin of ImageJ; values near 1 indicate colocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunn et al., 2011</xref>). This is not surprising as both proteins are critical for c-di-AMP synthesis based on our c-di-AMP measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Organism and inclusion morphology were similar to the <italic>dacA</italic>-KDcom complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Not surprisingly, <italic>dacA</italic> and <italic>ybbR</italic> transcripts were elevated at the timepoints assessed under inducing conditions for both the <italic>dacA</italic>op and <italic>dacA</italic>opMut strains. Transcripts for <italic>euo</italic> were not statistically changed but trended higher at the 24 hpi timepoint, whereas <italic>omcB</italic> transcripts were slightly, but not significantly, increased at 14 and 24 hpi during <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression. Once again, we observed that <italic>hctA</italic> transcripts were increased over 10-fold at 14 hpi in the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), similar to what we measured for the complemented knockdown strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These data reinforce that elevated c-di-AMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) in these strains lead to increased expression of the late gene <italic>hctA</italic> at an earlier timepoint (14 hpi) in the developmental cycle.

In assessing developmentally regulated transcripts for the <italic>dacA</italic>opMut strain, <italic>euo</italic> levels were maintained, albeit not significantly so, at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

The transcriptional results of the developmentally regulated genes in the <italic>dacA</italic>opMut strain were very similar to the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting that blocking c-di-AMP accumulation interferes with developmental cycle progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Elevated c-di-AMP levels result in increased transcript levels of genes necessary for secondary differentiation</title><p>Given the surprising finding that, in strains overproducing c-di-AMP, <italic>hctA</italic> transcripts were 10-fold higher at a timepoint not associated with secondary differentiation, we asked the question whether <italic>all</italic> genes related to secondary differentiation were increased after inducing production of c-di-AMP. Conversely, we wanted to explore whether reducing c-di-AMP levels would delay expression of genes related to secondary differentiation. Thus, to further investigate how c-di-AMP affects transcription of such genes, we performed RNA sequencing on both the <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression and <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strains and compared the transcriptome between uninduced and induced samples within the given strain at the given timepoint. HeLa cells were infected with these transformants, and overexpression or knockdown was induced or not at 10 hpi with 5 nM aTc. For the <italic>dacA</italic>op strain, RNA was collected at 16 hpi, a time at which late genes are beginning to be expressed (as opposed to 14 hpi) but remain near a basal level of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belland et al., 2003</xref>). The rationale for this was to determine whether high c-di-AMP levels result in increased late gene transcripts at this timepoint <italic>above and beyond</italic> the levels of the control, uninduced condition. For the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain, RNA was collected at 24 hpi, a time at which late genes are peaking in their expression. The rationale for this was to determine whether late gene transcription was decreased, which could not otherwise be reliably assessed at the 16 hpi timepoint.</p><p>RNA sequencing results were statistically analyzed by the UNMC Bioinformatics Core (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) . <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows a volcano plot of the results for the <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression and <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strains. Of note, many late genes were evident in the upregulated quadrant for the <italic>dacAop</italic> strain whereas these genes were present in the downregulated quadrant for the <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strain. We further characterized the upregulated or downregulated gene sets for the <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression and <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strains, respectively, based on significant difference (p&lt;0.05) and fold-change (&gt;1.5). A summary of these results is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> (all data are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We grouped the differentially expressed genes into five categories: (1) canonical late genes for which the literature has associated them with EB function, (2) outer membrane-associated, (3) gene regulation-associated, (4) glycogen synthesis-associated, and (5) type III secretion system associated. Recent work from our group and the Hefty group to define the regulons of the alternative sigma factors in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> demonstrated that these sigma factors regulate some late gene expression associated with outer membrane remodeling, type III secretion, and other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatch and Ouellette, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Soules et al., 2020b</xref>). Consistent with our RT-qPCR data, we observed that all canonical late genes, as well as all the other genes listed in these categories, showed an increase in expression after c-di-AMP production was induced. In contrast, all the genes, and particularly the canonical late genes, showed a decrease in expression under conditions where c-di-AMP production was impaired. Overall, these RNA sequencing data confirm the direct influence of c-di-AMP on expression of genes related to secondary differentiation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The levels of c-di-AMP are correlated with late gene transcripts.</title><p>RNA sequencing was performed from HeLa cells infected with either the <italic>dacA</italic>op or <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strains.

However, if EB production is initiated at an earlier time in the developmental cycle when there are fewer non-infectious RBs to convert, then overall EB production should be decreased with a concomitant decrease in genome copies since only the RB replicates DNA. Conversely, delayed expression of late genes should be associated with a delay in EB production. Therefore, to test these predictions, we quantified EB production at 2 hr intervals from 18 to 24 hpi to assess EB production during earlier phases of the developmental cycle, as well as at 32 and 48 hpi to assess overall EB yields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We did not detect any EBs at 16 hpi or earlier (not shown). Cells were infected with the <italic>dacA</italic>op, <italic>dacA</italic>opMut, and <italic>dacA</italic>-KD strains and induced or not at 10 hpi with 5 nM aTc as previously noted. Consistent with the transcriptional data, we measured higher EB yields at 18 and 20 hpi during <italic>dacA</italic>op overexpression that quickly plateaued by 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Conversely, when c-di-AMP accumulation was blocked by reducing the expression of DacA and YbbR (<italic>dacA</italic>-KD), we observed delayed EB production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We also measured lower EB yields when c-di-AMP levels were decreased by overexpression of the DacA(D164N) isoform and YbbR (<italic>dacA</italic>opMut; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The uninduced control conditions for each strain showed a steady accumulation of EBs throughout the course of the experiment, as expected. The vector control strain expressing mCherry showed no differences as previously noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

However, the mechanisms governing this essential process are largely unknown. It is possible that both internal and external environmental changes might serve as signals to trigger the shift from the non-infectious RB to the infectious EB. It is also possible, and even likely, that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> integrates multiple signal inputs during the differentiation process. For example, we recently described two post-translational processes that impact secondary differentiation: the activity of the unfoldases ClpX and ClpC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jensen et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wood et al., 2022</xref>) and the redox status of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh and Ouellette, 2025</xref>). As secondary differentiation is asynchronous, any mechanism must account for the stochasticity within the population of RBs ‘considering’ differentiating to EBs. Here, we provide the first evidence of a signaling molecule that can directly activate EB-associated gene expression with a concomitant early production of EBs.</p><p>Several reports have proposed mechanisms by which <italic>Chlamydia</italic> triggers secondary differentiation. For example, Thompson et al. investigated the non-canonical regulation of the major sigma factor, σ<sup>66</sup>, by the Rsb phosphoregulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). The authors provided evidence that altering the levels of RsbW or RsbV1 impacted the expression of σ<sup>66</sup>-controlled genes. This led them to propose a model whereby sensing of ATP by the Rsb system controls the availability of σ<sup>66</sup>, implying that low levels of ATP lead to initiation of secondary differentiation. Further support from this came from work by Kuwabara et al. who showed effects of ATP, GTP, and glucose on the activity of different Rsb components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuwabara et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, work from Soules et al. identified TCA intermediates as ligands for RsbU, linking the TCA cycle and ATP synthesis to the Rsb system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soules et al., 2020a</xref>). However, no effect was noted on premature late gene expression in these experimental systems.</p><p>Sequestration/inactivation of the major sigma factor under low ATP conditions would presumably render RNA polymerase free to interact with the alternative sigma factors, σ<sup>54</sup> and σ<sup>28</sup>. These alternative sigma factors have been linked to late gene expression with studies from Soules et al. and Hatch and Ouellette indicating that σ<sup>54</sup> is associated with increased transcription of outer membrane components, type III secretion (T3S) system components, and other genes typically expressed late in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatch and Ouellette, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Soules et al., 2020b</xref>). However, some of these changes are likely indirect and downstream to the σ<sup>54</sup> regulon itself since some affected genes have been shown to have σ<sup>66</sup> promoter sequence elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ouellette et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hefty and Stephens, 2007</xref>). Significant remodeling of the outer membrane occurs as the RB transitions to the EB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tamura et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tamura and Manire, 1967</xref>), and, similarly, the EB is prepackaged with T3S effectors, like TarP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clifton et al., 2004</xref>), that facilitate EB invasion into a target host cell. σ<sup>28</sup> was shown to control expression of two canonical late genes: <italic>hctB</italic> and <italic>tsp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatch and Ouellette, 2023</xref>). Each of the encoded proteins is highly toxic if overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Swoboda et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grieshaber et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that the additional layer of regulation by σ<sup>28</sup> is necessary to ensure EBs are formed at the correct time. Hatch and Ouellette proposed that these genes may be the last to be activated precisely because of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatch and Ouellette, 2023</xref>). Overall, these data clearly link transcriptional regulation, via the sigma factors, to developmental cycle progression and secondary differentiation.</p><p>Despite the clear changes in transcription that occur during the chlamydial developmental cycle, activation of late gene expression alone does not guarantee secondary differentiation. We recently explored the function of the Clp protease systems in chlamydial growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wood et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the inability to degrade SsrA-tagged products prevented functional secondary differentiation with a severe defect in EB production. This was demonstrated in strains unable to degrade SsrA products either by preventing their recognition by ClpX or by altering the SsrA tag to a version that is not degraded efficiently. Nonetheless, late gene transcription was activated in these strains. Therefore, post-translational regulation of secondary differentiation is also critical to the process.</p><p>Assuming a post-translational gene regulation model for secondary differentiation, we were interested in exploring known differences between EBs and RBs as a clue to what factors could be serving as a signal for this process. EBs and RBs differ in a number of characteristics, from their function to their morphology to their gene expression. In 2013, a study from Barker et al. added another difference – their relative levels of c-di-AMP with RBs having lower levels than EBs. Although the study from Barker et al. was focused on understanding how IFNβ is activated in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells, we were intrigued by this relative difference in c-di-AMP levels. We hypothesized that c-di-AMP production might be a signal for secondary differentiation. We compared chlamydial growth in normal HeLa or STING-KO HeLa cells but could not detect any differences in growth in these cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>), indicating that c-di-AMP production by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is unlikely used as means of activating the host cell. Rather, STING activation is an ‘accidental’ outcome during chlamydial developmental cycle progression. Using recently developed genetic tools for <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, we demonstrated that we could manipulate the levels of c-di-AMP in the bacterium to either block or stimulate its production. Excitingly, we observed that elevated c-di-AMP was linked to earlier secondary differentiation whereas blocking c-di-AMP production prevented EB production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Importantly, c-di-AMP production resulted in an increase in late gene transcripts, as noted above for the function of the alternative sigma factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, c-di-AMP may act as a post-translational mechanism to trigger secondary differentiation. We can also directly conclude from our experiments that the threshold level of c-di-AMP necessary to trigger secondary differentiation in our culture conditions is greater than 1000 pg/mL and less than 2000 pg/mL. We base this on the fact that the 16 hpi level of c-di-AMP in the DacA-overexpressing strain (1000 pg/mL) did not trigger secondary differentiation whereas, during a normal infection (e.g., mCherry-expressing strain) when EBs are being produced at 24 hpi, the c-di-AMP level is ~2000 pg/mL. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify and provide experimental evidence for a signaling factor involved in differentiation of an obligate intracellular bacterium.</p><p>How might c-di-AMP function in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>? This is not readily apparent because <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks orthologs of proteins that have been characterized in other bacterial systems to bind c-di-AMP. For example, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> lacks annotated K<sup>+</sup> transporters, and it is unknown how these bacteria maintain their osmolarity. However, a recent study suggested that changes in K<sup>+</sup> levels affect the chlamydial developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrew et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, c-di-AMP may function as a K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis coordinator in <italic>Chlamydia</italic> through as-yet unknown pathways. We did observe altered chlamydial morphology in some of our strains in which we altered c-di-AMP levels, and this may indicate changes in osmostability or effects on cell division. In regard to the latter possibility, in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, DacA activity is inhibited by interacting with GlmM (phosphoglucosamine mutase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tosi et al., 2019</xref>). GlmM produces UDP-GlcNAc that is a precursor in both peptidoglycan and LPS synthesis. Given that <italic>Chlamydia</italic> uses peptidoglycan for cell division, we tested whether DacA and YbbR were localized to the division septum. However, their localization was not associated with the division septum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we did not detect an interaction between DacA and GlmM using the Bacterial Adenylate Cyclase-based Two-Hybrid (BACTH) system (data not shown), and the chlamydial GlmM lacks the residues required for DacA interaction. Therefore, we conclude that DacA and YbbR are unlikely to directly impact cell division. However, based on the cell morphological changes in DacA overexpression, we cannot exclude a function for c-di-AMP on cell wall metabolism. Future studies will focus on identifying c-di-AMP binding proteins and characterizing their function in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. We also cannot exclude a function for c-di-AMP in directly manipulating gene expression by riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>), and further work is necessary to understand how c-di-AMP directly controls chlamydial development.</p><p>The use of c-di-AMP as a signal for secondary differentiation presents a ‘chicken-or-egg’ quandary. How is the activity and expression of DacA, the diadenylate cyclase, regulated? Our transcript analyses indicate that <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic> transcripts peak during the RB phase of growth, similar to most genes in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. One possibility not easily tested due to the obligate intracellular nature of <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is that c-di-AMP production depletes ATP levels, which then reduce σ<sup>66</sup> activity as described above. Our data indicate YbbR is necessary to activate DacA function since expressing membrane-localized or ΔTM isoforms of DacA alone only modestly increased c-di-AMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, overexpressing DacA alone did negatively impact chlamydial growth, suggesting that the balance between DacA and YbbR levels is important, with YbbR being the limiting factor for c-di-AMP production. For example, too much DacA insertion into the membrane without binding to YbbR may disrupt the membrane biology of the RB. This is supported by the fact that we observed no detrimental effects of overexpressing ΔTM isoforms of either wild-type or mutant (D164N) DacA. Indeed, overexpressing ΔTMDacA(D164N) did not alter c-di-AMP levels. Therefore, YbbR itself may be a target for regulation. As a monotopic transmembrane protein, YbbR may be degraded by proteases such as the inner membrane-associated FtsH or the periplasmic proteases HtrA or Tsp. This would presumably shut down c-di-AMP synthesis. Alternatively, DacA may interact with other membrane proteins, and overexpressing it alone may impair the function of this binding partner(s), resulting in the observed phenotypes. However, this possibility contradicts the effects of overexpressing the D164N isoform, which blocked c-di-AMP production. These experiments were conducted in the presence of the chromosomally expressed copy of DacA, and we suggest that the mutant isoform acts as a dominant negative by binding and/or interfering with the wild-type DacA or by titrating away YbbR from the wild-type DacA. This is also supported by the fact that overexpressing the ΔTMDacA(D164N) isoform had no impact on c-di-AMP levels or chlamydial growth. In contrast, knocking down <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic> transcripts will reduce, but not completely eliminate, DacA and YbbR proteins, which may result in residual c-di-AMP levels as compared to overexpressing the DacA mutant (either alone or with YbbR in <italic>dacA</italic>opMut) as well as the phenotypic differences between these strains. Further work is needed to test these possibilities. However, our data are clear in linking increased c-di-AMP levels to chlamydial developmental progression.</p><p>Even though diverse functions of c-di-AMP in other bacteria have been reported previously, this is the first time c-di-AMP has been described as a checkpoint in chlamydial development. It is possible that the levels of c-di-AMP act as a de facto means for monitoring the bacterial population within the inclusion or for their overall developmental status. Canonical bacteria can use quorum sensing to detect bacteria at the population level and to communicate with other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller and Bassler, 2001</xref>). However, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> lacks homologues of genes related to quorum sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stephens et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, secondary differentiation occurs asynchronously, and this feature is different from a quorum sensing mechanism. Our model accounts for the asynchronicity of secondary differentiation. As RBs accumulate c-di-AMP and divide, it is likely the c-di-AMP will be distributed unevenly between the mother and daughter cells since <italic>Chlamydia</italic> divides through an asymmetric budding mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdelrahman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This will lead to two cells with different levels of c-di-AMP, one of which may then accumulate enough c-di-AMP to trigger secondary differentiation while the other continues to divide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is consistent with a recent model proposing that a population of division-competent RBs is maintained throughout the developmental cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiarelli et al., 2023</xref>). Similar uneven distribution of post-translational factors between asymmetrically dividing mother and daughter cells would also impact other recently described signals for differentiation, including the levels of ClpC protein or overall redox via AhpC antioxidant levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jensen et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh and Ouellette, 2025</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A working model illustrating how c-di-AMP impacts the onset of secondary differentiation in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During reticulate body (RB) division, there is a gradient of c-di-AMP that forms between the mother and daughter cell. The lighter blue represents lower levels of c-di-AMP, the darker blue represents higher levels of c-di-AMP. In the depicted scenario, the daughter cell is able to divide again, having not reached a critical threshold of c-di-AMP. In contrast, the mother cell accumulates sufficient c-di-AMP to trigger secondary differentiation to an EB.

Shown is the ‘normal’ condition of wild-type bacteria, bacteria overexpressing DacA and YbbR (higher cyclic di-AMP), and bacteria expressing the CRISPRi system targeting the <italic>dacA</italic> promoter (lower cyclic di-AMP).

Southampton) was used for transformation. All cell cultures and chlamydial stocks were routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination using the Mycoplasma PCR detection kit and confirmed negative (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, #MP0035-1KT).

Target genes were amplified by PCR with Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB, #M0530L) using 10 ng <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 genomic DNA or appropriate vectors as a template. Some DNA segments were directly synthesized as a gBlock fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). If plasmids were used as a template, then we treated the PCR product with DpnI enzyme to remove templates. The PCR products were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, #28506). The HiFi Assembly reaction master mix (NEB, #E2621X) was used following the manufacturer’s manual in conjunction with plasmids pBOMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ouellette et al., 2021</xref>) linearized with EagI and KpnI or pBOMBL12CRia (empty vector) linearized with BamHI. The linearized plasmids were also dephosphorylated with FastAP (ThermoFisher, #EF0652). The products of the HiFi reaction were transformed into NEB10β competent cells (NEB) and plated on LB agar with appropriate antibiotics. Plasmids were subsequently isolated using a mini-prep kit (Qiagen, #27106) and verified by plasmid digest and sequencing from individual colonies grown overnight in LB broth with appropriate antibiotic selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Transformation of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic></title><p>McCoy cells were plated in a six-well plate the day before beginning the transformation procedure. <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 without plasmid (-pL2) resuspended with Tris-CaCl<sub>2</sub> buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 50 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) was incubated with 2 μg plasmid at room temperature for 30 min. During this step, McCoy cells were washed with 2 mL Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) media containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Corning, Corning, NY #21–023-CV). After that, McCoy cells were infected with the transformants in 2 mL HBSS per well. The plate was centrifuged at 400 × g for 15 min at room temperature and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The inoculum was aspirated, and 2 mL 1 X DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 μg/mL gentamicin was added per well. At 8 hr post- infection (hpi), 1 μg/mL cycloheximide and either 1 or 2 U/mL penicillin G or 500 μg/mL spectinomycin were added, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C until 48 hpi. At 48 hpi, the transformants were harvested and infected onto a new McCoy cell monolayer. These harvest and infection steps were repeated every 44–48 hpi until fluorescent, antibiotic-resistant inclusions were observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>(RT-)qPCR</title><p>HeLa cells were infected with chlamydial transformants at an MOI of 0.5. At 10 hpi, 5 nM anhydrotetracycline (aTc) was added or not to the culture medium. Total RNA and DNA were harvested at this time point from duplicate wells not treated with aTc. At 14 and 24 hpi, total RNA and DNA were collected using Trizol (Invitrogen, #15596018) and DNeasy Tissue (Qiagen, #69506) kit, respectively, as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatch and Ouellette, 2023</xref>). After DNase (Invitrogen, #69506) treatment of total RNA, cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, #18-080-085). After diluting the cDNA 10-fold, 5 μl of the diluted cDNA was used as a template for qPCR. Equal masses of genomic DNA were used from each of the samples to quantify chlamydial genomes, which were used to normalize transcript data as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ouellette et al., 2005</xref>). For both cDNA and gDNA samples, triplicate qPCR reactions were prepared using 2 X SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, #A25778) in a total volume of 25 μL per well. Standard cycling conditions were used with a melting curve analysis to verify products. Transcripts and genome copies were assessed from at least three biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)</title><p>HeLa cells were infected with chlamydial transformants as above.

After thawing the lysates, the samples were serially 1:10 diluted and used to infect HeLa cells seeded in 24-well plates. At 24 hpi, the number of GFP- expressing inclusions was counted from 30 fields of view to calculate the IFUs from the original sample. Three biological replicates were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cyclic di-AMP measurement</title><p>HeLa cells were infected with the indicated chlamydial transformants as above. At 10 hpi, expression of the constructs was induced or not with 5 nM aTc, and, at 16 and 24 hpi, samples were prepared for measuring the level of cyclic di-AMP. After aspirating the media, the infected cell monolayers were washed with 1 X PBS and resuspended with B-Per Bacterial Cell Lysis Buffer (Pierce, Appleton, WI, #PI90078). Samples were vortexed for 1 min and then centrifuged at 13,300×g for 15 min at 4℃. The levels of cyclic di-AMP from the supernatants of the cell lysates were quantified using the Cyclic di-AMP ELISA kit (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI, #501960-STRIP) following the manufacturer’s instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Underwood et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Preparation of RNA sequencing samples</title><p>Samples were prepared as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatch and Ouellette, 2023</xref>).

The main findings remain the same. The authors show that overexpression of the dacA-ybbR operon results in increased production of c-di-AMP and early expression of transitionary and late genes. The authors also knocked down the expression of the dacA-ybbR operon and reported a modest reduction in the expression of both hctA and omcB. The authors conclude with a model suggesting the amount of c-di-AMP determines the fate of the RB, continued replication, or EB conversion.</p><p>Overall, this is a very intriguing study with important implications however the data is very preliminary and the model is very rudimentary. The data support the observation that dramatically increased c-di-AMP has an impact on transitionary gene expression and late gene expression suggesting dysregulation of the developmental cycle. This effect goes away with modest changes in c-di-AMP (detaTM-DacA vs detaTM-DacA (D164N)). However, the model predicts that low levels of c-di-AMP delays EB production is not not well supported by the data. If this prediction were true then the growth rate would increase with c-di-AMP reduction and the data does not show this. The levels of of c-di-AMP at the lower levels need to be better validated as it seems like only very high levels make a difference for dysregulated late gene expression. However, on the low end it's not clear what levels are needed to have an effect as only DacAopMut and DacAopKD show any effects on the cycle and the c-di-AMP levels are only different at 24 hours.</p><p>The data still do not support the overall model.</p><p>In Figure 1 the authors show at 24 hpi.</p><p>DacA overexpression increases cdiAMP to ~4000 pg/ml</p><p>DacAmut overexpression reduces cdiAMP dramatically to ~256 pg/ml</p><p>DacATM overexpression increases cdiAMP to ~4000 pg/ml.</p><p>DacAmutTM overexpression does not seem to change cdiAMP ~1500 pg/ml .</p><p>dacAKD decreases cdiAMP to ~300 pg/ml .</p><p>dacAKDcom increased cdiAMP to ~8000 pg/ml.</p><p>DacA-ybbRop overexpression increased cdiAMP to ~500,000 pg/ml.</p><p>DacA-ybbRopmut ~300 pg/ml.</p><p>However in Figure 2 the data show that overexpression of DacA (cdiAMP ~4000 pg/ml) did not have a different phenotype than over expression of the mutant (cdiAMP ~256 pg/ml). HctA expression down, omcB expression down, euo not much change, replication down, and IFUs down. Additionally, Figure 3 shows no differences in anything measured although cdiAMP levels were again dramatically different. DacATM overexpression (~4000 pg/ml) and DacAmutTM (~1500). This makes it unclear what cdiAMP is doing to the developmental cycle.</p><p>In Figure 4 the authors knockdown dacA (dacA-KD) and complement the knockdown (dacA-KDcom) dacAKD decreases cdiAMP (~300) while DacA-KDcom increases cdiAMP much above wt (~8000).</p><p>KD decreased hctA and omcB at 24hpi. Complementation resulted in a moderate increase in hctA at a single time point but not at 24 hpi and had no effect on euo or omcB expression. Importantly, complementation decreased the growth rate. Based on the proposed model, growth rate should increase as the chlamydia should all be RBs and replicating and not exiting the cell cycle to become EBs (not replicating). Interestingly reducing cdiAMP levels by over expressing DacAmut (~256 pg/ml) did not have an effect on the cycle but the reduction in cdiAMP by knockdown of dacA (~300 pg/ml) did have a moderate effect on the cycle.</p><p>For Figure 5 DacA-ybbRop was overexpressed and this increased cdiAMP dramatically ~500,000 pg/ml as compared to wt ~1500. This increased hctA only at an early timepoint and not at 24hpi and again had no effect on omcB or euo. Overexpression of the operon with the mutation DacA-ybbRopmut reduced cdiAMP to ~300 pg/ml and this showed a reduction in growth rate similar to dacAmut but a more dramatic decrease in IFUs.</p><p>Overall:</p><p>DacA overexpression increases cdiAMP to ~4000 pg/ml (decreased everything except euo)</p><p>DacAmut overexpression reduces cdiAMP dramatically (~256 pg/ml). (decreased everything except euo)</p><p>DacATM overexpression increases cdiAMP to ~4000 pg/ml (no changes noted)</p><p>DacAmutTM overexpression does not seem to change cdiAMP ~1500 pg/ml (no changes noted)</p><p>dacAKD decrease cdiAMP to ~300 pg/ml (decreased everything except euo)</p><p>dacAKDcom increased cdiAMP to ~8000 pg/ml (decreases growth rate, increase hctA a little but not omcB)</p><p>DacA-ybbRop overexpression increased cdiAMP to ~500,000 pg/ml (decreases growth rate, increase hctA a little but not omcB)</p><p>DacA-ybbRopmut ~300 pg/ml (decreased everything except euo)</p><p>Overall, the data show that increasing cdiAMP only has a phenotype if it is dramatically increased, no effect at 4000 pg/ml. Decreasing cdiAMP has a consistent effect, decreased growth rate, IFU, hctA expression and omcB expression. However, if their proposed model was correct and low levels of cdiAMP blocked EB conversion then more chlamydial cells would be RBs (dividing cells) and the growth rate should increase. Conversely, if cdiAMP levels were dramatically raised then all RBs would all convert and the growth rate would be very low. When cdiAMP was raised to ~4000 pg/ml there was no effect on the growth rate. However, an increase to ~8000 pg/ml resulted in a significant decrease but growth continued. Increasing cdAMP to ~500,000 pg/ml had less of an impact on the growth rate. Overall, the data does not cleanly support the proposed model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104240.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Junghoon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Nebraska Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Omaha</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ouellette</surname><given-names>Scot P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Nebraska Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Omaha</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript describes the role of the production of c-di-AMP on the chlamydial developmental cycle. The main findings remain the same. The authors show that overexpression of the dacA-ybbR operon results in increased production of c-di-AMP and early expression of transitionary and late genes. The authors also knocked down the expression of the dacA-ybbR operon and reported a modest reduction in the expression of both hctA and omcB. The authors conclude with a model suggesting the amount of c-di-AMP determines the fate of the RB, continued replication, or EB conversion.</p><p>Overall, this is a very intriguing study with important implications however the data is very preliminary and the model is very rudimentary. The data support the observation that dramatically increased c-di-AMP has an impact on transitionary gene expression and late gene expression suggesting dysregulation of the developmental cycle. This effect goes away with modest changes in c-di-AMP (detaTM-DacA vs detaTM-DacA (D164N)). However, the model predicts that low levels of c-di-AMP delays EB production is not not well supported by the data. If this prediction were true then the growth rate would increase with c-di-AMP reduction and the data does not show this. The levels of of c-di-AMP at the lower levels need to be better validated as it seems like only very high levels make a difference for dysregulated late gene expression. However, on the low end it's not clear what levels are needed to have an effect as only DacAopMut and DacAopKD show any effects on the cycle and the c-di-AMP levels are only different at 24 hours.</p></disp-quote><p>These appear to be the same comments the reviewer presented last time, so we will reiterate our prior points here and elsewhere. We do not think and nor do we predict that low c-di-AMP levels should increase growth rate (as measured by gDNA levels), and this conclusion cannot be drawn from our data. Rather, we predict that the inability to accumulate c-di-AMP should delay production of EBs, and this is what the data show. The reviewer has applied their own subjective (and erroneous) interpretation to the model. The asynchronicity of the normal developmental cycle means RBs continue to replicate as EBs are forming, so gDNA levels cannot be used as the sole metric for determining RB levels. We show that reduced c-di-AMP levels reduce EB levels as well as transcripts associated with late stages of development. The parsimonious interpretation of these data support that low c-di-AMP levels delay progression through the developmental cycle consistent with our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data still do not support the overall model.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree. We have presented quantified data that include appropriate controls and statistical tests, and the reviewer has not disputed that or pointed to additional experiments that need to be performed. The reviewer has imposed a subjective interpretation of our model based on their own biases. A reader is free, of course, to disagree with our model, but a reviewer should not block a manuscript based on such a disagreement if no experimental flaws have been identified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1 the authors show at 24 hpi.</p></disp-quote><p>We also showed data from 16hpi, which is a more relevant timepoint for assessing premature transition to EBs. In contrast, the 24hpi is more important for assessing developmental effects of reduced c-di-AMP levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>DacA overexpression increases cdiAMP to ~4000 pg/ml</p><p>DacAmut overexpression reduces cdiAMP dramatically to ~256 pg/ml</p><p>DacATM overexpression increases cdiAMP to ~4000 pg/ml.</p><p>DacAmutTM overexpression does not seem to change cdiAMP ~1500 pg/ml .</p><p>dacAKD decreases cdiAMP to ~300 pg/ml .</p><p>dacAKDcom increased cdiAMP to ~8000 pg/ml.</p><p>DacA-ybbRop overexpression increased cdiAMP to ~500,000 pg/ml.</p><p>DacA-ybbRopmut ~300 pg/ml.</p><p>However in Figure 2 the data show that overexpression of DacA (cdiAMP ~4000 pg/ml) did not have a different phenotype than over expression of the mutant (cdiAMP ~256 pg/ml). HctA expression down, omcB expression down, euo not much change, replication down, and IFUs down. Additionally, Figure 3 shows no differences in anything measured although cdiAMP levels were again dramatically different. DacATM overexpression (~4000 pg/ml) and DacAmutTM (~1500). This makes it unclear what cdiAMP is doing to the developmental cycle.</p></disp-quote><p>As we have explained in the text and in response to reviewer comments on previous rounds of review, overexpressing the full-length WT or mutant DacA is detrimental to developmental cycle progression for reasons that have nothing to do with c-di-AMP levels (likely disrupting membrane function), since, as the reviewer notes, the WT DacA deltaTM strain had similar c-di-AMP levels but no negative effects on growth/development. If we had not presented the effects of overexpressing the individual isoforms, then a reviewer would surely have requested such, which is why we present these data even though they don’t seem to support our model. This is an honest representation of our findings. The reviewer seems intent on nitpicking a minor datapoint that seems to contradict the rest of the manuscript while ignoring or not carefully reading the rest of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4 the authors knockdown dacA (dacA-KD) and complement the knockdown (dacA-KDcom)</p><p>dacAKD decreases cdiAMP (~300) while DacA-KDcom increases cdiAMP much above wt (~8000).</p><p>KD decreased hctA and omcB at 24hpi. Complementation resulted in a moderate increase in hctA at a single time point but not at 24 hpi and had no effect on euo or omcB expression.</p></disp-quote><p>By 24hpi, late gene transcripts are being maximally produced during a normal developmental cycle. It is unclear why the reviewer thinks that these transcripts should be elevated above this level in any of our strains that prematurely transition to EBs. There is no basis in the literature to support such an assumption. As we noted in the text, the dacA-KDcom strain phenocopied the dacAop OE strain, and we showed RNAseq data and EB production curves for the latter that support our conclusions of the effect of increased c-di-AMP levels on developmental progression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Importantly, complementation decreased the growth rate.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, since the c-di-AMP levels breached the “EB threshold” at 16hpi, it causes premature transition to EBs, which do not replicate their gDNA, at an earlier stage of the cycle when fewer organisms are present. Therefore, the gDNA levels are decreased at 24hpi, which is consistent with our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on the proposed model, growth rate should increase as the chlamydia should all be RBs and replicating and not exiting the cell cycle to become EBs (not replicating).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a spurious conclusion from the reviewer. As we clearly showed, the dacA-KDcom did not restore a wild-type phenotype and instead mimicked the dacAop OE strain. This was commented on in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interestingly reducing cdiAMP levels by over expressing DacAmut (~256 pg/ml) did not have an effect on the cycle but the reduction in cdiAMP by knockdown of dacA (~300 pg/ml) did have a moderate effect on the cycle.</p></disp-quote><p>This is again a spurious conclusion from the reviewer. The dacAMut and dacA-KD strains are distinct. As noted in the text and above for DacA WT OE, overexpressing the DacAMut similarly disrupts organism morphology, which is different from dacA-KD. These strains should not be directly compared because of this. This point has been previously highlighted in the text (in Results and Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 5 DacA-ybbRop was overexpressed and this increased cdiAMP dramatically ~500,000 pg/ml as compared to wt ~1500. This increased hctA only at an early timepoint and not at 24hpi and again had no effect on omcB or euo.</p></disp-quote><p>As we explained in prior reviews, our RNAseq data more comprehensively assessed transcripts for the dacAop OE strain. These data show convincingly that late gene transcripts (not just hctA and omcB) are elevated earlier in the developmental cycle. Again, it is not clear why the reviewer should expect that late gene transcripts should be higher in these strains than they are during a normal developmental cycle. This is not part of our model and appears to be a bias that the reviewer has imposed that is not supported by the literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overexpression of the operon with the mutation DacA-ybbRopmut reduced cdiAMP to ~300 pg/ml and this showed a reduction in growth rate similar to dacAmut but a more dramatic decrease in IFUs.</p></disp-quote><p>As we described in the text, in earlier revisions, and above, the dacAMut OE strain has distinct effects unrelated to c-di-AMP levels and, therefore, should not be compared to other strains in terms of linking its c-di-AMP levels to its phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall:</p><p>DacA overexpression increases cdiAMP to ~4000 pg/ml (decreased everything except euo)</p><p>DacAmut overexpression reduces cdiAMP dramatically (~256 pg/ml).

However, these thresholds are more important at the 16hpi timepoint not 24hpi (which the reviewer is referencing) when assessing premature transition to EBs. We specifically highlighted in our prior revision in Figure 1E this EB threshold to make this point clearer for the reader. Once the threshold is breached, then the overall c-di-AMP levels become irrelevant as the RBs have begun their transition to EBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Decreasing cdiAMP has a consistent effect, decreased growth rate, IFU, hctA expression and omcB expression. However, if their proposed model was correct and low levels of cdiAMP blocked EB conversion then more chlamydial cells would be RBs (dividing cells) and the growth rate should increase.</p></disp-quote><p>The only effect should be normal gDNA levels, which is what we see in the dacA-KD. Given the asynchronicity of a normal developmental cycle in which RBs continue to replicate as EBs are still forming, there is no basis to assume gDNA levels should increase under these conditions for the dacA-KD strain at 24hpi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conversely, if cdiAMP levels were dramatically raised then all RBs would all convert and the growth rate would be very low.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. This is what is reflected by the dacAop OE and dacA-KDcom strains, with reduced gDNA levels at 24hpi since organisms have transitioned to EBs at an earlier time post-infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When cdiAMP was raised to ~4000 pg/ml there was no effect on the growth rate.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, because it had not breached the EB threshold at 16hpi – consistent with our model! The reviewer is confusing effects of elevated c-di-AMP at 24hpi when they should be assessed at the 16hpi timepoint for strains overproducing this molecule.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, an increase to ~8000 pg/ml resulted in a significant decrease but growth continued.</p></disp-quote><p>If the reviewer is referring to the dacA-KDcom strain, then this is not accurate. gDNA levels were decreased in this strain at 24hpi when the c-di-AMP levels were increased compared to the WT (mCherry OE) control at 16hpi, indicating this strain had breached the “EB threshold” and initiated conversion to EBs at an earlier timepoint post-infection when fewer organisms were present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Increasing cdAMP to ~500,000 pg/ml had less of an impact on the growth rate.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not clear what this conclusion is based on and what the reviewer is comparing to. This is a subjective assessment not based on our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the data does not cleanly support the proposed model.</p></disp-quote><p>It is an unfortunate aspect of biology, particularly for obligate intracellular bacteria – a challenging experimental system on which to work, that the data are not always “clean”. The overall effects of increased c-di-AMP levels on chlamydial developmental cycle progression we have documented support our model, and we think the reader, as always, should make their own assessment.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript describes the role of the production of c-di-AMP on the chlamydial developmental cycle.

However, the model predicts that low levels of c-di-AMP delays EB production is not not well supported by the data. If this prediction were true then the growth rate would increase with c-di-AMP reduction and the data does not show this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. We have apparently not adequately communicated our predictions and the model. We do not think and nor do we predict that low c-di-AMP levels should increase growth rate, and there is no basis in any of our data to support that. Rather, we predict that the inability to accumulate c-di-AMP should delay production of EBs, and this is what the data show. We have clarified this in the text (line 89 paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The levels of c-di-AMP at the lower levels need to be better validated as it seems like only very high levels make a difference for dysregulated late gene expression.

Again, we stress that low levels of c-di-AMP are irrelevant to the model. We have revised Figure 1E to indicate the level of c-di-AMP in the control strain at the 24hpi timepoint that coincides with increased EB levels. We hope this will further clarify the goals of our study. That a given strain might be below the EB control is not relevant to the model beyond indicating that it has not reached the necessary threshold for triggering secondary differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors responded to reviewers' critiques by adding the overexpression of DacA without the transmembrane region. This addition does not really help their case. They show that detaTM-DacA and detaTM-DacA (D164N) had the same effects on c-di-AMP levels but the figure shows no effects on the developmental cycle.</p></disp-quote><p>As it relates directly to the reviewer’s point, the delta-TM strains did not show the same level of c-di-AMP. It may be that the reviewer misread the graph. The purpose of testing these strains was to show that the negative effects of overexpressing full-length WT DacA were due to its membrane localization. Both the FL and deltaTM-DacA (WT) overexpression had equivalent c-di-AMP levels even though the delta-TM overexpression looked like the mCherry-expressing strain based on the measured parameters. This shows that the c-di-AMP levels were irrelevant to the phenotypes observed when overexpressing these WT isoforms. For the mutant isoforms, the delta-TM looked like the mCherry-expressing control while the FL isoform was negatively impacted for reasons we described in the Discussion (e.g., dominant negative effect). In addition, at 16hpi, neither delta-TM strain had c-di-AMP levels that approached the 24h control as denoted in Figure 1E (dashed line) and in the text, which explains why these strains did not show increased late gene transcripts at an earlier timepoint like the dacAop and dacA-KDcom strains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Describing the significance of the findings:</p><p>The findings are important and point to very exciting new avenues to explore the important questions in chlamydial cell form development. The authors present a model that is not quantified and does not match the data well.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with this assessment as noted above in response to the reviewer’s critique. All of our data are quantified and support the hypothesis as stated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Describing the strength of evidence:</p><p>The evidence presented is incomplete. The authors do a nice job of showing that overexpression of the dacA-ybbR operon increases c-di-AMP and that knockdown or overexpression of the catalytically dead DacA protein decreases the c-di-AMP levels. However, the effects on the developmental cycle and how they fit the proposed model are less well supported.</p><p>Overall this is a very intriguing finding that will require more gene expression data, phenotypic characterization of cell forms, and better quantitative models to fully interpret these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not clear what quantitative models the reviewer would prefer, but, ultimately, it is up to the reader to decide whether they agree or not with the model we present. The data are the data, and we have tried to present them as clearly as possible. We would emphasize that, with the number of strains we have analyzed, we have presented a huge amount of data for a study with an obligate intracellular bacterium. As a comparison, most publications on Chlamydia might use a handful of transformant strains, if any. Given the cost and time associated with performing such studies, it is prohibitive to attempt all the time points that one might like to do, and it is not clear to us that further studies will add to or alter the conclusions of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Minor critiques</p><p>The graphs have red and blue lines but the figure legends are red and black.
