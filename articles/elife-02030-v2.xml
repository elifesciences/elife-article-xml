interfaces covary during evolution? If so, such covariance could be used to predict contacts across interfaces and assemble models of biological complexes. We find that residue pairs identified using a pseudo-likelihood-based method to covary across protein–protein interfaces in the 50S ribosomal unit and 28 additional bacterial protein complexes with known structure are almost always in contact in the complex, provided that the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the two proteins. We use this method to make subunit contact predictions for an additional 36 protein complexes with unknown structures, and present models based on these predictions for the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter, the tripartite efflux system, the pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex, and the methionine ABC transporter.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02030.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02030.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02030.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are considered the ‘workhorse molecules’ of life and they are involved in virtually everything that cells do. Proteins are strings of amino acids that have folded into a specific three-dimensional shape. Proteins must have the correct shape to function properly, as they often work by binding to other proteins or molecules—much like a key fitting into a lock. Working out the structure of a protein can, therefore, provide major insights into how the protein does its job.</p><p>Two or more proteins can bind together and form a complex to perform various tasks; and solving the structures of these complexes can be challenging, even if the structures of the protein subunits are known. Now, Ovchinnikov, Kamisetty, and Baker have developed a method for predicting which parts of the proteins make contact with each other in a two-protein complex.</p><p>Different species can have copies of the same proteins; but a copy from one species might have different amino acids at certain positions when compared to a related copy from another species. As such, when pairs of interacting proteins from different species are compared, there will be many positions in the two proteins that vary. However, if the amino acid at a position in one protein (let's call it ‘X’) varies, and the amino acid at, say, position ‘Y’ in the other protein also varies such that for any given amino acid at position Y there is often a specific amino acid at position X; positions X and Y are said to ‘co-vary’. Ovchinnikov et al. noticed that when a pair of amino acids (one from each protein in a two-protein complex) co-varied, these two amino acids tended to make contact with each other at the protein–protein interface.</p><p>Ovchinnikov et al. used the new method to make predictions about the protein–protein interfaces in 28 protein complexes found in bacteria, and also to make a prediction about the interface between protein subunits in the bacterial ribosome. When these predictions were checked against the actual structures, which were all known beforehand, they were found to be accurate if the number of copies of each protein being compared is greater than the average length of the two proteins.</p><p>Ovchinnikov et al. went on to predict the amino acids on the protein–protein interfaces for another 36 bacterial protein complexes with unknown structures, and to present models for four larger complexes. The next challenge is to extend the method to protein complexes that are found only in eukaryotes (i.e., not in bacteria). Since the number of related copies for eukaryotic proteins tends to be smaller, there are fewer proteins to compare and it is therefore harder to detect ‘covariation’ when it occurs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02030.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02030.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>protein coevolution</kwd><kwd>protein complexes</kwd><kwd>pseudo-likelihood</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM092802-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ovchinnikov</surname><given-names>Sergey</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamisetty</surname><given-names>Hetunandan</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Institute of General Medical Studies, P41 GM103533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000774</institution-id><institution>Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00024-10-D-6318/0024-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ovchinnikov</surname><given-names>Sergey</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Co-evolving residue pairs in the different components of a protein complex almost always make contact across the protein–protein interface, thus providing powerful restraints for the modeling of protein complexes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent work has demonstrated the accuracy of coevolution-based contact prediction for monomeric proteins using a global statistical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>) to distinguish between direct and indirect couplings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hopf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nugent and Jones, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lapedes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sułkowska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>).

The more general problem of predicting if two proteins interact with each other has been studied extensively using a wide variety of approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Juan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21a">Hosur et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shoemaker and Panchenko, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valencia and Pazos, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ochoa and Pazos, 2010</xref>). Amino acid residue coevolution has been used to predict residue–residue interactions across interfaces with local statistical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pazos et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halperin et al., 2006</xref>). As noted above, the accuracy of these models is reduced by the confounding of direct and indirect correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lapedes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weigt et al., 2009</xref>); the application of global statistical models to coevolution-based contact prediction across interfaces has been limited to the case of the histidine-kinase/response-regulator two component system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger and van Nimwegen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weigt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schug et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dago et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examine residue–residue covariation across protein–protein interfaces using a pseudo-likelihood-based statistical method. In a large set of complexes of known structure, we find that covarying pairs of positions are almost always in contact in the three-dimensional structure, provided there are sufficient aligned sequences. We find further that significant residue–residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting protein pairs but very rarely between non-interacting pairs, and hence should be useful for predicting whether two proteins interact. We use the pseudo-likelihood method to predict contacts across protein-interfaces for 36 evolutionarily conserved complexes of unknown structure and present structure models for four of the complexes particularly well constrained by these data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>For a single protein family, it is straightforward to generate a multiple sequence alignment and subsequently identify covarying residue pairs. To identify covarying residue pairs between two proteins A and B is not as easy: only organisms that contain an ortholog of protein A and protein B contribute, and in generating the alignments the protein A and protein B sequences for each organism must be properly paired. To simplify the ortholog identification problem, we focus on pairs of genes with conserved chromosomal locations separated in the genome by fewer than 20 other annotated genes. We then build GREMLIN global statistical models for sequences in the paired protein families. The models have ‘one-body’ parameters for each amino acid at each position in the two proteins, and ‘two-body’ parameters for each pair of amino acids at each pair of positions in the two proteins. These parameters are obtained by maximizing the pseudo-likelihood of the observed sequence pairs, rather than their likelihood, which makes the quite formidable estimation tractable. In the following sections, we investigate the structural contexts of residue pairs with large values of these two-body coupling parameters</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Residue–residue covariation in the bacterial 50S ribosomal unit</title><p>We began by studying residue–residue coupling parameters in the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit—the largest evolutionarily conserved bacterial multiprotein complex with an atomic resolution structure. For each individual protein in the complex, we constructed multiple sequence alignments by querying the UniProt sequence database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2006</xref>) for homologous sequences. For every pair of proteins in the complex, we then constructed a paired multiple sequence alignment (‘Materials and methods’). For each such paired alignment, we built a GREMLIN global statistical model, computed normalized coupling strengths from the two body coupling parameters, and ranked inter protein residue pairs based on these scores (‘Materials and methods’). A coupling strength larger than one indicates higher than average coupling between two residues.</p><p>We find that in the 50S ribosomal subunit only a small fraction of residue pairs coevolve, as indicated by coupling strengths (y axis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) greater than 1.5. Remarkably, the two residues in each of these pairs are almost all within 8 Å of each other in the 50S crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and all are within 12 Å.

In the 50S subunit, every pair of proteins with summed coupling strengths (numbers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) greater than 1.5 interacts with each other (boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). There are, however, several instances of protein pairs that contact in the 50S subunit for which no covariance is observed; clearly not every interaction will be identified by the sum of the coupling strengths, for example between two proteins that are held together primarily by the ribosomal RNA.</p><p>How many aligned sequences are required for accurate contact prediction? To assess the dependence on alignment depth, we generated paired sub-alignments with varying numbers of sequences for every pair of 50S proteins and recomputed coupling strengths for each sub-alignment. For each alignment depth, we calculated the fraction of residue pairs within 12 Å for different ranges of coupling strengths. We find that the greater the number of aligned sequences, the lower the value of the coupling strength above which residue pairs are likely to be in contact in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For example, if the number of aligned sequences is greater than the sum of the lengths of the two proteins, residue–residue contact predictions are likely to be accurate if the coupling strength is 2 or greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: orange dots), while if there are twice as many sequences, contact predictions are accurate above a coupling strength of 1.5 (the cutoff shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A sigmoidal function of the coupling strength and the number of sequences per position in the complex accurately fits the observed contact frequency data (‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); we refer to the fitted values as GREMLIN scores for the remainder of the paper.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bacterial complex benchmark</title><p>We next generated paired-alignments for all <italic>E. coli</italic> gene-pairs that had conserved intergenic distances across genomes deposited in the UniProt (‘Materials and methods’). As the 50S results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) suggested that alignment depths greater than the average of the lengths of the two proteins were required for accurate prediction, we focused on paired alignments with at least this number of sequences—1126 gene pairs in total excluding the ribosomal proteins. For each of these 1126 pairs, we generated GREMLIN global statistical models and determined the coupling strength for each residue pair.</p><p>For 64 of the 1126 gene pairs, at least one pair of residues had GREMLIN score &gt;0.85. For 28 of the 64 pairs three-dimensional structures have been determined experimentally, and the locations of the residue pairs with GREMLIN score &gt;0.6 for several of these complexes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (pairs within 8 Å are in yellow, between 8 Å and 12 Å in orange, and greater than 12 Å, in red). Almost all pairs with GREMLIN scores greater than 0.6 are in contact in the complex structures, with the notable exception of the NADH dehydrogenase subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The complex is thought to undergo a cascade of conformational changes during electron transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>); the high GREMLIN score contacts not made in the solved structure may provide insight into the nature of these changes. As observed for the 50S complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the existence of one or more high GREMLIN scores between two proteins provides evidence that the proteins interact: 44% (28/64) of the protein pairs with high GREMLIN scores form a complex which has been solved crystallographically compared to 8% (78/1126) over the whole set.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02030.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Residue covariation in complexes with known structures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Residue-pairs across protein chains with high GREMLIN scores almost always make contact across protein interfaces in experimentally determined complex structures.

We evaluated this on a docking test set containing 18 protein complexes from the benchmark set where at least one component (or a close homolog) had a known structure in the <italic>apo</italic> form (‘Materials and methods’, docking test-set). We developed a docking protocol that used the predicted contacts as distance restraints and sampled the space of physically plausible structures to generate models of the protein–protein complex. The model with the best restraint score had an interface that was within 4 Å (in root mean square deviation) of the native interface in 14 of the 18 cases and had more than half the native contacts in 16 of the 18 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two of the cases in which the iRMSD (interface root-mean-square deviation) was the highest (bottom of table in A) are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>: the high iRMSD is due to large changes in the conformation of one of the monomers upon binding; despite these changes the binding interface is reasonably accurately identified. Conformational changes that hinder the rigid-body docking protocol from sampling the bound conformation also occurred for thiazole synthase/sulfur carrier and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase with iRMSD of 4.8A and 4.3A, respectively. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, a second energy minimum corresponds to a second interface in the complex with a different homo-oligomer subunit. In the absence of conformational changes, predicted contact guided docking is very accurate.

Not all contacting residues across protein interfaces likely co-evolve nor all protein–protein interfaces. Nevertheless, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>, there is clearly sufficient coevolutionary signal to significantly constrain models of a large number of protein complexes.</p><p>There is a notable contrast in the utility of intra-monomer and intersubunit predicted contacts for structure modeling. We found previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>) that contacts could be predicted with high accuracy for monomeric proteins, provided there were sufficient aligned sequences, but in such cases there was almost always already a structure of a family member from which comparative models could be built, limiting the utility of the predicted contacts in structure prediction (Though predicted contacts can be useful in modeling allosteric changes in protein structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hopf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morcos et al., 2013</xref>]). In contrast, here we find that more than half of the complexes for which the protein families of the constituent subunits are sufficiently large for accurate contact prediction do not currently have three-dimensional structures. Hence, while predicted contacts can be very accurate for both monomeric globular proteins and for protein–protein complexes, they are more useful for structure modeling for the latter due to the much poorer representation of protein complexes in the PDB.</p><p>While our approach of constructing a global statistical model from paired sequence alignments is generally applicable to any taxa, the current study focuses on prokaryotes and mitochondria. Doing so allows us to largely avoid the problem of distinguishing between paralogs by exploiting the operon architecture of bacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacob et al., 2005</xref>). Constructing paired-sequence alignments for more complex genomic architectures is more involved and requires the ability to distinguish orthologs from paralogs, the subject of active research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Remm et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Datta et al., 2009</xref>).

We refer to such a multiple sequence alignment of paired sequences as a paired alignment.</p><p>For gene families with a single copy in each genome such as the ribosomal proteins, constructing paired alignments is straightforward as sequence pairs from the same genome can simply be concatenated. While the process of generating paired alignments in general is complicated in the presence of multiple paralogs of a gene in a single genome, in prokaryotes, co-regulated genes are often co-located on the genome into operons. We exploit this property to avoid paralogous genes when creating paired sequences by restricting to gene pairs that have small, conserved intergenic distances. A similar approach was used to construct a database of fusion proteins in prokaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suhre and Claverie, 2004</xref>). Defining Δgene as the number of annotated genes between a gene pair, we only consider pairs with Δgene conserved in 60% of genomes and less than 20. To allow for ambiguity in annotation, if the second or third most common intergenic distance is within 1 of the mode, these gene-pairs are included in the conservation calculation. Given that most UniProt accession IDs are serially assigned in a genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">UniProt Accession</xref>), Δgene can be rapidly evaluated by looking at the difference in accession ids.

Despite some concerns, your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor (John Kuriyan), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers. To minimize delays, you should first respond by email to describe how you plan to revise the article before submitting a full revision. We are hopeful that by your submitting a detailed response this can be discussed by the editors and the reviewers, and that a revised manuscript need not then be submitted to re-review.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments, and there is consensus that this is an interesting and potentially very influential manuscript using evolution methods to improve both protein structure prediction as well as protein-protein interactions. The manuscript describes the application of the pseudo-likelihood approach, first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balakrishnan et al. (2011)</xref>, to the determination of interacting residues across protein-protein interfaces. The coupling information is then used for the construction of docked models for a number of biologically important systems. The results seem to be very good and interesting, at least at a qualitative level. There are, however, some concerns:</p><p>1) Why were structural models built only for the unknown complexes, and why not for the ones with known structure? Quantitative results for at least some of the complexes with known structure would be helpful to better understand the accuracy of the resulting models and the impact of distance constraints.</p><p>2) There is not sufficient quantitative evidence demonstrating that the method described here is far superior to previous methods such as mfDCA and plDCA.</p><p>3) It is somewhat unfortunate that the paper as currently written overstates the novelty of the work, including unnecessary and unsubstantiated criticism of previous methods. Understandably, the authors did not want to repeat the discussion of the algorithm given previously by Balakrishnan et al. and also briefly in their PNAS paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>). However, considering that the primary readers of <italic>eLife</italic> are most likely biologists, it might be useful to add a few sentences in the Introduction about the innovative nature of the pseudo-likelihood approach, and why is it better than the earlier methods. More generally, there are many places in the paper where some more explanation would help the readers. Note that <italic>eLife</italic> has no limitation on the length of the paper, and hence it is possible to improve readability.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02030.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Why were structural models built only for the unknown complexes, and why not for the ones with known structure? Quantitative results for at least some of the complexes with known structure would be helpful to better understand the accuracy of the resulting models and the impact of distance constraints</italic>.</p><p>This is an excellent suggestion. We have carried out a detailed analysis of docking results on proteins of known structure, and we will include this in the revised version. Briefly, in 30 of the 33 cases where there were at least two predicted contacts with scores greater than 0.6, the docking model with the best gremlin score was within 2 Å RMSD of the experimentally determined complex structure. We will point out that this likely overestimates the accuracy of our models of the unknown complexes, however, since docking of bound (from the structure of the complex) structures generally is more accurate than docking of unbound structures.</p><p><italic>2) There is not sufficient quantitative evidence demonstrating that the method described here is far superior to previous methods such as mfDCA and plDCA</italic>.</p><p>The demonstration that the pseudo-likelihood approach is quantitatively better than previous methods was presented in the two previous papers on this approach. This is not the focus of this paper, as should be clear from the Abstract. The focus of this paper is, instead, the demonstration that co-evolution data can be used to generate reliable models of a wide range of protein protein complexes of biological interest. We go very considerably beyond previous work on this topic, which has focused on the Sensor histidine kinase+Response Regulator (SK/RR) two-component systems.</p><p><italic>3) It is somewhat unfortunate that the paper as currently written overstates the novelty of the work, including unnecessary and unsubstantiated criticism of previous methods.

We will provide more explanation of the innovative nature of the approach in the methods section. Where necessary, we will refer to the relevant sections of our PNAS paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>) for technical details.</p></body></sub-article></article>
