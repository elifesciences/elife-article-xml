Inhibitory synapses are key regulators of the functional balance of neural circuits. However, due to the diversity of inhibitory presynaptic neurons, the complex composition of postsynaptic receptor subunits, and the lack of typical postsynaptic dense structure, there are relatively few studies on the regulatory mechanisms for inhibitory synaptic structure and function, and insufficient understanding of the cellular and molecular abnormalities of inhibitory synapses in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we report a crucial role for endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses. We show that endophilin A1 directly interacts with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin in excitatory neurons and promotes organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic density and synaptic recruitment/stabilization of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors via its plasma membrane association and actin polymerization-promoting activities. Loss of endophilin A1 by gene knockout in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells weakens inhibitory synaptic transmission and causes imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory function of neural circuits, leading to increased susceptibility to epilepsy. Our findings identify endophilin A1 as an iPSD component and provide new insights into the organization and stabilization of inhibitory postsynapses to maintain E/I balance as well as the pathogenesis of epilepsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endophilin A1</kwd><kwd>E/I balance</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>GABAAR</kwd><kwd>gephyrin</kwd><kwd>inhibitory synapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32271005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yanrui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070785</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yanrui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31921002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32270730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91954126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022-MDB-KF-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endophilin A1 at postsynaptic sites promotes inhibitory postsynaptic organization through interaction with gephyrin to maintain E/I balance, which is essential for the suppression of epilepsy susceptibility.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activities of neural circuits are tightly orchestrated in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakimoto et al., 2021</xref>). The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity is implicated in many neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canitano and Pallagrosi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canitano and Palumbi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foss-Feig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fritschy, 2008</xref>). In the brain, in contrast to asymmetric excitatory synapses formed between axonal boutons and dendritic postsynaptic structures with thick disc-shaped postsynaptic density (PSD), inhibitory synapses are symmetric and are constituted of the presynaptic terminal from diverse interneurons and the postsynaptic plasma membrane with thin sheet-like PSD where receptor complexes are anchored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Favuzzi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mody and Pearce, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tao et al., 2018</xref>). Although the formation, maturation, and plasticity of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses are vitally important for neural circuit functioning, much more research effort has been focused on the regulatory mechanisms governing excitatory synaptic structure and function. The mechanisms by which inhibitory synapses are constructed in the brain and fine-tuned in response to neural activity remain largely unexplored.</p><p>The γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs), major targets of antiseizure drugs, are heteropentameric chloride channels that mediate fast synaptic transmission at inhibitory synapses in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scott and Aricescu, 2019</xref>). Several neuropathologies are characterized by alterations in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking, synaptic E/I ratio, and neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakimoto et al., 2021</xref>). At the inhibitory postsynaptic site, synaptic localization and functioning of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs requires trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, submembranous scaffold proteins, and intracellular signaling proteins. Gephyrin is a master organizer of iPSD, which self-assembles into planar lattices beneath the plasma membrane and anchors GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs or glycine receptors (GlyRs) to the postsynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">George et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kasaragod and Schindelin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirsch et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>). Collybistin, a membrane lipid-binding protein, functions in recruitment of gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to the plasma membrane by interacting with gephyrin, the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin-2 (NL2) and the α2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalscheuer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saiepour et al., 2010</xref>). The transmembrane protein Shisa7 binds GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and regulates their trafficking, synaptic abundance, and functional properties via binding to protein(s) other than gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, mechanisms governing the assembly, recruitment, and maintenance of various inhibitory synaptic components remain largely enigmatic.</p><p>The majority of inhibitory synapses are formed on the dendritic shaft, or around the cell body of excitatory principal neurons where both actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are present underneath the plasma membrane. Through direct interaction with polymerized tubulin, gephyrin organizes the iPSD by anchoring the GlyRs and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to the microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parato and Bartolini, 2021</xref>). Notably, although small F-actin patches are observed within the dendritic shaft where the majority of inhibitory synapses are assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Bommel et al., 2019</xref>), role(s) of the actin cytoskeleton in the organization and maintenance of inhibitory synapses is still unclear.</p><p>Endophilin A1 (EndoA1) is a member of the endophilin A protein family characterized by an amino (N)-terminal membrane-binding N-BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain and a carboxyl (C)-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. The gene encoding endophilin A1 (gene name <italic>sh3gl2</italic>) is almost exclusively expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ringstad et al., 1997</xref>), and has been implicated in epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corponi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Germer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2018b</xref>). In excitatory synapses, endophilin A1 functions in synaptic vesicle recycling and autophagosome formation at the axon terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bademosi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murdoch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ringstad et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Soukup et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Verstreken et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>), and regulates the morphogenesis, maturation, and acute structural plasticity of dendritic spines by promoting actin polymerization via its effector protein p140Cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies reported that the double knockout (KO) mice of EndoA1 and EndoA2 (gene name <italic>sh3gl1</italic>) exhibit spontaneous epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). However, EndoA1 depletion only causes a slight decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). As E/I imbalance is caused by changes in either excitatory or inhibitory activity, or both, we were prompted to investigate the biological function of endophilin A1 in the inhibitory synapses. In this study, we show that endophilin A1 interacts with gephyrin and localizes to GABAergic postsynapses. Via its membrane-binding and actin polymerization-promoting activities, endophilin A1 facilitates organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery. Loss of endophilin A1 causes impairment of inhibitory synaptic transmission, E/I imbalance, and aggravation of epileptic susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ablation of endophilin A1 causes E/I imbalance and increases epilepsy susceptibility</title><p>Previous studies found that EndoA1 and EndoA2 double knockout (KO) mice exhibit spontaneous epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that endophilin A1 and A2 are involved in maintaining the E/I balance. However, another study reported that the protein levels of endophilin A1 were higher in temporal neocortex neurons of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2018b</xref>).

Whole-cell patch clamp recording of CA1 pyramidal cells indicated that, while the eEPSC and its paired-pulse ratio (PPR) were not significantly changed, the evoked inhibitory postsynaptic current (eIPSC), not its PPR, was decreased in the EndoA1 KO neurons, resulting in a significant increase in the E/I ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–I</xref>). Of note, neither the frequency nor the amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSC) or miniature IPSCs (mIPSC) was altered in EndoA1 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–O</xref>). Moreover, neither fast mIPSCs (perisomatic events:&lt;2.8 ms) nor slow mIPSCs (distal dendritic events:&gt;2.8 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miles et al., 1996</xref>) were affected by EndoA1 KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that presynaptic quantal release of soma- or dendrite-targeting inhibitory synapses is normal. Taken together, these data indicate that endophilin A1 in hippocampal pyramidal neurons functions in inhibitory synaptic transmission to maintain E/I balance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Endophilin A1 is required for the formation and stabilization of inhibitory synapses</title><p>Diminished eIPSC in EndoA1 KO pyramidal neurons prompted us to determine the role of endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses by immunofluorescence staining of brain sections from <italic>Sh3gl2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.

By immunofluorescence staining and super-resolution microscopy of hippocampal neurons in dissociated culture, we observed partial colocalization of endophilin A1 with gephyrin as well as surface GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 in dendrites of hippocampal neurons, and juxtaposition or partial colocalization of endophilin A1 and VGAT puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1 fig3video2 fig3video3">Figure 3—video 1–3</xref>). We further detected the localization of endophilin A1 to inhibitory synapses by co-immunostaining with both pre- and post-synaptic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">Figure 3—video 4</xref>). Quantitative analysis of super-resolution localization maps revealed that ~47% puncta of gephyrin or Bassoon were proximal to endophilin A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>, n = 14), with a mean distance between endophilin A1- and gephyrin-positive pixels of ∼ 120 nm, or between endophilin A1- and Bassoon-positive pixels of ∼ 130 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). These results indicate that endophilin A1 localizes to not only ePSD but also iPSD. Therefore, we speculated that endophilin A1 acted as a component of iPSD. Previous studies reported that synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs contain the γ2 subunit along with α and β subunits (e.g. α1β2γ2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scott and Aricescu, 2019</xref>). The γ2 subunit is essential for receptor clustering at the synapse, mediated by interactions with scaffold proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Essrich et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) of endogenous proteins in membrane fractions from mouse brain lysates with antibodies against GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 detected not only the known iPSD components γ2, NL2, and gephyrin, but also endophilin A1, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Of note, loss of endophilin A1 caused decreases in levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 and gephyrin but not NL2 in anti-GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Further, immunoblotting of synaptosome fractions revealed that the levels of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 and gephyrin were reduced at synapses in adult EndoA1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>).

To further investigate the mechanism underlying endophilin A1-mediated assembly of inhibitory postsynapses, we asked whether actin polymerization contributes to the stabilization of iPSD and GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering in dendrites. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Bommel et al., 2019</xref>), we observed large patches of F-actin labeled by LifeAct-mCherry in spines and small puncta in dendritic shafts that exhibited partial colocalization with or adjoined gephyrin in cultured hippocampal neurons by super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). We then determined the impact of F-actin depolymerization on gephyrin-labeled iPSD and γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in cultured hippocampal neurons. Treatment of mature neurons with nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizing reagent, for one hour (short-term) or two hours (long-term), caused decreases in the number of both PSD95 and gephyrin puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>), which was in good agreement with previous findings that microtubule dynamics regulates the spatial organization of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaworski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirsch and Betz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirsch et al., 1991</xref>).

We then tested the effect of actin depolymerization on GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering and found that long-term but not short-term latrunculin A application caused a reduction in the number of GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 puncta in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>). This finding supported the observation that the decrease in gephyrin cluster preceded the reduction in GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 receptor cluster following latrunculin A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). In addition, colocalization analysis revealed less recruitment of γ2 to gephyrin puncta even after short-term drug application, without changes in γ2 clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref>).

In the present study, we identify endophilin A1 as a novel binding partner for gephyrin and demonstrate that it promotes the assembly of inhibitory synapses and clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at the iPSD. Loss of endophilin A1 activity causes impairment of inhibitory synaptic transmission in neuronal circuits and increases susceptibility to seizures. In the central nervous system, inhibitory interneurons are highly diverse in morphologies, molecular profiles, and physiological functions. Presynaptic terminals from different types of interneurons target distinct subcellular compartments in postsynaptic pyramidal neurons where GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors of specific subunit compositions are located. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons usually contact the soma and proximal dendrites, whereas somatostatin-expressing (SST+) interneurons mainly innervate the dendrites of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). Although different inhibitory synapses localized in different subcellular compartments of postsynaptic neurons have distinct properties and express a diversity of synaptic proteins, gephyrin remains a core postsynaptic component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Favuzzi et al., 2019</xref>). Our study revealed that endophilin A1 promotes the clustering of gephyrin in all subcellular compartments of pyramidal neurons, indicating that endophilin A1 functions in the organization of inhibitory postsynapses innervated by various presynaptic interneurons.</p><p>Among the endophilin A proteins, endophilin A1 is the most abundant in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). Although they have redundant roles in physiological or pathological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>), endophilin A1, but not A2 or A3, promotes spine morphogenesis and excitatory postsynaptic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we uncover a previously unanticipated role for endophilin A1 at GABAergic synapses. By deleting endophilin As in specific neuron subtypes, we found that endophilin A1 regulates GABAergic postsynaptic compartments. Endophilin A1, rather than A2 or A3, interacts with gephyrin and modulates the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery. Although endophilin A1 might function redundantly with other endophilin As in synaptic vesicle recycling at the presynaptic site, it participates in the organization or reorganization of postsynaptic structures through specific binding to postsynaptic proteins, a function that cannot be fully replaced by other endophilin As at both excitatory and inhibitory postsynapses.</p><p>The membrane lipid-binding protein collybistin interacts with the trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecule NL-2 to recruit gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub>R α2 to the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalscheuer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saiepour et al., 2010</xref>). Adamtsl3 secreted from presynapses binds to the transmembrane protein DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) and controls its synaptic localization, which is required for the maintenance of GABAergic synapses in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cramer et al., 2023</xref>). Anchoring of the α5 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub>R to the actin cytoskeleton through radixin, an actin-binding protein, facilitates its clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loebrich et al., 2006</xref>). These findings underscore the necessity for investigation of mechanism(s) regulating the plasma membrane-iPSD-actin cytoskeleton interaction. As membrane-binding and actin polymerization-promoting activities of endophilin A1 are both required for its function in enhancing iPSD formation and γ2–containing GABA<sub>A</sub>R clustering to iPSD, we propose that membrane-bound endophilin A1 promotes postsynaptic assembly by coordinating the plasma membrane tethering of the postsynaptic protein complex and its stabilization with the actin cytomatrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, clustering of β2/3 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is independent of the actin or microtubule cytoskeleton in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kasaragod et al., 2022</xref>). Given that synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are composed of distinct subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kasaragod et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koh et al., 2023</xref>), these findings indicate that the actin cytoskeleton plays distinct roles in the clustering and possibly dynamic changes in the subunit composition and subcompartmental localization of different types of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Of note, the subcellular distribution of gephyrin, which has a tubulin-binding motif, is not affected by depolymerization of F-actin or microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 2000</xref>). Overall, the discrepancy in data about the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in inhibitory synapses may be due to differences in drug concentration, treatment time, receptor subtypes, and neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mody and Pearce, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sexton et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, the impaired clustering of gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub> γ2 by F-actin depolymerization underscores the essential role of F-actin in the assembly and stabilization of the inhibitory postsynaptic machinery. Membrane-bound endophilin A1 promotes F-actin polymerization beneath the plasma membrane through its interaction with p140Cap, an F-actin regulatory protein, thereby facilitating and/or stabilizing the clustering of gephyrin and γ2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at postsynapses.</p><p>The number of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is subject to alterations not only during development and neuronal plasticity but also during pathological processes such as epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nusser et al., 1998</xref>). Synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are recruited directly from extrasynaptic pools following exocytosis, and their endocytosis occurs exclusively at extrasynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogdanov et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, lateral diffusion of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites and their iPSD anchoring are very important for their synaptic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>). In good agreement with the finding that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs stabilization at synapses depends on gephyrin clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacob et al., 2005</xref>), we found that decreases in gephyrin clustering preceded the reduction in surface GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs following F-actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As the core scaffold protein in iPSD, gephyrin is highly enriched at the inhibitory postsynaptic sites and drives the formation of iPSD sheets via phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>). As binding of gephyrin by its partner proteins inhibits the iPSD condensate formation via autoinhibition of the multivalent interactions between its E domain and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoffmann and Milovanovic, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), it is conceivable that endophilin A1 binding not only tethers the scaffold protein to the plasma membrane, but also releases it from the autoinhibitory conformation to facilitate the phase separation of the gephyrin-receptor complexes. Whether the activity of endophilin A1 is regulated by neuronal activity to participate in the structural and functional remodeling of iPSD awaits further investigation.</p><p>At the presynaptic site of excitatory synapses, endophilin A1 functions in synaptic vesicle recycling by recruiting the clathrin-uncoating factor synaptojanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milosevic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schuske et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Verstreken et al., 2003</xref>). At the excitatory postsynapses, plasma membrane-associated endophilin A1 facilitates the morphogenesis, stabilization, maturation, and plasticity of dendritic spines by promoting actin polymerization via its interaction with p140Cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that endophilin A1 functions upstream of p140Cap in not only excitatory but also inhibitory postsynapses of excitatory neurons. Intriguingly, recent studies reported that p140Cap is present in the inhibitory presynaptic compartment and regulates GABAergic synaptogenesis and neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russo et al., 2019</xref>), raising the possibility that endophilin A1 and p140Cap also coordinate to regulate the organization and activity of GABAergic synapses at the inhibitory presynaptic site. Remodeling of inhibitory synapses and dendritic spines is spatially clustered by sensory inputs in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the turnover of inhibitory synapses outpaces that of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that deficits in inhibitory synapses are much more severe in EndoA1 KO mice, leading to perturbation of the E/I balance and increased epileptic vulnerability.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Generation of <italic>Sh3gl2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Sh3gl2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (KO first) mice on the C57BL/6J background was as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).

Finally, select the two images (GPN and EndoA1 or Bassoon and EndoA1) and the mask images, then perform a cross-correlation analysis (CCC) between the two images using the CCC plugin for ImageJ software(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/andmccall/Colocalization_by_Cross_Correlation">https://github.com/andmccall/Colocalization_by_Cross_Correlation</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCall, 2024b</xref>), which is publicly available under GPL-3.0 license.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For all biochemical, cell biological, and electrophysiological recordings, at least three independent experiments were performed (independent cultures, transfections, or different mice). Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data sets were tested for normality and direct comparisons between two groups were made using two-tailed Student’s t test (t test, for normally distributed data) as indicated. To evaluate statistical significance of three or more groups of samples, one-way ANOVA analysis with a Tukey test was used or repeated measures ANOVA analysis with a Tukey test was used in behavior assays. Statistical parameters are reported in the figures and the corresponding legends. The statistical significance was defined as * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, respectively. All data are presented as scatterplots with mean ± S.E.M.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Approval code: AP2022008).

To this end, the authors use constitutive or conditional knockout of Endophilin A1 (EEN1) to assess the consequences on GABAergic synapse composition and function, as well as the outcome for PTZ-induced seizure susceptibility. The authors show that EEN1 KO mice show a higher susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizures, accompanied by a reduction in the GABAergic synaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin as well as specific GABAAR subunits and eIPSCs. The authors then investigate the underlying mechanisms, demonstrating that Endophilin A1 binds directly to gephyrin and GABAAR subunits, and identifying the subdomains of Endophilin A1 that contribute to this effect. Overall, the authors state that their study places Endophilin A1 as a new regulator of GABAergic synapse function.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the topic of this manuscript is very timely, since there has been substantial recent interest in describing the mechanisms governing inhibitory synaptic transmission at GABAergic synapses. The study will therefore be of interest to a wide audience of neuroscientists studying synaptic transmission and its role in disease. The manuscript is well written and contains a substantial quantity of data. In the revised version of the manuscript, the authors have increased the number of samples analyzed and have significantly improved the statistical analysis, thereby substantially strengthening the conclusions of their study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102792.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The function of neural circuits relies heavily on the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs.

Their data show impaired evoked inhibitory synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons of mice lacking endophilin A1, and an increased susceptibility to seizures. Endophilin can interact with the postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin and promotes assembly of the inhibitory postsynaptic element. Endophilin A1 is known to play a role in presynaptic terminals and in dendritic spines, but a role for endophilin A1 at inhibitory postsynaptic densities has not yet been described, providing a valuable addition to the field.</p><p>To investigate the role of endophilin A1 at inhibitory postsynapses, the authors used a broad array of experimental approaches, including tests of seizure susceptibility, electrophysiology, biochemistry, neuronal culture and image analysis. The authors have addressed the remaining concerns in their revision. Taken together, their results expand the synaptic role of endophilin-A1 to include the inhibitory post synaptic element.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102792.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

While superplots could more transparently show culture to culture variability, it is difficult to add more colors or even shades to the scatterplots in the current form, which have already been color coded for multiple groups of samples.

The long list of issues brought up by the reviewers and the many corrections needed still raise questions about data quality in this manuscript.</p><p>In response to my comments (Point 2), the added experiment with PSD95.FingR and GPN.FingR in cultured neurons (Fig. S5A-D) is a good addition; the in vivo data using FingRs in Figure S3 look less convincing however. In response to my Point 5, the authors have added a cell-free binding assay (Figure 5I). This is a useful addition, but to convincingly make the point of interaction between Gephyrin and EndoA1, more rigorous biophysical quantitation of binding is needed. The legend in Figure 5I states that 4 independent experiments were performed, but the graph only shows 3 dots. This needs to be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate your comments and apologize for any concerns raised. As suggested (Point 2), we made many efforts to visualize endogenous postsynaptic proteins using recombinant probes. However, due to much lower expression of GPN.FingR compared with PSD95.FingR in P21 brain slices following viral infection (Figure S3), we were unable to obtain better imaging results. To strengthen our data and conclusions, we additionally performed experiments with PSD95.FingR and GPN.FingR in cultured neurons (Fig. S5A-D) in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the biophysical quantification of gephyrin–endophilin A1 binding, we do not have the equipment for this type of experiment (surface plasmon resonance or isothermal titration calorimetry). Instead, we performed a pull-down assay as an alternative to confirm their interaction (Figure 5I). We also apologize for the error in the number of independent experiments stated in the figure legend and have corrected it in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
