APC/C activity is controlled by an interplay of multiple pathways during mitosis, including the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), that are not yet fully understood. Here, we show that sumoylation of the APC4 subunit of the APC/C peaks during mitosis and is critical for timely APC/C activation and anaphase onset. We have also identified a functionally important SUMO interacting motif in the cullin-homology domain of APC2 located near the APC4 sumoylation sites and APC/C catalytic core.

Cellular mechanisms therefore exist to safeguard against chromosome missegregation, including the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) that functions during the mitotic stage of the cell cycle. At the onset of mitosis, mitotic kinases and microtubule motor proteins coordinate attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores to align sister chromatids at the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>). The SAC monitors spindle attachments and produces an inhibitory signal known as the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). The MCC is composed of BubR1, Bub3, Cdc20, and Mad2 and functions to inhibit the Anaphase Promoting Complex or Cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin RING E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Musacchio, 2015</xref>). The SAC is silenced upon proper chromosome alignment, leading to APC/C activation, processive ubiquitylation and degradation of Cyclin B1 and securin, and subsequent anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sivakumar and Gorbsky, 2015</xref>). The dynamics between SAC signaling and APC/C activation produce a fine-tuned ‘rheostat’ responsive to multiple signals affecting mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The multi-subunit APC/C is a member in a large family of cullin-RING E3 ligases and functions most prominently as the gatekeeper to the metaphase-anaphase transition and mitotic exit. APC/C activity must be exquisitely regulated to target specific substrates for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis during different points in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pines, 2011</xref>). In mitosis, APC/C activity is modulated through multiple signals that act to regulate MCC, co-activator, E2 enzyme and substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eytan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uzunova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matyskiela and Morgan, 2009</xref>), as well as sub-cellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acquaviva et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jörgensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Topper et al., 2002</xref>). Studies of APC/C structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herzog et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>) and interactions with E2 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>) and substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davey and Morgan, 2016</xref>) are beginning to provide detailed molecular insights into its function and regulation. These findings reveal that the APC/C contains a flexible and dynamic catalytic core composed of APC2, the cullin subunit, and APC11 that contains the RING domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, the ability of the catalytic core to bind co-activators, substrates and E2 conjugating enzymes is directly impacted by MCC interactions. Although phosphorylation has been identified as an important regulator of co-activator binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fujimitsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kraft et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>), mechanisms modulating MCC binding and dissociation from the APC/C remain incompletely understood.</p><p>Sumoylation regulates a variety of essential cellular processes, including DNA replication and repair, chromatin remodeling, and mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flotho and Melchior, 2013</xref>). Analogous to the ubiquitin pathway, SUMOs are added to proteins by the sequential cascade of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. However, the catalog of SUMO pathway enzymes in vertebrates is more limited in comparison to the ubiquitin system, with a single activating E1 (expressed as the heterodimer Aos1/Uba2), a single E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) and approximately a dozen E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gareau and Lima, 2010</xref>). The SUMO pathway also includes a family of cysteine isopeptidases, known as Sentrin isopeptidases (SENPs), that remove SUMOs from substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mukhopadhyay and Dasso, 2007</xref>). Regulation at the level of deconjugation is an important axis controlling SUMO function, as demonstrated by the importance of SENP1 and SENP2 in regulating mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cubeñas-Potts et al., 2013</xref>). Although dynamic cycling between conjugation and de-conjugation can result in a relatively low steady-state level of sumoylation for most substrates, sumoylation nonetheless produces essential regulatory effects on substrate localization and function in a variety of cellular pathways.</p><p>One paradigm for SUMO function is its role as ‘molecular Velcro’ and in the generation of non-covalent interactions between proteins to facilitate protein complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jentsch and Psakhye, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matunis et al., 2006</xref>). Novel protein-protein interactions are generated between sumoylated proteins and proteins containing SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). SUMO-SIM interactions are required for the assembly of cellular structures, including PML nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shen et al., 2006</xref>), ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Finkbeiner et al., 2011</xref>) and kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Early genetic studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have also identified SUMO pathway components as essential for progression through mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biggins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meluh and Koshland, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seufert et al., 1995</xref>). Yeast sumoylation mutants result in a large budded phenotype and fail to properly degrade APC/C substrates Pds1 and Clb3, indicating an essential role for sumoylation during the metaphase-anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dieckhoff et al., 2004</xref>). Precisely how sumoylation regulates the metaphase-anaphase transition, however, has not been defined. Additional investigations in human cell lines have underscored the importance of sumoylation in early mitotic processes, including kinetochore-microtubule interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azuma et al., 2003</xref>); dharan et al., 2015), and checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ban et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Miranda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Recent proteomic studies have also identified sumoylation sites on subunits of the APC/C, suggesting possible effects of SUMO on APC/C function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cubeñas-Potts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schimmel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schou et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that the APC/C subunit APC4 is sumoylated at two C-terminal residues. We show that APC4 sumoylation peaks during mitosis and is required for timely anaphase onset that is SAC-dependent. In addition, our findings demonstrate that the APC2 subunit contains a functional SIM near the C-terminal winged-helix B (WHB) domain and in close spatial proximity to APC4 sumoylation sites. Analyses of APC4 and APC2 mutants in cultured mammalian cells are consistent with SUMO-SIM interactions between these subunits contributing to timely APC/C activation and mitotic exit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>APC4 is sumoylated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner at lysines 772 and 798</title><p>APC4 is a protein subunit at the base of the APC/C that is sumoylated in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cubeñas-Potts et al., 2015</xref>). To more precisely characterize the temporal regulation of APC4 sumoylation during the cell cycle, we synchronized HeLa cells using a double-thymidine block. After release from thymidine for varying lengths of time, cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for APC4 and the APC/C substrates Cyclin B1 and Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with a possible role in regulating APC/C activity in mitosis, APC4 sumoylation levels (evidenced by the detection of a prominent high-molecular-mass protein band migrating at 120 kDa) increased with entry into mitosis and peaked at a time correlating with Cyclin B1 degradation. APC4 sumoylation was further investigated using a U2OS cell line stably expressing 6xHis-SUMO2 and the parent U2OS cell line as control. Cells were synchronized in S-phase using a double-thymidine block or in mitosis using nocodazole treatment and release. Proteins were captured from cell lysates using nickel-NTA agarose and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-APC4 and SUMO2/3 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although unmodified APC4 (~97 kDa) was non-specifically purified from control and 6xHis-SUMO-2 expressing cell lysates, SUMO2-modified APC4 (~120 kDa) was uniquely identified in 6xHis-SUMO-2 expressing cells. Further supporting a function in mitosis, maximal levels of sumoylated APC4 were detected in nocodazole-arrested cells and levels decreased following exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29539.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>APC4 is sumoylated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner at two C-terminal lysines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa cells were synchronized in S-phase using a double-thymidine arrest and released for varying time points.

These APC4 consensus sites are conserved across mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To characterize APC4 sumoylation and modification at K772 and K798, we expressed wild type and mutant variants of APC4 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine. Translation products were incubated in reactions containing recombinant SUMO E1 activating and E2 conjugating enzymes and SUMO2 for varying lengths of time and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In reactions containing wild-type APC4, we observed two prominent high-molecular-mass bands of 120 and 135 kDa, consistent with sumoylation at two sites. In reactions containing APC4 with single amino acid substitutions at either K772A or K798A, a single high-molecular-mass band of 120 kDa was observed, whereas sumoylation was abolished in reactions containing the K772A/798A double mutant. Of note, lysine 798 was more efficiently modified relative to lysine 772. Reactions were also performed in the presence of recombinant SUMO1 with comparable results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, our findings are consistent with previous mass spectrometry studies indicating that APC4 is sumoylated at two C-terminal lysine residues at positions 772 and 798.</p><p>To characterize sumoylation of APC4 in vivo, we generated stable HeLa cell lines allowing for inducible expression of FLAG-tagged, wild-type APC4 or a K772/798R mutant, hereafter referred to as APC4 and APC4<sup>KR</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These cells also constitutively expressed yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged histone H2B to facilitate live cell imaging. To investigate APC4 sumoylation using these cell lines, we depleted endogenous APC4 using siRNAs directed against the 3’ UTR and induced expression of the FLAG-tagged transgenes to near endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). APC4 was immunopurified from cell lysates using FLAG-specific antibodies and immunoblot analysis was performed using APC4- or SUMO2/3-specific antibodies. Two SUMO2/3-modified protein bands were detected at 120 and 135 kDa in immunopurifications from wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), but not in immunopurifications from cells expressing APC4<sup>KR</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We also evaluated sumoylation by SUMO1 with comparable results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These findings confirm that K772 and K798 are the major APC4 sumoylation sites in vivo.</p><p>We also explored the regulation of APC4 sumoylation by SUMO isopeptidases using siRNA-mediated depletion of SENP1 or SENP2, two isopeptidases critical for normal mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cubeñas-Potts et al., 2013</xref>). SENP1 or SENP2 were depleted using siRNAs as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cubeñas-Potts et al., 2013</xref>), and cells were synchronized at metaphase using a nocodazole block followed by a 2 hr release into medium containing the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates revealed that APC4 sumoylation is specifically enhanced in SENP1-depleted cells compared to control or SENP2-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), implicating SENP1 as a regulator of APC4 sumoylation in mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sumoylation of APC4 is required for timely metaphase-anaphase transition</title><p>As a subunit of the APC/C, APC4 is predicted to be essential for normal cell cycle progression.

Cells were depleted of endogenous APC4 by siRNA-mediated knockdown and APC4 or APC4<sup>KR</sup> transgenes were concomitantly induced for 48 hr. Progression through mitosis was analyzed after 16 hr of timelapse acquisition beginning with nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) and ending with anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Notably, expression of the APC4<sup>KR</sup> mutant was not fully effective in rescuing the APC4 knockdown defects, in comparison to full rescue by APC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C–E</xref>). In particular, analysis revealed that cells expressing APC4 or APC4<sup>KR</sup> did not have statistically significant differences (p=0.38) in the time from NEBD to metaphase, but exhibited significant differences (p&lt;0.0001) in the time between metaphase and anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). On average, APC4-expressing cells spent ~23 min from metaphase to anaphase and APC4<sup>KR</sup> cells spent ~86 min. Despite the observed delay, APC4<sup>KR</sup> expressing cells ultimately progressed to anaphase and exited mitosis.</p><p>We also characterized the effects of individual APC4 consensus sumoylation site mutations on mitotic progression by analysis of inducible cell lines expressing K772R or K798R APC4 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1 B and C</xref>). Cells were depleted of endogenous APC4 using siRNA and FLAG-APC4<sup>772R</sup> (APC4<sup>772R</sup>) or FLAG-APC4<sup>798R</sup> (APC4<sup>798R</sup>) expression was induced using doxycycline for 48 hr prior to timelapse acquisition (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">3</xref>). Most notably, APC4<sup>K772R</sup> and APC4<sup>K798R</sup> expressing cells exhibited metaphase-anaphase delays that were intermediate to APC4<sup>KR</sup> double-mutant expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). On average, APC4<sup>772R</sup> cells took ~40 min to transition from metaphase to anaphase onset and APC4<sup>798R</sup> took ~65 min, compared to ~86 min in APC4<sup>KR</sup> double-mutant expressing cells and ~26 min in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). Thus, sumoylation at a single site is sufficient (798 &gt; 772) to partially restore APC4 function.</p><p>To explore the molecular basis of the metaphase-anaphase delay observed in APC4<sup>KR</sup> expressing cells, we monitored the degradation of the APC/C substrates, Cyclin B1 and Cdc20. Following depletion of endogenous APC4 and induction of APC4 or APC4<sup>KR</sup>, cells were synchronized using a double-thymidine block and released into drug-free medium. In APC4-expressing cells, APC4 sumoylation peaked concomitantly with declines in Cyclin B1 and Cdc20 protein levels, beginning at ~12 hr following thymidine release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As expected, APC4 sumoylation was not observed in APC4<sup>KR</sup>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In addition, the turnover of Cyclin B1 and Cdc20 protein levels was delayed compared to APC4-expressing cells. Specifically, in APC4-expressing cells, Cyclin B1 levels were reduced to 50% of peak levels approximately 12.5 hr following thymidine release, while in APC4<sup>KR</sup> expressing cells levels were reduced to 50% after 13.5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). Thus, the delay in anaphase onset detected in APC4<sup>KR</sup>-expressing cells correlates with a delay in the turnover of APC/C-dependent target proteins. Taken together, our findings suggest that APC4 sumoylation is required for timely APC/C activation or optimal function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Fusion of SUMO to APC4<sup>KR</sup> rescues the metaphase-anaphase delay</title><p>Having established that a defect in APC4 sumoylation affects timely anaphase onset, we next sought to investigate the consequences of constitutive APC4 sumoylation.

Time course analysis revealed no measurable differences between control and APC4<sup>KR-S2</sup>-expressing cells.

To explore this further, we monitored the effect of either weakening or abrogating SAC signaling by treating cells with low and high doses of reversine, an inhibitor of the Mps1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santaguida et al., 2010</xref>). Cells were depleted of endogenous APC4, and APC4 and APC4<sup>KR</sup> transgenes were induced for 48 hr followed by treatment with either 1 µM or 50 nM reversine (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video4">4</xref>). Progression through mitosis, beginning with NEBD to anaphase onset, was analyzed after 4 hr of timelapse acquisition.

Thus, SAC abrogation eliminated the metaphase delay observed in APC4<sup>KR</sup>-expressing cells and APC/C activity appeared to be similar in both APC4 and APC4<sup>KR</sup>-expressing cells in the absence of the SAC. In contrast, weakening the SAC by treatment with a low dose of reversine elicited unique effects on APC4 and APC4<sup>KR</sup>-expressing cells. Whereas the time in mitosis was significantly shortened in APC4-expressing cells treated with 50 nM reversine (from ~49 min in control to 35 min in treated), no significant effect was observed on mitotic progression in APC4<sup>KR</sup>-expressing cells, which continued to exhibit a marked delay in the metaphase-anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–H</xref>).

Here, we have shown that sumoylation of the APC4 subunit of the APC/C is required for optimal timing of the metaphase-anaphase transition. We have identified sumoylation sites in the C-terminus of APC4 and a SIM in the cullin-homology domain of APC2 that are both critical for timely APC/C activation and mitotic exit. Although multiple mechanisms may explain the effects of APC4 sumoylation on APC/C function, we favor a model in which interactions between sumoylated APC4 and the SIM in APC2 stabilize a conformation of the catalytic core that relieves inhibition and facilitates E2 binding and substrate ubiquitylation in vivo.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>APC4 sumoylation regulates the metaphase-anaphase transition</title><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that sumoylation of APC4 is required for timely APC/C activation and mitotic exit. First, cells expressing sumoylation deficient APC4<sup>KR</sup> underwent normal progression from NEBD to metaphase plate alignment, but exhibited delays during the metaphase-anaphase transition, accompanied by delays in Cyclin B1 degradation. Second, mimicking constitutive APC4 sumoylation through expression of a APC4<sup>KR</sup>-SUMO2 fusion protein (APC4<sup>KR-S2</sup>) rescued the metaphase delay observed in APC4<sup>KR</sup> cells. Notably, expression of APC4<sup>KR-S2</sup> had no adverse effects on progression through mitosis, revealing that APC4 sumoylation alone is insufficient to promote premature mitotic exit. This observation suggests that the functional consequences of APC4 sumoylation on APC/C are only manifested following satisfaction of other essential regulatory steps, possibly including checkpoint silencing and other post-translational protein modifications on APC/C.</p><p>With regard to checkpoint silencing, our findings revealed that the effect of APC4 sumoylation functions through the SAC. This was evidenced both by the relief of any metaphase delay in cells expressing APC4<sup>KR</sup> cultured in the presence of high doses of reversine, as well as an insensitivity to low doses of reversine treatment. Analysis of SAC protein localization in mitotic cells indicated that checkpoint signaling by kinetochores is appropriately regulated in APC4<sup>KR</sup>-expressing cells, suggesting that APC4 sumoylation functions downstream of SAC silencing at kinetochores. Exactly how APC4 sumoylation regulates APC/C function, however, remains to be fully understood. We were unable to detect a direct effect of APC4 sumoylation on APC/C activity toward securin using in vitro assays both in the absence and presence of inhibitory MCC complexes. However, it is important to note that these assays were performed using APC/C complexes purified from nocodazole-arrested cells which may not fully replicate conditions at the metaphase-anaphase transition. As noted above, the consequences of APC4 sumoylation on APC/C in vivo appear to require satisfaction of other essential regulatory steps affecting APC/C activation. Of possible significance, the APC2 SIM is phosphorylated at residues 732, 736 and 738 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alfieri et al., 2017</xref>) and can be predicted to enhance SUMO binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stehmeier and Muller, 2009</xref>). The timing and consequence of phosphorylation of these residues has not been explored and will be important to investigate in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Effects of APC4 sumoylation</title><p>Delays in the metaphase-anaphase transition like those observed in APC4<sup>KR</sup>, APC2<sup>SM</sup>, and APC4<sup>KR</sup>-SUMO2<sup>QFI</sup> expressing cells are unusual and have only been observed in a limited number of cases. Deletion of the spindle and kinetochore-associated (Ska) complex, for example, results in a related anaphase delay. It has been proposed that the Ska complex promotes APC/C localization to chromosomes with the effect of stimulating Cyclin B1 and securin degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sivakumar et al., 2014</xref>). Although we detected no major defects in APC/C localization to kinetochores in APC4<sup>KR</sup>-expressing cells, it is possible that the chromosome association of APC/C may also be influenced by sumoylation of APC4 specifically by one of the known chromosome-associated SUMO E3 ligases, RanBP2/Nup358 or PIASγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dawlaty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ryu et al., 2010</xref>). Further studies are required to establish whether such a connection exists. Additionally, mutations that inactivate Ube2S, the ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme responsible for elongating K11-linked polyubiquitin chains on APC/C substrates, also lead to delays in anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williamson et al., 2009</xref>). This defect is due in part to inefficient turnover of inhibitory MCC complexes and is checkpoint dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Also of interest, depletion of the APC15 subunit of the APC/C results in a similar metaphase-anaphase delay observed in APC4<sup>KR</sup> and APC4<sup>SM</sup>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foster and Morgan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uzunova et al., 2012</xref>). APC15 is not essential for ubiquitylation of CyclinB1 or securin by the APC/C, but instead facilitates turnover of bound MCC complexes mediated in part through auto-ubiquitylation of Cdc20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uzunova et al., 2012</xref>). Cryo-EM analyses of APC/C complexes bound to MCC reveal that APC15 is central to structural changes involved in conversion of the catalytic core from a closed to an open conformation. In the closed conformation, APC/C is fully inhibited from binding both substrates and the E2 conjugating enzyme UbcH10. In the open conformation, a shift in the MCC complex relieves interactions between the WHB domain of APC2 and BubR1, thereby enabling UbcH10 binding and Cdc20 auto-ubiquitylation. Depletion of APC15 blocks transition to the open conformation and delays progression into anaphase, implying that one mechanism for SAC silencing involves regulation of the closed to open conformation of APC/C and Cdc20 auto-ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>). Mechanisms affecting the transition between closed and open conformations, however, remain unknown.</p><p>Based on the proximity of the SIM in APC2 to the WHB domain, it is tempting to speculate that APC4 sumoylation functions to affect timely anaphase onset at least in part by promoting the transition of APC/C from the closed to open conformation, resulting in permissive E2 binding. Both the APC4 sumoylation sites and the SIM are located within domains that are disordered in currently available structures. Sumoylation could stabilize these flexible domains and a configuration of the WHB domain that facilitates MCC turnover and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). There is precedence for ubiquitin-like modifications influencing the activity of canonical cullin-RING E3 ligases. Specifically, neddylation of the WHB domains of cullins releases the RING domain of Rbx1 from conformational constraints and thereby enhances catalysis and substrate ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duda et al., 2008</xref>). Because neddylation of APC2 has yet to be described, it is especially intriguing that sumoylation may also influence APC/C activity by affecting the conformation of the catalytic core through effects on the WHB domain.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29539.028</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A model for SUMO-mediated enhancement of APC/C activity involving APC4 sumoylation and APC2 SUMO binding.</title><p>SUMO, conjugated to C-terminal lysines in APC4, is proposed to interact with a SIM near the WHB domain of APC2 and stabilize a conformation of the catalytic core that facilitates either MCC turnover, E2 binding or both.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29539-fig9-v4"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Temporal regulation of APC4 sumoylation</title><p>APC4 sumoylation is detectable in all other stages of the cell cycle but peaks during mitosis.

Both RanBP2 and PIASγ localize to centromeres in mitosis and could similarly control APC4 sumoylation in a spatiotemporal manner. Another possible regulator of APC4 sumoylation during mitosis is the SUMO isopeptidase, SENP1. SENP1 is critical for timely progression during the metaphase-anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cubeñas-Potts et al., 2013</xref>) and our analysis indicates that APC4 is a bona fide SENP1 substrate, as SENP1 depletion results in increased levels of APC4 sumoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). It will therefore be important to further investigate how the activities of SENP1 and possible E3 ligases are coordinated to control APC4 sumoylation in mitosis. Notably, APC4 is also phosphorylated at two residues in close proximity to the C-terminal sumoylation sites (serines 777 and 779) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Previous evidence for phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gareau and Lima, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hietakangas et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that APC4 sumoylation may also be under the regulatory control of mitotic kinases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Broader implications and conclusions</title><p>Sumoylation is required for the assembly and activities of many cellular structures including ribosomes, PML nuclear bodies, DNA repair foci and kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Finkbeiner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jentsch and Psakhye, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matunis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In many of these structures, sumoylation functions to promote assembly of protein complexes by facilitating interactions through covalent modification and non-covalent SIM binding. In contrast to these examples, our discovery of SUMO-SIM regulation of the APC/C suggest that sumoylation can also function to modulate the intermolecular interactions and functions of a pre-assembled molecular machine.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that both covalent sumoylation and non-covalent SUMO-SIM interactions play important roles in regulating APC/C function and mitotic exit. Although a precise molecular mechanism remains to be determined, we favor a model in which APC4 sumoylation stabilizes a conformation of the catalytic core that facilitates activation and substrate ubiquitylation. A formal test of this model will benefit from further functional studies and structural analysis of sumoylated APC/C. Notably, inhibitors of the SUMO pathway are currently being developed for chemotherapeutic use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">He et al., 2017</xref>), and our studies provide molecular insights into how these inhibitors may function to disrupt cell division.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and cell lines</title><p>The coding sequence for APC4 was PCR-amplified from pENTR221 ANAPC4 (Ultimate Human ORF Collection, HiT Center, Johns Hopkins University) into pJET 1.2 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The linear SUMO2 fusion (without the C-terminal di-glycine) was PCR-amplified and inserted in frame to the C-terminus of APC4 in the vector above. APC2 was sub-cloned into the pCITE vector from a plasmid (a gift from Hongtao Yu, UT Southwestern). Single N-terminal FLAG tags were inserted using PCR-amplified sequences.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Andrea Musacchio (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Lee and co-workers investigate the role of the ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO in controlling the activity of the anaphase promoting complex (APC/C), an essential regulator of cell division. The authors initially validate previously published proteomics data by demonstrating that the APC4 subunit is modified by SUMO at K772 and 798. By using an siRNA-depletion and complementation approach they show that cells expressing a SUMOylation-deficient APC4 mutant (APC4 2KR) exhibit a metaphase to anaphase delay. This phenotype could be rescued by linearly fusing SUMO2 to APC4 2KR supporting the idea that SUMO2 conjugation to APC4 indeed regulates APC activity and proper mitotic progression. In subsequent experiments the authors rule out an involvement of the SAC in this process, but propose that SUMO-mediated binding of APC4 to a SIM in APC2 stimulates APC activity. This model is based on available structural data and the observation that APC2 binds to SUMO via a C-terminal SIM region. Moreover, when expressed in cells in the absence of endogenous APC2 the SIM mutant of APC2 recapitulates the phenotype observed in cells expressing APC2 KR. Based on their findings the authors propose that APC4 SUMOylation stabilizes a conformation that of APC2 that is optimal for E2 enzyme UbcH10 thereby facilitating substrate modification. Altogether this work provides substantial evidence that APC/C activity is controlled by the SUMO system thus expanding previous observations made in lower eukaryotes. In principle, this is an important and significant finding. However, to support publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the major experiments described below will have to be performed to strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to strengthen their evidence showing that APC4 is indeed SUMOylated, and that this SUMO-modification is regulated during the cell cycle. The Western blots in Figure 1 are not sufficient to support this important claim, but instead APC4-IPs and anti-SUMO Westerns, or better, denaturing HIS-SUMO purifications during cell cycle time course would be required.</p><p>2) The analysis of in vitro-ubiquitylation activity by the APC/C +/- APC4-SUMOylation needs to be significantly improved (Figure 4). This is a major weakness of the current manuscript. The authors need to compare WT-APC4 with APC4-KR2, and they need to provide quantitative information to the extent of APC/C-stimulation by APC4-SUMOylation. Their low APC/C activity is likely caused by incomplete incorporation of APC4-FLAG into the APC/C, and thus, they either need to integrate a SUMO-tag after the APC4-locus using CRISPR/Cas9, or ensure that FLAG-APC4 is purified only in the context of complete APC/C (for example, by sequential IPs).</p><p>3) The authors need to improve their data on showing that APC4 SUMOylation and APC2-SIM function are connected.

The Western blots in Figure 1 are not sufficient to support this important claim, but instead APC4-IPs and anti-SUMO Westerns, or better, denaturing HIS-SUMO purifications during cell cycle time course would be required.</p></disp-quote><p>It was suggested that more conclusive evidence was required to demonstrate that APC4 is indeed sumoylated and that sumoylation is regulated during the cell cycle. We have produced several lines of evidence demonstrating the sumoylation of APC4. First, we have previously published immunopurification and western blotting data showing the modification of endogenous APC4 by both SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 (Cubeñas-Potts et al., 2015). In addition, immunopurifications of Flag-tagged wild type and mutant APC4 and anti-SUMO westerns are included in Figures 1F-G and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C of the current study. As recommended, we also now demonstrate more conclusively that APC4 sumoylation is cell cycle regulated by including His-SUMO purification and time course analysis in the newly added Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The analysis of in vitro-ubiquitylation activity by the APC/C +/- APC4-SUMOylation needs to be significantly improved (Figure 4). This is a major weakness of the current manuscript. The authors need to compare WT-APC4 with APC4-KR2, and they need to provide quantitative information to the extent of APC/C-stimulation by APC4-SUMOylation. Their low APC/C activity is likely caused by incomplete incorporation of APC4-FLAG into the APC/C, and thus, they either need to integrate a SUMO-tag after the APC4-locus using CRISPR/Cas9, or ensure that FLAG-APC4 is purified only in the context of complete APC/C (for example, by sequential IPs).</p></disp-quote><p>It was felt that in vitro ubiquitylation activity assays represented a major weakness of the original submission and needed to be significantly improved. We have attempted to address this concern using multiple approaches. As suggested, we attempted sequential IPs and activity assays using our established cell lines expressing Flag-tagged wild type and mutant APC4 but were unable to overcome technical challenges using this approach. We were also unable to establish tagged APC4 cell lines using CRSPR/Cas9. We therefore turned to activity assays using APC/C complexes immunopurified from nocodazole-arrested cells and subsequently sumoylated in vitro prior to analysis. As documented by immunoblotting with APC4 and SUMO specific antibodies, APC4 was efficiently and uniquely modified under our reaction conditions (new Figures 4J-O). Using securin as substrate, we were nonetheless unable to detect any differences in ubiquitylation activity between control APC/C complexes with unmodified APC4 and complexes containing fully sumoylated APC4 (new Figure 4I). We also investigated the ability of APC4 sumoylation to affect MCC binding and inhibition of APC/C activity but again detected no differences in comparison to unmodified APC/C complexes (new Figure 4L).</p><p>These new findings have been incorporated into the revised manuscript. Interpretations and possible caveats are presented in the Discussion and take into account multiple and complimentary lines of in vivo evidence supporting an important role for APC4 sumoylation in affecting APC/C activation or activity. Although the precise mechanism by which APC4 sumoylation affects APC/C remains to be determined, we hope the reviewers agree that our findings are important and provide a valuable foundation for future biochemical and structural studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to improve their data on showing that APC4 SUMOylation and APC2-SIM function are connected.

As recommended, we investigated whether fusing a SUMO mutant defective in SIM binding to APC4<sup>KR</sup> would rescue mitotic defects of APC4<sup>KR</sup> expressing cells. As illustrated in new Figure 8, SIM recognition by SUMO fused to APC4<sup>KR</sup> is required for rescue of mitotic defects, demonstrating that SUMO-SIM interactions are indeed critical for the effect of sumoylation on APC/C.</p></body></sub-article></article>
