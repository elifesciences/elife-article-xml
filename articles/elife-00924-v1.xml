We showed previously that adult forebrain stem cell function declines during aging because of increased expression of <italic>let-7</italic> microRNAs, evolutionarily conserved heterochronic genes that reduce HMGA2 expression. Here we asked whether <italic>let-7</italic> targets also regulate changes between fetal and adult stem cells. We found a second <italic>let-7</italic> target, the RNA binding protein IMP1, that is expressed by fetal, but not adult, neural stem cells. IMP1 expression was promoted by Wnt signaling and Lin28a expression and opposed by <italic>let-7</italic> microRNAs. <italic>Imp1</italic>-deficient neural stem cells were prematurely depleted in the dorsal telencephalon due to accelerated differentiation, impairing pallial expansion. IMP1 post-transcriptionally inhibited the expression of differentiation-associated genes while promoting the expression of self-renewal genes, including <italic>Hmga2</italic>. A network of heterochronic gene products including Lin28a, <italic>let-7</italic>, IMP1, and HMGA2 thus regulates temporal changes in stem cell properties.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00924.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00924.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00924.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stem cells are found throughout the body, and play key roles in promoting tissue growth during fetal development, and in maintaining tissues in the adult. When stem cells divide, they can either give rise to more stem cells, or they can generate specialized cells required for tissue function. However, the properties of stem cells must change over time to match the changing growth and regeneration demands of tissues.</p><p>A previous study by Nishino et al. has shown that expression of a micro RNA molecule called <italic>let-7</italic> increases throughout adulthood, and this reduces the activity of stem cells in older animals. Now, Nishino et al. report that <italic>let-7</italic>, and other genes it regulates, also control the dramatic changes that occur in the properties of stem cells between fetal development and adulthood. Whereas stem cells in the fetal forebrain undergo rapid division and are capable of generating many different cell types, stem cells in the adult forebrain divide less often and can generate only a few specific types of cell. While Nishino et al. performed their study on stem cells in the brain, their results are likely to apply also to stem cells in other tissues.</p><p>Nishino et al. show that <italic>let-7</italic> regulates the production of an RNA binding protein called IMP1. Mice with stem cells that lack IMP1 have a smaller cerebral cortex than normal mice because their stem cells undergo fewer rounds of division before committing to become brain cells. Additional experiments revealed that IMP1 inhibits the expression of genes that trigger stem cells to commit to specific fates and promotes the expression of genes related to self-renewal.</p><p>These results indicate that the gene that encodes IMP1 is expressed in fetal neural stem cells, but not in adult neural stem cells, and that the reduced production of this protein contributes to the developmental switch from highly proliferative neural stem cells in the fetus to the more quiescent stem cells found in adults. Further studies are likely to identify many more targets of <italic>let-7</italic> that enable stem cells to adapt their properties to the changing needs of the organism over time.</p><p>These results are interesting because let-7-regulated networks were first discovered based on their ability to regulate the timing of developmental transitions in worms. This suggests that the mechanisms employed by mammalian tissue stem cells to regulate changes in their properties over time, are at least partly evolutionarily conserved mechanisms inherited from invertebrates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00924.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00924.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>heterochronic gene</kwd><kwd>cortical development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 AG024945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS40750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A set of genes that are turned on only within time-limited windows—including genes encoding RNA binding molecules, <italic>let-7</italic> microRNAs and IMP1—control developmental switches in stem cell properties between fetal development and adulthood.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cell properties change throughout life in many tissues in response to changing growth and regeneration demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2009</xref>). These changes are particularly evident in the central nervous system (CNS) forebrain, where neural stem cells persist throughout life. During fetal development rapidly dividing neural stem cells expand in number before differentiating in precisely defined temporal windows, first to form neurons and then to form glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Salomoni and Calegari, 2010</xref>). Largely quiescent neural stem cells persist into adulthood in the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ) as well as in the dentate gyrus, where they give rise to new interneurons throughout adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Buylla and Lim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). However, the rate of neurogenesis, the frequency of stem cells, and their rate of proliferation all decline with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuhn et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enwere et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maslov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Molofsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonaguidi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Encinas et al., 2011</xref>). A fundamental question concerns the mechanisms that control these temporal changes in stem cell properties.</p><p>The declines in SVZ proliferation, stem cell self-renewal potential, and neurogenesis during aging are regulated by a pathway that includes <italic>let-7</italic> microRNAs, the chromatin-associated HMGA2 high mobility group protein, and the p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor: <italic>let-7b</italic> expression increases with age, reducing Hmga2 expression and increasing p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nishino et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>Ink4a</italic></sup> deficiency or overexpression of a <italic>let-7</italic> insensitive form of <italic>Hmga2</italic> partially rescues the declines in neural stem cell function and neurogenesis in aging mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Molofsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nishino et al., 2008</xref>).

However, it is unclear why Wnt signaling expands the number of neural stem cells during development but only maintains declining numbers of stem cells during adulthood.</p><p>Here we report that <italic>Imp1</italic> is expressed in fetal neural stem/progenitor cells as a consequence of Wnt signaling but that its expression declines in late fetal development, partly as a consequence of increasing <italic>let-7</italic> microRNA expression. <italic>Imp1</italic> promoted the expansion of fetal neural stem cells and <italic>Imp1</italic> deficiency reduced brain mass. IMP1 bound to a number of mRNAs, post-transcriptionally promoting the expression of gene products that promote self-renewal, including <italic>Hmga2</italic>, and inhibiting the expression of gene products involved in differentiation. Our findings demonstrate a novel role for IMP1 in the expansion of fetal neural stem cells and suggest that the perinatal loss of IMP1 expression is part of the mechanism that allows Wnt signaling to promote the expansion of fetal stem cells. More broadly, our results demonstrate that a network of heterochronic genes regulates temporal changes in stem cell function throughout life.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Imp1</italic> is expressed by stem/progenitor cells in the pallial region of the telencephalon</title><p>We examined <italic>Imp1</italic> expression by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) in CNS stem/progenitor cells from the embryonic day (E)12.5 dorsal telencephalon, E14.5 dorsal telencephalon, postnatal day (P)0 lateral ventricle ventricular zone (VZ), and P30 lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ). <italic>Imp1</italic> expression was high at E12.5 but declined over 100-fold by P0 and was no longer detected in the P30 SVZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Nonetheless, our data indicate that IMP1 cell-autonomously regulates neural stem cell function in the dorsal telencephalon. First, neural stem cell specific knockdown of <italic>Imp1</italic> in a small percentage of cells in the developing telencephalon reduced cell proliferation and accelerated differentiation in a cell autonomous way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) .Second, all of our experiments demonstrating neural stem/progenitor cell phenotypes in <italic>Imp1</italic> deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2F–I and 4</xref>), <italic>Lin28 transgenic</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–I</xref>) or <italic>ilet-7</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>) involved studies of individual isolated neural stem cells in culture. Third, in all of our experiments that involved viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7 fig8">Figures 6E–F, 7K, 8L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>), we compared the growth of infected neurospheres to non-infected neurospheres growing in the same cultures, or in control cultures. We never observed non-cell autonomous effects of infected neurospheres on non-infected neurospheres within the same cultures. Finally, we observed a correlation between <italic>Imp1</italic> expression and function within the telencephalon: the phenotypes observed in <italic>Imp1</italic> deficient mice were consistently more profound in the dorsomedial telencephalon, where <italic>Imp1</italic> expression was high, than in the dorsolateral telencephalon, where <italic>Imp1</italic> expression was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2E and 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 3 min, washed three times with PBS plus 0.1 μg/ml cycloheximide, and then lysed on ice for 15 min in polysome extraction solution (10 mM Tris [7.4], 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> ,0.3M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml heparin [Sigma]) plus 0.1 μg/ml cycloheximide. After clearing cell debris by centrifugation, small aliquots of lysates were saved as input controls and the rest were loaded on top of a 10–50% sucrose gradient in polysome extraction buffer plus 0.1 μg/ml cycloheximide, and spun down at 4°C at 35,000 rpm for 190 min in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter). After ultracentrifugation, fractions were taken serially from the top (10% sucrose) to the bottom (50% sucrose). Each fraction was divided into half and either saved in Trizol (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction or subjected to methanol/chloroform protein extraction. To assess the shift of ribosomal proteins, parallel cultures were processed in solutions that contain 30 mM EDTA instead of cycloheximide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Genotyping of mice</title><p>Genotyping was performed by PCR following the manufacturer’s instructions using Go Taq Flexi DNA polymerase (Promega) for <italic>Imp1</italic>, <italic>Lin28a</italic>, <italic>let-7</italic>, <italic>Hmga2</italic>, and <italic>let-7b/c2</italic> mutant mice and Choice-Taq DNA Polymerase (Denville Scientific Inc.

E18.5 is a time-point where the severe growth defects could have already affected the NSCs non-cell autonomously before isolation, perhaps due to a systemic reduction in IGF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2004</xref>). Given that WT <italic>Imp1</italic> expression is highest at E12.5, but nearly extinguished in the WT brain by E17.5, one might have expected that defects would have been more likely in the early rather than the late neurospheres. The fact that you only observed NSC defects at E18.5 in <italic>Imp1βgeo/βgeo</italic> mice, in vitro and in vivo throughout the manuscript, leaves open the possibility that the effects could be completely explained by non-cell autonomous effects. In order to prove cell-autonomy, neural-specific deletion of a floxed <italic>Imp1</italic> allele would be required. If you can undertake these experiments, this would strengthen your conclusions. If this experiment does not work, you would have to modify your claim of cell-autonomy.

The first important point is that although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> showed that neurospheres had self-renewal defects at E18.5 and not at E12.5, this should not be taken to mean that neurospheres did not exhibit defects prior to E18.5. We simply had not tested cultured neurospheres at intermediate time points because we focused our analyses on more definitive in vivo experiments at the intermediate time points. To address this we performed two experiments in which we examined the frequency and self-renewal of multipotent neurospheres cultured from E15.5 <italic>Imp1</italic> deficient and control telencephalon. We observed declines in the frequency and self-renewal of <italic>Imp1</italic> deficient neurospheres in both experiments. We have added these new data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>.</p><p>The second important point is that <italic>Imp1</italic> does continue to be expressed within stem cells from the dorsomedial telencephalon through E18.5. Its expression is extinguished neonatally. The manuscript shows IMP1 expression in the VZ of the dorsal telencephalon at E14.5, E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) and in neurospheres cultured from the E18.5 dorsomedial telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). As requested, we have also summarized the expression pattern and the anatomy schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>The third important point is that it is not accurate that we only observed NSC defects at E18.5 in the <italic>Imp1βgeo/βgeo</italic> mice. A number of figures in our manuscript show that we observed significant neural stem cell defects in vivo beginning at E12.5. These defects were associated with significant changes in the numbers of Tbr2+ progenitors beginning at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), the numbers of TuJ1+ neurons beginning at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the number of Pax6+ stem cells beginning at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the frequency of dividing cells beginning at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and the cortical surface length beginning at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The in vivo data demonstrate evidence of premature stem cell differentiation in vivo beginning at E12.5 and continuing throughout fetal development. There is no disconnect between the timing of <italic>Imp1</italic> expression in these cells and the timing with which premature differentiation is observed in vivo.</p><p>We believe that certain phenotypes were not observed until E16.5 or E18.5 because loss of IMP1 function causes neural stem cells to prematurely differentiate first into Tbr2+ intermediate progenitors (first detected at E12.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and then into neurons (first detected at E12.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and glia (first detected at E18.5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Since Tbr2+ intermediate progenitors are themselves dividing, this delays the onset of defects in proliferation and cortical growth, which were not observed until E16.5.</p><p>Unfortunately, nobody has ever made a floxed allele of <italic>Imp1</italic>, making it impossible for us to conditionally delete in neural stem cells. To address this we have instead injected virus bearing an shRNA against <italic>Imp1</italic> into the forebrain of fetal mice developing in utero. We confirmed that this shRNA profoundly reduced <italic>Imp1</italic> expression in cultured neurospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). By transilluminating the uterus we were able to inject virus into the E12.5–E14.5 telencephalic ventricle, infecting a small minority of stem cells in the dorsal telencephalon. At E15.5–E17.5, we compared Ki67, Pax6, Tbr2, and Tuj1 staining by cells infected (GFP+) with the <italic>Imp1</italic> shRNA versus a control scrambled shRNA. Cells infected with the <italic>Imp1</italic> shRNA were significantly less likely to express Pax6 or Ki67 and significantly more likely to express Tbr2 or Tuj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). This demonstrates that IMP1 acts cell autonomously within stem cells in the dorsal telencephalon to promote the maintenance of an undifferentiated state.</p><p>We agree that IMP1 is likely to have a mix of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects on the growth of other tissues. We have acknowledged this in our manuscript; however, all of our data are consistent with cell-autonomous effects in the dorsal telencephalon.</p></body></sub-article></article>
