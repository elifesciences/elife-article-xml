crucial region involved in respiratory control, particularly in generating active expiration through an expiratory oscillatory network. Active expiration involves rhythmic abdominal (ABD) muscle contractions during late-expiration, increasing ventilation during elevated respiratory demands. The precise anatomical location of the expiratory oscillator within the ventral medulla’s rostro-caudal axis is debated. While some studies point to the caudal tip of the facial nucleus (VIIc) as the oscillator’s core, others suggest more rostral areas. Our study employed bicuculline (a γ-aminobutyric acid type A [GABA-A] receptor antagonist) injections at various pFL sites (–0.2 mm to +0.8 mm from VIIc) to investigate the impact of GABAergic disinhibition on respiration. These injections consistently elicited ABD recruitment, but the response strength varied along the rostro-caudal zone. Remarkably, the most robust and enduring changes in tidal volume, minute ventilation, and combined respiratory responses occurred at more rostral pFL locations (+0.6/+0.8 mm from VIIc). Multivariate analysis of the respiratory cycle further differentiated between locations, revealing the core site for active expiration generation with this experimental approach. Our study advances our understanding of neural mechanisms governing active expiration and emphasizes the significance of investigating the rostral pFL region.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>active expiration</kwd><kwd>abdominal activity</kwd><kwd>multivariate analysis</kwd><kwd>bicuculline</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>lateral parafacial</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>388717</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pagliardini</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-02926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dickson</surname><given-names>Clayton T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pisanski</surname><given-names>Annette</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multivariate analysis of respiratory cycle shows that GABAergic disinhibition in the rostral regions of the lateral parafacial area is linked to the most significant and enduring changes in active expiration.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neural control of respiration is a complex physiological process that requires precise coordination among multiple brainstem nuclei. One such nucleus, the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), plays a crucial role in generating the inspiratory rhythm and pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gray et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the lateral parafacial area (pFL), also referred to as pFRG in the initial studies, has emerged as an important brainstem structure containing neurons that are responsible for the generation of active expiration via the recruitment of expiratory musculature, such as the abdominal (ABD) muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pisanski and Pagliardini, 2019</xref>). Although the involvement of preBötC in respiration as well as its origin, anatomical location, markers, and anatomical projections has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biancardi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gray et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yackle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang and Feldman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), the expiratory oscillator remains a challenging structure to locate accurately due to the absence of a definite anatomical marker and the lack of its activation during experimental resting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). Understanding the precise location and functional properties of the expiratory oscillator is crucial for unraveling the complete neural circuitry underlying respiratory control.</p><p>Previous research has employed a variety of tools to study and elucidate this expiratory oscillator that include pharmacological disinhibition and excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Britto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korsak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zoccal et al., 2018</xref>), as well as chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pisanski et al., 2020</xref>). The coordinates used for the latter studies considered the core of the expiratory oscillator proximal to the caudal tip of the facial nucleus (VIIc) (–0.2 mm to +0.5 mm from VIIc). Interestingly, the use of chemogenetics to inhibit pFL at the level of the caudal tip of the facial nucleus (–0.3 mm to +0.3 mm from VIIc) partially inhibited the putative expiratory muscle output, with ABD recruitment still occurring naturally during sleep, albeit at a diminished rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pisanski et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, chemogenetic inhibition of pFL at +0.5 mm from VIIc decreased the intensity of the ABD signals obtained in response to bicuculline/strychnine injections, but did not silence it entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>). Although both of these elegant chemogenetic studies have extensively contributed to our understanding of the pFL, the existing evidence suggests that the expiratory oscillator may expand beyond the limits of the viral expression achieved in said studies, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>. Intriguingly, other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silva et al., 2019</xref>) located its core at more rostral coordinates (+0.3 mm to +1.0 mm from VIIc). This dichotomy in the coordinates used to study the functional properties of the expiratory oscillator demonstrates that the characterization of the anatomical and functional boundaries of pFL are incomplete.</p><p>To address this gap, we used focal injections of bicuculline along different rostro-caudal locations of the brainstem as a tool to create a functional map of the pFL. Bicuculline, a competitive antagonist of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors, has been widely employed to study neuronal excitability and functional circuitry in various brain regions, including the pFL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). By strategically administering localized volumes of bicuculline at multiple rostro-caudal levels of the ventral brainstem, we aimed to selectively enhance the excitability of neurons driving active expiration, thereby revealing the extension of the pharmacological response and the most efficient site in generating active expiration. Because all the locations studied have been previously shown to produce active expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silva et al., 2019</xref>), we conducted a more holistic analysis of all the respiratory changes induced by bicuculline injections. This analysis included traditional respiratory measures such as tidal volume, minute ventilation, respiratory rate, and oxygen metabolism on top of the ABD changes induced by active expiration. Additionally, using a novel multidimensional cycle-by-cycle analysis specifically developed for this study, we characterized the effect that bicuculline elicited on the different phases of the respiratory cycle at each injection site, as the differences in area under the curve (AUC) of the airflow, ∫DIA EMG, and ∫ABD EMG, as well as the combined differences of these three respiratory signals using a novel phase-plane analysis. This approach enabled us to construct a comprehensive functional map of the pFL in conjunction with anatomical immunostaining techniques.</p><p>Our results indicate that the injection of bicuculline produced active expiration at all locations studied (–0.2 mm to +0.8 mm from VIIc). However, the strongest effects in terms of changes in tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>), minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) and differences in combined respiratory signals were observed at the two most rostral locations (+0.6 mm and +0.8 mm). Similarly, ABD activation lasted longer at these sites and the swiftest onset of the ABD response was observed at the +0.6 mm location. Interestingly, our multivariate analysis of the respiratory cycle permitted further differentiation of the response elicited in the two rostral locations, with the strongest deformations of the respiratory loop during late-expiration (late-E) and post-inspiration (post-I) with injections at the +0.8 mm locations, whereas injections at the level of +0.6 mm producing more pronounced deformations of the respiratory cycle during the inspiratory phase. The use of the multidimensional trajectory map will certainly enhance our understanding of the role that the expiratory oscillator plays in respiratory control. Additionally, it will provide a crucial foundation for future investigations into its modulation, plasticity, and potential therapeutic targets for respiratory disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental subjects</title><p>Thirty-five adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 340.4 g±13.2 were used for the study.

All experimental procedures followed the guidelines set by the Canadian Council of Animal Care and received approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of the University of Alberta (AUP#461).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Surgical preparation</title><p>Prior to the experiment, the rats were initially anesthetized using 5% isoflurane in air for induction, followed by 1–3% isoflurane for maintaining a surgical plane of anesthesia. During this time, we cannulated the femoral vein to facilitate the gradual administration of urethane (1.5–1.7 g/kg body weight) for inducing permanent and irreversible anesthesia. We assessed the depth of anesthesia by monitoring the absence of the withdrawal reflex. We cannulated the trachea and used a flow head connected to a transducer (DP10310N154D, GM Instruments, UK) to detect respiratory flow using a carrier demodulator (CD15, Validyne Engineering, CA, USA). We provided supplemental oxygen (30%) throughout the experiment and connected a gas analyzer (ML 206-1704, ADInstruments, CO, USA) to the tracheal tube. The gas analyzer measured fractional concentration of O<sub>2</sub>. Based on this and the flow rate at the level of the trachea (minute ventilation), we calculated O<sub>2</sub> consumption according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Depocas and Hart, 1957</xref>. Paired electromyogram (EMG) wire electrodes (AS633, Cooner Wire, CA, USA) were inserted into the oblique ABD and diaphragm (DIA) muscles. The wires were connected to differential amplifiers (model 1700, AM Systems, WA, USA), and we sampled the activity at a rate of 1 kHz using the Powerlab 16/30 system (ML880, ADInstruments, CO, USA). We performed vagotomy by resecting a 2 mm portion of the vagus nerve at the mid-cervical level, and the rats’ body temperature was maintained at a constant level of 37±1°C using a servo-controlled heating pad (55-7022, Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA).

We then collected, postfixed, cryoprotected, and sectioned the brains in a cryostat (CM1950, Leica, Germany) to obtain 30 µm thick transverse slices. To prepare the brain tissue for immunohistochemistry, we washed the brain sections multiple times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the cryoprotectant solution (15% sucrose, 15% ethyleneglycol, 0.5% PVP-40 in 0.5X-PBS). All immunostaining procedures were conducted at room temperature. We incubated the sections in a blocking solution (0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% normal donkey serum [NDS] in PBS) for 1 hr to enhance membrane permeability to antibodies and minimize nonspecific binding. After blocking, we incubated the tissue overnight with the primary antibody solution, which consisted of PBS, 1% NDS, and 0.3% Triton X-100. In order to identify specific brain structures relevant to this study, we used the following primary antibodies: anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; goat; 1:800; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_20797">AB_20797</ext-link>, EMD Millipore, ON, Canada), anti-PHOX2B (PHOX2B; mouse; 1:100; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2813765">AB_2813765</ext-link>, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX, USA), anti-cFos (cFos; rabbit; 1:500; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2247211">AB_2247211</ext-link>, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA), and anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; chicken; 1:800; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_570923">AB_570923</ext-link>, EMD Millipore, ON, Canada).

Following the incubation with the secondary antibodies, we washed the sections three times and mounted them with Fluorsave mounting medium (345789-20 ML, EMD Millipore, ON, Canada). We observed the slides under an Evos FL fluorescent microscope (AMF4300, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and acquired TIFF files for cell counting and analysis of the rostro-caudal, mediolateral, and dorsoventral coordinates of the injection sites using ImageJ. We examined serial sections with a 120 µm interval, spanning from 400 µm caudal to 1000 µm rostral to the caudal tip of the facial nucleus (VIIc). To group the animals according to the location of the injections, we calculated a 3D distance from the VIIc using the rostro-caudal, mediolateral, and dorsoventral coordinates of each injection site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Data acquisition and analysis</title><p>EMG signals were amplified at ×10,000 and filtered between 300 Hz and 1 kHz (model 1700, AM Systems, WA, USA).

The tidal volume was obtained by integrating the airflow amplitude and converting it to milliliters using a five-point calibration curve (0.5–5 ml range). The coupling between ABD and DIA signals was measured as a ratio and analyzed by quantifying the number of bursts of activity observed for the ABD and DIA EMG signals during the first 10 min of the response, excluding time bins at end of the response (due to fading and waning of the ABD activity in those instances). The ABD delay was calculated as the time between the end of the second injection and the beginning of the ABD response (negative values mean that the response started following the first injection before the second injection occurred). Whereas ABD duration was calculated by measuring the time between the first and the last ABD burst elicited by bicuculline.</p><p>Airflow and integrated EMG signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) were standardized across rats by first zeroing signals in the rest period phases between breaths as recorded during baseline conditions and then converting the remaining amplitude values into standard deviation units (SD) based on a time-collapsed amplitude distribution. Baseline data was averaged over a period of 5 min. Experimental data was tracked in time bins of 2 min duration from the baseline period prior to injections and spanned 20 min of recording post-injection. Mean-cycle measurements for each signal were computed by averaging across all cycles within a given time bin (~300 cycles in baseline, ~100 cycles per response time bin). We then used the average calculations of respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>), minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>), expiratory ABD amplitude, expiratory ABD area, VO<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>E</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> to obtain values relative to the baseline period. Peak responses were identified as the time bin that produced the strongest changes relative to baseline. To assess the changes within each of the phases of the breathing cycle, each mean-cycle was subdivided into the late-E, inspiratory, post-I, and resting phases using the zero-crossings of the mean airflow signal (green lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The inspiratory phase begins with an inward (positive going) intake of air as airflow increases above zero and ends when airflow crosses zero toward the negative direction. This negative going deflection begins the post-I phase, which lasts until airflow returns to zero during the rest period. The late-E phase is defined in two ways. In cases where a significant negative deflection in airflow was observed previous to inspiration, the late-E phase was determined to have begun when airflow decreased below zero and ended when airflow crossed back above zero to begin the subsequent inspiratory phase. When airflow did not decrease below zero prior to inspiration, as was often the case during baseline conditions, the late-E phase was determined as the last quarter of the expiratory period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The AUC was measured during baseline and was subtracted from the corresponding AUC of the response for each time bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This AUC measure was computed as the sum of the signal in a given respiratory phase as all signals were sampled at the same rate. Note that areas calculated below the zero (0) line, as would be expected from a negative airflow during expiration, yields negative AUC values. Any changes to the duration of the three respiratory phases, as well as changes to the entire respiratory period, were independently assessed using the triggers described above.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Measures used in quantifying respiratory responses to bicuculline injections.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The time course of raw, and integrated electromyogram (EMG) signals relative to recorded airflow during a sample breath.

In a manner similar to respiratory pressure-volume loops, each point in time is defined as a dot in this 3D space based on the three simultaneous physiological measurements of respiration we recorded (airflow, together with the ∫DIA EMG, and ∫ABD EMG). Each respiratory cycle could then be plotted as a trajectory of points in this space, represented as a loop. Example loops for the baseline and the first 2 min time bin of the elicited response are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and are also projected onto separate 2D planes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. Our approach was to measure how the trajectories of response loops changed relative to the baseline loop during each phase of the respiratory cycle, as per the color scheme (same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Given these loops may be deformed as a result of changes to any one of the three signals which form the basis of this 3D space, this method determines the <italic>total</italic> extent to which breathing is altered in response to stimulation. We quantified changes to respiratory trajectories elicited by bicuculline injection using the sum of the ‘straight-line’ or ‘Euclidean’ distances between points on the response and baseline loops in each respiratory phase. An example of the Euclidean distance between the peak of inspiration in baseline and response loops is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> (pink line). To compute this distance for all timepoints, we resampled the response to ensure that that baseline and response mean-cycles had the same number of comparison phase points in a given respiratory phase.

Thus, this measure can be interpreted as having units of standard deviation, as it describes how likely it is to observe the response given the distribution of baseline measurements gathered across many respiratory cycles. This measure is known as the Mahalanobis distance and is exemplified as the pink distance relative to the black cloud of points in the baseline mean-cycle of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>.

In a similar manner, increases in the ∫ABD EMG at the two most rostral locations (+0.6 mm: purple, +0.8 mm: orange) differed relative to those elicited by control injections and at the most caudal injection site from 8 min to 14 min post-injection (–0.2 mm: red) (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(5) = 20.81, p&lt;0.001, Dunn: +0.6 mm: p&lt;0.001; +0.8 mm: p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) with the +0.8 mm group remaining elevated at 16 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 13.56, p=0.009, Dunn: +0.8: p=0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, our results in the late-E phase demonstrate that the rostral regions of the ventral medulla are the most sensitive to bicuculline-induced increases in expiratory airflow, presumably elicited via a prominent activation of ABD activity.</p><p>For the inspiratory phase, bicuculline injections evoked strong increases in the respiratory airflow, which were strongest in the most rostral locations (+0.6 mm, +0.8 mm) and relatively weaker in more caudal locations (–0.2 mm). Inspiratory airflow in the +0.6 location increased relative to control injections for timepoints extending from 2 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(<italic>4</italic>) = 13.25, p=0.021, Dunn: p&lt;0.001) to 12 min post-injection (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 14.58, p=0.012, Dunn: p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, we also observed increases in the airflow of the +0.6 mm location when compared to the +0.4 mm group, from 10 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 10.50, p=0.033, Dunn: p=0.004) to 12 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(5) = 10.93, p=0.027, Dunn: p=0.003) post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Contributions of the ABD muscle to the respiratory changes during inspiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, inspiratory phase) were determined to be negligible as the raw ABD EMG is not active during this phase and the remaining signal in the ∫ABD EMG can be accounted for by exponential decay induced by the integration algorithm used to pre-process these signals (see Methods section). These results illustrate that the increases in inspiratory airflow evoked by bicuculline injections are stronger when targeting more rostral injection locations. However, these changes are relatively weak and, on average, remain altered for a shorter period of time relative to the effects noted above for the late-E phase.</p><p>Negative deflections in the airflow signal during the post-I phase were observed in several responses and were most pronounced in the two most rostral injection groups consistent with the results above (purple and orange, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Bicuculline injections into the most rostral group (+0.8 mm: orange) evoked substantial increases in ∫ABD EMG activity during the post-I phase which were elevated during the 6 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 10.37, p=0.035, Dunn: p=0.002) and 16 min time bins (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 9.52, p=0.049, Dunn: p=0.001) when compared to injections into the most caudal group (–0.2 mm). These effects were unlikely to be related to any changes in the DIA signal, as the DIA muscle activity was quiescent during the post-I period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and the ∫DIA EMG is contaminated by the pre-processing as noted above for the ABD muscle during inspiration (see Methods section).</p><p>Altogether, the AUC analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that airflow is substantially altered in all three phases of the respiratory cycle and the ABD muscle is strongly activated in several groups in the late-E and post-I periods with injections of bicuculline along the pFL axis. Importantly, these effects are stronger when targeting the rostral areas of the pFL (+0.6 mm and +0.8 mm) compared to injections that target the more caudal regions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Bicuculline responses can be differentiated by the deviations of their 3D trajectories at different phases of the respiratory cycle</title><p>We next sought to determine whether responses to bicuculline injections across the rostro-caudal axis of the pFL could be more precisely differentiated from each other when combining the responses in all three recorded signals (airflow, together with ʃDIA and ʃABD EMG) evoked within the periods of late-E, inspiration, and post-I. Our approach was to represent all three signals as axes in a 3D space wherein each point corresponds to an individual timepoint during our recordings. When plotting the measurements across an entire respiratory cycle, this multidimensional representation resembles a looped trajectory as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> for cycles recorded during the baseline and post-injection periods. Indeed, each phase of the cycle (late-E, inspiration, and post-I) could be recognized as a particular region along the 3D trajectory. Inspiration, for example, occupies the space where airflow and ∫DIA EMG are positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: red). In baseline conditions, the loop is largely confined to the plane defined by the airflow-∫DIA axes, as the ABD muscles are not activated during resting states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left). Following bicuculline injections, respiratory loops became more complex, involving marked perturbations occurring in this first plane, together with novel deformations extending along the ∫ABD EMG axis as shown in the right-hand plane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, described by airflow and the ʃABD EMG. The relative amplitudes of these complex deviations from the baseline cycle could then be used to characterize the degree of change caused by our injections across pFL sites.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–E</xref> demonstrates how the trajectories computed during the baseline (shown in black) are altered as the response evolves across each time bin spanning the full 20 min post-injection period for all injection locations. Animations of each example recording in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, along with their cycle-by-cycle variability, further clarify their 3D shape as the trajectory is rotated about the ∫DIA EMG axis (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—animations 1–5</xref>). We noted several key deformations to baseline loops including a ‘bulb’ of activation on the outermost edge of the loop during the peak of inspiration when airflow is at its maximum. These ‘bulbs’ are similarly confined to the ∫DIA EMG-airflow axis as both of these signals are involved in shaping their overall prominence. Baseline loops are also perturbed during the late-E period as a result of ∫ABD EMG-airflow activation which can be seen as ‘tails’ which extend upward in the right-most plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–E</xref>.

Compared to control injections of HEPES buffer, bicuculline evoked pronounced late-E ‘tails’, as well as inspiratory ‘bulbs’, and post-I ‘feet’ in all injection groups which lasted throughout the 20 min response, with the notable exception of the most caudal group (–0.2 mm) which returned to a baseline trajectory by 8 min post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the most rostral injections at +0.6 mm and +0.8 mm elicited the largest late-E deformations. The 3D approach applied here further differentiated the responses of these two groups, as the late-E ‘tails’ of the +0.6 mm group were longer than those observed in the –0.2 mm group early in the response from 8 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 12.22, p=0.016, Dunn: p&lt;0.001) to 12 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 12.34, p=0.015, Dunn: p=0.002), while those in the +0.8 mm group peaked later in the response and were longer than in the –0.2 mm group from 12 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 12.34, p=0.015, Dunn: p=0.001) to 16 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 10.89, p=0.028, Dunn: p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These results are consistent with the observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, which indicate that responses in the +0.6 mm group begin earlier relative to other groups. Moreover, the +0.6 mm group produced the largest deformations to the inspiratory ‘bulb’ which were greater than those in the –0.2 mm group from 8 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 12.59, p=0.013, Dunn: p&lt;0.001) to 14 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 10.27, p=0.036, Dunn: p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

To account for the impact of this variability on our quantification of trajectory deformations, we computed the mean Mahalanobis distance within the late-E, inspiratory, and post-I phases (see Methods). Our results revealed a gradient of response intensities relative to respiratory variability, with the two most rostral groups producing the strongest deformations to breathing trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Similar to our results above, these groups differed in the time course and relative strength of their responses in each phase. Injections at +0.6 mm produced more pronounced late-E ‘tails’ compared to caudal injection responses from 6 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 11.80, p=0.019, Dunn: p=0.001) for 12 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 12.24, p=0.016, Dunn: p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Late-E tails’ from the +0.8 mm group were more prominent than ‘tails’ evoked by caudal bicuculline injections for much greater proportion of the 20 min response compared to the +0.6 mm group, ranging from 6 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 11.80, p=0.019, Dunn: 0.002) to 20 min post-injection (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 11.01, p=0.026 Dunn: p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Deformations to the inspiratory ‘bulb’ relative to respiratory variability were larger in the +0.6 mm group compared to caudal responses and peaked at the 12 min time bin post-injection (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 10.63, p=0.031, Dunn: p=0.002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). In contrast, the extent of post-I ‘feet’ was greater in the +0.8 mm group than the –0.2 mm group from 6 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 11.00, p=0.027, Dunn: p=0.002) to 20 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 10.74, p=0.030, Dunn: p&lt;0.001), whereas the extent of post-I ‘feet’ in the +0.6 mm group was greater than in caudal injections only at the 8 min (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 11.65, p=0.020, Dunn: p=0.002) and 12 min time bins (KW test: <italic>H</italic>(4) = 12.23, p=0.016, Dunn: p=0.001). Thus, while response intensity in all respiratory periods was strongest in the two most rostral injection groups, overall changes in the late-E and post-I period were strongest in the +0.8 mm group, while changes in inspiration were strongest in the +0.6 mm group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, our primary aim was to investigate and quantify the extent of the rostro-caudal distribution of the source of active expiration within the pFL. To accomplish this objective, we used bicuculline, a GABA-A receptor antagonist known for its ability to disinhibit pFL cells and generate active expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silva et al., 2019</xref>). Bicuculline was administered at various rostro-caudal coordinates, and we methodically assessed the resulting respiratory responses to pinpoint the location within this region that induced the most significant and relevant changes to the respiratory cycle. Our findings offer valuable insights into the neural circuitry governing active expiration in the brainstem, with a particular focus on less-explored, more rostral areas of the pFL.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Technical considerations</title><p>Previous work has already demonstrated a temporal correlation between the onset of late-E neuron activity in the pFL and ABD activity recruitment in response to bicuculline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>), as well as the presence of GABAergic sIPSCs in late-E neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>). Since bicuculline has previously shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents inducing nonspecific potentiation of NMDA currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson and Seutin, 1997</xref>), caution should be warranted in attributing our findings solely to the effects on GABAergic disinhibition as activation of late-E neurons and active expiration may also be triggered by these secondary pharmacological effects of bicuculline.</p><p>Our experiments focused on determining the area in the pFL that is most effective in generating active expiration as measured by ABD EMG activity and expiratory flow.

Future studies involving multi-unit recordings or imaging of cell population activities will help to determine the firing pattern and population density of bicuculline-activated cells and further determine differences in distribution and function of late-E neurons across the region of the pFL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Histological analysis</title><p>We adopted a stereological approach to identify the central region of the injection sites by visualizing sections containing fluorobeads. Experimental subjects were categorized based on the proximity of the injection sites, spanning from –0.2 mm to +0.8 mm from VIIc. We took measures to ensure that injections were positioned ventrolateral to the facial nucleus (VIIc) and did not overlap with PHOX2B+ cells within the more ventromedial RTN. The assessment of cellular activity, quantified through cFos staining, unveiled the existence of basal activity in control rats, that is likely emanating from subthreshold physiological processes within the pFL which do not culminate in ABD activity. Analysis of the cFos staining confirmed focal activation of neurons in the pFL of rats injected with bicuculline and minimal cFos expression in the PHOX2B+ cells in all groups as compared to the control group. These results confirm the very limited mediolateral spread of the drug from the core site of injection and support previous findings, suggesting that the majority of PHOX2B+ cells are more ventrally located in the ventral pFL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>) and that PHOX2B+ cell recruitment is not necessary for active expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Characteristics of ABD signals</title><p>At rest, respiratory activity does not present with active expiration (i.e. expiratory flow below its functional residual capacity in conjunction with expiratory-related ABD muscle recruitment) and expiratory flow occurs due to passive recoil of chest wall with little to no contribution of ABD muscle activity.

Although never assessed in freely moving, unanesthetized rodents, bicuculline has been extensively used to generate active expiration and late-E neuron activity in both juvenile and adult anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korsak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>). Our efforts successfully elicited expiratory ABD responses and active expiration at all tested injection sites, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Britto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korsak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zoccal et al., 2018</xref>). Previous work has primarily examined the core of pFL at locations ranging from –0.2 mm to +1.0 mm from the caudal tip of the facial nucleus, a range similar to the one explored in the current study (–0.2 mm to +0.8 mm from VIIc). However, it is important to note that those studies have traditionally used the presence or absence of active expiration in response to a stimulus as the only measure to assess active expiration. Our study reveals that all locations within that range in which injections were made exhibited active expiration with various intensities. Consequently, we employed a combination of diverse respiratory measures to assess the injection site that induced the most robust respiratory effect.</p><p>Remarkably, the ABD response was consistently generated at locations rostral to VIIc, aligning with previous observations that did not find a reliable triggering of the ABD response at caudal positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). This response was characterized by a late-E component at all rostro-caudal locations and, in the most rostral groups, an additional post-I component that was absent in the injections at more caudal locations. Although the configuration of the ABD response, whether late-E only, post-I, or a combination of the two, has not been extensively discussed in the literature, these distinctions may provide valuable insights into the involvement of distinct neuronal circuits within the pFL and in connection with other structures of the respiratory network in mediating the ABD response. For example, sample traces from the injection of bicuculline/strychnine from 0 mm to +1.0 mm from VIIc with 4–5% CO<sub>2</sub> exposure exhibited a tonic ABD response throughout the entire expiratory phase (without post-I or late-E peaks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silva et al., 2019</xref>), whereas sample traces from injections spanning from –0.2 mm to +0.4 mm from VIIc seemed to indicate a combination of tonic and late-E ABD responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the latter studies also observed tonic increases in ABD EMG (without a late-E peak), but only during baseline conditions and not in response to drug injection. In our study, we also observed a post-I ABD activation that only appeared at the most rostral locations. This post-I peak was previously observed in neonate rats during ABD activation occurring throughout apneic periods induced by systemic fentanyl injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janczewski et al., 2002</xref>). A similar biphasic pattern (late-E/post-I) was also observed in facial nerve recordings of in vitro preparations and associated with neuronal activity in the pFL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Onimaru and Homma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Onimaru et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, although it has previously been described, the exact mechanism by which this post-I activity in the ABD muscles is generated is currently unknown . For example, the interplay between the rostral pFL and brainstem structures generating post-I activity, such as the proposed post-I oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>) or pontine respiratory networks, could be reasonably involved in this process. The presence of these unique responses featured at different rostro-caudal locations suggests a complex interplay among neural populations within the ventral medulla, necessitating further investigation beyond the scope of the present study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Temporal dynamics of the ABD response reveal a longer-lasting and shorter latency response at rostral locations</title><p>The temporal dynamics of the ABD response exhibited significant variations along the rostro-caudal axis. Responses at rostral locations displayed prolonged durations and stronger coupling with DIA signals compared to caudal locations. Previous research employing bicuculline injections to induce active expiration have reported an increase in the coupling between ABD and DIA signals at +0.1 mm to +0.3 mm from VIIc in juvenile rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>). Similarly, we observed good coupling at locations rostral to +0.1 mm from VIIc. Such coupling has been documented in other studies as an indicator of the robustness of the ABD response, either during hypercapnia/sleep or chemogenetic modulation during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leirão et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pisanski and Pagliardini, 2019</xref>). Therefore, in our study, we used it as a measure of the strength of the achieved activation of active expiration. Additionally, prior studies have indicated that the duration of effects induced by bicuculine/strychnine injections ranges from 16 min to 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silva et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies did not specify whether there were disparities in the duration of ABD responses along the rostro-caudal axis. In our study, we have conclusively established that there are indeed variations in the robustness (as denoted by ABD/DIA coupling) and duration of the ABD responses, with the more rostral locations yielding the most potent responses in this regard. Importantly, the group with injection sites at +0.6 mm from VIIc exhibited the swiftest response onset, suggesting that this area is the most critical for the generation of active expiration, either through direct activation of the expiratory oscillator or, alternatively, for providing a strong tonic drive to late-E neurons located elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Bicuculline injection elicited stronger respiratory effects at rostral locations in pFL</title><p>Bicuculline injections induced significant alterations in a number of respiratory parameters, reminiscent of previous studies exploring the effects of bicuculline/strychnine injections in the ventral medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silva et al., 2019</xref>).

However, in the most rostral locations in our study, the respiratory frequency remained unchanged. This dichotomy in the frequency response despite the presence of ABD recruitment in both cases may suggest that the slowing of the respiratory period in the most caudal locations may be a consequence of disinhibition of the adjacent Bötzinger complex. Additional evidence to support this view is that the nadir of respiratory frequency was achieved at increasing periods of time as the injections were located increasingly more rostrally, with the most caudal injection reaching the minimum respiratory frequency at 2 min post-injection, while at the most rostral injection site, the minimum respiratory frequency was observed at 6 min.</p><p>On the other hand, V<sub>T</sub> increased by 16–29% in all the studied locations except –0.2 mm, similar to what was observed previously with activation of pFL at locations ranging from –0.2 mm to +0.4 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boutin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). However, minute ventilation increased above baseline at the +0.6 mm location in our study, whereas it decreased at the most caudal location and remained unchanged in the rest of the sites. These results are in agreement with previous observations, where V<sub>E</sub> remained unchanged at caudal locations after bicuculline injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). However, it is important to highlight the absence of studies that have measured V<sub>T</sub> and V<sub>E</sub> after eliciting active expiration at more rostral locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silva et al., 2019</xref>).

This method confirmed that the two most rostral injection sites elicited the most robust activation of ABD activity and induced the most significant alterations in expiratory airflow during both the late-E and post-I phases. Similarly, during the inspiratory phase, rostral injections generated the most pronounced changes in inspiratory airflow and DIA activity – particularly when positioned +0.6 mm from the VIIc. These findings align with the observed increases in tidal volume depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref> at those specific locations.

Our final goal was to develop an algorithm which could accurately represent the complete ‘framework’ of respiratory activation across each recorded signal with respect to each these phases. To this end, we introduced another novel analysis method that tracked the multivariate changes occurring throughout the respiratory cycle. We revealed a number of features of the respiratory cycle including late-E ‘tails’, inspiratory ‘bulbs’, and post-I ‘feet’ that allowed us to characterize alterations that are specifically relevant to active expiration. Given that this analysis is designed to maintain a consistent representation across conditions within experiments, these features can be catalogued into a ‘framework’ of the breathing cycle during both baseline and post-injection conditions. Thus, this method is both sensitive to subtle changes in the activations of each component signal, but also more importantly, it is highly robust to the variability inherent in the acquisition of respiratory physiological measurements in vivo.</p><p>By quantifying the respiratory cycle in terms of 3D measures of distance, we discriminated between the rostral and caudally evoked responses, as well as between the two most rostral locations which were previously undetected in the standard analyses. Our findings were consistent with the other analyses applied here with regard to the larger extent of respiratory loop distortions in the two most rostral positions in comparison to the more caudal injections. Furthermore, it was observed that injections in the most rostral group produced the highest amplitude changes to the late-E ‘tails’, as well as the longest late-E ‘tails’ and post-I ‘feet’. Conversely, the most prominent inspiratory ‘bulbs’ were observed in the +0.6 mm group, aligning with the most substantial changes in V<sub>T</sub> observed in our single dimension analysis.</p><p>Collectively, these results imply that while the combined effects of bicuculline injection on the respiratory cycle were most pronounced at the two most rostral positions, there were slight variations in the effects exhibited during each respiratory phase at this level of the ventral medulla. These nuanced effects may suggest differences in the functional characteristics, phenotypes, and projections of cell populations at these specific coordinates. It is worth noting that the pFL neurons responsible for active expiration are typically quiescent in adults at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>), making their phenotypic and functional characterization challenging. Recent work started investigating electrophysiological characteristics of late-E neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>). However, these observations were made in neurons situated closer to the tip of the facial nucleus in juvenile rats. It will be important to investigate now whether phenotypic and electrical properties of neurons at more rostral positions share the same identity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>pFL or RTN?</title><p>An ongoing debate centers on whether the neurons responsible for the generation of ABD recruitment are an independent oscillator composed of PHOX2B-negative, late-E firing neurons (pFL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pisanski and Pagliardini, 2019</xref>) or part of the PHOX2B+/NMB+ chemosensitive neurons of the RTN/ventral parafacial region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Souza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marina et al., 2010</xref>). While there is evidence that specific stimulation of PHOX2B+/NMB+ neurons causes ABD activity and active expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Souza et al., 2020</xref>), these studies have not shown recordings from late-E PHOX2B/NMB+ neurons in their investigations. However, there is concrete evidence of the existence of PHOX2B-negative late-E firing neurons that are activated in response to bicuculline injections in the ventral medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magalhães et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). Because our anatomical results show very little PHOX2B/cFos+ staining at injections sites rostral to +0.1 mm is fair to conclude that the ABD activity generated at that level is likely not the direct result of RTN activation or driven by PHOX2B+ neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study highlight the functional diversity of the lateral parafacial region and emphasize the strong role of the most rostral locations in generating active expiration. The use of our novel multidimensional map to assess physiological responses highlighted the functional nuances in respiratory responses to bicuculline along the pFL rostro-caudal axis, and advanced our understanding of the parafacial region.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental procedures followed the guidelines set by the Canadian Council of Animal Care and received approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of the University of Alberta (AUP#461).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-94276-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

While the neural origins of inspiration are very well understood, the neural bases for expiration lag considerably. The problem is important and new knowledge pertaining to the neural origins of expiration is welcome.</p><p>The authors perturb the parafacial lateral (pFL) respiratory group of the brainstem with microinjection of bicuculline, to elucidate how disinhibition in specific locations of the pFL influences active expiration (and breathing in general) in anesthetized rats. They provide valuable, if not definitive, evidence that the borders of the pFL appear to extend more rostrally than previously appreciated. Prior research suggests that the expiratory pFL exists at the caudal pole of the facial cranial nucleus (VIIc). Here, the authors show that its borders probably extend as much as 1 mm rostral to VIIc. The evidence is convincing albeit with caveats.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors achieve their aim in terms of showing that the borders of the expiratory pFL are not well understood at present and that it (the pFL) extends more rostrally. The results support that point. The data are strong enough to cause many respiratory neurobiologists to look at the sites rostral to the VIIc for expiratory rhythmogenic neurons and characterize their properties and mechanisms. At present my view is that most respiratory neurobiologists overlook the regions rostral to VIIc in their studies of expiratory rhythm and pattern.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The injection of bicuculline has indiscriminate effects on excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and the parafacial region is populated by excitatory neurons that are expiratory rhythmogenic and GABA and glycinergic neurons whose roles in producing active expiration are contradictory (Flor et al. J Physiol, 2020, DOI: 10.1113/JP280243). It remains unclear how the microinjections of bicuculline differentially affect all three populations. A more selective approach would be able to disinhibit the populations separately. Nevertheless, for the main point at hand, the data do suggest that we should reconsider the borders of the expiratory pFL nucleus and begin to examine its physiology up to 1 mm rostral to VIIc.</p><p>The control experiment showed that bicuculline microinjections induced cFos expression in the pFL, which is good, but again we don't know which neurons were disinhibited: glutamatergic, GABAergic, or glycinergic.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for sharing your excitement on the results of our study, and appreciating the thorough investigation performed with the use of bicuculline, an approach that was originally used in Pagliardini et al, 2011, PMID: 21414911 and then used by many other groups to generate and study active expiration in vivo.</p><p>In the current study we used the well known effect of Bicuculline to systematically test the area that is more sensitive to such a pharmacological effect, and hence may be the core for generating active expiration. While the use of GABA receptor antagonists may have an indiscriminate effect on GABA receptor expressing neurons with various phenotypes, anatomical assessment of inhibitory cells has shown very little distribution of GABAergic and glycinergic cells in the parafacial area (Tanaka et.al, 2003; PMID: 14512139) and it has been inferred in multiple publications (Huckstepp et al., 2015, PMID: 25609622; Huckstepp et al. 2016 PMID: 27300271; Huckstepp et al., 2018, PMID: 30096151; Flor et al., 2020, PMID: 32621515; Britto &amp; Moraes, 2017; PMID: 28004411; Silva et al. 2016; PMID: 26900003) and demonstrated recently (Magalhaes et al., 2021; PMID: 34510468) that late-E neurons in the parafacial region are excitatory and have a glutamatergic phenotype. We can’t exclude that a small fraction of neurons in the pFL area are inhibitory, and that they could influence recruitment of adjacent late-E expiratory neurons. A more selective activation of neuronal populations with different phenotype would be indeed interesting, nonetheless, if local inhibitory neurons have a role in the generation of active expiration, then their disinhibition could have either an inhibitory effect on late-E activity or stimulate expiration in a more indirect fashion.</p><p>While the effect of bicuculline on active expiration has been reported and replicated in multiple manuscripts, the source of inhibition across different phases of the respiratory cycle is still under investigation. Some studies suggest that GABAergic and glycinergic inhibition is not originated in pFL but rather in the BötC and preBötC areas (Flor et al., 2020, PMID: 32621515; Magalhaes et al., 2021; PMID: 34510468) and the effects of this inhibition across the respiratory cycle is debated. Future studies will be key to identify the source of pFL inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript characterizes how bicuculline microinjections affect breathing parameters such as tidal volume, frequency, ventilation, inspiratory and expiratory time, as well as oxygen consumption. Those aspects of the manuscript are a bit tedious and sometimes overanalyzed. Plus, there was no predictive framework established at the outset for how one should expect disinhibition to affect breathing parameters. In other words, if the authors are seeking to map the pFL borders, then why analyze the breathing patterns so much? Does doing so provide more insight into the borders of pFL? I did not think it was compellingly argued.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the introduction to address this comment and emphasize the rationale for the study. We also edited the results section to summarize our findings.</p><p>We continue to report our in-depth analysis of the perturbations induced by bicuculline injection over the various respiratory characteristics as this will be fundamental to determine the effects of our experiment not only on the activation of pFL and active expiration, but also on the respiratory network in general. In order to be fair and open about our findings we have reported the results of our analysis in detail. Of note, all sites generated active expiration, but since the objective of the study was to determine the sites with the most significant changes, a finer and multilevel analysis has been used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, lines 382-386 make a point about decreasing inspiratory time even though the data do not meet the statistical threshold.

I had trouble making sense of that disparity.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistics were confirmed, and the lines edited as follows: “Interestingly, the duration of inspiration during the response was found to decrease in all groups relative to baseline respiration (Ti response = 0.279 ± 0.034s, Ti baseline = 0.318 ± 0.043s, Wilcoxon rank sum: Z = 3.24, p = 0.001). Contrary to this decrease in inspiratory duration, the total expiratory time was observed to increase in all groups and remained elevated compared to baseline (TE response = 1.313 ± 0.188s, TE baseline = 1.029 ± 0.161s, Wilcoxon rank sum: Z = 4.49, p = 0.001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other statistical hiccups include &quot;tended towards significance&quot; (line 454), &quot;were found to only reach significance for a short portion of the response&quot; (line 486-7), &quot;did not reach the level of significance&quot; (line 506), which gives one the sense of cherry picking or over-analysis. Frankly, this reviewer finds the paper much more compelling when just asking whether the microinjections evoke active expiration. If yes, then the site is probably part of the pFL.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical “tendencies” have been eliminated throughout the manuscript.</p><p>We have analyzed in details our results in order to determine changes and differential effects on respiration when comparing the 5 sites of injections. Although the presentation of the results may seem tedious, it has allowed us to highlight some interesting effects: first, the effects on respiratory frequency. It has been shown in the past that optogenetic stimulation of this area causes an increase in respiratory frequency (Pagliardini et al., 2011, PMID: 21414911), whereas a dishinibition with this same approach or stimulation of AMPAreceptor in pFL have shown a reduction in frequency or not a significant change in the response (Pagliardini et al., 2011, PMID: 21414911; Huckstepp et al., 2015, PMID: 25609622; Huckstepp et al. 2016 PMID: 27300271; Huckstepp et al., 2018, PMID: 30096151). Here, we suggest that the reduction in respiratory frequency is observed only in the caudal sites and could be attributed to BötC effects rather than the stimulation of the core of the pFL since no respiratory change was observe where the effect was more potent (rostral side). Another interesting point was the effects on O2 consumption, although difficult to interpret at this point, we found very interesting that hyperventilation occurred only at the most rostral injection sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I encourage the authors to consider the fickleness of p-values in general and urge them to consider not just p but also effect size.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the feedback on our description of the statistical results and the suggestion of incorporating effect size.

Stereotactic injections of bicuculline were utilized to map various pFL sites and their impact on respiration. The results indicate that injections at more rostral pFL locations induce the most robust changes in tidal volume, minute ventilation, and combined respiratory responses. The study indicates that the rostrocaudal organization of the pFL and its influence on breathing is not simple and uniform.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The data provide novel insights into the importance of rostral locations in controlling active expiration. The authors use innovative analytic methods to characterize the respiratory effects of bicuculline injections into various areas of the pFL.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Bicuculline injections increase the excitability of neurons. Aside from blocking GABA receptors, bicuculline also inhibits calcium-activated potassium currents and potentiates NMDA current, thus insights into the role of GABAergic inhibition are limited.</p><p>Increasing the excitability of neurons provides little insights into the activity pattern and function of the activated neurons. Without recording from the activated neurons, it is impossible to know whether an effect on active expiration or any other respiratory phase is caused by bicuculline acting on rhythmogenic neurons or tonic neurons that modulate respiration. While this approach is inappropriate to study the functional extent of the conditional &quot;oscillator&quot; for active expiration, it provides valuable insights into this region's complex role in controlling breathing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a reflection of the weaknesses of our studies in the technical consideration section to address the possibility that bicuculline may induce active expiration through other mechanisms. Please note that the use of bicuculline was not to gain further insight on GABAergic inhibition of pFL but to adopt a tool to generate active expiration that has been extensively validated by our group and others.</p><p>Multiple studies have shown recruitment of excitatory late expiratory neurons with bicuculline injections. Although we did not record from late-E neurons in this study, we infer from the body of literature that disinhibition of neurons in this area will activate late-E neurons (as previously demonstrated) and generate active expiration. Although we see value in recording activity of single neurons (especially to study mechanisms of rhythmogenesis), we opted to measure the physiological response from respiratory muscles as an indication of active expiration recruitment <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recording from single neurons after bicuculline injections in each site would confirm the presence of expiratory neurons along the parafacial area, which is probably not surprising, since every site tested promoted active expiration. The focus of the study though was to determine the site with the strongest physiological response to disinhibition. Future studies will be key to determine whether all neurons along this column have similar electrophysiological rhythmic properties to the ones recently reported (Magalhaes et al., 2021; PMID: 34510468), or some of them simply provide tonic drive to late-E neurons located elsewhere.</p><p>We have discussed the issue as follows:</p><p>“Our experiments focused on determining the area in the pFL that is most effective in generating active expiration as measured by ABD EMG activity and expiratory flow. We did not attempt to record single cell neuronal activity at various locations as previously shown in other studies (Pagliardini et al 2011; Magalhaes et al., 2021), as this approach would most likely find some late-E neurons across the pFL and thus not effectively discriminate between areas of the pFL. Future studies involving multi-unit recordings or imaging of cell population activities will help to determine the firing pattern and population density of bicuculline-activated cells and further determine differences in distribution and function of late-E neurons across the region of the pFL.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, the manuscript addresses an important question in the field, the anatomical location of the expiratory oscillator.

The authors mention that bicuculline injections elicited a late-E downward inflection that was absent in baseline conditions. Thus, this raises the point of how these findings compare to awake freely moving animals or during different conditions of increased ventilatory demand.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that has not yet been address in the field. As far as we know, there are no recordings of pFL neurons in freely behaving animals although recordings of pFL late-E neurons under elevated PaCO2 have shown a late-E activity in in situ preparations (Britto &amp; Moraes, 2017; PMID: 28004411; Magalhaes et al., 2021; PMID: 34510468).</p><p>We have clarified this in the discussion as follows:</p><p>“At rest, respiratory activity does not present with active expiration (i.e, expiratory flow below its functional residual capacity in conjunction with expiratory-related ABD muscle recruitment) and expiratory flow occurs due to passive recoil of chest wall with no contribution of abdominal activity. Active expiration and abdominal recruitment can be spontaneously observed during sleep (in particular REM sleep, Andrews and Pagliardini, 2015; Pisanski et al., 2019) and can be triggered during increased respiratory drive (e.g. Hypercapnia, RTN stimulation, Abbott et al., 2011). Although never assessed in freely moving, unanesthetized rodents, bicuculline has been extensively used to generate active expiration and late-E neuron activity in both juvenile and adult anesthetized rats (Pagliardini et al., 2011; Huckstepp et al., 2015 Huckstepp et al., 2016; Huckstepp et al., 2018; De Britto and Moraes, 2017; Magalhaes et al., 2021). “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 2A, there appears to be an injection site in the top right quadrant of the image, very distant from the intended site.

The precise location of this expiratory oscillator within the ventral medulla remains uncertain, with some studies indicating that the caudal tip of the facial nucleus (VIIc) forms the core while others propose more rostral areas. Bicuculline injections were utilized at various pFL sites to explore the impact of these injections on respiration. The authors use innovative and impressive analytic methods to characterize the effect on respiratory activity. The results indicate that injections at more rostral pFL locations induce the most robust changes in tidal volume, minute ventilation, and combined respiratory responses. The study will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the neural mechanisms controlling active expiration. The main message of the study is that the rostro-caudal organization of the pFL is not simple and uniform. The data provides novel insights into the importance of rostral locations in controlling active expiration (see e.g. lines 738-740).</p><p>The data and results of the paper are intriguing, and it appears that the experiments are well-managed and executed. However, there are several major and minor comments and suggestions that should be addressed by the authors:</p><p>(1) The study relies heavily on local injections into specific areas that are confirmed histologically. One potential concern is the injection volume of 200 nL in such a tiny area. The authors suggest that the drug did not spread to rostral/caudal areas outside the specified coordinate partly based on their cFOS staining. For example, the lack of cFOS activation in TH+ cells and Phox2B cells is interpreted as proof that bicuculline did not spread to these somas (Figure 2). The authors seem to use a similar argument as evidence that the pFL does not include Phox2B neurons in the RTN as discussed in the Discussion section (lines 830-847). However, it is very surprising that bicuculline injections into an area that is known to contain Phox2B and Th+ neurons do not activate these neurons as assessed by the cFOS staining. It seems puzzling to me that none of their injections shown in Figure 2 activated Phox2B or Th neurons. I assume that in targeting the pFL the authors must have sometimes hit areas that included neurons that define the RTN, which would have activated Phox2B or Th+ neurons. Did the authors find that these activations did not activate active expiration? Such negative &quot;controls&quot; would strengthen their argument that pFL is a separate and distinct region that selectively controls active expiration.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the positive feedback on the manuscript. As it has been demonstrated and discussed in several previous publications, PHOX2B expressing neurons in this area of the brain are part of the RTN Neuromedin B positive neurons (more densely located in the ventral paraFacial rather than the lateral parafacial, our site of injection), the TH+ C1 neurons (located in a somewhat more caudal and medial position compared to our sites of injection, around the BötC/ preBötC area) and the large Facial MN (easily identifiable by their large size and compact location). Given this differential spatial distribution, and the controls described below, we believe we have reduced the possibility of the direct activation of these neurons, although we can’t exclude it in full.</p><p>There is now strong evidence about lack of PHOX2B expression in late E neuron in juvenile and adult rats (Magalhaes et al., 2021; PMID: 34510468). We realize that the microinjected solution could potentially diffuse in the brain and hit other areas, but we combined two strategies to verify our intention for a focal injection activating only a restricted area of the brain (i.e., the pFL): (i) localization of fluorobeads that were diluted in the Bicuculline solution; (ii) expression of cFos combined with anatomical markers, to identify activated cells. Fluorobeads have a very limited spread in the brain and therefore informed us of the site of the injection to differentiate between the five injections locations. Although we can’t assume that Bicuculline will have a similar spread (and it will also be quickly degraded in the tissue), the combination of this analysis with the localized expression of cFos cells has helped us to differentiate between injections site. Because of the proximity of PHOX2B cells in RTN and C1 neurons, we also combined cFos expression with immunohistochemistry to determine whether bicuculline activation was also visible in these two neuronal populations. Our results indicate that there is baseline cfos activity in RTN neurons (see vehicle injection) but the fraction of PHOX2B activated cells did not increase with bicuculline injections suggesting that these neurons were not the target of our injections. Please note that cfos expression has been extensively used to determine RTN neuron activation, especially following chemoreflex responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors refer to &quot;the expiratory oscillator&quot; throughout the manuscript (e.g. lines 58, 62, 65) as if there is only one expiratory oscillator i.e. &quot;the expiratory oscillator&quot;. For some reason, the authors avoided citing and mentioning PiCo (Anderson et al. 2016), which is considered the oscillator for postinspiration. Since the present study focuses on the role of expiration, and since the authors describe convincing effects on postinspiration, considering this oscillator which is located dorsomedial to the VRC seems relevant for the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the limited and controversial literature that is currently present describing Pico as a third oscillator and the fact that our studies do not directly assess the post-inspiratory activity (as measure by the V nerve or laryngeal muscles) or Pico activity and location (which would be even more distant than the RTN, for example), we prefer to avoid commenting on the effects of this injection on Pico or the connectivity between Pico and pFL.</p><p>We have added this to the discussion:</p><p>“Therefore, although it has previously been described, it is currently unknown the exact mechanism by which this post-I activity in the ABD muscles is generated. For example the interplay between the rostral pFL and brainstem structures generating post-inspiratory activity, such as the proposed post-inspiratory oscillator (PiCo; Anderson et al., 2016) or pontine respiratory networks, could be reasonably involved in this process.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors do not specify what type of bicuculline they injected. Bicuculline is known to have significant effects on potassium channels. Thus, the effects reported here could be due to a non-specific change in excitability, rather than caused by a specific GABAergic blockade.</p><p>The authors also do not know what effects these injections cause in the neurons in vivo, since the injections are not accompanied by recordings from the respiratory neurons that they activate. This together with the non-specific bicuculline effects will affect the interpretation of the results. Thus, the authors need to be more careful when interpreting their effects as &quot;GABAergic&quot;. The use of more specific blockers like gabazine could partly address this concern. The authors have to discuss this in a &quot;limitation section&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing that out, we have now clarified in the methods section that we used bicuculline methochloride. We can’t exclude that some side- effects could be present due to the use of this drug. For the purpose of this study though, we focused on using bicuculline as a tool to consistently generate active expiration since it has been extensively used by multiple laboratories to induce abdominal muscle recruitment and active expiration, as well as to directly record late-E neurons in this same area.</p><p>We have included in the discussion the following statement:</p><p>“Technical considerations</p><p>Bicuculline methiodide has previously been observed to exhibit inhibitory effects on Ca2+ activated K+ currents inducing non-specific potentiation of NMDA currents (Johnson and Seutin, 1997). Consequently, caution is warranted in attributing our findings solely to the GABAa antagonist properties of bicuculline. Previous work has demonstrated a temporal correlation between the onset of late-E neuron activity in the caudal parafacial region and ABD activity in response to bicuculline (Pagliardini et al., 2011; de Britto and Moraes, 2017; Magalhaes et al., 2021) as well as GABAergic sIPSCs in late-E neurons (Magalhaes et al., 2012). However, it is essential to note that the current study lacks single unit recording, preventing us from definitively confirming whether the observed activity stems from late-E neuronal GABAergic dishinibition or excitation through non GABAergic mechanisms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I also caution the authors when stating that the bicuculline injections will reveal the precise location and functional boundaries of &quot;the&quot; expiratory oscillation within the pFL. Increasing the excitability with bicuculline is inappropriate to study the functional boundaries of an oscillator. It is particularly inappropriate to identify the boundaries of the pFL, a network that is normally inactive and activated only under certain behavioral and metabolic conditions. Because the injections are increasing the neuronal excitability unspecifically, and because the authors are not recording the activity of the neurons in the pFL region it is unclear what kind of neurons are activated. The cFOS staining may help to define whether these neurons are Phox2B or Th positive or negative, but they will not provide insights into the activity patterns of the activated neurons. Thus, it is fair to assume that these injections will likely include also tonic neurons that might indirectly control the activity of pFL neurons under certain metabolic or behavioral conditions without actually being involved in the rhythmogenesis of active expiration. Many of the effects peak after several minutes, and different regions cause differential effects with different time courses, which is difficult to interpret functionally. Thus, the &quot;core&quot; identified in the present study could consist of tonic neurons as opposed to rhythmic neurons generating active expiration.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our local injections may have activated an heterogeneous population of neurons. We do not claim that we only activated late-E rhythmogenic neurons but that our multiple sites of injections revealed the area that is generating the strongest excitation of ABD muscles and active expiration.</p><p>While the use of GABA receptor antagonists may have an indiscriminate effect on GABA receptor expressing neurons with various phenotypes, anatomical assessment of inhibitory cells has shown very little distribution of GABAergic and glycinergic cells in the parafacial area (Tanaka et.al, 2003; PMID: 14512139) and it has been inferred in multiple publications (Huckstepp et al., 2015, PMID: 25609622; Huckstepp et al. 2016 PMID: 27300271; Huckstepp et al., 2018, PMID: 30096151; Flor et al., 2020, PMID: 32621515; Britto &amp; Moraes, 2017; PMID: 28004411; Silva et al. 2016; PMID: 26900003) and demonstrated recently (Magalhaes et al., 2021; PMID: 34510468) that late-E neurons in the parafacial region are excitatory and have a glutamatergic phenotype</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, it is possible that the bicuculline injection may have activated some tonic non rhythmogenic neurons which could activate the expiratory oscillator located elsewhere.</p><p>We have edited the introduction as follows:</p><p>“By strategically administering localized volumes of bicuculline at multiple rostrocaudal levels of the ventral brainstem, we aimed to selectively enhance the excitability of neurons driving active expiration, thereby revealing the extension of the pharmacological response and the most efficient site in generating active expiration.”</p><p>We have edited the results as follows:</p><p>“Importantly, the group with injection sites at +0.6 mm from VIIc exhibited the swiftest response onset, suggesting that this area is the most critical for the generation of active expiration, either through direct activation of the expiratory oscillator or, alternatively, for providing a strong tonic drive to late-E neurons located elsewhere.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the introduction, it should also be emphasized that the pharmacological approach used in the present study complements the existing elegant chemogenetic studies, rather than emphasizing primarily the limitations of the chemogenetic inhibitions. The conclusion should be that these studies together provide different, yet complementary insights: The chemogenetic approach by inhibiting neurons, the present study by exciting neurons, and all studies come with their own limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion, we have updated the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“Although both of these elegant chemogenetic studies have contributed extensively to our understanding of the pFL, the existing evidence suggests that the expiratory oscillator may expand beyond the limits of the viral expression achieved in said studies, as proposed by Huckstepp et al., (2015).”</p><p>Throughout the manuscript, the authors have to be cautious when implying that an excitatory effect relates to the activity of rhythmogenic pFL neurons. For example, on line 710 the authors state that &quot;it is conceivable to infer that the rostral pFL is in the closest proximity to the cells responsible for the generation of active expiration&quot;. While it may indeed be &quot;conceivable&quot;, the bicuculline injections themselves provide no insights into the location of neurons responsible for rhythmogenesis. It is equally &quot;conceivable&quot; that the excited neurons provide a tonic drive to the neurons without being involved in the generation of active expiration. These tonic neurons could be located at a distance from the presumed rhythmogenic core.</p><p>We have included the possibility of tonic excitation in the technical considerations section:</p><p>“However, our study did not include recording from late-E neurons following bicuculline injections, preventing us from definitively confirming whether the observed activity stems from late-E neuronal excitation or the potentiation of a tonic drive, particularly in the rostral areas.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is intriguing that some of their injections (Fig.2D) evoked postinspiratory activity. This interesting finding should be discussed as it could provide important insights into the coordination of the different phases of expiration.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have included the following to the discussion:</p><p>“Therefore, although it has previously been described, the exact mechanism by which this post-I ABD activity is generated is unclear. This late-E/post-I pattern of activity is similar to what has been observed in in vitro preparations and in vivo recordings in juvenile rats (Janczewski et al., 2002; Janczewski et al., 2006).</p><p>“Therefore, although it has previously been described, it is currently unknown the exact mechanism by which this post-I activity in the ABD muscles is generated. For example the interplay between the rostral pFL and brainstem structures generating post-inspiratory activity, such as the proposed post-inspiratory oscillator (PiCo; Anderson et al., 2016) or pontine respiratory networks, could be reasonably involved in this process.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors conducted bilateral disinhibition of the pFL, but only a unilateral photomicrograph was shown. Figure 2 should include a representative bilateral photomicrograph along with a scatter plot for clarity and completeness.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited figure 2 to include representative images of bilateral injections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Regarding the Bicuculline injections in the Methods section: Aside from specifying exactly what type of bicuculline was used, the authors should provide more information about the pFL location and landmarks used, including the missing medial-lateral coordinate. The fluorobead spread of approximately ~300 µm, as observed in Figure 2C, is crucial for the interpretation of the results and should be detailed. An alternative approach could involve e.g. calculating the area covered by fluorobeads in each group.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the following in the text:</p><p>“Each rat was injected at 2.8 mm lateral from the midline and at a specific RC coordinate based on the following groups: -0.2 mm from the caudal tip of the facial nucleus (VIIc) (n=5), +0.1 mm from VIIc (n=7), +0.4 mm from VIIc (n=5), +0.6 mm from VIIc (n=6), +0.8 mm from VIIc (n=5)”</p><p>“These findings strongly suggest that bicuculline specifically activated cells within the vicinity of the injection sites which spread ~300 ìm (Figure 2C, horizontal lines) and did not activate PHOX2B+ cells in the RTN area, beyond their baseline level of activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) In the Experimental Protocol, the authors should provide more details on how the parameters were determined. For example, specify the number of cycles included for Dia frequency/amplitude, Abd frequency/amplitude, and with regards to the averaging process, the authors should specify over how many cycles they obtained an average for Dia/Abd activity time and AUC. The authors should also provide information on the number of bicuculline injections that they repeated to average these values and they should report the coefficient of variation for repeated injections. Please clarify the method used to calculate AUC, considering the non-linear nature of the activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Only one bicuculline injection per rat was performed and the number of rats used for each injection site is indicated in the methods as follows:</p><p>“Each rat was injected at 2.8 mm lateral from the midline and at a specific RC coordinate based on the following groups: -0.2 mm from the caudal tip of the facial nucleus (VIIc) (n=5), +0.1 mm from VIIc (n=7), +0.4 mm from VIIc (n=5), +0.6 mm from VIIc (n=6), +0.8 mm from VIIc (n=5), and CTRL (n=7). We recorded the physiological responses to the injection for 20-25 min.”</p><p>We have clarified in the methods section the following:</p><p>“Respiratory data was tracked in time bins of 2-minute duration from the baseline period prior to injections and spanned 20 min of recording post-injection. Mean-cycle measurements for each signal were computed by averaging values across all cycles within a given time bin.”</p><p>Additional clarifications have been added:</p><p>“We then used the average calculations of respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT), Minute Ventilation (Ve), expiratory ABD amplitude, expiratory ABD area, VO2, VE/VO2 to obtain values relative to the baseline period. Peak responses were identified as the time bin that produced the strongest changes relative to baseline.”</p><p>“Mean-cycle measurements for each signal were computed by averaging across all cycles within a given time bin. (~300 cycles in baseline, ~100 cycles per response time bin). We then used the average calculations of respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT), Minute Ventilation (Ve), expiratory ABD amplitude, expiratory ABD area, VO2, VE/VO2 to obtain values relative to the baseline period. Peak responses were identified as the time bin that produced the strongest changes relative to baseline.”</p><p>“The Area under the curve (AUC) was measured during baseline and was subtracted from the corresponding AUC of the response for each time bin (Figure 1C). This AUC measure was computed as the sum of the signal in a given respiratory phase as all signals were sampled at the same rate. Note that areas calculated below the zero- (0) line, as would be expected from a negative airflow during expiration, yields negative AUC values.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The authors should explain how oxygen consumption was calculated-did it involve the Depocas &amp; Hart (1957) formula? Please provide information on expiratory CO2, whether ventilation was adjusted to achieve consistent CO2 levels across animals, and ideally specify the end-tidal CO2 range for the experiments. Discuss the rationale behind the chosen CO2 levels and whether CO2-dependent pFL activity could have influenced results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the measurement in the methods as follows:</p><p>“The gas analyzer measured fractional concentration of O2. Based on this and the flow rate at the level of the trachea (minute ventilation), we calculated O2 consumption according to Depocas and Hart (1957).”</p><p>We have also added to the methods section:</p><p>“During the entire experimental procedure, rats breathed spontaneously and end tidal CO2 was not adjusted through the experimental protocol.”</p><p>In terms of the CO2-dependent pFL activity possibly influencing the results: by inducing active expiration in conditions in which there is no physiological demand for it (i.e. no hypoxia or hypercapnia), it is likely that pCO2 is reduced, overall decreasing the drive for ABD activity which would suggest that our results are likely an underestimation of the response that would have been produced if we maintained the CO2 levels constant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) The authors should address the discrepancy in fos-activated neurons between the control (44 neurons) and experimental animals (90-120 neurons per hemisection). Please explain the activation in the control group. Please also provide insights into how the authors interpret this difference in cfos-activated neurons between control and experimental groups.</p></disp-quote><p>The following paragraph has been added to the discussion:</p><p>“The assessment of cellular activity, quantified through cFos staining, unveiled the existence of basal activity in control rats. This observed baseline activity is likely emanating from subthreshold physiological processes within the parafacial area which do not culminate in ABD activity. Analysis of the cFos staining confirmed focal activation of neurons in the pFL of rats injected with bicuculline and minimal cFos expression in the PHOX2B+ cells in all groups as compared to the control group. These results confirm the very limited mediolateral spread of the drug from the core site of injection and back previous findings supporting the hypothesis that the majority of PHOX2B+ cells are more ventrally located in the parafacial area (pFV, Huckstepp et al., 2015) and PHOX2B+ cell recruitment is not necessary for active expiration (de Britto &amp; Moraes, 2017; Magalhães et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) In Figure 8, the authors plotted the relationship of each cycle correlated to the normalized area. Have you also calculated the same late-E, inspiratory, and post-I to fR or VT separately?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we only did the separated breathing phase (late-E, I, Post-I) analysis in the calculations of the DIA, airflow and ABD area, as well as on the Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Is there any specific reason for conducting these experiments exclusively in males?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we usually use male rats for this type of experiments. We use both male and female rats for other studies that concern the effects of sex hormones but in this case, we performed experiments only in male rats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 13, Line 320: What is the duration of the bicuculline-induced effects?</p></disp-quote><p>This information is included in the results section as follows:</p><p>“Similarly, the ABD response duration was longer at the two most rostral locations (+0.6 mm = 17.6 ± 2.7 min; +0.8 = 17.1 ± 3.3 min) compared to the most caudal group (-0.2 mm = 2.4 ± 1.1 min; One-Way ANOVA p = 0.043; Tukey -0.2 mm vs +0.6 mm: p = 0.048; -0.2 mm vs +0.8 mm: p = 0.041; Figure 3E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 16, Line 400: Is there a rationale for the high tidal volume (VT) observed in these animals? A baseline VT of 7 ml/kg appears notably elevated.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that rats were vagotomised and spontaneously breathing, hence the tidal volume is increased compared to non-vagotomised rats as seen in previous studies (Ouahchi et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2D: Could you provide longer recordings?
