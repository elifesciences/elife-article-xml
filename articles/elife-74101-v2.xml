individual GPCRs can activate multiple signaling pathways has raised the possibility of developing drugs selectively targeting therapeutically relevant ones. This requires tools to determine which G proteins and βarrestins are activated by a given receptor. Here, we present a set of BRET sensors monitoring the activation of the 12 G protein subtypes based on the translocation of their effectors to the plasma membrane (EMTA). Unlike most of the existing detection systems, EMTA does not require modification of receptors or G proteins (except for G<sub>s</sub>). EMTA was found to be suitable for the detection of constitutive activity, inverse agonism, biased signaling and polypharmacology. Profiling of 100 therapeutically relevant human GPCRs resulted in 1500 pathway-specific concentration-response curves and revealed a great diversity of coupling profiles ranging from exquisite selectivity to broad promiscuity. Overall, this work describes unique resources for studying the complexities underlying GPCR signaling and pharmacology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>g protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>enhanced bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer</kwd><kwd>effector membrane translocation assay</kwd><kwd>biosensor</kwd><kwd>G protein activation</kwd><kwd>high-throughput assay</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bouvier</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-148431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bouvier</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R218-2016-1266</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gloriam</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R313-2019-526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gloriam</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF18OC0031226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gloriam</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R278-2018-180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hauser</surname><given-names>Alexander S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002491</institution-id><institution>Bristol-Myers Squibb</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bouvier</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Development, validation, and use of an effector membrane translocation biosensor platform reveals G protein coupling selectivity signatures for 100 GPCRs that range from remarkable selectivity to full promiscuity toward the different G protein subtypes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play crucial roles in the regulation of a wide variety of physiological processes and represent one-third of clinically prescribed drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hauser et al., 2017</xref>). Classically, GPCR-mediated signal transduction was believed to rely on linear signaling pathways whereby a given GPCR selectively activates a single G protein family, defined by the nature of its Gα subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oldham and Hamm, 2008</xref>). Gα proteins are divided into four major families (G<sub>s</sub>, G<sub>i/o</sub>, G<sub>q/11</sub>, and G<sub>12/13</sub>) encoded by 16 human genes. Once activated, these proteins each trigger different downstream effectors yielding different biological outcomes. It has now become evident that many GPCRs can couple to more than one G protein family and that ligands can selectively promote the activation of different subsets of these pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namkung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quoyer et al., 2013</xref>). These observations extended the concept of ligand-biased signaling, which was first established for ligand-directed selectivity between βarrestin and G protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azzi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wei et al., 2003</xref>), to functional selectivity between G proteins. Ligand-directed functional selectivity represents a promising avenue for GPCRs drug discovery since it offers the opportunity of activating pathways important for therapeutic efficacy while minimizing activation of pathways responsible for undesirable side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galandrin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kenakin, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To fully explore the potential of functional selectivity, it is essential to have an exhaustive description of the signaling partners that can be activated by a given receptor, providing receptor- and ligand-specific signaling signatures. Currently, few assays allow for an exhaustive pathway-specific analysis of GPCR signaling; these include BRET-based G protein activation sensors platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galés et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Masuho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maziarz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mende et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olsen et al., 2020</xref>) and the TGF-α shedding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>). However, several of these platforms require modification of G protein subunits that may create functional distortions. Moreover, these assays may detect non-productive conformational rearrangements of the G protein heterotrimer as was recently reported for G<sub>12</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Okashah et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe unique sensors that do not require modification of receptors or G proteins (except for G<sub>s</sub>) for interrogating the signaling profiles of GPCRs. The platform includes 15 pathway-selective enhanced bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (ebBRET) biosensors monitoring the translocation of downstream effectors to the plasma membrane for G<sub>i/o</sub>, G<sub>q/11</sub>, and G<sub>12/13</sub>, the dissociation of the Gα subunit from the plasma membrane for G<sub>s</sub> and the recruitment of βarrestin to the plasma membrane. Overall, the new ebBRET-based <bold><underline>E</underline></bold>ffector <bold><underline>M</underline></bold>embrane <bold><underline>T</underline></bold>ranslocation <bold><underline>A</underline></bold>ssays, named EMTA, provide a readily accessible large scale and comprehensive platform to study constitutive and ligand-directed GPCR signaling. The signaling signatures of 100 GPCRs using the EMTA platform also provides a rich source of information to explore the principles underlying receptor/G protein/βarrestin coupling selectivity relationships. It thus provides a unique set of tools that is complementary to previously described platforms and existing datasets, and offers a map of the coupling potentials for individual GPCR that will stimulate future studies investigating the relevance of these couplings in different physiological systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ebBRET-based G protein effector membrane translocation assay (EMTA) allows detection of each Gα protein subunit activation</title><p>To detect the activation of Gα subtypes, we created an EMTA biosensor platform based on ebBRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namkung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The biosensors at the heart of EMTA consist of sub-domains of the G protein-effector proteins p63-RhoGEF, Rap1GAP and PDZ-RhoGEF that selectively interact with activated G<sub>q/11</sub>, G<sub>i/o</sub>, or G<sub>12/13</sub>, respectively. These domains were fused at their C-terminus to <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (RlucII) and co-expressed with different unmodified receptor and Gα protein subtypes. Upon GPCR activation, the energy donor-fused effectors translocate to the plasma membrane to bind activated Gα proteins, bringing RlucII in close proximity to the energy acceptor, <italic>Renilla</italic> green fluorescent protein, targeted to the plasma membrane through a CAAX motif (rGFP-CAAX), thus leading to an increase in ebBRET. The same plasma membrane translocation principle is used to measure βarrestin recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namkung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top). Because no selective soluble downstream effector of G<sub>s</sub> exists, the assay was modified taking advantage of Gα<sub>s</sub> dissociation from the plasma membrane following its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wedegaertner et al., 1996</xref>). In this configuration, the RlucII is directly fused to Gα<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2014</xref>). Its activation upon GPCR stimulation leads to its dissociation from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin and Lambert, 2016</xref>), resulting in a reduction in ebBRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EMTA ebBRET platform to monitor G protein activation and βarrestin recruitment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the G protein Effector Membrane Translocation Assay (GEMTA) to monitor Gα protein activation.

The responses were monitored upon heterologous expression of specific Gα subunits belonging to G<sub>i/o</sub>, G<sub>q/11</sub>, or G<sub>12/13</sub> families in the absence or presence of pharmacological inhibitors and using engineered cells lacking selected Gα subtypes. The dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor was used to validate the ability of the G<sub>i/o</sub> binding domain of Rap1GAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jordan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meng et al., 1999</xref>) to selectively detect G<sub>i/o</sub> activation. The dopamine-promoted increase in ebBRET between Rap1GAP-RlucII and rGFP-CAAX in the presence of Gα<sub>i/o</sub> subunits was not affected by the G<sub>q/11</sub>-selective inhibitor UBO-QIC (a.k.a., FR900359; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schrage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left), whereas the Gα<sub>i/o</sub> family inhibitor, pertussis toxin (PTX), completely blocked the response for all members of Gα<sub>i/o</sub> family except for Gα<sub>z</sub>, known to be insensitive to PTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation of the GnRH receptor (GnRHR), used as a prototypical G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled receptor, promoted ebBRET between the RlucII-fused G<sub>q/11</sub> binding domain of p63-RhoGEF (p63-RhoGEF-RlucII; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rojas et al., 2007</xref>) and rGFP-CAAX. The ebBRET increase observed in the presence of different Gα<sub>q/11</sub> subunits was not significantly (p = 0.077, 0.0636 and 0.073 for G<sub>q</sub>, G<sub>11</sub>, and G<sub>14</sub>, respectively) affected by PTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right), whereas UBO-QIC completely blocked the response for all members of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> family except for Gα<sub>15</sub>, known to be insensitive to UBO-QIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schrage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left). These two G protein-specific EMTA were sensitive enough to detect responses elicited by endogenous G proteins since deletion of G<sub>i/o</sub> (ΔG<sub>i/o</sub>) or G<sub>q/11</sub> (ΔG<sub>q/11</sub>) subtypes completely abolished the responses induced by D<sub>2</sub> or GnRHR activation in the absence of heterologously expressed G proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>).

When an agonist-promoted response was observed in non-transfected parental HEK293 cells, this response was not considered as a receptor-specific response (see Materials and methods).</p><p>To compare the signaling profiles across all receptors and pathways and to overcome differences in receptor expression levels and individual biosensor dynamic windows, we first min-max normalized E<sub>max</sub> and pEC<sub>50</sub> values (between 0 and 1) across receptors as a function of a reference receptor yielding the largest response for a given pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left).

Such double normalization allows direct comparison of the coupling efficiency to different G proteins for a given receptor and across receptors for a given G protein. This coupling efficiency is summarized as heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) that reveals a high diversity of signaling profiles. The selectivity toward the different G protein families varies considerably among GPCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In our dataset, which is the first using unmodified GPCRs and Gα proteins (except for G<sub>s</sub>), 29% of the receptors coupled to only one family, whereas others displayed more promiscuity by coupling to 2, 3, or 4 families (36%, 25%, and 10%, respectively). Receptors coupling to a single G protein family favored the members of the G<sub>i/o</sub> family. Indeed, 27% of the receptors coupling to G<sub>i/o</sub> only activated this subtype family in comparison to 0, 2.4 and 9.1% for receptors activating G<sub>12/13</sub>, G<sub>q/11</sub>, and G<sub>s</sub>, respectively, thus displaying more promiscuous coupling.

As can be seen in the table, although in many cases the potency for the novel couplings is lower, this is not a universal finding since for some receptors, the pEC<sub>50</sub>s for the new couplings are similar (ex: G<sub>12</sub> for CB<sub>1</sub>; G<sub>13</sub> for serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>; G<sub>12/13</sub> for adenosine 2A (A<sub>2A</sub>) and prostaglandin E1 (EP<sub>1</sub>) receptors; G<sub>i/o</sub> for corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRFR1), ET<sub>A</sub> and G protein-coupled receptor 39 (GPR39)) or higher (ex: G<sub>z</sub> for serotonin 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>; G<sub>15</sub> for adenosine 3 (A<sub>3</sub>) and melanocortin 3 (MC3R) receptors; G<sub>12</sub> for bradykinin 2 (B<sub>2</sub>), cholecystokinin A (CCK<sub>1</sub>), chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) and ET<sub>A</sub> receptors; G<sub>12/13</sub> for CRFR1 and GPR68) than those for the canonical ones. Interestingly, in many instances the potency for the newly uncovered couplings are similar to those for βarrestins, which is generally lower than for their canonical G proteins, a finding consistent with the role of βarrestins in signaling arrest at the plasma membrane. The potency differences observed for the activation of different G protein subtypes by a given receptor may lead to preferential activation of some pathways over others. This relative selectivity is likely to be influenced by tissue-dependent G protein subtype expression levels.

The usefulness of the G<sub>z</sub>/G<sub>15</sub> combined sensor to detect off-target ligand activity is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.

The activation of D<sub>2</sub> by noradrenaline and serotonin was confirmed by the ability of the D<sub>2</sub>-family selective antagonist eticlopride to block the dopamine-, serotonin-, and noradrenaline-promoted responses detected using the combined G<sub>z</sub>/G<sub>15</sub> or the G<sub>i2</sub>- and G<sub>oB</sub>-selective sensors and βarrestin2 sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, top).

One such example of trans-activation is provided by the activation of cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptors by acetylcholine (detected by the G<sub>z/15</sub> and confirmed with the G<sub>oB</sub> sensors; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). Indeed, the activation was completely inhibited by both the CB inverse agonist AM-630 and by the cholinergic antagonist atropine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, left). Yet the response evoked by the CB selective agonist WIN55,212 2 was not blocked by atropine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, center). Gα<sub>oB</sub> activation by acetylcholine did not result from direct activation of endogenous muscarinic receptors since no Gα<sub>oB</sub> response was observed in parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given that the M<sub>3</sub> muscarinic receptor, which is endogenously expressed at relatively high levels in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atwood et al., 2011</xref>), is strongly coupled to the G<sub>q/11</sub>, CB<sub>1</sub>-expressing cells were pretreated with G<sub>q/11/14</sub> inhibitor UBO-QIC prior to stimulation with acetylcholine. UBO-QIC pre-treatment blocked acetylcholine- but not WIN55,212–2-mediated Gα<sub>oB</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, right). These results demonstrate that CB<sub>1</sub> activation by acetylcholine is indirect and potentially involves the secretion of an endogenous CBR ligand following activation of G<sub>q/11</sub> by endogenous muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The combined G<sub>z</sub>/G<sub>15</sub> sensor is therefore a useful tool to identify interplay between receptors and to explore systems pharmacology resulting from such cross-talks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study describes the development and validation of a genetically encoded ebBRET-based biosensor platform allowing live-cell mapping of GPCR-G protein coupling preferences covering 12 heterotrimeric G proteins. The novel EMTA biosensors were combined with previously described ebBRET-based βarrestin trafficking sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namkung et al., 2016</xref>), providing an unprecedented description of GPCR signaling partner couplings. In addition to providing a resource to study GPCR functional selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pándy-Szekeres et al., 2022</xref>) , the sensors provide versatile and readily usable tools to study, on a large-scale, pharmacological processes such as constitutive activity, inverse agonism, ligand-biased signaling, and signaling cross-talk.</p><p>Our EMTA-based biosensor platform offers several advantages relative to other available approaches. First, EMTA provides direct real-time measurement of proximal signaling events following GPCR activation (i.e. Gα protein activation and βarrestin recruitment) and resulting in lower level of amplification than those of assays relying on enzymatic activity of downstream effectors (i.e.: adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C) or artificial detection systems (i.e.: gene-reporter or TGF-α shedding assays) that measure signal accumulation sometimes following extended incubation times. In addition, measuring proximal activity reduces the risk of cross-talks between pathways that may complicate data interpretation when considering downstream signaling as the readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mancini et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Second, EMTA uses native untagged GPCRs and G protein subunits (except for G<sub>s</sub>), contrary to protein complementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laschet et al., 2019</xref>), FRET/BRET-based Gαβγ dissociation/receptor-G protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bünemann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galés et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galés et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoffmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namkung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olsen et al., 2020</xref>) or TGF-α shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>) assays. Modifying these core-signaling components could alter responses, complicate interpretation and explain some of the discrepancies observed between the EMTA platform and other approaches used to study G protein activation. Moreover, the ability to work with unmodified receptors and G proteins (except for G<sub>s</sub>) offers numerous advantages. First, it allows for the detection of endogenous GPCR signaling in either generic HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) or more physiologically relevant cell lines such as induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and promyelocytic HL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Further it allows, in cells expressing sufficient endogenous level of the G proteins of interest, to detect activation of both native receptor and G proteins with no need of overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). This is illustrated by the ability to detect the recruitment of Rap1GAP upon activation of the endogenous G<sub>i/o</sub> family members by the formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) in HL-60 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) or protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The ability to detect the activation of endogenous G protein was also illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>, where the responses elicited by agonist stimulation were lost in cells genetically deleted of the G protein engaged by the studied receptor (i.e.: G<sub>q/11</sub> or G<sub>i/o</sub> families). Recently, another BRET-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maziarz et al., 2020</xref>), taking advantage of a synthetic peptide recognizing the GTP-bound form of Gα subunits, also allows the detection of native G protein activation, offering alternative means to probe coupling selectivity profiles for both endogenously and heterologously expressed GPCRs.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Detection of endogenous receptor- and/or G protein-mediated responses in cells with the EMTA ebBRET platform.</title><p>Concentration-dependent activation of Gα<sub>i2</sub> protein by (<bold>A</bold>) endogenous S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes transfected with heterologous Gα<sub>i2</sub>, (<bold>B</bold>) endogenous FPR2 in promyelocytic HL-60 cells transfected with heterologous Gα<sub>i2</sub>, (<bold>C</bold>) endogenous FPR2 in promyelocytic HL-60 cells with endogenous G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins and (<bold>D</bold>) endogenous PAR2 receptor in HEK293 cells with endogenous G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins.

Indeed, one cannot exclude that distinct members of a given family may display different relative affinities for their common effector. However, such differences are compensated by our data normalization that establishes the maximal response observed for a given subtype as the reference for this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as long as the number of the diversity of receptors included in the analysis is sufficient.</p><p>A second potential caveat of EMTA is that, when using heterologously expressed GPCRs and G proteins, some of the responses could result from favorable stoichiometries that may not exist under physiological conditions. It follows that such profiling represents the coupling possibilities of a given GPCR and not necessarily the coupling that will be observed in all cell types. Any couplings observed in such high-throughput studies requires further validation to conclude on their physiological relevance in cells or tissues of interest, and to form hypothesis for futures studies. Because we elected to use unmodified receptors (i.e.: not bearing any tags), the expression level of receptors could not be directly monitored. However, the double normalization method developed (see Materials and methods) allows quantitative comparison of coupling preferences across different receptors curtailing the influence of the assay response windows as well as receptor expression levels. Indeed, the double normalization allows ranking the coupling propensity of the receptors first as a function of the receptor which shows the strongest coupling to a specific G protein subtype, and then establishing the maximal response observed for a given G protein subtype as the reference for all G protein activated by a given receptor. In addition, as illustrated using the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor as example, titrating receptor levels did not influence the pEC<sub>50</sub> for the activation of the different G protein coupled to this receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>). Similarly, the pEC<sub>50</sub> was not affected when titrating the amount of G protein subtype expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). As expected, only the amplitude of the response was affected.</p><p>It could be argued that overexpressing the G protein effectors (i.e.: p63-RhoGEF, Rap1GAP or PDZ-RhoGEF) used as sensors could influence the couplings observed. This potential caveat is mitigated by the fact that we used truncated part and/or modified versions of these effectors that limit the possibilities of interference with other components of the signaling machinery, and served essentially as a binding detector of the active forms of the G proteins (see Materials and methods). Supporting this notion, titrating the amount of the biosensor effector component did not affect the pEC<sub>50</sub> of G protein activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>).</p><p>Another limitation of the EMTA platform is the lack of a soluble effector protein selective for activated Gα<sub>s</sub> thus requiring tagging of the Gα<sub>s</sub> subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom) and monitoring its dissociation from the plasma membrane. Yet, our data show that this translocation reflects G<sub>s</sub> activation state, justifying its use in a G protein activation detection platform.</p><p>Finally, because EMTA is able to detect constitutive activity, high receptor expression levels may lead to an elevated basal signal level that may obscure an agonist-promoted response. Such an example can be appreciated for the A<sub>1</sub> receptor for which the agonist-promoted Gα<sub>i2</sub> response did not reach the activation threshold criteria because of a very high constitutive activity level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The impact of receptor expression on the constitutive activity and the narrowing on the agonist-promoted response is illustrated for Gα<sub>q</sub> activation by the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of any large-scale signaling study and drug discovery program is that ligands may elicit responses downstream of receptors other than the one under study. The development of a G<sub>z</sub>/G<sub>15</sub> quasi-universal biosensor enables efficient screening and detection of such polypharmacology and cross-talk. Using a combination of EMTA and appropriate pharmacological tools, we also proposed a systematic approach to distinguish off-target action of ligands from cross-talk. Interestingly, the cross-talk between the M<sub>3</sub> and CB receptors detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) may have physiological relevance since activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors has been shown to enhance the release of endocannabinoids in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2002</xref>). The combined G<sub>z</sub>/G<sub>15</sub> biosensor should be particularly useful for early profiling of compound activity on safety panels and for the design of drugs displaying polypharmacology, an approach that is increasingly considered for the development of neuropsychiatric drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roth et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The EMTA platform undoubtedly represents a novel tool-set that could be amenable for high throughput screening of small molecules and biologics across an array of signaling pathways, allowing for the discovery of functionally selective molecules or for GPCR deorphanization campaigns. The ability of the EMTA platform to quantitatively assess G protein coupling selectivity firmly expands the concept of functional selectivity and potential ligand bias beyond the dichotomic G protein <italic>vs</italic>. βarrestin view and provides plausible functional selectivity profiles that could be tested for their biological and pharmacological outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>HEK293 clonal cell line (HEK293SL cells), hereafter referred as HEK293 cells, were a gift from S.

Gα<sub>12/13</sub> protein family activation was monitored using the selective-G<sub>12/13</sub> effector PDZ-RhoGEF-RlucII and rGFP-CAAX in the presence of either Gα<sub>12</sub> or Gα<sub>13</sub> and the tested receptor. The expression level of the Gα subunits was monitored by western blot in HEK293 cells that endogenously expressed Gα<sub>i1</sub>, Gα<sub>i2</sub>, Gα<sub>12</sub>, Gα<sub>13</sub>, Gα<sub>q</sub>, Gα<sub>11</sub>, Gα<sub>14</sub>, and Gαs but not Gα<sub>oA</sub>, Gα<sub>oB</sub>, Gα<sub>z</sub>, and Gα<sub>15</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). Gα<sub>12/13</sub>-downstream activation of the Rho pathway was measured using PKN-RBD-RlucII or Ezrin-RlucII and rGFP-CAAX with the indicated receptor. βarrestin recruitment to the plasma membrane was determined using DNA mix containing rGFP-CAAX and βarrestin1-RlucII with GRK2 or βarrestin2-RlucII alone or with GRK2 and the tested receptor. Glutamate transporters EAAC-1 and EAAT-1 were systematically co-transfected with the mGluR to prevent receptor activation and desensitization by glutamate secreted in the medium by the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brabet et al., 1998</xref>). All ligands were also tested for potential activation of endogenous receptors by transfecting the biosensors without receptor DNA. The G<sub>z</sub>/G<sub>15</sub> biosensor consists of a combination of the following plasmids: rGFP-CAAX, Rap1GAP-RlucII, Gα<sub>z</sub>, p63-RhoGEF-RlucII and Gα<sub>15</sub>. For G protein activation detection using the BRET-based Gαβγ dissociation sensors, cells were co-transfected with untagged Gβ<sub>1</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub>-118-RlucII, Gα<sub>12</sub>-136-RlucII or Gα<sub>13</sub>-130-RlucII with GFP10-Gγ<sub>1</sub>, or Gα<sub>i1</sub>-loop-RlucII, Gα<sub>i2</sub>-loop-RlucII or Gα<sub>oB</sub>-99-RlucII with GFP10-Gγ<sub>2</sub>, along with the indicated receptor.</p><p>The day of the BRET experiment, cells were incubated in HBSS for 1 hr at room temperature (RT). Cells were then co-treated with increasing concentrations of ligand (see Appendix 1—key resources table and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for details) and the luciferase substrate coelenterazine prolume purple (1 µM, NanoLight Technologies; Pinetop, AZ, USA) for 10 min at RT. Plates were read on a Synergy Neo microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc; Winooski, VT, USA) equipped with 410 ± 80 nm donor and 515 ± 30 nm acceptor filters or with a Spark microplate reader (Tecan; Männedorf, Switzerland) using the BRET<sup>2</sup> manufacturer settings. The BRET signal (BRET²) was determined by calculating the ratio of the light intensity emitted by the acceptor over the light intensity emitted by the donor. To validate the specificity of the biosensor responses, cells were pretreated in the absence or presence of either the Gα<sub>q</sub> inhibitor UBO-QIC (100 nM, 30 min; Institute for Pharmaceutical Biology of the University of Bonn, Germany), the Gα<sub>i/o</sub> inhibitor PTX (100 ng/mL, 18 hr; List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, California, USA) or the Gα<sub>s</sub> activator CTX (0–200 ng/mL, 4 hr; Sigma-Aldrich) before stimulation with agonist. For inverse agonist activity detection of A<sub>1</sub> or CB<sub>1</sub> receptors, cells were stimulated during 10 min with increasing concentrations of DPCPX or rimonabant, respectively. For ligand-cross receptor activation experiments, cells were pretreated for 10 min with increasing concentrations of antagonists or inverse agonist (eticlopride for D<sub>2</sub>, WB4101 for α<sub>2A</sub>AR, atropine for muscarinic receptors and AM-630 for CB<sub>1</sub>) before a 10 min stimulation with an EC<sub>80</sub> concentration of the indicated agonist. BRET was measured as described above. For the safety target panel ligand screen using the combined G<sub>z</sub>/G<sub>15</sub> sensor, basal ebBRET level was first measured 10 min following the addition of coelenterazine prolume purple (1 µM) and ebBRET level was measured again following a 10 min stimulation with a single dose of the indicated ligand (1 μM for endothelin-1 and 10 μM for all other ligands). Technical replicates for each receptor were included on the same 96-well plate. For kinetics experiment of ET<sub>A</sub> activation, basal BRET was measured during 150 s before cells stimulation with either vehicle (DMSO) or 1 µM of endothelin-1 (at time 0 sec) and BRET signal was recorded each 30 s during 3570 s. For the validation of G<sub>12/13</sub>-mediated signal by new identified G<sub>12/13</sub>-coupled receptor using PKN- or Ezrin-based BRET biosensors, cells were pretreated or not with the Gα<sub>q</sub> inhibitor YM-254890 (1 µM, 30 min; Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Fujifilm), Osaka, Japan) before agonist stimulation for 10 min. For G protein activation detection using the BRET-based Gαβγ dissociation sensors, and for titration experiments of either Gα proteins subunit with GEMTA sensors, GPCRs with GEMTA sensors or Effector-RlucII (p63-RhoGEF-RlucII for Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, Rap1GAP-RlucII for Gα<sub>i/o</sub> or PDZ-RhoGEF-RlucII for Gα<sub>12/13</sub>) from GEMTA sensors, cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of the indicated agonist in the presence of prolume purple for 10 min before BRET measurement. For BRET in iPSC cardiomyocytes and HL-60 cells, cells were incubated in Tyrode Hepes buffer (137 mM NaCl, 0.9 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 11.9 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3.6 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM HEPES, 5.5 mM D-Glucose and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) 30 min at RT before being treated with increasing concentrations of agonist for 15 min, using prolume purple (2 µM) as luciferase substrate, and BRET measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>BRET data analyses and coupling efficiency evaluation</title><p>All BRET ratios were standardized using the equation below and represented as universal BRET (<italic>u</italic>BRET) values: <italic>u</italic>BRET = ((BRET ratio – A)/(B-A)) * 10,000.

Consequently, a score of 0 or 1 was assigned to each signaling pathway depending on an agonist’s ability to activate the tested pathway (0 = no activation; 1 = activation). In the case were responses associated to endogenous receptor were detectable, we considered as ‘distorted’ and exclude all the responses observed in the presence of transfected receptor for which E<sub>max</sub> was ≤to 2*mean of the E<sub>max</sub> value obtained with endogenous receptors or pEC<sub>50</sub> was ≥to 2*mean of the pEC<sub>50</sub> value obtained with endogenous receptors. Consequently, a score of 0 was assigned for these distorted responses in radial graph representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and concentration-response curves were placed on a gray background in signaling signature profile panels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

E<sub>max</sub> and pEC<sub>50</sub> values deduced from concentration-response curves were first normalized between 0 and 1 across receptors by ranking the receptors as a function of the receptor that most efficiently activate a given pathway and then using the activation value for the pathway (including G protein and βarrestin subtypes) that a given receptor most efficiently activate as a reference for the other pathways that can be activated by this receptor.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Roger Sunahara (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the authors have generated a useful set of reagents and analysis tools for investigating G protein coupling by GPCRs, and is in principle appropriate as a Tools and Resources contribution, but it was felt that the strengths and weaknesses need to be presented in a more cautious manner. The need for overexpression of receptors, G proteins and effectors (points 2, 3 and 4) is not adequately discussed, and the authors need to make clear to the general reader that the assays indicate what GPCR-G couplings are possible, as distinct from what happens physiologically. It is also felt that the &quot;non modified&quot; G protein argument is overstated given that Gs is modified; nonetheless, there is very likely significant advantage in using unmodified receptors.</p><p>1. The authors should show an example in which this assay system shows a clear benefit versus other available high-throughput assays. The authors refer to the companion paper that presents a detailed analysis of selectivity profiles and comparison with existing data sets. It would be better if this analysis (or at least the main points) was simply included in the present manuscript, as this might better demonstrate cases where the EMTA assays outperform other assays, a key claim of the present manuscript. Moreover, the authors say that their &quot;comparative analysis&quot; (line 275) revealed a number of couplings not found in IUPHAR or Inoue, but simple inspection of the data does the same thing. For completeness, that should at least mention that their dataset also lacks some couplings found in other datasets.</p><p>2. The authors discuss the caveats with the EMTA approach, stating that the assays require overexpression of both G protein isoforms and receptors, although they can be used with endogenous receptors. It is unclear how overexpression of GPCRs and G proteins could influence the engagement of downstream effectors and possible mislead interpretation about potential biased signaling or polypharmacology. The authors need to present a balanced discussion of the relationship between receptor and G proteins overexpression. Notably, the authors have previously claimed that ligand biased signaling is dependent on cellular context, where various levels of expression of receptor, G proteins, effectors are found. With this in mind, how valuable is the information presented since the measurements were acquired in a non-natural context? Some experimental examples varying receptor and G protein expression and monitoring effector engagement would be ideal to address these issues.</p><p>3. Related to point 2, the assays are limited to a subset of effectors. The authors still need to address whether overexpression of the effector-sensor also biases the response. Typical endogenous effectors are expressed at very low levels owing to their roles as catalysts. In this assay, however, overexpression of the sensor is required as a BRET pair. Thus, are the authors confident that over expression of the effector-sensor does not bias the coupling response, either by altering the potency or efficacy of agonist activation?</p><p>4. The authors state that effector coupling between G proteins from the same subclass are observed (i.e. different Galphai, G12 vs G13 etc…)? In order to claim this, the authors would need to carefully monitor the level of expression of the G proteins (if not possible by WB then qPCR). For example, in figure 2C, the authors present data that CB1 seems to couple to Galpha 13 more than Galpha 12, two G proteins that have been thought to be functionally equivalent. Could G protein isoforms have different affinities for the biosensors?</p><p>5. The authors are for the most part clear about the fact that Gs needed to be modified in their experiments, but in several places they gloss over this in a way that tends to overstate their results. For example, on line 219 they refer to theirs as the first dataset to use &quot;unmodified GPCRs and G proteins&quot; in the same sentence as promiscuous coupling to 2,3 or 4 families. Some of this promiscuous coupling must have been demonstrated with modified Gs. In general the authors should be cautious about the broad claim that the assay uses unmodified G proteins when one of the four major families is indeed modified.</p><p>6. The authors considered the effects of glutamate in media for the mGluR studies, but the authors use A1 adenosine receptors to demonstrate constitutive activity, with larger inverse agonist responses than agonist responses. However, a limitation of this example is the ubiquity of adenosine in cell cultures; studying adenosine receptors in HEK cells is not straightforward without testing the effects of adenosine deaminase to metabolize adenine-containing molecules released into the media by the cells themselves. Either deaminase treatment should be performed for this experiment, or a better receptor example with known constitutive activity (e.g. beta2AR or CB1), where the possibility of an endogenous ligand being present is more remote.</p><p>7. When discussing the coupling efficiency of GPCRs to subsets of Galpha subunits, the authors highlight the adenosine A2A receptor as one which preferentially couples to Galpha15. The data in the table really suggest that the A2B receptor might be more selective for Galpha15 then A2A.</p><p>8. To compare the receptor coupling efficiencies, the authors normalized the dose-response curves of the agonists for each G protein (or arrestin) against a reference receptor on that given pathway. Similarly, the authors illustrated the Emax for each coupling relationship as a normalized response to a reference receptor that yields a maximal response. These are rational interpretations for comparison purposes. For physiological and pharmacological purposes, it might be useful if the authors expressed the coupling specificity in a slightly different manner. It would be useful for readers to see how an effector response would be for a non-canonical coupling event relative to a cognate coupling relationship. For example, what would be the effector response for norepinephrine stimulation of beta1AR with the non-cognate G proteins using an EC50 concentration determined from the Galphas (cognate) measurements? Here the physiological concentrations of norepinephrine that are necessary for Galphas activation (coupling) can be compared to the coupling to other Galphas (or arrestin) at the same concentration. At least under non-pathological conditions, coupling with hormone or even therapeutically relevant drug concentrations could then be compared fairly. The data are already collected by the authors and assembling a table illustrating this comparison should not be too difficult. This sort of interpretation/presentation should be quite informative.</p><p>9. The normalization procedure that compares all responses as a percentage of baseline may have unintended consequences for receptors with high constitutive activity or where endogenous ligands may be present in HEK cell cultures (e.g. adenosine, 5-HT, glutamate). Basal responses may be high for the most efficient G proteins but lower for secondary couplers, which could paradoxically give the latter a larger response window. This might skew the results, e.g. does A1 really activate G12 better than Gi subunits, or rather does the G12 sensor simply have a higher window due to lower baseline. This might also explain why Gi looks like a better coupler to mGluR5 than Gq; perhaps the Gq signal is already close to saturation, as glutamate is also difficult to remove.</p><p>10. Line 418 the authors claim that EMTA does not require amplification. It's unclear precisely what they mean in this context, but amplification could certainly occur with this assay system, as a single active receptor could maintain many G proteins in the active state. This might be especially true if the EMTA probes themselves prevent binding of RGS proteins, thus prolonging the active lifetime of each G protein. It is now clear that assays that lack amplification are advantageous for studies of ligand bias, therefore the authors should be careful to avoid making this claim.</p><p>11. Line 505 the authors refer to the use of EMTA for HTS. BRET is rarely used for true HTS, so this statement might be softened somewhat.</p><p>12. The authors should directly address a recent study showing that PDZ-RhoGEF is activated by Gi subunits (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.15.452545v1.full). Were all experiments with their PDZ-RhoGEF sensor done in the presence of PTX, as in Figure 2C?</p><p>13. The authors claim that EMTA allows for imaging of the spatiotemporal activation of the different Biosensors. Although this is convincing for video 2 and video 3, it is less so for video 1 (galphaI). Can the authors provide additional information or an alternative representative video?</p><p>14. On lines 300-301, the authors mention that HEK293 cells do not express Galpha15 and that the EP2 and opioid receptors do not couple to Gq/11 family members but couple to Galpha15. However, in Figure 3 supp 3B, there is a clear calcium response upon PGE2 or Dynorphin exposure. Galpha15 expression only potentiated the response. How is calcium signaling activated if it is not Galphaq/11 mediated?</p><p>15. The authors suggest that the cross-activation of the D2 and alpha2 receptors by noradrenaline and serotonin is direct (through direct engagement of D2 and alpha2) as the response is inhibited by D2 and alpha2 antagonist. This conclusion would be further strengthened if the response was not inhibited by adrenergic or serotoninergic antagonists (as done with the muscarininc antagonist for CB1-CB2 cross talk).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are some issues that should to addressed by the authors. None are deal breakers but they should be addressed, most likely possible without any further experimentation.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>The authors nicely state the caveats with the EMTA approach stating that the assays require overexpression of both G protein isoforms and receptors, although can be used with endogenous receptors.

We agree with the reviewers that, as for most assays, the EMTA platform has its limitations. Concerning, the notion that the assays indicate what GPCR-G couplings are possible, and not necessarily what happens physiologically, we agree with the reviewers and we had mentioned this point in the discussion of the original manuscript in the following way:</p><p>‘A second potential caveat of EMTA is the use of overexpressed GPCRs and G proteins. Some of the responses detected could indeed result from favorable stoichiometries that may not exist under physiological conditions. It follows that the profiling represents the coupling possibilities of a given GPCR and not necessarily the coupling that will be observed in all cell types.’ (lines 472-476 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>To emphasize it even further, we now also addressed this point in a more general way as early as the introduction (lines 82-86 of the revised manuscript) and more directly linked it to the EMTA assays in the Results section (line 195 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>The reviewer is right that the possibility to use the assay with endogenous levels of receptors or G proteins (discussed below) should not detract from the fact that, in our manuscript, the EMTA platform was mainly used with heterologously expressed receptors and G proteins, since the goal was to perform a large-scale scanning of the G protein coupling potentials for a large collection of GPCRs. Any couplings observed in such high-throughput studies will require further validation to conclude on their physiological relevance in cells or tissues of interest. This has now been reiterated in the discussion on lines 476-478. Yet, it should be noted that the assays for G<sub>q/11</sub> and, G<sub>i/o</sub> families can be used in the absence of heterologously expressed G proteins (lines 127-131 of the revised manuscript). However, as we have now indicated on lines 131-133, it is impossible under these conditions to distinguish which members of the family is activated by the receptor. As also noted on lines 442-454 of the revised manuscript, the assay can be used to profile endogenously expressed receptor and G proteins, with no need for overexpression of either the receptor or G proteins, given a sufficient endogenous expression level.</p><p>Concerning the special case of G<sub>s</sub> that needs to be modified to detect its activation in an EMTA format, this had been mentioned in the original discussion:</p><p>‘Another limitation is the lack of a soluble effector protein selective for activated Gαs thus requiring tagging of the Gα<sub>s</sub> subunit (Figure 1B, bottom) and monitoring its dissociation from the plasma membrane. Yet, our data show that this translocation reflects Gs activation state, justifying its use in a G protein activation detection platform’ (lines 503-507).</p><p>For clarity sake, we have now stated the exception of G<sub>s</sub> everytime we evoked the ability of detecting G protein activation without modification of either Gα or Gβγ proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

To more clearly present the advantages and limitations of EMTA in a more balance matter, the section of advantages, limitations and caveats have been significantly expanded (lines 82-86, 127-133, 163-167, 173-177, 195, 343-347, 442-454, 476-478, 483-501, 589-592 and 597-600 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>Yet, to directly address the question of the reviewer regarding examples in which EMTA shows a clear benefit, new data presenting side-by-side comparison of the signals detected with EMTA <italic>vs.</italic> BRET assays based on Gαβγ dissociation (Gαβγ) (Gales et al., Nat Methods 2005; Gales et al., Nat Struct Mol Biol 2006; Olsen et al., Nat Chem Biol 2020) had been added. As shown in new Figure 2—figure supplement 5, EMTA generated significantly larger assay windows than Gαβγ assays for the 6 Gα subunits tested for the 8 receptors selected (D<sub>2</sub>, GIP, PTH1, M<sub>3</sub>, ET<sub>A</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, FP or Cys-LT<sub>2</sub>). In some cases, a robust response could be observed only with EMTA. These data are now presented in the Results section (lines 173-177).</p><p>Given that some of the G<sub>12/13</sub> couplings had not been reported by Inoue et al., or in the GtP dataset, the validity of these couplings was confirmed using orthogonal assays downstream of G<sub>12/13</sub> in the absence of heterologously expressed G proteins. As shown in modified Figure 3—figure supplement 4A, G<sub>12/13</sub> activation by FP and Cys-LT<sub>2</sub> was detected using the PKN-based (Namkung et al., Sci Signal 2018) and MyrPB-Ezrin-based (Leguay et al., J. Cell Sci 2021) BRET biosensors, two biosensors detecting Rho activation downstream of G<sub>12/13</sub>; a response not affected by G<sub>q/11</sub> inhibition. These data are now described in the revised manuscript (lines 314-316). Such confirmation of new couplings compared to Inoue <italic>et al.,</italic> and GtP dataset was also provided for G<sub>15</sub> by monitoring calcium-induced responses (see Figure 3—figure supplement 4B).</p><p>As requested by the reviewer, although an extensive comparison between datasets is presented in the companion paper, we included a new table directly comparing couplings identified in our study <italic>vs.</italic> that of Inoue <italic>et al.,</italic> (Supplementary File 4A).

Direct comparison with the GtP dataset is less straightforward since all members of a given family are clustered in one category in this database. Yet, when considering the family clusters, some differences can be observed between the couplings identified in our study, and those reported in GtP database. This is now also discussed in lines 292-296 and in Supplementary File 4B, and a more detailed analysis can be found in the companion paper (Hauser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021 bioRxiv. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.07.459250).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

It is unclear how overexpression of GPCRs and G proteins could influence the engagement of downstream effectors and possible mislead interpretation about potential biased signaling or polypharmacology. The authors need to present a balanced discussion of the relationship between receptor and G proteins overexpression. Notably, the authors have previously claimed that ligand biased signaling is dependent on cellular context, where various levels of expression of receptor, G proteins, effectors are found. With this in mind, how valuable is the information presented since the measurements were acquired in a non-natural context? Some experimental examples varying receptor and G protein expression and monitoring effector engagement would be ideal to address these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the idea that the signaling profile of a receptor can be influence by the expression levels of its downstream transducers and effectors (a concept known as system bias), the reviewer is right. Again, the point of the manuscript is not to determine the signaling profiles of a given receptor in specific physiologically relevant tissues but rather to provide a broad view of the coupling potentials of a large number of receptors. As indicated in the response to the previous comments, this potential caveat of the assays has been emphasized in lines 82-86, 127-133, 465-470, 472-501, 589-592 and 597-600 of the revised manuscript. Given that for all receptors tested the same amount of a given G protein was used to assess their coupling potential, the relative propensity of each of these receptors to activate the different G proteins can be assessed. Such comparison is greatly facilitated by the double normalization used in the study (see lines 208-216) since it allows ranking the coupling propensity of the receptors first as a function of the receptor which shows the strongest coupling to a specific G protein subtype, and then establishing the maximal response observed for a given G protein subtype as the reference for all G proteins activated by a given receptor. This should greatly diminish, if not obliterate, the influence of the G protein and receptor expression levels. Nevertheless, we added a new supplemental figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A), demonstrating that varying G protein expression level can modify the amplitude of the response (as expected since the purpose of our platform is to identifying specific Gα subunits activated by a given receptor by overexpressing them) but not the potency (pEC<sub>50</sub>) of ligand-promoted effectors recruitment by activated-G proteins (Supplementary File 1B). Similarly, varying GPCR expression level only modified the amplitude of the response but not the pEC<sub>50</sub> (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and Supplementary File 1C). These results are now discussed in the revised manuscript (lines 163-167 and 487-489). It should also be noted that in the original manuscript (lines 159-163 of the revised manuscript), we provided evidence that no competition with endogenous G proteins occurs to a significant extent in the heterologous expression configuration, since the potencies of the responses to a given G protein subtype were not affected by the genetic deletion of the different G protein family members (see lines 490-492 of the revised manuscript, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Supplementary File 1A).</p><p>The question of ligand-biased signaling is a different one. This is a comparison between the propensity of two ligands to lead to the activation of two different pathways. This is theoretically an intrinsic property of the ligand-receptor pair and should be independent of the absolute expression of the partners as long as the two ligands are compared under equivalent conditions. No systematic analysis of ligand-bias has been attempted in the present study. The only reference to ligand-biased signaling concerns an example that was given for type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT<sub>1;</sub> see Figure 5B and text lines 349-353 of the manuscript) to illustrate that biases previously reported could be detected using EMTA. We also provided an example showing that mutations of a given receptor (i.e.: GPR17) could affect the signaling preference of this receptor (See Figure 5C and text lines 353-359 of the manuscript). Again, these experiments were performed at equal quantities of effectors and cannot be explain by difference in receptor expression levels since signaling to specific pathway was either untouched or compromised in a mutation-depend manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Related to point 2, the assays are limited to a subset of effectors. The authors still need to address whether overexpression of the effector-sensor also biases the response. Typical endogenous effectors are expressed at very low levels owing to their roles as catalysts. In this assay, however, overexpression of the sensor is required as a BRET pair. Thus, are the authors confident that over expression of the effector-sensor does not bias the coupling response, either by altering the potency or efficacy of agonist activation?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in stating that the RlucII-fused effector constructs need to be heterologously expressed in the EMTA assay as they are part of the biosensors. It should however be specified that only part of the PDZ and p63 sequences are included in the biosensors. For the PDZ biosensor, the sequence fused to RlucII include the G<sub>12/13</sub> protein binding domain but is lacking the PDZ domain involved in protein-protein interaction, the actin-binding domain and the DH/PH domains involved in GEF activity and RhoA activation (Mohamed Aittaleb et al., Molecular Pharmacology 2010). For the p63 biosensor, the sequence fused to RlucII included the G<sub>q</sub> binding domain (which is included in the PH domain), but lacked the N-term part, containing the palmitoylation sites maintaining p63 to plasma membrane, and part of the DH domain involved in RhoA binding/activation (Mohamed Aittaleb et al., Molecular Pharmacology 2010; Mohamed Aittaleb et al., JBC 2011). For Rap1GAP, a bigger part of the protein was kept as two regions are important for the interaction with G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins. However, mutations of protein kinase A phosphorylation sites (i.e.: S437A/S439A/S441A) were introduced in order to eliminate any G<sub>s</sub>-mediated Rap1GAP recruitment to the plasma-membrane (McAvoy et al., PNAS 2009). Altogether, the use of truncated part and/or modified version of these effector limits the possibilities of interference with other components of the signaling machinery, and serves essentially as a binding detector of the active forms of the G proteins. These precisions have now been added to the Material and Method section of the revised manuscript (see lines 589-592 and 597-600).</p><p>Although the ratio of effector-RlucII to rGFP-CAAX is important to define the assay window (maximal response), as is the case in any BRET assay, the expression level of the RlucII-effector should not affect the measured pEC<sub>50</sub> of the response. In agreement with this statement, similar pEC<sub>50</sub> were obtained for different levels of effector-RlucII expression as illustrated in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 3C, with corresponding pEC<sub>50</sub> reported in Supplementary File 1D, and discussed in the section validating the assay platform (lines 163-167 and 499-501 of revised manuscript). These data indicate that heterologous expression of the biosensors did not influence the propensity of a receptor to activate a given G protein. Consistent with this notion, recruitment of the effectors was entirely G protein selective (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2) in agreement with the documented selectivity of the G protein effectors used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors state that effector coupling between G proteins from the same subclass are observed (i.e. different Galphai, G12 vs G13 etc…) ? In order to claim this, the authors would need to carefully monitor the level of expression of the G proteins (if not possible by WB then qPCR). For example, in figure 2C, the authors present data that CB1 seems to couple to Galpha 13 more than Galpha 12, two G proteins that have been thought to be functionally equivalent. Could G protein isoforms have different affinities for the biosensors?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that the expression levels of the G proteins belonging to the same subclass (ex: G<sub>12</sub> and G<sub>13</sub>) could theoretically lead to apparent difference in coupling that would be driven by mass action. However, it should be noted that all experiments were carried out using the same amount of G protein cDNA (using the same plasmid backbone) for all receptors tested. Yet, differences could still occur. This is why we used the double normalization approach (see lines 208-216 of the revised manuscript) that allows ranking the coupling propensity of the receptors as a function of the receptor which shows the strongest coupling to a specific G protein subtype. This should greatly diminish, if not obliterate, the influence of the G protein expression level.</p><p>In the specific case of G<sub>12</sub> and G<sub>13</sub>, the fact that we observe receptors that couple to G<sub>13</sub> but not G<sub>12</sub> (14) and reciprocally to G<sub>12</sub> but not G<sub>13</sub> (6) indicates that a simple difference in expression levels cannot explain the selectivity between the subtypes. Similarly, for receptors that were found to couple to both G<sub>12</sub> and G<sub>13</sub>, some showed greater potencies for G<sub>12</sub> whereas others for G<sub>13</sub>.</p><p>It should also be noted that western blot analyses of the G protein expression levels were presented in the original Figure 2—figure supplement 4 (Figure 2—figure supplement 6 of the revised manuscript) to illustrate the level of overexpression <italic>vs.</italic> endogenous levels for each of the G protein subtype. However, this cannot be use to compare the expression levels of the different G proteins since the different antibodies may have different affinities/avidities. qPCR would also be an inadequate estimate as it would not consider differences in the translation and stability of the individual G proteins.</p><p>As indicated above, we believed that our double normalization methods alleviate the possible distortions promoted by different expression levels. The lack of effect of increasing G protein levels on the pEC<sub>50</sub> of ligand-promoted G protein activation observed in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, also suggests that the differences observed do not result from different expression levels (see response to question 2).</p><p>Another variable that could impact the apparent preference among G protein of the same subclass that is mitigated by the double normalization, is the possibility that the effectors-RlucII constructs may have different affinities for the members of the G protein family that they recognize. This was already acknowledged in the original discussion:</p><p>‘A potential caveat of EMTA is the use of common downstream effectors for all members of a given G protein family. Indeed, one cannot exclude the distinct members of a given family may display different relative affinities for their common effector. However, such differences are compensated by our data normalization that establishes the maximal response observed for a given subtype as the reference for this pathway (Figure 3A).’ (lines 465-470 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors are for the most part clear about the fact that Gs needed to be modified in their experiments, but in several places they gloss over this in a way that tends to overstate their results. For example, on line 219 they refer to theirs as the first dataset to use &quot;unmodified GPCRs and G proteins&quot; in the same sentence as promiscuous coupling to 2,3 or 4 families. Some of this promiscuous coupling must have been demonstrated with modified Gs. In general the authors should be cautious about the broad claim that the assay uses unmodified G proteins when one of the four major families is indeed modified.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully revised the text not to lead the readers to believe that all G protein activities could be detected without modification of the Gα subunit. In every case, we made it clear that this was possible for all Gα subunits except Gα<sub>s</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors considered the effects of glutamate in media for the mGluR studies, but the authors use A1 adenosine receptors to demonstrate constitutive activity, with larger inverse agonist responses than agonist responses. However, a limitation of this example is the ubiquity of adenosine in cell cultures; studying adenosine receptors in HEK cells is not straightforward without testing the effects of adenosine deaminase to metabolize adenine-containing molecules released into the media by the cells themselves. Either deaminase treatment should be performed for this experiment, or a better receptor example with known constitutive activity (e.g. beta2AR or CB1), where the possibility of an endogenous ligand being present is more remote.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the high level of basal activity observed for the A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor could result from activation by adenosine in cell culture medium rather than constitutive activity. Yet, despite the fact that adenosine was found to have the same potency to activate A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> receptors (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1A), high basal activity was observed for A<sub>1</sub> but not A<sub>3</sub>, supporting the notion that it is truly constitutive activity that has been observed. This is now included in the manuscript lines 336-342. Nevertheless, we chose to also provide another example where inverse efficacy could be observed with the EMTA assay. A new panel in Figure 5A indeed describes the constitutive activity of CB<sub>1</sub> on G<sub>z</sub> activation and the inverse agonist activity of rimonabant, and is described lines 343-347.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. When discussing the coupling efficiency of GPCRs to subsets of Galpha subunits, the authors highlight the adenosine A2A receptor as one which preferentially couples to Galpha15. The data in the table really suggest that the A2B receptor might be more selective for Galpha15 then A2A.</p></disp-quote><p>When we referred to the selectivity of A<sub>2A</sub> in the manuscript (line 370 of the revised manuscript), it was done in the context of the G<sub>z</sub>/G<sub>15</sub> dual biosensor. It was presented to provide an example of a receptor that couples to only one of the two pathways (G<sub>15</sub> and not G<sub>z</sub>) and which activity could be detected by the dual biosensor. Nevertheless, the reviewer is right that this is also the case for A<sub>2B</sub>, which we now added as an additional example (line 370).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. To compare the receptor coupling efficiencies, the authors normalized the dose-response curves of the agonists for each G protein (or arrestin) against a reference receptor on that given pathway. Similarly, the authors illustrated the Emax for each coupling relationship as a normalized response to a reference receptor that yields a maximal response. These are rational interpretations for comparison purposes. For physiological and pharmacological purposes, it might be useful if the authors expressed the coupling specificity in a slightly different manner. It would be useful for readers to see how an effector response would be for a non-canonical coupling event relative to a cognate coupling relationship. For example, what would be the effector response for norepinephrine stimulation of beta1AR with the non-cognate G proteins using an EC50 concentration determined from the Galphas (cognate) measurements ? Here the physiological concentrations of norepinephrine that are necessary for Galphas activation (coupling) can be compared to the coupling to other Galphas (or arrestin) at the same concentration. At least under non-pathological conditions, coupling with hormone or even therapeutically relevant drug concentrations could then be compared fairly. The data are already collected by the authors and assembling a table illustrating this comparison should not be too difficult. This sort of interpretation/presentation should be quite informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The information requested by the reviewer can be found in the Supplementary File 2C. As can be seen in the table, although in many cases the potency for the novel couplings is lower, this is not a universal finding since for some receptors, the pEC<sub>50</sub>s for the new couplings (non-canonical couplings) are similar to those of the canonical ones (for example: G<sub>12</sub> for CB<sub>1</sub>; G<sub>13</sub> for 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>; G<sub>12/13</sub> for A<sub>2A</sub> and EP<sub>1</sub>; G<sub>i/o</sub> for CRFR1, ET<sub>A</sub> and GPR39). Interestingly, in a few cases, it is the potency for the non-canonical pathways that is higher (for example: G<sub>z</sub> for 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>; G<sub>15</sub> for A<sub>3</sub> and MC3R; G<sub>12</sub> for B<sub>2</sub>, CCK<sub>1</sub>, CCR6 and ET<sub>A</sub>; G<sub>12/13</sub> for CRFR1 and GPR68). A paragraph has now been added in the manuscript (lines 229-246) to discuss the implications of these potency differences for the potential physiological roles of the newly identified couplings. A note concerning the differences between the members of the same family was also made (lines 267-269). Also, the results have been discussed considering that for most receptors, the potency toward βarrestins is lower than for their canonical G protein, an observation that has also been made in the past using different assays and that is consistent with the role of βarrestins into signaling arrest at the plasma membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The normalization procedure that compares all responses as a percentage of baseline may have unintended consequences for receptors with high constitutive activity or where endogenous ligands may be present in HEK cell cultures (e.g. adenosine, 5-HT, glutamate). Basal responses may be high for the most efficient G proteins but lower for secondary couplers, which could paradoxically give the latter a larger response window. This might skew the results, e.g. does A1 really activate G12 better than Gi subunits, or rather does the G12 sensor simply have a higher window due to lower baseline. This might also explain why Gi looks like a better coupler to mGluR5 than Gq; perhaps the Gq signal is already close to saturation, as glutamate is also difficult to remove.</p></disp-quote><p>The point raised by the reviewer is valid and important and we had already acknowledged this possibility in the original manuscript (lines 509-515 of the revised manuscript):</p><p>‘Finally, because EMTA is able to detect constitutive activity, high receptor expression level may lead to an elevated basal signal level that may obscure an agonist-promoted response. Such an example can be appreciated for the A<sub>1</sub> receptor for which the agonist-promoted Gα<sub>i2</sub> response did not reach the activation threshold criteria because of a very high constitutive activity level (Figure 5A). The impact of receptor expression on the constitutive activity and the narrowing on the agonist-promoted response is illustrated for Gαq activation by the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B).’</p><p>It should however be noted that although such increased in the basal activity (whether originating from the intrinsic constitutive activity of the receptors or from the endogenous presence of agonists in the media) could affect the maximal agonist-mediated response, it should not dramatically affect the potency determined. Yet, the reduced agonist-promoted response could introduce a bias in the evaluation of the relative efficacies for different pathways (a phenomenon which is true for any assay). Because we did not asses the extent of constitutive activity of each receptor for each pathway, and given that inverse agonists, which would be needed to unambiguously conclude to constitutive activity, do not exist for all receptors, we believed that stating this possible limitation in the manuscript (lines 509-515) is sufficient to alert readers to this potential caveat.</p><p>In addition to the examples of A<sub>1</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> already presented in the original submission, prompted by the reviewer’s comment, we assessed whether a higher basal activity for the G<sub>q</sub> pathway <italic>vs.</italic> G<sub>i2</sub> for mGluR5 could explain the difference in the agonist-promoted response window. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the basal activities detected were very similar for G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>i2</sub> and the greater window observed for G<sub>i2</sub> was also observed when examining the non-normalized data.

Line 418 the authors claim that EMTA does not require amplification. It's unclear precisely what they mean in this context, but amplification could certainly occur with this assay system, as a single active receptor could maintain many G proteins in the active state. This might be especially true if the EMTA probes themselves prevent binding of RGS proteins, thus prolonging the active lifetime of each G protein. It is now clear that assays that lack amplification are advantageous for studies of ligand bias, therefore the authors should be careful to avoid making this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that, since one receptor can activate multiple G proteins, some level of amplification similar to those observed for assays monitoring the dissociation of the Gα from Gβγ subunits would occur with EMTA. Given that receptors can activate many G proteins before being inactivated, there are very few assays monitoring GPCR signaling that have no amplification factor. The comment made at line 418 of the original manuscript was in respect to assays that relies on the enzymatic activity of a downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C or artificial detection systems such as gene-reporter assays or TGF-α shedding assay, which would lead to higher level of amplification than EMTA. To avoid confusion, we clarified our thinking by modifying the sentence lines 426-432.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Line 505 the authors refer to the use of EMTA for HTS. BRET is rarely used for true HTS, so this statement might be softened somewhat.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, BRET is now regularly used in HTS formats both in academic HTS centers and in biopharmaceutical companies. In the HTS platform of IRIC alone, BRET-based assays have been used in more than 25 screens. Domain Therapeutics (DT) has also run around 50 screens and hit-to-lead campaigns in miniaturized assay format. Further, DT have profiled over 200 variants per receptor, for 60 receptors, each using 4 to 8 biosensors in full concentration-response curves, using the EMTA platform. Some examples of such screens have already been published (Hugo Lavoie et al., Nat Chem Biol. 2013; Leguay et al., J Cell Sci. 2021; Giubilaro et al., Nat Commun. 2021). It should also be noted that the Z’ obtained for many BRET-based assays, including EMTA, are larger than 0.6 and thus sufficiently robust for HTS.

The apparent paradox between the results of Chandan <italic>et al.,</italic> indicating that PDZ-RhoGEF can be activated by G<sub>i/o</sub> family members and the selectivity of our PDZ-RhoGEF construct for G<sub>12/13</sub> may result from the fact that, in contrast to the full length PDZ-RhoGEF used by Chandan <italic>et al.</italic>, we used a truncated version of PDZ-RhoGEF that only contains the G<sub>12/13</sub> binding domain and lacks the PDZ domain involved in protein-protein interaction, the actin-binding domain and the DH/PH domains involved in GEF activity and RhoA activation (Mohamed Aittaleb et al., Molecular Pharmacology 2010).

How is calcium signaling activated if it is not Galphaq/11 mediated?</p></disp-quote><p>Calcium signal has been shown to result from many distinct signaling cascades. For instance, activation of PLC by Gβγ originating from G<sub>i/o</sub> activation has been well documented (WJ Koch et al., JBC 1994; MF Ethier and JM Madison, Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol., 2006; ZG Gao. and KA Jacobson, Biochem. Pharmacol. 2016; EM Pfeil, et al., Molecular Cell 2020).

It should be emphasized that the experiment described in Figure 3—figure supplement 4B was to confirm the G<sub>15</sub> coupling observed with EMTA using the calcium response promoted by heterologous expression of G<sub>15</sub> as an orthogonal assay and not to assess other pathways that could be involved in the calcium response evoked by κOR and EP<sub>2</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. The authors suggest that the cross-activation of the D2 and alpha2 receptors by noradrenaline and serotonin is direct (through direct engagement of D2 and alpha2) as the response is inhibited by D2 and alpha2 antagonist.

Here the physiological concentrations of norepinephrine that are necessary for Galphas activation (coupling) can be compared to the coupling to other Galphas (or arrestin) at the same concentration. At least under non-pathological conditions, coupling with hormone or even therapeutically relevant drug concentrations could then be compared fairly. The data are already collected by the authors and assembling a table illustrating this comparison should not be too difficult. This sort of interpretation/presentation should be quite informative.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 8 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors are for the most part clear about the fact that Gs needed to be modified in their experiments, but in several places they gloss over this in a way that tends to overstate their results. For example, on line 219 they refer to theirs as the first dataset to use &quot;unmodified GPCRs and G proteins&quot; in the same sentence as promiscuous coupling to 2,3 or 4 families. Some of this promiscuous coupling must have been demonstrated with modified Gs.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 5 of the Essential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors refer to a companion paper that presents a detailed analysis of selectivity profiles and comparison with existing data sets. It would be better if this analysis (or at least the main points) was simply included in the present manuscript, as this might better demonstrate cases where the EMTA assays outperform other assays, a key claim of the present manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 1 of the Essential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors say that their &quot;comparative analysis&quot; (line 275) revealed a number of couplings not found in IUPHAR or Inoue, but simple inspection of the data does the same thing. For completeness, that should at least mention that their dataset also lacks some couplings found in other datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 1 of the Essential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The term &quot;therapeutically-relevant&quot; is not defined, isn't necessary, and seems a stretch for many of the receptors sampled here, many of which are not demonstrated therapeutic targets.</p></disp-quote><p>Looking back at the list, we feel confident that all receptors studied are either already the target of clinically used drugs (74 receptors reported in Drugbank database), presently considered for the pre- or clinical development of drugs (6 receptors are currently investigational in clinical trials according to ClinicalTrials.gov database) or directly involved in specific pathophysiological processes. For more clarity, the term &quot;therapeutically-relevant&quot; is now defined lines 192-195 of the revised manuscript and receptors with approved drug or currently investigational in clinical trials reported in Drugbank database are now identified in the Supplementary File 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors make frequent use of the term &quot;engage&quot;. This is semantics, but the term is not as precise as &quot;bind&quot; or &quot;activate&quot;, and seems closer to &quot;bind&quot;. In this case I much prefer &quot;activate&quot;, after all a key advantage of the EMTA format is that G proteins must be activated, not just bound or engaged by a GPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank and agree with the reviewer and the term ‘engage’ has been changed for ‘activate’ in all cases except when describing the non-productive engagement of G<sub>12</sub> by the V<sub>2</sub> that we have changed for ‘non-productive binding’ (line 462 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use A1 adenosine receptors to demonstrate constitutive activity, with larger inverse agonist responses than agonist responses. However, a limitation of this example is the ubiquity of adenosine in cell cultures, which often requires adenosine deaminase treatment to remove completely. A better example might be another receptor with known constitutive activity (e.g. beta2AR or CB1), where the possibility of an endogenous ligand being present is more remote.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 6 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 418 the authors claim that EMTA does not require amplification. It's unclear precisely what they mean in this context, but amplification could certainly occur with this assay system, as a single active receptor could maintain many G proteins in the active state. This might be especially true if the EMTA probes themselves prevent binding of RGS proteins, thus prolonging the active lifetime of each G protein. It is now clear that assays that lack amplification are advantageous for studies of ligand bias, therefore the authors should be careful to avoid making this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 10 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 505 the authors refer to the use of EMTA for HTS. BRET is rarely used for true HTS, so this statement might be softened somewhat.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 11 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should directly address a recent study showing that PDZ-RhoGEF is activated by Gi subunits (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.15.452545v1.full). Were all experiments with their PDZ-RhoGEF sensor done in the presence of PTX, as in Figure 2C?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 12 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The normalization procedure which compares all responses as a percentage of baseline may have unintended consequences for receptors with high constitutive activity or where endogenous ligands may be present in HEK cell cultures (e.g. adenosine, 5-HT, glutamate). Basal responses may be high for the most efficient G proteins but lower for secondary couplers, which could paradoxically give the latter a larger response window. This might skew the results, e.g. does A1 really activate G12 better than Gi subunits, or rather does the G12 sensor simply have a higher window due to lower baseline. This might also explain why Gi looks like a better coupler to mGluR5 than Gq; perhaps the Gq signal is already close to saturation, as glutamate is also difficult to remove.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 9 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors highlight that one of the strengths of EMTA is the use of untagged receptor and G proteins but fail to present an example where this constitutes a true benefit when compared to other biosensors or signaling assays.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 1 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although EMTA functions in some endogenous cases where receptor expression and effector coupling are optimal, in most contexts overexpression of both GPCRs and G proteins is required. It is unclear how overexpression of GPCRs and G proteins could influence the engagement of downstream effectors and possible mislead interpretation about potential biased signaling or polypharmacology. The authors need to present a careful analysis of the relationship between receptor and G proteins overexpression (using qPCR) and effector engagement? This could be done by varying receptor and g protein expression and monitoring effector engagement.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 2 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors have previously claimed that ligand biased signaling is dependent on cellular contexts, where various levels of expression of receptor, G proteins, effectors are found. With this in mind, how valuable is the information presented since the measurements were acquired in a non-natural context?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 2 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In figure 2B on the right, it appears that PTX leads to a significant inhibition of the G protein coupling (non Galphai) in response to GnRH, is this significant? The authors state on lines 128-129 that the response is not affected by PTX. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Although there is a tendency for reduction of G protein activation in presence of PTX, no statistically significant difference was found compared to untreated cells (p=0.077, 0.0636 and 0.073 using Unpaired t-test for G<sub>q</sub>, G<sub>11</sub> and G<sub>14</sub>, respectively). The term ‘not significantly’ and p values have been added to the sentence (lines 124-125 of revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors state that effector coupling between G proteins from the same subclass are observed (i.e. different Galphai, G12 vs G13 etc…)? In order to claim this, the authors need to carefully monitor the level of expression of the G proteins (if not possible by WB then qPCR). For example, in figure 2C, the authors present data that CB1 seems to couple to Galpha 13 more than Galpha 12, two G proteins that have been thought to be functionally equivalent. Could G protein isoforms have different affinities for the biosensors?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 4 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors claim that EMTA allows for imaging of the spatiotemporal activation of the different Biosensors. Although this is convincing for video 2 and video 3, it is less so for video 1 (galphaI). Can the authors provide additional information or alternative representative video?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 13 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) On lines 300-301, the authors mention that HEK293 cells do not express Galpha15 and that the EP2 and opioid receptors do not couple to Gq/11 family members but couple to Galpha15. However, in Figure 3 supp 3B, there is a clear calcium response upon PGE2 or Dynorphin exposure. Galpha15 expression only potentiated the response. How is calcium signaling activated if it is not Galphaq/11 mediated?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 14 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors suggest that the cross-activation of the D2 and alpha2 receptors by noradrenaline and serotonin is direct (through direct engagement of D2 and alpha2) as the response is inhibited by D2 and alpha2 antagonist. This conclusion would be further strengthened if the response was not inhibited by adrenergic or serotoninergic antagonists (as done with the muscarininc antagonist for CB1-CB2 cross talk).</p></disp-quote><p>See response to point 15 of the Essential</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Perhaps the most interesting new biology uncovered in this study is the indirect activation of CB1 and CB2 signaling by muscarinic agonist, a mechanism the authors suggest could involve the secretion of a cannabinoid ligand by muscarinic receptor activation. The authors however stop short of directly demonstrating that this is the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the identification of the indirect activation of CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> signaling by muscarinic agonist is particularly interesting and deserve a deeper investigation of the mechanisms involved. However, we believe that this goes beyond the scope of the present manuscript which is to present a new platform with the description of the signal profiling of 100 GPCRs and informs the community on how the platform could be used to detect different pharmacological phenomenon including crosstalk between receptors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
