integrin-mediated focal adhesions (FAs) is essential for cell migration. Many studies have shown that FA disassembly requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, however our understanding of this process remains incomplete. Here, we show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via STIM1/Orai1 calcium channels, which cluster near FAs, leads to activation of the GTPase Arf5 via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated GEF IQSec1, and that both IQSec1 and Arf5 activation are essential for adhesion disassembly. We further show that IQSec1 forms a complex with the lipid transfer protein ORP3, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx triggers PKC-dependent translocation of this complex to ER/plasma membrane (PM) contact sites adjacent to FAs. In addition to allosterically activating IQSec1, ORP3 also extracts PI4P from the PM, in exchange for phosphatidylcholine. ORP3-mediated lipid exchange is also important for FA turnover. Together, these findings identify a new pathway that links calcium influx to FA turnover during cell migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GTPase</kwd><kwd>ORP</kwd><kwd>IQSec1</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>lipid transfer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM127361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casanova</surname><given-names>James E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Calcium influx stimulates formation of ER/plasma membrane contacts adjacent to focal adhesions, and lipid transfer at these sites is required for adhesion disassembly during cell migration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell migration is central to a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. These include morphogenetic movements during embryogenesis, migration of inflammatory cells to sites of infection or injury, wound healing, tissue regeneration, neovascularization of solid tumors and the metastasis of tumor cells to distant anatomical sites. Migrating cells extend protrusions that form integrin-mediated contacts with the extracellular matrix, physically linking the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton. These nascent adhesions (focal contacts) mature to become larger, more stable focal adhesions (FAs) that serve as anchorage points for the actomyosin-dependent traction forces that pull the cell forward. During migration, mature adhesions disassemble at the rear of the cell, and internalized integrins are recycled to the cell front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huttenlocher and Horwitz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Webb et al., 2002</xref>). While significant strides have been made in understanding how adhesions form, our understanding of how they disassemble remains fragmentary.</p><p>It is well established that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a critical regulator of cell migration, at least in part by stimulating calpain-mediated cleavage of focal adhesion components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pettit and Fay, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). Many cell surface receptors, including integrins, activate phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) resulting in IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from ER stores. Depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> is complemented by an ensuing influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the cytosol by Store Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE), mediated by the bipartite stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1)/Orai1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lewis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parekh and Penner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prakriya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vig et al., 2006</xref>). In response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, the ER resident protein STIM1 translocates to the plasma membrane where it assembles with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Orai1 at ER/plasma membrane contact sites (MCSs), leading to channel opening. Importantly, STIM1 and Orai1 are coordinately upregulated in many cancers, and pharmacological inhibition of SOCE has been shown to inhibit both migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our lab investigates the roles of Arf family GTPases and their regulators in cell migration. The Arfs are a family of small GTPases best known for their roles in vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>). Higher eukaryotes express six Arf isoforms divided into three classes, with Arf1, 2 and 3 in class I, Arf4 and 5 in class II and Arf6 the sole representative of class III. Most previous studies of adhesion and motility have focused on Arf6, which has been shown to regulate the recycling of integrins and other cargos from endosomal compartments to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasubramanian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jovanovic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Powelka et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Like other GTPases, Arfs require guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) to load them with GTP. The human genome contains 15 Arf GEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casanova, 2007</xref>). Among these, the IQSec subfamily is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal calmodulin-binding IQ motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Souza and Casanova, 2016</xref>). We have previously shown that IQSec2, which localizes to the post-synaptic densities of excitatory neurons, binds calmodulin and controls the trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2012</xref>), but whether other isoforms are similarly regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> remains unknown.</p><p>IQSec1 (also referred to as BRAG2), which is ubiquitously expressed, has been linked to cell adhesion/migration in several contexts. Previously, we reported that depletion of IQSec1 leads to increased surface levels of β1-integrin, enhanced adhesion and a corresponding reduced rate of integrin endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunphy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moravec et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, depletion of IQSec1 was shown to slow focal adhesion disassembly in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yue et al., 2014</xref>) and also to inhibit vasculogenesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manavski et al., 2014</xref>). IQSec1 has also been implicated in the metastasis of breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morishige et al., 2008</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oka et al., 2014</xref>), and pancreatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2012</xref>) cancers, and as well as melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoo et al., 2016</xref>). While all of these studies highlight a vital role for IQSec1 in cell migration and invasion, we still do not know how IQSec1 mediates these processes.</p><p>Here we report that IQSec1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly through the activation of Arf5, which until now has been thought to function solely in the early secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claude et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005</xref>). We further show that depletion of Arf5, but not of Arf6, phenocopies IQSec1 depletion, leading to flattened, non-motile cells with enlarged focal adhesions and a reduced rate of adhesion turnover. Importantly, Arf5 activation is stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and attenuated by inhibitors of SOCE. We also report the surprising discovery that IQSec1 activation is further stimulated by its association with oxysterol binding protein related protein 3 (ORP3), a lipid transfer protein previously reported to modulate cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lehto et al., 2008</xref>). We further show that ORP3 is recruited to ER/PM contact sites containing STIM1/Orai1 calcium channels, that cluster adjacent to focal adhesions. This recruitment is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and requires PKC-mediated phosphorylation of ORP3. Interaction of ORP3 with IQSec1 is similarly Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKC-dependent, and inhibition of either Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx or PKC activity inhibits downstream activation of Arf5. In agreement with these observations, ORP3 depletion similarly inhibits FA disassembly and migration in both 2D and 3D matrices. We show that ORP3 binds and extracts PI4P from the plasma membrane, delivering it to the ER in exchange for a second lipid, which we identify here as phosphatidylcholine. A mutant of ORP3 lacking lipid exchange activity partially, but not completely, restores adhesion turnover in ORP3-depleted cells, suggesting that localized activation of Arf5 and insertion of PC into the plasma membrane are both important to promote adhesion disassembly. Taken together, our findings establish a spatial and mechanistic link between calcium influx at ER/PM contact sites and focal adhesion turnover mediated by ORP3 and IQSec1-activated Arf5.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IQSec1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly</title><p>We have previously shown that depletion of IQSec1 in Hela cells leads to dramatic flattening of the cells and enhanced adhesion to fibronectin, due to accumulation of β1-integrins on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunphy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moravec et al., 2012</xref>). Similar observations have been reported in cultured endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manavski et al., 2014</xref>). Because previous reports have linked IQSec1 to metastatic breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morishige et al., 2008</xref>), here we focused on the highly metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231.</p><p>Bioinformatics indicates that IQSec1 exists in a large number of splice variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By RT-PCR we determined that three of these variants are expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, isoform A (NP_001127854.1), isoform X5 (XP_011532610.1) and isoform C (NP_001317548), the latter previously reported as GEP100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Someya et al., 2001</xref>). Antibodies against IQSec1 recognize two bands of approximately 100 and 125 KDa in cell lysates, whose expression is reduced upon shRNA-mediated knockdown of IQSec1 using hairpins directed at the shared core sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).</p><p>As previously described in other cell types, silencing of IQSec1 in MDA-MB-231 cells yielded a dramatically flattened phenotype relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

A similar increase in adhesion size was also observed upon IQSec1 depletion in the invasive fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IQSec1 promotes focal adhesion disassembly in MDA-MB-231 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bright field images of control and IQSec1 depleted cells, Bar = 20 µm.

Consistent with this, quantification of focal adhesion dynamics indicated that the rate of adhesion disassembly was significantly decreased relative to mock-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Note that the broad distribution in rates reflects distinct populations of adhesions that turn over at significantly different rates. Moreover, the software used for analysis of adhesion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berginski et al., 2011</xref>) only measures adhesions that assemble and disassemble over the time course of imaging (60 min). Static adhesions, which are abundant in IQSec1-depleted cells, are therefore under-represented in this analysis. Importantly, disassembly rate was restored to near control levels by re-expression of wild-type IQSec1 isoform A/NP_001127854.1 or isoform C/NP_001317548, but not a catalytically inactive mutant of isoform A (E606K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, neither isoform B/NP_ 055684.3 nor isoform X5/XP_011532610.1 significantly rescued FA turnover, suggesting that the alternatively spliced N-terminus in these variants affects their function. This analysis also revealed a significant decrease in the rate of FA assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We attribute this to the accumulation of integrins in enlarged, static adhesions, depleting the pool available for formation of new contacts. Consistent with the reduced rate of adhesion turnover, depletion of IQSec1 also dramatically impaired migration of MDA-MB-231 cells through Matrigel in a 3D transwell migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), in agreement with an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morishige et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we used a more physiologically relevant assay to measure cell migration in 3D collagen gels. Multicellular tumor spheroids﻿ generated by growing MDA-MB 231 cells in low-adhesion U-bottom wells, were embedded in collagen gels and imaged live for 18–24 hr. While migration of cells from control spheroids was clearly observed, essentially no migration was observed from spheroids generated from IQSec1 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>). Taken together, these results show that IQSec1 modulates 2D as well as 3D cell migration and invasion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IQSec1 activates Arf5 to promote FA disassembly</title><p>We have previously shown that IQSec1 activates both Arf5 and Arf6 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moravec et al., 2012</xref>). To date, limited studies of Arf5 have focused on its roles early in the secretory pathway, whereas Arf6 has been shown to act at the plasma membrane and in endosomal recycling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balasubramanian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jovanovic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oh and Santy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Powelka et al., 2004</xref>). As we had observed in Hela cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moravec et al., 2012</xref>), knockdown of Arf6 in MDA-MB-231 cells did not phenocopy IQSec1 knockdown; Arf6-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells were actually less well spread than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). Conversely, depletion of Arf5 in these cells led to dramatic cell flattening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), a significant increase in focal adhesion area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) with higher β1-integrin content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), and reduced disassembly rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Similar increases in focal adhesion area were observed in HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that Arf5 but not Arf6 is essential for focal adhesion turnover.</p><p>To provide additional support for this observation, we sought to bypass the IQSec1 deficiency using GEF-independent Arfs; rapid cycling Arf mutants that have a lower affinity for nucleotide, enabling them to undergo rapid, GEF-independent nucleotide exchange. Given the high cytosolic ratio of GTP/GDP, these mutants exist primarily in the active, GTP bound state but unlike traditional constitutively active mutants they also retain the ability to hydrolyze GTP, and therefore do not sequester effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santy, 2002</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, expression of rapid cycling Arf6 failed to restore FA turnover in IQSec1-depleted cells. In contrast, expression of rapid cycling Arf5 largely restored adhesion turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Like IQSec1, knockdown of Arf5 substantially impaired migration in the matrigel migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these data suggest that activation of Arf5, not Arf6, by IQSec1 mediates focal adhesion disassembly in migrating cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>IQSec1 activates ARF5 to promote FA disassembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Arf5 depletion leads to increased focal adhesion size.</italic> Control (left) and Arf5-depleted cells (right) were stained for endogenous β1-integrin (green) and FAK (red).

For this purpose, cells expressing Arf5 along with either IQSec1 or the catalytically inactive E606K mutant, were treated with the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin for 30 min in the presence of calcium. Thapsigargin depletes Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER by blocking the SERCA-mediated uptake of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lytton et al., 1991</xref>). This causes translocation of STIM1 to the PM where it binds to and activates PM localized Orai1 channels, resulting in an influx of calcium into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liou et al., 2005</xref>) As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> - E, thapsigargin-induced calcium influx increased active Arf5 by ~50% over basal levels in cells expressing WT IQSec1, whereas cells expressing the IQSec1 E606K mutant did not show a significant change in active Arf5 levels. In contrast, Arf5 activation is inhibited by ~60% by the selective Orai1 channel blocker, BTP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>), indicating that Arf5 activation is indeed modulated by calcium influx. Residual activity in the presence of BTP2 presumably represents Arf5 in the early secretory pathway, where it is activated by a different GEF, GBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claude et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005</xref>).

Treating cells with EGF, which elevates intracellular calcium through activation of PLCγ, also resulted in the co-recruitment of ORP3 and STIM1 to the PM, albeit more slowly and less dramatically compared to thapsigargin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and B’</xref>).</p><p>To determine if calcium modulates the interaction of ORP3 with IQSec1, cells were treated with either thapsigargin or BTP2, and the interaction monitored by co-precipitation.

The IQ motif in IQSec proteins resides in an extended N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Crystal structures exist of the IQSec1 catalytic domain in tandem with its C-terminally adjacent PH domain, but these were generated from truncated constructs lacking the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizel et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, these constructs are constitutively active in in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizel et al., 2013</xref>). This, together with our previous observation that calmodulin binding modulates catalytic activity in IQSec2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2012</xref>), suggests that the IQSec1 N-terminus may serve as a regulatory domain. Predictive modeling of the N-terminus suggests that it is comprised of four α-helices, tethered to the catalytic domain by a long unstructured linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The IQ motif (residues 127–136) resides in the third helix, separated from helix four by an unstructured loop.

To identify the lipid cargo(s) that is exchanged for PI4P at the PM, we performed lipid mass spectroscopy. For this purpose, cells were transfected with either GFP alone or GFP-ORP3, then treated (or not) with thapsigargin to drive ORP3 to the PM. Cells were then lysed and incubated with beads containing anti-GFP nanobodies. After washing, immunoprecipitates were extracted with methanol:choloroform (2:1) mixture, and the extracted lipids resolved by mass spectroscopy.</p><p>Structural modeling has suggested that the ORP3 lipid binding pocket is too small to accommodate sterols and does not fit the consensus for binding to phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perry and Ridgway, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vihervaara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In agreement with these predictions, ORP3 did not detectably bind sterols (not shown) and only weakly bound PS, PE or PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). In no case was binding enhanced following treatment with thapsigargin. Similarly, no significant interactions were observed with sphingomyelins (SM). In contrast, several species of phosphatidylcholine were detected in ORP3 precipitates, in amounts that were significantly increased in the thapsigargin-treated samples. The predominant PC species recovered were 16:0/18:1 and 16:0/16:0. Importantly, the levels of both were increased 3-fold upon treatment with thapsigargin, indicating that calcium influx stimulates cargo loading. Together, these observations suggest that ORP3 exchanges PI4P for PC at ER/PM contact sites, in a calcium-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Functions of ORP3 in focal adhesion turnover</title><p>To determine which aspects of ORP3 function are important for adhesion turnover we performed rescue experiments with ORP3 mutants in ORP3-depleted cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, the decrease in FA disassembly rate observed in ORP3 deficient cells was completely rescued by re-expressing wild-type ORP3. In contrast, a mutant lacking both FFAT motifs (∆<sup>FFAT</sup>) failed to restore adhesion turnover, confirming that interaction of ORP3 with VAP-A/B (and the formation of ER/PM contacts) is essential for its function. Interestingly, reconstitution with an ORP3 mutant lacking the ORD domain partially rescued the defect, but was clearly not as effective as the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). This result implies that the lipid transfer function of ORP3 enhances, but is not essential for FA disassembly.</p><p>Based on this observation, we reasoned that ORP3 might serve two independent functions, the first being the localization and allosteric activation of IQSec1, the second being localized lipid exchange in proximity to FAs. To test this hypothesis, we depleted cells of ORP3 and performed rescue experiments with rapid cycling Arf5, which as described above can restore adhesion disassembly in IQSec1-depleted cells. Interestingly, rapid cycling Arf5 did not rescue the FA disassembly defects observed in ORP3 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Together these data suggest that the IQSec1-mediated activation of Arf5 is not sufficient for FA disassembly and also depends on ORP3 mediated lipid exchange at ER/PM contact sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Arf family GTPases have long been implicated in the regulation of cell migration. It is well accepted that Arf6 mediates the recycling of β1-integrins from endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oh and Santy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Powelka et al., 2004</xref>), and Arf1 has been reported to promote focal adhesion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Norman et al., 1998</xref>), but whether and how Arfs may control focal adhesion disassembly remains poorly understood. Interestingly, at least six Arf GAPs (GIT1, GIT2, ASAP1, ASAP2, ASAP3, ARAP2, ACAP2) have been localized to focal adhesions, suggesting that maintaining a low local level of Arf activity may be important for adhesion stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoefen and Berk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Randazzo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vitali et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Here we report that activation of Arf5 by the Arf GEF IQSec1 is crucial for FA disassembly. Depletion of either IQSec1 or Arf5 significantly reduces the rate of adhesion turnover, resulting in the formation of large, stable adhesions and near cessation of cell motility. Despite the high level of sequence similarity among the Arfs (65% identity), expression of rapid cycling Arf5, but not Arf1 or Arf6, largely restores adhesion disassembly in IQSec1-deficient cells. This was unexpected, as Arf5 is generally thought to function in the early secretory pathway, where it is activated by a different Arf GEF, GBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claude et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005</xref>). However, our finding that ER/PM contact sites cluster near focal adhesions supports a novel role for Arf5 at the PM.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Regulation of IQSec1 by calcium</title><p>The IQSec subfamily of Arf GEFs are characterized by the presence of an N-terminal IQ motif that binds calmodulin in a non-canonical calcium independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2012</xref>). In the case of neuronal IQSec2, influx of calcium via NMDA receptors triggers the release of calmodulin and stimulates IQSec2 GEF activity. Since the sequence flanking the IQ motif is nearly identical in all three IQSec isoforms, we hypothesized that calcium would also enhance the activity of the ubiquitously expressed IQSec1 in non-neuronal cells. Here we show that store-operated calcium influx via STIM1/Orai1 channels significantly stimulates IQSec1 activity, and that basal activity is inhibited in the presence of the selective Orai1 channel inhibitor BTP2.</p><p>SOCE also serves to recruit the IQSec1 binding partner, ORP3 to the PM. Intriguingly, the association of ORP3 with IQSec1 occurs through an unstructured loop adjacent to the IQ motif, which is both necessary and sufficient for ORP3 binding. This suggests a two-step activation mechanism for IQSec1 in which calmodulin displacement during Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx may be required for ORP3 binding and full activation. Future studies will be required to define this mechanism in more detail.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Phosphoregulation of ORP3 recruitment to the plasma membrane</title><p>Although it possesses both a PH domain that mediates interaction with PIP<sub>2</sub> at the PM and two FFAT motifs that mediate interaction with VAP-A at the ER, ORP3 is primarily cytosolic at steady state, especially if calcium influx is inhibited using BTP2. Previous studies have shown that ORP3 becomes hyperphosphorylated upon treatment of cells with PMA, and that this significantly enhances its interaction with VAP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weber-Boyvat et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show that cytosolic ORP3 rapidly translocates to ER/PM contacts in a PKC-dependent manner. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of PKC renders ORP3 diffusely cytosolic even in the presence of thapsigargin, and increases its mobility on SDS-PAGE gels. Although we cannot rule out that PKC triggers ORP3 phosphorylation indirectly (e.g. as part of a kinase cascade), bioinformatics analysis (NetPhos 3.0) predicts ~20 PKC sites scattered throughout the ORP3 sequence. Previously, Olkonnen and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weber-Boyvat et al., 2015</xref>) identified a number of phosphorylated serines by mass spectroscopy, only one of which (S372) fits the consensus for a PKC site. These authors reported that none of the identified sites altered mobility of ORP3 on SDS-PAGE gels when mutated to alanine, but they did not determine whether interaction with VAP-A was affected.</p><p>Together, these observations suggest that cytosolic ORP3 exists in a soluble autoinhibited state in which its PH domain and FFAT motifs are sequestered. We hypothesize that PKC-mediated phosphorylation induces a conformational change that exposes these domains simultaneously, thereby providing a mechanism for the regulated formation of ER/PM contacts in response to calcium influx. Interestingly, phosphoregulation of lipid transfer activity has also been reported for OSBP and the ceramide transporter CERT, although in both cases phosphorylation actually inhibits transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumagai et al., 2007</xref>). Studies are in progress to map ORP3 phosphorylation sites and determine their importance in the recruitment of the ORP3/IQSec1 complex to the plasma membrane.</p><p>IQSec1 also preferentially associates with the hyperphosphorylated form of ORP3, implying that ORP3, VAP-A/B and IQSec1 form a tripartite complex upon ORP3 phosphorylation. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that VAP-A co-precipitates with ORP3 and IQSec1, and that increased expression of VAP-A actually enhances interaction of IQSec1 with ORP3. Conversely, mutation of the FFAT motifs in ORP3 reduces binding of IQSec1 to ORP3, suggesting that either VAP-A interaction is a prerequisite for IQSec1 binding, or that the two proteins bind cooperatively to phosphorylated ORP3. Importantly, inhibition of PKC not only reduces interaction between IQSec1 and ORP3, but also significantly attenuates Arf5 activity, further supporting the notion that ORP3 (and possibly VAP-A) binding positively regulates IQSec1 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Lipid transfer by ORP3</title><p>All 12 mammalian ORPs contain a C-terminal ORD (OSBP-related) domain that is thought to mediate the exchange of lipids between closely apposed membranes. A unifying feature of the ORDs is the presence of a signature sequence for the binding of PI4P, and in most cases that have been examined PI4P is indeed one of the cargos. In these cases, PI4P is transferred from the target membrane to the ER, where it is dephosphorylated by the resident protein Sac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nemoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zewe et al., 2018</xref>). In the case of OSBP, PI4P is exchanged for cholesterol, which is transferred to the TGN or endosomes from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sobajima et al., 2018</xref>). ORP5 and ORP8 have been shown to transfer phosphatidylserine to the PM in exchange for PI4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>), while ORP10 transfers PS from the ER to the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Venditti et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, ORP2 was reported to transfer cholesterol to the PM in exchange for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> rather than PI4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that ORP3 extracts PI4P from the PM in a calcium-dependent manner. Thapsigargin treatment triggers a dramatic decrease in the level of PM PI4P that corresponds temporally with delivery of ORP3 to ER/PM contact sites. Surprisingly, mass spectroscopy of lipids bound to ORP3 determined that the primary cargo is PC, strongly suggesting that ORP3 exchanges PC for PI4P. However, unlike other lipid species for which fluorescent probes exist, such probes are not available for endogenous PC, and it has not been possible for us to track the movement of PC from the ER to the PM in intact cells. Moreover, most other reports describing the properties of lipid transfer proteins have used in vitro assays that measure the transfer of a lipid species from one population of liposomes to another, again using fluorescent probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>). Such liposomes, which mimic biological membranes, invariably contain a large fraction of PC, rendering in vitro analysis of PC transfer problematic.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that pharmacological depletion of PI4P from the PM using GSK-A1 actually resulted in larger adhesions and reduced motility in the spheroid assay. This suggests that it is not extraction of PI4P, but rather local insertion of PC into the PM that is important for adhesion disassembly. The most abundant PC species identified in our mass spectroscopy analysis were POPC (16:0/18:1) and DPPC (16:0/16:0), which are among the most abundant PC species in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harayama and Riezman, 2018</xref>). How might insertion of PC contribute to focal adhesion turnover? The lipid environment at FAs is reported to be highly ordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaus et al., 2006</xref>), at least in part due to the accumulation of cholesterol and negatively charged lipids in ordered domains around clustered integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalli et al., 2017</xref>). One possibility is that insertion of a high concentration of PC into this environment, particularly in the cytoplasmic leaflet, would dilute the concentration of cholesterol or charged lipids in adhesions, rendering the bilayer more fluid. Alternatively, many focal adhesion components (talin, vinculin, FAK) bind to acidic lipids (e.g. PIP<sub>2</sub>), and dilution of negatively charged headgroups could reduce their respective affinities for the membrane at these sites. Future work will be directed at dissecting these potential mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Integration of ORP3, IQSec1 and Arf5 in focal adhesion turnover</title><p>The proximity of ORP3-containing contact sites to focal adhesions, and our observation that ORP3 knockdown slows adhesion disassembly, suggest that local lipid transfer is essential for efficient adhesion turnover. Surprisingly, we found that an ORP3 mutant lacking the ORD domain partially restored adhesion disassembly in cells depleted of endogenous ORP3. This observation suggests that, while lipid transfer is indeed important, it is not the only role of ORP3 in this process. In contrast, a mutant lacking both FFAT motifs completely failed to restore adhesion turnover, indicating that formation of ER/PM contacts is critical. Interestingly, this mutant also has a substantially reduced affinity for IQSec1, suggesting that both lipid transfer and activation of Arf5 at contact sites are essential for adhesion disassembly. In support of this hypothesis, expression of rapid cycling Arf5, which did restore adhesion turnover in IQSec1-depleted cells, was not sufficient in ORP3-deficient cells.</p><p>Based on these observations, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) in which local calcium influx triggers the PKC-dependent assembly of an ORP3/VAP-A/IQSec1 complex and its translocation to ER/PM contact sites containing STIM1/Orai1 calcium channels that are in close proximity to focal adhesions. Lipid transfer mediated by ORP3, combined with Arf5 activation by IQSec1, drives the downstream disassembly of nearby adhesions and the subsequent ability of cells to detach their trailing edge, allowing migration to proceed.</p><p>An important question that remains unresolved is the role of Arf5 in FA disassembly. Specifically, what are the downstream effectors of Arf5 at this location and how do they promote adhesion turnover? One previous study determined that the PIP5 kinase isoform PI(4)P 5-kinaseIIIβ, which is allosterically activated by Arfs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honda et al., 1999</xref>) drives the recruitment of the endocytic machinery at sites of adhesion disassembly through local production of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2010</xref>). Determining whether Arf5 stimulates local PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> production via PI(4)P 5-kinaseIIIβ in intact cells, or whether other unidentified Arf5 effectors drive adhesion disassembly will be an important goal for future research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

The phosphatase treated lysates were then incubated with GST-IQSec1<sup>152-212</sup> beads for sixty minutes. Beads were subsequently washed with lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved on 4–20% gradient gels and immunoblotted with anti-GFP or anti-mCherry antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>GGA pulldown assays</title><p>Arf activation was measured using GST-GGA3-mediated pulldown, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santy and Casanova, 2001</xref>). Briefly, cells expressing HA-tagged Arf5 were lysed on ice with chilled GGA-lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 25 mM Tris HCL pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Clarified supernatants were incubated with GST-GGA3 beads for 30 min, washed three times in GGA-wash buffer (25 mM Tris HCL pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and resolved on SDS-PAGE before immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Protein samples were resolved on 4–20% SDS-gradient gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA), then transferred to PVDF-FL membrane (Millipore Burlington, MA). Detection and quantification was carried out using a LI-COR Odyssey infrared scanning system using fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies. All western blots were scanned using the Odyssey Clx infrared imaging system from LICOR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Matrigel invasion assay</title><p>Biocoat matrigel invasion chambers from Corning (354480) were used for these assays. 100,000 cells, either mock depleted or depleted of IQSec1, Arf5 or ORP3 were loaded into the upper chamber in serum free media. Media containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber and cells were allowed to invade for 6 hr at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator. Cells in the upper chamber were removed by gentle scrubbing using a cotton swab, followed by fixing cells that had migrated onto the lower surface with 4% PFA. Cells were stained with DAPI, imaged and counted. Three membranes were analyzed per group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Tumor spheroid assay</title><p>To generate tumor spheroids, we used approaches previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Froehlich et al. (2016)</xref>. Briefly, spheroid formation was induced by growing MDA-MB-231 cells (approximately 10,000 to 15,000 cells per well) in suspension in cell repellent surface 96 well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Germany) with complete media containing 3.5% matrigel for 48 hr. To prepare 3D collagen gels, 300 µl of bovine collagen (final concentration 1.5 mg/ml) in complete media (pH adjusted to 7.4 with 7.5% sodium bicarbonate) was pipetted into a 24 well TC treated plates and allowed to polymerize for 30 min at 37°C. Spheroids were mixed with 300 µl of collagen and then layered on top of collagen polymerized earlier and allowed to further polymerize for an additional 30 min at 37°C. Wells were subsequently topped with complete media and cells were imaged live at 5X magnification for 18–24 hr. For image analysis, the area of the spheroid at time 0 and after 18–24 hr was measured and data is presented as a ratio at these timepoints.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Cells were plated on fibronectin (5 µg/ml) coated coverslips. The next day cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with PBS and blocked in PBS containing 3% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) and 0.1% Triton X (PBST) for 30 min. Incubation with both primary and secondary antibodies was for 60 min at room temperature in blocking buffer. Coverslips were mounted on slides with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, Il).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Confocal microscopy and image analysis</title><p>Images were captured after satisfying the Nyquist criteria for sampling using a 100X, 1.49 NA TIRF objective on a Nikon C1 Plus Confocal microscope. Z Sections of 0.25–0.5 microns were taken. For every experiment, a series of test images were taken to identify exposure gains that minimized oversaturation and this gain was subsequently used for all conditions. 12 bit images were analyzed using Nikon Elements software. A single optical section at the plasma membrane/matrix interface was analyzed per cell. Fluorescence intensities were calculated as mean fluorescence intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Live cell imaging using spinning disc confocal microscopy</title><p>Cells were plated on fibronectin coated (5 µg/ml), 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (Mat-Tek Corp). Imaging was carried out at 37°C approximately 18 to 24 hr after transfection. Before imaging, cells were transferred to pre-warmed imaging buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 also containing 10% FBS and 0.45% glucose). Cells were imaged using a 60X objective fitted to a Nikon TE 2000 microscope equipped with Yokogawa CSU 10 spinning disc and 512 × 512 Hamamatsu 9100 c-13 EM-BT camera. Green fluorescence was excited with a 488 nm/100 mW diode laser (Coherent) and collected by a BP 527/55 filter. Red fluorescence was excited with a 561 nm/100 mW diode laser (Coherent) and collected by a BP 615/70 filter. Multicolor images were acquired sequentially. Time lapse movies were captured at a typical frame rate of 15 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Optogenetic depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></title><p>To deplete PM membrane pools of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, we followed a procedure previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Idevall-Hagren et al. (2012)</xref>. Briefly, cells expressing GFP-ORP3, mCherry-CRY2-5-Ptase<sub>OCRL</sub> (a fusion protein containing the 5-phosphatase domain of OCRL attached to CRY2) and CINB-CAAX were exposed to blue light that induces dimerization of CRY2 and CINB, targeting the 5-phosphatase domain of OCRL to the PM. Blue light illumination was done by exposing cells to light from a 488 nm/100 mW diode laser for 10 frames (once every 15 s). PMA was added after 150 s and cells were imaged for an additional 30 mins.</p><p>For focal adhesion analysis, cells expressing mCherry CRY2-5 Ptase<sub>OCRL,</sub> CINB-CAAX and GFP-Paxillin were imaged every 15 s for 30 min. Exposing cells to blue light to image GFP-Paxillin also induced dimerization of CRY2 and CINB at the PM, depleting the PM of PI(4,5)P2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Measurement of focal adhesion assembly and disassembly rates</title><p>MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with GFP-paxillin or DsRed paxillin and plated on fibronectin coated Mat-Tek dishes for 18–24 hr. Cells were imaged live using spinning disc confocal microscopy at 1 frame every 15 s for 60 min. Movies were compressed into a single grayscale stacked tiff file using Image J and uploaded to the focal adhesion server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://faas.bme.unc.edu/">https://faas.bme.unc.edu/</ext-link>) maintained by Shawn Gomez’s lab at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC). For assembly/disassembly rates, tracks with R-squared value greater than 0.8 were included in analysis.

Briefly, after applying a smoothing filter, areas with pixel intensities above background fluorescence were measured before (T<sub>0</sub>) and after thapsigargin/PMA (T<sub>t</sub>) treatment. The difference in areas at T<sub>t</sub> and T<sub>0</sub> was expressed as percentage of total cell area and plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Measurement of number of ORP3 puncta in cell protrusions and retractions</title><p>A double-blind study method was used to count the number of ORP3 puncta in cell protrusions and retractions. Briefly, cells were transfected with GFP-ORP3 and DsRed-paxillin, then imaged live every 15 s for 30 to 60 min. A protrusion was defined as an area where new focal adhesions form and mature, while a retraction was defined as an area where existing focal adhesions disassemble. Since paxillin was labelled in the red channel, protrusions and retraction were first identified in the red channel, a region of interest was drawn around them, followed by opening the green channel and counting the ORP3 puncta in the region of interest drawn. Two independent raters counted the ORP3 puncta and results were pooled and presented. To quantify the percentage of FA with ORP3 puncta, Imaris 9.5.1 software was used. Focal adhesions were identified using the surfaces function and puncta were identified using the spots function separately for protruding or retracting regions. Using the extension ‘Find spots close to surfaces’, puncta within a distance threshold of 1 µM to the nearest adhesion were identified and counted and the ratio of total associated puncta over total focal adhesions for each region was determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Graphpad Prism7 was used for all statistical analysis. D’Agostino and Pearson’s normality test was used to differentiate between parametric/non-parametric distributions. Mann Whitney’s U test was used to test for significance between two non-parametric groups. In the case of multiple comparisons, the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used along with Dunn’s multiple comparison tests. For all other statistical analysis, student’s ‘t’ test was used to test for significance. For focal adhesion size and disassembly rates, data are presented as Tukey box-plots, where the top of the box represents the 3<sup>rd</sup> quartile (Q<sub>3</sub>) which captures the upper 75<sup>th</sup> percentile and the bottom of the box represents the 1<sup>st</sup> quartile (Q<sub>1</sub>) which captures the lower 25<sup>th</sup> percentile. The median is represented by the solid middle line. The upper whisker represents all values above the 75th percentile plus 1.5 times the IQR (Q<sub>3</sub> + 1.5IQR) and the lower whisker represents all values that fall below the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times the IQR (Q<sub>1</sub>-1.5IQR). The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile and first quartile (Q<sub>3</sub>- Q<sub>1</sub>). The values plotted individually are outliers defined by Grubbs’ test. In all figures, statistical significance between groups has been designated as: ‘*’p&lt;0.05, ‘**’p&lt;0.001, ‘***’p&lt;0.0001, or ‘NS’ p&gt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank David Castle, Bettina Winkler and Adam Greene for critically reading the manuscript, and Lloyd McMahon for help with image analysis.

Whilst Calcium influx has previously been shown to be a critical regulator of motility, the mechanisms are incompletely understood. This paper reports a new role for the lipid exchange protein ORP3 in this pathway, that acts as a spatial and mechanistic link between calcium influx at ER-plasma membrane contact sites and focal adhesion turnover. This dual action of ORP3 locally controls adhesion dynamics and is permissive for cell invasion.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Calcium-stimulated disassembly of focal adhesions mediated by an ORP3/IQSec1 complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports a novel molecular complex regulating focal adhesion turnover and cancer cell invasion. The authors propose a Calcium-responsive mechanism centred around the lipid exchange protein ORP3. Calcium-influx-dependent PKC activation triggers cortical recruitment of ORP3 to ER-PM contact sites near focal adhesions. ORP3 is proposed to have a dual role, triggering activation of the small GTPase ARF5 by allosteric activation of the ARF GEF protein IQSec1, in addition to ORP3-mediated exchange of PI4P out of the PM, and exchange for a particular species of phosphatidylcholine. These dual pathways are proposed to control focal adhesion turnover. Overall, this work proposes a novel mechanism for the regulation of focal adhesion turnover. One general criticism is that the work brings together several concepts (GEF-ARF pair, lipid transfer, GEF-novel interactor complexes) without providing a clear and deep demonstration of how each stream controls focal adhesion function. In this sense, it is an amalgam of incomplete studies. Moreover, a pervasive issue is overstatement of conclusions, not supported by data. However, even if the details remain incomplete, this may be of general interest to the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern is data replication and appropriateness of statistics. The extent of rigorousness of the data is ambiguous, making it difficult to judge the validity of a number of key data. The authors need to more clearly describe their analyses. Throughout the work, in figure legends, n values are given, sometimes in the thousands. Statistical analyses are performed on these values. However, such experiments are then listed as 5-8 cells per condition. Is this 5-8 cells per independent experiment? How many independent experiments? Essential to support the authors claims would be independently performed experiments with much more appropriate sample sizes. It is not appropriate to be comparing simply 5 cells in a single experiment to 5 in another.</p><p>2) With regard to mapping protein interactions using immunoprecipitations, single blots without quantitation are presented. It is stated that experiments were performed twice, with similar trends. The most appropriate would be to have at least triplicate experiments. In the absence of these, please include both independent experiments for all immunoprecipitations, plotted for the reader to see and judge conclusions.</p><p>3) In a number of places, 'rescue' experiments are performed to identify sufficiency of certain exogenously expressed proteins to restore a function lost upon RNAi to a certain protein. These are often referred to as restoring function to control levels. There is a consistent lack of support from the data that this occurs. For instance, in Figure 2B, a rapid-cycling mutant of Arf5 is proposed to rescue IQSEC1 depletion. Although the authors indicate that the metric used (focal adhesion disassembly) is decreased by IQSEC1 knockdown, then significantly increased by ARF5 rapid cycling mutant, this is modest at best. There is no indication or significance associated that this actually 'rescues' IQSEC1 loss to control levels. This is similarly the case for Figure 1E.</p><p>4) The data in Figure 3G and Supplementary Figure 3A do not convincingly show ORP3 or STIM1 is recruited to focal adhesions. The experiments would need to be performed using TIRF microscopy and full quantified to support this conclusion. Notably the appearance of ORP3 punctae at protruding membrane regions may be coincident with focal adhesions assembling, but not mechanistically linked. Many proteins accumulate in newly forming actin-based protrusions (not least because the volume of membrane increases at those sites); co-incidental data is not sufficient to support potential co-operation between these protein assemblies.</p><p>5) The binding of ORP3 to PC is interesting, but the study failed to link this finding back to focal adhesion formation; neither CA-Arf5 or ORF3 ORD mutants alter adhesion disassembly. The authors postulate both functions may be required for adhesion turnover, but this is not tested; and the possibility exists that neither are related to focal adhesion dynamics. In which case, it remains unclear as to the significance of the ORP3 lipid transfer with respect to adhesion dynamics. Moreover, it also remains possible/likely that the bulk effects on plasma membrane lipid partitioning indirectly alter the stability of numerous lipid-binding FA proteins, such as vinculin, kindlin and talin. It would strengthen the study to understand this, as well as the above potential role of Ras in integrin activation.</p><p>6) All experiments are performed with IQSEC1 'Isoform A'. However, this mutant only appears to partially rescue IQSEC1 knockdown. The authors indicate multiple isoforms of IQSEC1 expressed in MDA-MB-231. The data for this is missing. How did the authors detect both which 5’ end and which 3' end of the transcript is present to indicate select variants are present? Why was this isoform chosen? Do other variants 'rescue' fully?</p><p>7) The authors propose that ORP3 may dually a) activate IQSEC1 function and b) function to flip PI4P out of the PM and a specific PC into the OM. It is unclear whether these are the same mechanism or parallel. Depletion of PI4P by a PI4K inhibitor GSK-A1 inhibits invasion, suggesting that PI4P is needed, possibly as a substrate for ORP3 in migration. However, is PI4P needed for ORP3-stimulated IQSEC1-mediated ARF5 GTP-loading? Does GSK-A1 reduce ARF5-GTP levels?</p><p>8) Mass spec for interactors of IQSEC1, and lipid cargoes for ORP3 are identified and discussed. These data are not included, other than key targets. If the data is not present, the validity of claims for interaction or presence cannot be evaluated. These should not be included.</p><p>9) Figure 7G reports which lipid species may be exchanged by ORP3. However, replicate information is missing, as is any other species identity to put this in context of potential enrichment scores for this lipid.</p><p>10) The inclusion of PTPN13 and E-Syt3 as interactors of IQSEC1 is confusing (Figure 3). These are not further investigated. What is their reasoning for inclusion?</p><p>11) A previous paper (Weber-Boyvat et al., 2015) showed ORP3-VAPA binding regulates R-Ras to control integrin activation status. The authors cite this paper but fail to discuss these (highly relevant) findings in the context of their own study. Is it possible that all the effects seen here are mediated through this previously published pathway? It is notable here that the data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 suggesting increased VAPA in the ORP3-IQSec1 complex was not convincing as shown and no statistics were presented. Nevertheless, if VAPA associates with this complex, this suggests Ras may also play a role. It would be very helpful to discuss this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54113.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern is data replication and appropriateness of statistics.

These new data have been incorporated into Figure 1C and E, Figure 2B and H, Figure 3C and E, Figure 4F, G and H, Figure 5A, B, C and E, Figure 6B and C, Figure 7J and K, Figure 2—figure supplement 1H and Figure 4—figure supplement 1D. In this regard, we note that there does not appear to be a standard in the field for what constitutes an appropriate sample size. A survey of the literature suggests a range from 3-12 cells and between 50 and 200 focal adhesions per condition: Juanes et al., JCB 2019 (200 FAs, 8-12 cells), Rajah et al.

In our hands, images acquired using TIRF yielded nearly identical results, and while we appreciate the reviewer’s concern, we feel that re-doing all of the imaging and quantitation for every experiment would not affect the conclusions drawn. Also, the reviewer appears confused about where ORP3 puncta are accumulating – they are actually more abundant in disassembling, not newly forming adhesions. In our original manuscript we provided evidence that ORP3 puncta were roughly twice as abundant in retracting vs. protruding regions of the cell (Figure 3I). In this revision we also show that nearly 100% of disassembling adhesions had adjacent ORP3 puncta, while only 25% of newly formed adhesions did so (Figure 3J). This strongly suggests a preferential recruitment of ORP3 to ER/PM contact sites in response to local calcium signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The binding of ORP3 to PC is interesting, but the study failed to link this finding back to focal adhesion formation; neither CA-Arf5 or ORF3 ORD mutants alter adhesion disassembly.

We agree that it is possible/likely that insertion of PC into the PM adjacent to adhesions may alter the stability of lipid-binding FA components, and have added text to this effect in our Discussion. However, it is unclear how we could test this experimentally; disassembling adhesions are by definition less stable, and are clearly more stable in the absence of ORP3 or Arf5.</p><p>Related to the topic of R-Ras and its association with ORP3; we have been unable to reproduce either the interaction between the two proteins or the effect of ORP3 knockdown on R-Ras activity previously described by the Olkkonen lab.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ORP3 fails to co-IP with HA-R-Ras (left), and depletion of neither ORP3 nor IQSec1 impacts R-Ras activity in a pulldown assay (<bold>A</bold>).</title><p>Quantitation in panel <bold>B</bold> is from 3 independent experiments.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54113-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We also found that neither constitutively active nor dominant negative R-Ras interacted with ORP3 (not shown).

Do other variants 'rescue' fully?</p></disp-quote><p>Using the sequences available at the NCBI, we designed PCR primers specific for the variable N- and C- termini, and sequenced the products generated after amplification from MDA-MB-231 mRNA. The corresponding primers and protocol are described in the Materials and methods. This analysis identified 3 isoforms, isoform A (NP_001127854.1), isoform X5 (XP_011532610.1) and isoform C (NP_001317548.1), also known as GEP100. In response to this reviewer’s concern, we tested the ability of all 3 detected isoforms to rescue IQSec1-depleted cells. As shown in the new Figure 1E, both isoform A and isoform C significantly restored adhesion turnover, while isoform X5 was less efficient. We also tested a fourth isoform (isoform B, NP_055684.3) that is not expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, and it was statistically indistinguishable from a catalytically inactive mutant of isoform A. Because isoform A rescued most efficiently, that is the isoform we used for subsequent experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors propose that ORP3 may dually (a) activate IQSEC1 function and (b) function to flip PI4P out of the PM and a specific PC into the OM. It is unclear whether these are the same mechanism or parallel. Depletion of PI4P by a PI4K inhibitor GSK-A1 inhibits invasion, suggesting that PI4P is needed, possibly as a substrate for ORP3 in migration. However, is PI4P needed for ORP3-stimulated IQSEC1-mediated ARF5 GTP-loading? Does GSK-A1 reduce ARF5-GTP levels?</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that PI4P at the PM is indeed required as a substrate for exchange with PC from the ER, and that the lipid exchange mechanism is distinct from its allosteric activation of IQSec1. As noted by the reviewer, inhibition of this exchange inhibits migration. Interestingly, depletion of PI4P with GSK-A1 actually <italic>increases</italic> Arf5 activity (not shown). This suggests that ORP3 may be trapped in an open conformation that favors its interaction with IQSec1 if exchange cannot be completed. This finding complements our observation that rapid cycling Arf5 cannot drive adhesion turnover in the absence of ORP3 (Figure 7K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Mass spec for interactors of IQSEC1, and lipid cargoes for ORP3 are identified and discussed. These data are not included, other than key targets. If the data is not present, the validity of claims for interaction or presence cannot be evaluated. These should not be included.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are now included as Source Data 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 7G reports which lipid species may be exchanged by ORP3. However, replicate information is missing, as is any other species identity to put this in context of potential enrichment scores for this lipid.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a new Figure 7I, which shows the level of enrichment for other lipids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The inclusion of PTPN13 and E-Syt3 as interactors of IQSEC1 is confusing (Figure 3). These are not further investigated. What is their reasoning for inclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>We had originally included blots validating that PTPN13 and E-Syt3 interact with IQSec1 as additional confirmation of our mass spec analysis. However, we agree that this was confusing and have removed those blots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) A previous paper (Weber-Boyvat et al., 2015) showed ORP3-VAPA binding regulates R-Ras to control integrin activation status. The authors cite this paper but fail to discuss these (highly relevant) findings in the context of their own study. Is it possible that all the effects seen here are mediated through this previously published pathway? It is notable here that the data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 suggesting increased VAPA in the ORP3-IQSec1 complex was not convincing as shown and no statistics were presented. Nevertheless, if VAPA associates with this complex, this suggests Ras may also play a role. It would be very helpful to discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown above (point #5), we have been unable to recapitulate either the interaction of R-Ras with ORP3 even in the presence of exogenous VAPA, or to detect any change in its activity upon knockdown of either ORP3 or IQSec1. For this reason, we have not included discussion of this point in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
