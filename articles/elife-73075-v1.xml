impinges upon the transcription coactivator Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP). Hippo-YAP signaling has been shown to play key roles both at the early embryonic stages of implantation and gastrulation, and later during neurogenesis. To explore YAP’s potential role in neurulation, we used self-organizing neuruloids grown from human embryonic stem cells on micropatterned substrates. We identified YAP activation as a key lineage determinant, first between neuronal ectoderm and nonneuronal ectoderm, and later between epidermis and neural crest, indicating that YAP activity can enhance the effect of BMP4 stimulation and therefore affect ectodermal specification at this developmental stage. Because aberrant Hippo-YAP signaling has been implicated in the pathology of Huntington’s Disease (HD), we used isogenic mutant neuruloids to explore the relationship between signaling and the disease. We found that HD neuruloids demonstrate ectopic activation of gene targets of YAP and that pharmacological reduction of YAP’s transcriptional activity can partially rescue the HD phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hippo pathway</kwd><kwd>neurulation</kwd><kwd>Huntington's Disease</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>ectodermal specification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005725</institution-id><institution>CHDI Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A-9423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piccolo</surname><given-names>Francesco M</given-names></name><name><surname>Haremaki</surname><given-names>Tomomi</given-names></name><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Qingyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Laundos</surname><given-names>Tiago L</given-names></name><name><surname>Beaudoin</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Brivanlou</surname><given-names>Ali H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beaudoin</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBO-LTF-254-2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Santis</surname><given-names>Riccardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DC016984</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gnedeva</surname><given-names>Ksenia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hudspeth</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD/BD/127997/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laundos</surname><given-names>Tiago L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a model of human neurulation (neuruloids), YAP is deferentially regulated across ecotodermal lineages, where it contributes to their differentiation and structural organization, and is hyper-active upon HD mutation, contributing to an HD-signature phenotype.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although the study of embryogenesis benefits from a broad array of model organisms and the conservation of mechanisms across species, elucidation of the particularities of human development remains challenging. The use of human pluripotent stem cells for the creation of synthetic human organoids has greatly enhanced our ability to investigate human development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). For example, the process of neurulation can be mimicked in vitro through micropattern-based neuruloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haremaki et al., 2019</xref>). This technique, which allows the generation of hundreds of virtually identical organotypic cultures, offers a powerful opportunity to investigate the molecular and biophysical principles of human neurulation and the associated diseases.</p><p>The Hippo pathway is an ancient and highly conserved signaling cascade that operates in numerous cell types and a variety of organisms. In contrast to developmental pathways that require specific ligand-receptor interactions, the Hippo pathway functions as an integrator of molecular signals and biophysical states, including cell polarity, adhesion, GPCR signaling, and mechanical forces sensed through the cytoskeleton. With key roles in development, homeostasis, and regeneration, the pathway interacts with other developmental and regulatory signals including Wnt, Notch, and TGFβ. Despite the apparent complexity, the core cascade is relatively simple, including the parallel mammalian STE20-like kinases 1 and 2 (MST1/2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MAP4K). The activity of these enzymes leads to phosphorylation of large tumor suppressor kinases 1 and 2 (LATS1/2), which in turn phosphorylate and limit the nuclear localization of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and the homologous WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (TAZ). When they translocate to the nucleus, YAP and TAZ cooperate with TEA-domain transcription factors (TEAD1/2/3/4) to activate the expression of a variety of genes associated with proliferation, cell survival, de-differentiation, and cellular morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davis and Tapon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hansen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Juan and Hong, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moya and Halder, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Hippo-YAP signaling is essential at various stages of embryonic development, including the zygote, early blastomeres, the inner cell mass (ICM), trophectoderm (TE), and the emergence of individual organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu and Guan, 2021</xref>). Because Yap<sup>−/−</sup> mice die at E8.5 owing to the failure of endothelium formation in the yolk sac, and Yap<sup>−/−</sup>, Taz<sup>−/−</sup> embryos fail prior to the morula stage, investigating the potential role of Yap in neurulation in vivo requires complex transgenic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morin-Kensicki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>). The use of neuruloids derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) therefore offers a convenient, highly reproducible, and quantitative alternative means of investigating the role of Hippo signaling in neurulation.</p><p>Here, we identify YAP activation as a key lineage determinant, first between neuronal ectoderm (NE) and nonneuronal ectoderm (NNE), and later between epidermis and neural crest (NC), in human embryo models. Exploiting the reproducible phenotype of Huntington’s Disease (HD) mutations in neuruloids, we additionally find that HD neuruloids demonstrate stronger YAP’s downstream transcriptional signature and that the pharmacological reduction of YAP’s transcriptional activity partially reverses the HD phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential YAP activity in neural and nonneural ectoderm</title><p>In order to study the role of the Hippo pathway during human neurulation in vitro, we applied a neuruloid assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haremaki et al., 2019</xref>).

As previously reported, stimulation until the fourth day after plating, which we designate hereafter as D4, led to the induction of NNE at the edge and NE in the center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haremaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of YAP expression and localization in early neuruloids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During the first 4 days of the differentiation protocol, pluripotent hESCs seeded on a micropattern undergo 3 days of neural induction (SB +LDN) followed by BMP4 induction of neurulation (SB +BMP4).

Although exploring the role of this pathway during human development remains a challenge, organoid cultures derived from hESCs offer simplified simulacra for investigation. Here, we have identified YAP as an important determinant in neurulation, during which the protein’s activity is controlled—at least in part—by the Hippo pathway. Our data suggest that YAP plays a role in the specification of early ectodermal lineages, first influencing the differentiation between NNE and NE, and then between epidermis and NC. Because YAP transcriptional activity is already robust at D4 in precursors of the epidermis, the Hippo pathway might play an early role in the specification of NNE during neurulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the unbalanced differentiation of the NNE, YAP activation also results in the failure of the central NE domain to properly close into a compact structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Future investigations will determine whether this phenotype is a cell-intrinsic result of the ectopic YAP activation in the NE lineage, or is instead an indirect consequence of the lack of the NC lineage at its margin, which might be required to provide structural support for the closure of the NE domain. This second scenario would be consistent with a recent study showing that both NE and NNE contribute to the folding morphogenesis during human neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karzbrun et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), our results illustrate a reciprocal relationship between Hippo-YAP and BMP4-SAMD1/5 signaling during the development of the nervous system. In particular, YAP expression rises upon BMP4 stimulation, and YAP activation in turn enhances the cellular response to BMP4 at various stages: initially by augmenting BMP4-dependent NNE induction, and later by favoring the specification of epidermis, which is known to occur at a high BMP4 concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilson and Hemmati-Brivanlou, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Earlier reports showed that YAP is involved in various stages of NC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>), including the proliferation of NC precursors in animal models such as <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gee et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, YAP has been associated with stem cell-derived NC specification in a BMP4-independent manner in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hindley et al., 2016</xref>). These reports contrast with our finding that, in the context of BMP4 induction, excessive YAP activity can skew NNE specification toward an epidermal lineage at the expense of NC. These differences might stem from an epistatic relationship between the Hippo-YAP and BMP pathways during human neurulation, when YAP activity could sensitize cells to BMP stimuli.</p><p>In agreement with recent reports showing that YAP is required for early ectodermal specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giraldez et al., 2021</xref>), the pharmacological inhibition of YAP transcriptional activity with verteporfin during the early phase of neural induction (D0–D3) results in cell death. However, subsequent administration of verteporfin is inconsequential for the generation of WT neuruloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result indicates that YAP can influence ectodermal specification during neurulation, perhaps by boosting BMP4 signaling, but its activity is not required.</p><p>Noting the similarities between TRULI-treated neuruloids and those bearing HD mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haremaki et al., 2019</xref>), we explored the potential contribution of YAP dysregulation to the HD phenotype. HD-neuruloids displayed altered YAP regulation that resulted in ectopic activation of its transcriptional program, especially within the NE lineage. This HD-associated YAP hyperactivity results in an unbalanced differentiation of the NNE lineage as well as increased cell proliferation and might contribute directly to the failure of compaction in the central NE, even though this structure is devoid of YAP detectable by immunofluorescence.</p><p>Although individuals with HD have not been reported to experience a failure in folding of the neural tube or effects on fertility rate, there is a large body of evidence that connects HTT activity to developmental events. First, homozygote loss of function in the mouse leads to embryonic lethality at the onset of gastrulation, demonstrating that the function of the protein is necessary for early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nasir et al., 1995</xref>). Consistent with that result, no human of the HTT<sup>−/−</sup> genotype is ever born. Second, in human embryos, the HD mutation impacts development as early as gestational week 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnat et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, CAG expansion in HD patients causes early fetal anatomical abnormalities including an effect on ventricular volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hobbs et al., 2010</xref>). The earliest postnatal death due to HD in humans has been reported at 18 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nicolas et al., 2011</xref>). Perhaps the most stringent evidence linking the causality of HD to early embryogenesis is the fact that a pulse of expression of expanded CAG-HTT in a WT mouse leads to the emergence of HD symptoms in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Molero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wiatr et al., 2018</xref>). Third, guided differentiation of hESCs toward mature cortical neurons, self-organizing cerebroids, gastruloids, and neuruloids all point to CAG-length-dependent embryonic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Galgoczi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haremaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ruzo et al., 2018</xref>). Our study demonstrates that HTT-CAG expansion affects a model for human neurulation and that this phenotype is associated with the dysregulation of the Hippo pathway, with an increase of YAP activity early at D4 and later reduction by D7.</p><p>Owing to homeostatic and compensatory mechanisms, development in vivo is likely to be more robust than that in vitro. As a result, the neuruloid offers a sensitive assay for subtle phenomena that might otherwise remain hidden. Because our data suggest that neurulation is perturbed in HD, exploring how the developing human embryo compensates for this challenge could yield insight into the dysfunction manifested postnatally.</p><p>Several studies support the role for YAP in the pathophysiology of HD. Postmortem cortical samples from HD patients display diminished YAP activity. Moreover, YAP activators ameliorate symptoms in HD mice and normalize the phenotypes of cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mueller et al., 2018</xref>). In our data, YAP activation at D4 was elevated in HD neuruloids compared to WT controls, but at D7, YAP transcription was instead diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). This reversal might reflect compensation for increased YAP activity so that development could proceed normally. The reversal might alternatively represent an end state of failed development. It will be interesting to investigate whether YAP hyperactivation during early neurulation leads to hypoactivity in mature neurons. Lats1/2 knockout mice demonstrate that Hippo signaling later regulates the number and differentiation of neural progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lavado et al., 2018</xref>), and postmortem analysis of HD patients shows significantly increased proliferation of subependymal neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Curtis et al., 2005</xref>). These results suggest that the effects of <italic>HTT</italic> mutations on this process through YAP dysregulation bear on the pathophysiology of the disease.</p><p>Our study leaves open the question of the connection between Hippo signaling and HD. Huntingtin protein is known to play a role in vesicle trafficking and establishing apical-basal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Caviston and Holzbaur, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Galgoczi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saudou and Humbert, 2016</xref>), a prime regulator of Hippo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>). The protein is also involved in the establishment and maintenance of intact epithelia, a function that is compromised by HD mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Galgoczi et al., 2021</xref>). Loss of intercellular adhesion might contribute directly to dysregulation of the Hippo pathway, reflected here as increased YAP activity. In this scenario, it is possible that CAG expansion at the HTT locus effects cell-cell contact, disrupting proper epithelial integrity and in turn dysregulating the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, lack of proper epithelial polarity could also result in the mislocalization of morphogen receptors and thus in increased sensitivity of BMP4/SMAD1/5 signaling, which in turn could affect the Hippo pathway.

Twelve images representative of the data were selected to train Ilastik, an interactive learning and segmentation toolkit, to classify each pixel into two categories: nucleus or background. The pixels in the nucleus class were then used to create a binary mask. The original z-slice image was then processed to detect seeds based on a sphere filter with a manually set threshold. Watershedding was then applied from the defined seeds into the mask of the nuclei as defined previously by Ilastik, resulting in a set of segmented nuclei. The median intensity of PAX6, SOX10, or YAP immunofluorescence was then measured for each segmented nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p>Micropatterned glass coverslips with neuruloids 500 μm in diameter were grown in 3 ng/ml BMP4 from RUES2 hESCs and the isogenic 56CAG HD line. On D4, approximately half of the neuruloids on each coverslip were scraped off and treated for 10 min at 37°C with Accutase (Stemcell Technologies). The remaining neuruloids were fixed for immunofluorescence analysis as a quality control. After dissociation, the cells were washed three times in PBS−/− (Gibco) with 0.04% bovine serum albumin and strained through a 40-μm tip strainer (Flowmi 136800040). The number and viability of cells were determined by exclusion of trypan blue on a Countess II automated cell counter. The samples were separately loaded for capture with the Chromium System using Single Cell 3' v2 reagents (10× Genomics). Following cell capture and lysis, cDNA was synthesized and amplified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting libraries were sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 SP flowcell. The Cell Ranger software pipeline (v2.0.2) was used to create FASTQ files that aligned to the hg19 genome with default parameters. Filtered gene-expression matrices of genes versus detected barcodes (cells) with counts of unique molecular identifiers were generated and used for subsequent analyses. These data are available through NCBI accession number GSE182074.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Single-cell RNA analysis</title><p>The sequencing data were analyzed using Cellranger count (v3.0.2) and aggregated with the Aggr function and default settings. The aggregated datasets were processed with Seurat (v3.2.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). Quality control and filtering were performed with Scater Bioconductor (v1.16.1) to identify and remove poor-quality cells characterized by low library sizes, low numbers of expressed genes, and low or high numbers of mitochondrial reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McCarthy et al., 2017</xref>). Following a cutoff step (counts &gt;6000; genes &gt;2600; 3% &lt;mitochondrial genes &lt;11 %), we obtained about 8000 cells in WT and roughly 6000 cells for HD. Counts of genes in each cell were normalized and log<sub>10</sub>-transformed. In order to merge the data sets using Seurat’s FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData methods, we identified integration anchors for the WT and HD datasets by means of the top 2000 variable genes and first 20 principal components. The cell cycle phase was estimated by Seurat with default setting and data were rescaled to remove the effects of cell cycle and mitochondrial transcript expression. Clustering of cell was performed with Seurat’s findClusters function by use of the first 20 principal components and with two resolutions—0.5 and 0.1—to yield sets of seven clusters and two clusters, respectively. The seven-cluster set was further aggregated by manual curation of cell-type specific markers into four clusters. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimension reduction implemented within Seurat was applied to the normalized, integrated data and the cluster sets projected and visualized on the resulting UMAP coordinates. Visualization of normalized expression values on UMAP coordinates and as violin plots were performed using Seurat’s FeaturePlot and VlnPlot, respectively. Differential gene expression and analysis between clusters and samples were performed by MAST (v1.8.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Finak et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Raman M Das (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. While the reviewers see merit in the work, they also recommend extensive revisions to improve quantitation and clarify the results. The full reviews are enclosed to help in the revision process.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The manuscript requires additional quantifications and an expanded discussion.</p><p>2. The authors should look at upstream effectors of the Hippo pathway and assess the effects of YAP activity on proliferation.</p><p>3. The authors must resolve the inconsistencies in the model and improve quantification strategies, as detailed in the full reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– In Figure 5 the authors present the upregulation of YAP target genes in the epidermal lineage. The dataset of 364 genes employed for this analysis (Zanconato et al., 2015) was developed in epithelial-like breast cancer cells and may not represent the downstream targets of Hippo signaling in the developing ectoderm.</p><p>– Introduction and discussion are insufficiently referenced.</p><p>– Statistics for violin plots in figures 5, S6, S7, S9 and for box plots in Figure 2D should be included.</p><p>– Legends of Fig6 and FigS8 indicate &quot;PAX10&quot; expression in NC instead of SOX10.</p><p>– Supplemental figure 2A and 2B do not correspond to the description in the figure and text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript identifies YAP signalling as key player in lineage determination during development of early human ectoderm. Additionally, the authors show that neuroloids generated using cells engineered to express penetrant levels of CAG repeats in the HTT gene display aberrant YAP signalling during ectodermal specification and that this phenotype can be partially rescued by inhibition of this pathway. The similarity of the YAP-activated neuroloids and the HD neuroloids is striking and important. However, the study should be improved by providing clear mechanistic experiments to definitively demonstrate the role of YAP signalling in NNE specification and in HD neuroloids.</p><p>– It could also be useful to look at various proteins within the Hippo pathway to show dynamics across the colony over neural induction.</p><p>– In figure 1E, it is hard to distinguish the localization of YAP within the nucleus – it would be useful to show higher resolution images with H2B-Cherry cells like in SFig2, or simply fixed-and-stained for YAP compared to DAPI to show redistribution of YAP over neural induction. Quantification of colocalization within the nucleus is needed.</p><p>– It would be helpful if the authors could show higher resolution still images to document what they mean by &quot;nuclear cytoplasmic flux.&quot; Right now the data is rather unconvincing that it is shuttling out of the nucleus. Quantification of fluorescence intensities within the nucleus compared to outside of the cell would be needed to show that YAP is indeed shuttling outside the nucleus. Would it be possible to use a cell membrane marker to show that this YAP shuttling conserves the protein over time – as in, all of the accounted for nuclear YAP is maintained and pushed to the cytoplasm?</p><p>– Quantifications of fluorescence intensities of the blots would be useful to measure increases in expression.</p><p>– Statistics are needed for the change in expression levels in 2C – is this a significant change? Also what are the Y axes?</p><p>– In 2D they describe nuclear YAP exclusion from the nucleus but it is difficult to discern where exactly the signal is coming from without a DAPI channel or zoomed images of nuclear exclusion. It would be also interesting to describe the extent of nuclear exclusion and if that correlates with KRT18 expression. Does the more nuclear YAP dictate how much KRT18 expression there is?</p><p>– Similar quantifications of cytoplasmic/nuclear expression is needed for Figure 4.</p><p>– The authors describe that verteporfin results in loss of cell adhesion in both WT and HD samples but do not show images describing this phenomenon. As a control it would be useful to show that adhesions are maintained over the course of neuroloid development with and without Verteporfin treatment.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, the authors demonstrate that the YAP signature is highly enriched in the NE cluster in HD neuroloids, however, their staining and previous figures show little to no YAP localisation within the PAX6+ NE.</p><p>Significant extra analysis of the downstream ramifications of aberrantly increased YAP signalling in the NE is necessary.</p><p>The authors claim that increased YAP activity leads to increased NNE and epidermal cell commitment but this is not reflected in the scRNAseq data (Figure 5). It would be valuable to include more robust identification of lineages that includes multiple markers for each lineage (a heat map will illustrate this nicely).</p><p>– While the authors use TRULI and Verteporfin to study the effects of YAP on neural induction, it would be worthwhile to visualize via fix-and-stains other members of the HIPPO pathway (and especially members downstream of YAP) to show if there are similar effects of nuclear exclusion in WT and HD neuruloids.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors report exclusion of Yap from nuclei at D3, when neural induction occurs. Is this indicative of initiation of Hippo signalling? Are the upstream stimuli that may lead to Hippo activation here known? Perhaps the authors could speculate on this a bit more in the discussion? Also, YAP is again upregulated upon BMP stimulation at D4, but is BMP directly activating Hippo signalling here?</p><p>Although of considerable interest, the connection between human neurulation and Huntington's Disease could be improved a bit. I wonder if the authors could expand on their discussion of the similarities between TRULI treatment and HD neuruloids. This is a particularly intriguing finding, as the authors state, since HD symptoms manifest only in adulthood. Are embryos carrying the htt mutation less likely to complete development and is there an effect in fertility rates? It would also be interesting if the authors could comment on juvenile HD, which has a much earlier onset of symptoms.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Overall, the authors have not presented key experimental details such as the number of neuruloids assessed for each experiment. This information will need to be added to improve confidence in the conclusions.</p><p>2. Perhaps the presentation of Video 1 could be improved to better display the nuclear-cytoplasmic flux of YAP. An enlarged region of representative cells undergoing said flux would be a welcome addition here as would slowing down the video.</p><p>3. The data presented in supplementary figure 2 is meant to show the effect of cell density and TRULI treatment on YAP localisation. However, this figure is difficult to interpret as all the panes appear to have similar YAP expression and localisation. Has this data been quantified? An indication of the percentages of cells with nuclear or cytoplasmic YAP would be useful here as would be zoomed images of representative cells.</p><p>4. Figure 2D is difficult to interpret as presented here. For example, it is not clear if any Pax6 positive cells are also expressing YAP. It would be useful to split the channels here.</p><p>5. Although it is clear that YAP is present in KRT18 nuclei (Figure 2E), there are a number of other cells in the region that are KRT18 negative but still present nuclear YAP. Are these cells also destined to acquire epidermal fate?</p><p>6. On page 6 and in following sections, the authors state that administration of TRULI leads to enhanced YAP activity. However, the data only really demonstrates nuclear localisation rather than activity. Granted, the later scRNA seq experiments then confirm this finding. Perhaps this statement could be toned down here.</p><p>7. The control images shown in figure 3 appear to also possess a lumen, albeit this is smaller than the lumen of the TRULI treated neuruloids. Is this indicative of slower neurulation compared to controls? Should neurulation be complete at the stages shown? I assume this is the case as the images shown in figure 2D show fully closed lumens.</p><p>8.

The manuscript requires additional quantifications and an expanded discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added quantification of nuclear YAP accumulation and included additional quantification of live YAP-GFP in pluripotency. The discussion has also been expanded to include a potential connection between the HD-neuruloid phenotype and the pathophysiology of HD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should look at upstream effectors of the Hippo pathway and assess the effects of YAP activity on proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed below in our response to reviewers, our analysis of upstream components derived from our data that indicate expression of all canonical components of the Hippo pathway at comparable expression levels across ectodermal lineages and between WT and HD samples. We also expand on our hypothesis regarding the connection between HD and YAP dysregulation as well as current technical limitations in further speculations regarding the upstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. We have also assessed, by two independent means the effects of YAP activation on the rate of cell division, using our scRNA-seq dataset at D4 to calculate the velocity of cell cycle-associated genes, and a direct count of mitotic cells at different time points during neuruloid formation. This analysis is now presented in a new supplemental figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). We show that there is an acceleration of the cell cycle associated with YAP activation or HD mutation, reinforcing our main conclusion that HD neuruloids display hyperactive YAP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors must resolve the inconsistencies in the model and improve quantification strategies, as detailed in the full reviews below.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now resolved apparent inconsistencies in our model by improving our schematic on Figure 6E, and provide further clarifications throughout the manuscript. We have also added nine supplemental figures that we believe, strengthen the conclusions of our study. Quantification strategies and methods have been clarified and strengthened as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– In Figure 5 the authors present the upregulation of YAP target genes in the epidermal lineage. The dataset of 364 genes employed for this analysis (Zanconato et al., 2015) was developed in epithelial-like breast cancer cells and may not represent the downstream targets of Hippo signaling in the developing ectoderm.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, the list of YAP target was established in a different context, which is not necessarily maintained here. However, we believe that this is the best approximation available to determine genes that are potentially directly regulated by YAP. Moreover, commonly cited YAP target genes are included in the dataset, which is also used in other studies (Kastan et al., 2021). Given epigenetic accessibility, the target specificity for a transcription factor is given by the promoter sequences, which do not change in different contexts. Therefore, it is true that not all 364 genes are YAP targets in this neuruloid context, but many of them are in progenitors of the epidermis lineage, which is the one that displays the strongest nuclear YAP signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Introduction and discussion are insufficiently referenced.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added additional references to introduction and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Statistics for violin plots in figures 5, S6, S7, S9 and for box plots in Figure 2D should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now included additional supplemental figures containing tables for the statistical analysis of scRNA-seq violin plots (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 17). Furthermore, we now include relevant statistics for the boxplot in Figure 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Legends of Fig6 and FigS8 indicate &quot;PAX10&quot; expression in NC instead of SOX10.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out; we have corrected the typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Supplemental figure 2A and 2B do not correspond to the description in the figure and text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out; we have now corrected this discrepancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript identifies YAP signalling as key player in lineage determination during development of early human ectoderm. Additionally, the authors show that neuroloids generated using cells engineered to express penetrant levels of CAG repeats in the HTT gene display aberrant YAP signalling during ectodermal specification and that this phenotype can be partially rescued by inhibition of this pathway. The similarity of the YAP-activated neuroloids and the HD neuroloids is striking and important. However, the study should be improved by providing clear mechanistic experiments to definitively demonstrate the role of YAP signalling in NNE specification and in HD neuroloids.</p><p>– It could also be useful to look at various proteins within the Hippo pathway to show dynamics across the colony over neural induction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the discussion about potential consequences of increased YAP activity and looked into the expression level of other components of the Hippo pathway across the three ectodermal lineage progenitors at D4 (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). This analysis showed that the Hippo pathway is active in all the cells at this stage. Unfortunately, antibodies for the proteins expressed by these genes did not work in our hands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In figure 1E, it is hard to distinguish the localization of YAP within the nucleus – it would be useful to show higher resolution images with H2B-Cherry cells like in SFig2, or simply fixed-and-stained for YAP compared to DAPI to show redistribution of YAP over neural induction. Quantification of colocalization within the nucleus is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1E correspond to samples that were fixed and labeled for YAP, TFAP2A and DAPI. The DAPI signal was then used to segment individual nuclei, which allowed the measurement of the YAP signal in the nucleus of each cell. Following the reviewer’s recommendation, and to better clarify this point we now include magnified videos of live YAP-GFP;H2B-mCHerry and YAP-GFP neuruloids (D3-D4; Figure 1—video 2, Figure 1—video 3, Figure 1—video 5, Figure 1—video 6, Figure 4—video 2 and Figure 4—video 3); as well as magnified confocal images of fixed and stained (DAPI/YAP) D4 neuruloids, in both cases for WT, WT+TRULI, and HD lines (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be helpful if the authors could show higher resolution still images to document what they mean by &quot;nuclear cytoplasmic flux.&quot; Right now the data is rather unconvincing that it is shuttling out of the nucleus. Quantification of fluorescence intensities within the nucleus compared to outside of the cell would be needed to show that YAP is indeed shuttling outside the nucleus. Would it be possible to use a cell membrane marker to show that this YAP shuttling conserves the protein over time – as in, all of the accounted for nuclear YAP is maintained and pushed to the cytoplasm?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion from our use of the term “flux&quot;. Upon BMP4 induction, YAP is upregulated and found in the nucleus of some cell at the edge of the colony. This effect is regulated by the Hippo pathway, which when active—in terms of phosphorylation—retains YAP in the cytoplasm. Thus, TRULI (a Hippo inhibitor) increases the amount of YAP that becomes free to translocate into the nucleus (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 5). Our focus is not with the bidirectional flux but rather the absolute measurable <italic>increase</italic> in nuclear localization upon Hippo inhibition.</p><p>We performed these analyses using confocal images of cells labeled for YAP and DAPI, using the latter to identify nuclei and then measure the amount of nuclear YAP signal, and plotted as a radial distribution. As motioned above, we have now added new supplemental material including highly magnified videos of living D3-D4 neuruloids (Figure 1—video 2, Figure 1—video 3, Figure 1—video 5, Figure 1—video 6, Figure 4—video 2 and Figure 4—video 3) as well as magnification of DAPI/YAP confocal images for WT, WT+TRULI, and HD lines (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Quantifications of fluorescence intensities of the blots would be useful to measure increases in expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We now added a Supplemental Figure with quantification of the immunoblot data (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Statistics are needed for the change in expression levels in 2C – is this a significant change? Also what are the Y axes?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s advice, we have now added the label for the Y axes as “cell counts&quot;, and performed two-way ANOVA and non-parametric multiple <italic>t</italic>-tests on two experiments, showing <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.000001 for both settings. The statistics have been added to the Figure Legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In 2D they describe nuclear YAP exclusion from the nucleus but it is difficult to discern where exactly the signal is coming from without a DAPI channel or zoomed images of nuclear exclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the reviewer, a Supplementary Figure with higher magnification that increases the resolution in different channels has now been added (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be also interesting to describe the extent of nuclear exclusion and if that correlates with KRT18 expression. Does the more nuclear YAP dictate how much KRT18 expression there is?</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout this study KRT18 has been used as a cell-type specific marker to identify early progenitors of the epidermal lineage, in terms of YAP activity and expression. Our study does not address direct regulation of KRT18 by YAP, which is outside of the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Similar quantifications of cytoplasmic/nuclear expression is needed for Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>As in Figure 1E, Figure 4B shows the fixed and labeled confocal images of D4 neuruloids (YAP/DAPI), in which the DAPI signal was used to perform nuclear segmentation and then to quantify the amount of nuclear YAP signal in WT and HD specimens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors describe that verteporfin results in loss of cell adhesion in both WT and HD samples but do not show images describing this phenomenon. As a control it would be useful to show that adhesions are maintained over the course of neuroloid development with and without Verteporfin treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the misunderstanding. Following verteporfin treatment during the first three days of the neuronal induction, the cells die and detach from the dish. This is not entirely surprising given that it has been shown that YAP activity is required for early ectodermal differentiation. We have now stated this point more clearly in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps most importantly, the authors demonstrate that the YAP signature is highly enriched in the NE cluster in HD neuroloids, however, their staining and previous figures show little to no YAP localisation within the PAX6+ NE.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, we were able to measure YAP activity by examining the expression of its target genes by scRNA-seq, a methodology that is far more sensitive than imaging. We conclude that the hyperactivation of YAP occurs highly in the NNE at the periphery and is very subtle in the NE at the center. However, because the level of YAP activity in NE is very low, a subtle increase results in a multifold change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significant extra analysis of the downstream ramifications of aberrantly increased YAP signalling in the NE is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>While this might be an interesting analysis, it falls outside the scope of our study. Nevertheless, we have now included a robust analysis on the cell cycle effects of YAP activation, and cover potential implications in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that increased YAP activity leads to increased NNE and epidermal cell commitment but this is not reflected in the scRNAseq data (Figure 5). It would be valuable to include more robust identification of lineages that includes multiple markers for each lineage (a heat map will illustrate this nicely).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion, which we have followed. A heatmaps of the top (100 and 20) genes that are differentially expressed most significantly across the three lineages has now been added (Figure 5—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– While the authors use TRULI and Verteporfin to study the effects of YAP on neural induction, it would be worthwhile to visualize via fix-and-stains other members of the HIPPO pathway (and especially members downstream of YAP) to show if there are similar effects of nuclear exclusion in WT and HD neuruloids.</p></disp-quote><p>As we show in supplemental Figure 5—figure supplement 3, the canonical components of the Hippo pathway upstream of YAP are expressed. Moreover, expression of LATS proteins in the cells where TRULY induces YAP activation suggests that at least some of the canonical Hippo signaling component are at play. Published antibodies for upstream components do not work in our hands, but even so, the non-YAP components of the Hippo pathway do not shuttle into and out of the nucleus, for their activity occurs in the cytoplasm. It is when the Hippo phosphorylation cascade is <italic>inactive</italic>, and YAP remains unphosphorylated, that YAP alone <italic>relocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus</italic> at an increased rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors report exclusion of Yap from nuclei at D3, when neural induction occurs. Is this indicative of initiation of Hippo signalling? Are the upstream stimuli that may lead to Hippo activation here known? Perhaps the authors could speculate on this a bit more in the discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>Dissecting the exact upstream regulatory mechanisms of Hippo signaling in this context is very challenging, for the pathway functions as a hub for a plethora of inputs. However, our interpretation is that HD mutation results in abnormal epithelial polarity, which in turn might dysregulate the Hippo pathway. Following the reviewer’s advice, we have now extended this part of the Discussion to address this more fully.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, YAP is again upregulated upon BMP stimulation at D4, but is BMP directly activating Hippo signalling here?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for raising this issue. The upregulation of YAP at the edge of the colony is induced by BMP4 stimulation. We have added a Supplemental Figure showing that the increase of nuclear YAP at D4 of the differentiation protocol is dependent on BMP4 stimulation (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A). Our video (Figure 1—video 1) shows that the upregulation of YAP at the edge of the colony occurs 18–20 hrs after BMP4 stimulation, suggesting that YAP expression might be directly regulated by SMAD1. To corroborate this hypothesis, we looked into a published dataset of SMAD1 ChIPseq performed in hESC (Tsancov et al., 2015), which shows that SMAD1 binds to the regulatory region of YAP and therefore could directly regulate YAP expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although of considerable interest, the connection between human neurulation and Huntington's Disease could be improved a bit. I wonder if the authors could expand on their discussion of the similarities between TRULI treatment and HD neuruloids. This is a particularly intriguing finding, as the authors state, since HD symptoms manifest only in adulthood. Are embryos carrying the htt mutation less likely to complete development and is there an effect in fertility rates? It would also be interesting if the authors could comment on juvenile HD, which has a much earlier onset of symptoms.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s advice, we have now expanded our Discussion to consider more widely the potential developmental implication of HD mutation, including comments on the juvenile forms of HD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Overall, the authors have not presented key experimental details such as the number of neuruloids assessed for each experiment. This information will need to be added to improve confidence in the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We apologize for this omission and have now included the number of colonies analyzed in each experiment in the Figure Legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Perhaps the presentation of Video 1 could be improved to better display the nuclear-cytoplasmic flux of YAP. An enlarged region of representative cells undergoing said flux would be a welcome addition here as would slowing down the video.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we apologize for the confusion created by our use of the term “flux”, which we agree can be misleading. We show that following BMP4 stimulation, YAP expression is upregulated at the edge of the colonies and sporadically localizes into the nucleus. Upon TRULI treatment or HD mutation, cells at the edge fail to retain YAP in the cytoplasm, resulting in increased nuclear YAP localization. To clarify this point, we have rephrased the term “flux” and included, as suggested, magnified and slowed videos of YAP-GFP/H2B-mCherry D3-D4 neuruloids (Figure 1—video 2, Figure 1—video 3, Figure 1—video 5, Figure 1—video 6, Figure 4—video 2 and Figure 4—video 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The data presented in supplementary figure 2 is meant to show the effect of cell density and TRULI treatment on YAP localisation. However, this figure is difficult to interpret as all the panes appear to have similar YAP expression and localisation. Has this data been quantified? An indication of the percentages of cells with nuclear or cytoplasmic YAP would be useful here as would be zoomed images of representative cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now performed quantitative analysis of these samples, where we calculated the ratios of YAP nuclear/cytoplasmic signals in live cell imaging. The ratios were determined by segmenting nuclei based on the H2B-mCherry channel and using an inverted nuclear mask to obtain the average cytoplasmic signal (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2D is difficult to interpret as presented here. For example, it is not clear if any Pax6 positive cells are also expressing YAP. It would be useful to split the channels here.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now added a Supplementary Figure with details of D4 to D6 neuruloids in split channels (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Although it is clear that YAP is present in KRT18 nuclei (Figure 2E), there are a number of other cells in the region that are KRT18 negative but still present nuclear YAP. Are these cells also destined to acquire epidermal fate?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. Figure 2E reports representative images of neuruloids at D5 when epidermal fate begins to emerge with few cells to expressing KRT18. We believe that all cells that display nuclear YAP at this stage will eventually become epidermis and express KRT18.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. On page 6 and in following sections, the authors state that administration of TRULI leads to enhanced YAP activity. However, the data only really demonstrates nuclear localisation rather than activity. Granted, the later scRNA seq experiments then confirm this finding. Perhaps this statement could be toned down here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In the narrative of the manuscript, we have striven to discriminate localization of YAP from its demonstrated transcriptional activity. However, we believe that nuclear localization of YAP is a good readout of its activity, and is broadly used in the field as such. Additionally, and as the reviewer notes, we do have scRNA-seq results that show enriched activity of YAP target genes in the epidermal lineage; we also found strong YAP nuclear localization through immunohistochemistry and live imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The control images shown in figure 3 appear to also possess a lumen, albeit this is smaller than the lumen of the TRULI treated neuruloids. Is this indicative of slower neurulation compared to controls? Should neurulation be complete at the stages shown? I assume this is the case as the images shown in figure 2D show fully closed lumens.</p></disp-quote><p>The phenotype observed in neuruloids is due to both on the relative abundance of discrete lineages (increased epidermis and reduced NC), and on the structural level (failure in closing of the central NE domain). To clarify the point raised by the reviewer we now added a diagram (Figure 6E) to represent the structural aspect of the HD/YAP activation phenotype as well as a paragraph in the Discussion that addresses this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors report that administration of verteporfin in the first three days of culture leads to loss of cell adhesion, but there is not data shown to support this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. Verteporfin treatment during the first three days of neuruloid differentiation leads to cells death, leading to their detachment from the dish. To better clarify this point we have rephrased that line to be more explicit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The methods section should also include a section on immunoblotting.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a methods section for immunoblotting and the appropriate reference (Vrbský, et al., 2021)</p><p>We would like to thank all three reviewers for taking the time to evaluate our manuscripts and for their suggestions and comments, which we believe will strongly improve the quality of our study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
