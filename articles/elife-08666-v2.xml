In third instar larvae (L3), cells constituting the second tracheal metamere (Tr2) reenter the cell cycle. Clonal analysis of L3 Tr2 revealed that dividing cells in the dorsal trunk, dorsal branch and transverse connective branches respect lineage restriction boundaries near branch junctions. These boundaries corresponded to domains of gene expression, for example where cells expressing Spalt, Delta and Serrate in the dorsal trunk meet <italic>vein</italic>–expressing cells in the dorsal branch or transverse connective. Notch signaling was activated to one side of these borders and was required for the identity, specializations and segregation of border cells. These findings suggest that Tr2 is comprised of developmental compartments and that developmental compartments are an organizational feature relevant to branched tubular networks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08666.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08666.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08666.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As a fruit fly develops, its cells may sort themselves into groups according to the type of cell that they will eventually become. Some groups form ‘developmental compartments’ that are separated by boundaries that cells cannot move across. All the descendants of a cell in a compartment will activate the same specific gene (called a ‘selector’ gene) that determines their identity and fate. Similar compartments also form in the developing hindbrains of mammals, but it is not clear how general this mechanism of tissue patterning is.</p><p>Fruit fly larvae undergo a physical transformation called metamorphosis to become adult fruit flies. Here, Rao et al. discover that the cells in the developing airways (or trachea) of the larvae at the start of metamorphosis are organised into compartments. At this stage the cells in the trachea start to divide and grow to make the adult tracheal system. The experiments show that these cells do not spread from one main branch of the tracheal system into another. Instead, the cells cluster in locations where the different branches meet on either side of a straight boundary.</p><p>The cells on each side of these boundaries activate different genes that regulate their identity and development. For example, cells in one branch of the system switch on a selector gene that makes a protein called Spalt. A pathway known as Notch signaling is activated by cells on the other side of a nearby boundary in a different branch of the tracheal system. This separation of Spalt production and Notch activation establishes a cell communication system that keeps the cells of the different compartments apart.</p><p>Rao et al.’s findings reveal a role for the Notch protein in regulating the organization of cells into compartments to form branches in fruit fly airways. A future challenge is to find out if Notch plays a similar role in other branched tissues, such as blood vessels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08666.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08666.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>developmental compartments</kwd><kwd>trachea</kwd><kwd>notch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM030637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornberg</surname><given-names>Thomas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cells in the tracheal systems of fruit fly larvae are organised into compartments with precisely located boundaries, which pattern the formation of branched tubular networks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The importance of temporal- and position-specific gene expression to regional specialization is established for many tissues. It may be universal. In contrast, the roles and contributions of determined cell lineages are not as clear and may not be generally shared. In Drosophila, there are tissues that are dependent on cell lineages - examples include neurons in the developing brain (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spindler and Hartenstein, 2010</xref>) and the developmental compartments that produce the adult cuticle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crick and Lawrence, 1975</xref>). However, there are also organs such as the salivary gland, gut and tracheal system of the Drosophila embryo that form from groups of non-mitotic cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kerman et al., 2006</xref>). The cells of these organs are assigned to their roles after they have exited the cell cycle, and the programs of tubulogenesis and branching that generate them proceed without further cell divisions. Even the complex network of tracheal branches in the embryo forms in this way, and without an apparent role for defined lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Samakovlis et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The tracheal primordia, which have 80–90 cells, have been estimated to derive from approximately ten blastoderm-stage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1985</xref>). The primordia are first evident in the lateral embryonic ectoderm during stage 10 (4–5 hr after egg laying (AEL)) as twenty groups of cells with distinct morphology, and in early in stage 11, they form discrete pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilk et al., 1996</xref>). Three post-blastoderm cell divisions have occurred by early stage 11, but there are no additional mitoses until L3, when some tracheal cells re-initiate cell cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guha and Kornberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weaver and Krasnow, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Beginning at embryo stage 11, the tracheal pits invaginate, elongate and mold into more complex shapes, following a stereotyped program that generates the major tracheal branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Samakovlis et al., 1996</xref>). Although analysis of random clones revealed no consistent relationships between position and kinship that would suggest a role for cell lineage in assigning cells to a particular tracheal branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Samakovlis et al., 1996</xref>), there is evidence for region-specific and stage-specific gene expression, and mutant phenotypes suggest that these genes have essential roles in the morphogenetic processes that generate the branches. For example, <italic>trachealess (trh</italic>) is expressed by pit cells and in all tracheal progenitors, and in <italic>trh</italic> mutants, pits do not form and there is no apparent tracheal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Isaac and Andrew, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilk et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>Spalt (sal</italic>) is expressed in the dorsal part of the tracheal primordium that will form the dorsal branch (DB) and dorsal trunk (DT), and in <italic>sal</italic> mutants, the dorsal primordium expresses genes such as <italic>unplugged,</italic> which is normally only expressed ventrally, and its cells do not migrate normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franch-Marro and Casanova, 2002</xref>). These and other findings have been interpreted as dorsal to ventral transformations and as evidence that <italic>sal</italic> has a role in fate specification for particular branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhnlein and Schuh, 1996</xref>). Mutants defective for <italic>knirps (kni)</italic> and for Notch signaling have major branching abnormalities suggestive of general and persistent requirements that begin at the earliest primary branching stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghabrial and Krasnow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ikeya and Hayashi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llimargas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steneberg et al., 1999</xref>). Although these studies support the idea that specialization and branch formation are dependent on region-specific expression of several fate-determining genes, the expression patterns of these genes have not been precisely correlated (at cellular resolution) with branching morphologies. There is evidence supporting the presence of a <italic>kni</italic>-dependent border between DT and DB cells in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1998</xref>), but it is not known whether the different branches, either alone or in combination, exist as distinct regions that develop with unique genetic addresses.</p><p>Developmental compartments are regions whose constituent cells share a unique genetic address and are clonally isolated. They are polyclones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crick and Lawrence, 1975</xref>) - groups of cells that represent all the descendants of a small group of founder cells that grow but never mix with cells of other compartments or tissues. Compartments of the imaginal discs and abdominal histoblasts generate the epidermal and neuronal cells of the adult cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Baker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kornberg, 1981a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morata and Lawrence, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">1979</xref>). They do not include associated cells, such as the myoblasts and tracheal cells that develop together and in tight juxtaposition with the epithelial cells of the wing imaginal disc. The common ancestry of cells in the developmental compartments in the epithelia of imaginal discs is essential to the identity and function of these domains, and the adult cuticle does not develop normally if the compartment boundaries do not restrict cells to grow on one side or other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blair et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kornberg, 1981a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morata and Lawrence, 1975</xref>), or do not properly delimit the expression of certain genes to the cells of a particular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dominguez et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabata et al., 1995</xref>). The compartments are domains of gene expression and pattern whose geographical positions and limits are precisely defined. In the wing disc, the compartment borders set up and coincide in space with developmental organizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabata et al., 1995</xref>) and juxtapose groups of cells with opposite developmental polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Struhl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang and Kornberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia-Bellido and Santamaria, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawrence and Morata, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lawrence et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabata et al., 1995</xref>), but the generality of developmental compartments beyond the epithelial progenitors of the insect cuticle is uncertain. It is not known whether cell lineage domains that have been identified in other tissues, for example in the adult thoracic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lawrence, 1982</xref>) and midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marianes and Spradling, 2013</xref>), share these properties.</p><p>The work described here investigated cell lineage parameters in the Drosophila tracheal system at the L3 stage. In contrast to the process that forms the tracheal system in the embryo, the pupal and adult tracheal systems develop as their constituent cells proliferate. As noted above, the first post-embryonic cell divisions in Tr2 occur during L3 when its branches begin to reorganize in preparation for metamorphosis. We undertook a classical clonal analysis of the branches of Tr2 and found evidence of coincident lineage and gene expression domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The dynamics of tracheoblast proliferation in the dorsal trunk</title><p>At the beginning of L3, the branches of Tr2 are sparsely populated by large cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The DT has 16–18, the DB 8, and the transverse connective (TC) 5–7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guha and Kornberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weaver and Krasnow, 2008</xref>); there is no air sac primordium (ASP). The other tracheal metameres are similarly constituted, but in early L3, programs of cell division that are unique to Tr2 repopulate its branches with many cells and grow the ASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guha and Kornberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2008</xref>). At late L3, the DT has approximately 360 ± 40 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin, 2009</xref>). The DB also reinitiates cell cycling during L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weaver and Krasnow, 2008</xref>). Despite the difference in cell numbers between Tr2 and the other metameres, the general overall size of the branches in each metamere remains similar as the L3 larva grows because the proliferating Tr2 cells are smaller. To better understand the growth dynamics of the Tr2 tracheoblasts during L3, we induced random clones of marked cells in the DT and analyzed their size and distribution.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08666.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell divisions in the second tracheal metamere during the third instar.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Drawings of the Tr2 branches before (early L3) and after (late L3) the onset of cell divisions; dorsal trunk (DT), dorsal branch (DB), visceral branch (VB), spiracular branch (SB), transverse connective (TC), lateral trunk (LT), air sac primordium (ASP), region in which <italic>btl-Gal4</italic> is expressed (purple).

At 0–2 hr after the L2-3 molt, 22/24 marked cells appeared to be isolated singles without marked neighbors, as would be expected prior to onset of proliferation and for the observed frequency of recombination (11%). At 16–18 hr , 80% were still singles, but at 18–20 hr, 69% were clones of two adjacent cells. This suggests that re-entry into the cell cycle was synchronous and that most DT cells divide according to a similar schedule. The clones formed contiguous patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that the DT cells do not tend to migrate or intermix with their neighbors; there was no apparent bias to their distribution within the DT. Divisions continued with approximate synchrony and with cycle time (at 23°C) of 10–12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The time interval during L3 that follows the onset of mitotic cycling can therefore accommodate five divisions, and if all of the starting population contributes to growth, the five divisions are sufficient to produce all the cells in the DT of the wandering L3. The maximum clone size is predicted to be 32, suggesting that larger patches we identified represent &gt;1 independent clone whose descendants grew together.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Delimited gene expression domains of the dorsal trunk, dorsal branch and transverse connective</title><p>To identify genes that are expressed in Tr2 branches during L3, we screened approximately 1300 enhancer trap lines whose expression was uncharacterized, as well as a group of candidate genes that express in domains of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franch-Marro and Casanova, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhnlein and Schuh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llimargas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thomas et al., 1991</xref>) or larval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furriols and Bray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pitsouli and Perrimon, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2013</xref>) trachea for which either antibodies, enhancer trap lines, Gal4 lines, or enhancer reporter lines were available. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows expression patterns for seven genes that are expressed in discrete regions of the L3 Tr2.

For example, at the junction of the DT and DB, the DT cells, which expressed Sal, Ser and Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A’,B’,C’</xref>) but not Kni, were precisely juxtaposed to Kni-expressing DB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>”). Although the location of the border appeared to vary between different preparations, we attribute these varied appearances to the way the preparations rotated as they were mounted for viewing and to the fact that proximal/distal position of the border is not precisely the same around the circumference of the branch junction; in no specimen did we detect cells that expressed Kni together with Sal, Ser, or Delta.</p><p>Another common border appeared to separate the DT and TC. Cells on the trunk side of this border expressed Ser and Delta; cells on the other side expressed Cut and Vein. This border is more complex than the DT/DB border in several respects. First, the border extends a significant distance into the area of the DT and does not align with the DT/TC junction. Cells in this area of the DT are members of the TC lineage domain. Second, cells located in this part of the TC domain varied in number and size, and in contrast to the other Tr2 branches, there were large cells in this region in most wandering stage L3s. The number of large cells varied between 0–3. This may be a consequence of delayed entry into mitotic cycling by these cells and the possibility that some of the wandering L3s that we analyzed had not yet reached the stage when these cells start to divide; but we have not established the reason for the variability. Third, whereas all cells in the DT lineage domain expressed Sal and Ser at high levels and no cells in the TC lineage domain expressed either gene at high levels, in some samples, low level expression of Sal was detected in 1–2 TC domain cells that were adjacent to the DT domain on the “lower layer” next to the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,H’,H”</xref>). All cells in the region of the TC domain in the DT expressed Cut and Vein. We note that there are also small regions of gene expression or lineage ambiguities at the anterior/posterior (A/P) compartment borders of the wing and eye-antennal imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blair, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morata and Lawrence, 1979</xref>), and suggest that the TC is also a lineage domain despite the apparent ambiguity for Sal at the DT/TC boundary. The TC lineage domain is defined by expression of Cut and Vein and by lack of expression of Ser and Delta, and it includes a portion that is physically within the DT. Based on this model, we suggest that Tr2 has distinct domains of gene expression that correlate with the DB, DT and TC. No distinct domains of gene expression that delimited the ASP from the TC were observed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> depicts these DT, DB and TC domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Notch activation at branch junctions</title><p>To characterize the role of Ser and Delta in the L3 Tr2, we monitored Notch signal transduction with the NRE-<italic>lacZ</italic> Notch pathway transcriptional reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furriols and Bray, 2001</xref>).

Similar clonal analysis studies of the wing imaginal disc revealed that in different discs, clones occupied varied locations and produced varied shapes in the wing, indicating that the descendants of particular single cells do not generate designated areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bryant, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</xref>). The clone borders were “wiggly” except at compartment borders where they were straight (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawrence and Struhl, 1996</xref>). Although the tracheal branches are tubes, not epithelial sheets, we were able to map clones in the DT, DB and TC. Most of the clones arose in the DT (as expected because of the greater relative number of founder cells), and the number of cells around its circumference was large enough that we were able to evaluate the contours of DT clones.</p><p>We generated marked clones using eight different regimens that varied clone type (e.g., “standard flipout”, dual flipout clones, MARCM, and <italic>M</italic> MARCM) as well as time and length of induction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The clone frequency for regimens A and F were low and few specimens had more than one marked patch. Clone frequency for regimens B-E, G, H was greater: most DTs had clones, most DTs with clones had an average of more than one discrete patch of marked cells, and because many marked areas included more than 32 cells (the period during L3 when the cells divide after clone induction limits the number of mitoses to a maximum of five), these areas must be the descendants of more than one founder cell and represent more than one clone. Nevertheless, the clonal patches we observed in the DT, DB and TC appeared to have located randomly in these branches, and clones in the DT appeared to have “wiggly” borders except at the boundaries that delimit the DT, DB and TC expression domains. Among the 361 specimens we analyzed that had marked cells, 202 marked patches were identified that lined a portion of these borders.

It is most likely therefore that the patches that meet on either side of the DT/TC border represent more than one clone and therefore are not inconsistent with the model we propose - that the DT/DB border is also a line of clonal restriction.</p><p>87 marked patches were identified that lined the DT/TC border from either side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4 fig4s5 fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 4–6</xref>). All 40 DT and 15 of the TC clonal patches had multiple cells, but as noted above, most specimens had 1–3 large cells in the TC domain within the DT, and 1–2 of these were marked in 32 of the 87. 15 specimens were identified that had marked cells on both sides of the DT/TC border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>); in 13 of these, the only marked TC cell was a single large one. Because the number of specimens with marked DT patches at the border (55) was similar to the number of specimens with marked TC cells (62), we conclude that the number of cells on either side of the DT/TC border at the time of recombination was approximately the same. And because the number of specimens with marked cells on both sides of the DT/TC border (15/102) relative to those with clones only on one side (DT only (40) TC only (47) = 87/102) is consistent with the expected number of independent clones in the DT and TC domains, we suggest that the DT/TC border is also a line of clonal restriction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Spalt function, branch identity and boundary formation</title><p>To investigate which functions might be served by the genes that are expressed specifically in the DT, DB and TC domains, we analyzed clones that either lacked sal function or ectopically expressed <italic>sal</italic>. In contrast to marked control clones in the DT, which integrated with their unmarked neighbors and were not morphologically distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), clones that lacked sal function appeared to sort out from their neighbors and to bulge abnormally from the plane of the trunk tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–F</xref>).

This expression signature (<italic>vein</italic>, Kni, Sal<sup>-</sup>, Delta<sup>-</sup>, Cut<sup>-</sup>) is the same as that of DB cells, suggesting that sal function is required for DT identity and that without sal function or with Kni, they transform to DB identity. The sorting out phenotype is consistent with the idea that the presence of mutant cells created an ectopic juxtaposition of cells with different identities. Expression of NRE-<italic>lacZ</italic> in the mutant cells that lacked sal function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) suggests that Notch signaling was activated at the ectopic borders that formed where the two groups of cells abut, just as it does at the normal DT/DB junction.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08666.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mutant clones transform dorsal branch, dorsal trunk and transverse connective cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Control DT clone of GFP-expressing cells with no effect on morphology or expression of Delta; (<bold>B-–F’</bold>) Clones of <italic>sal</italic> mutant DT cells generated bulges, apparently sorting out, and lacked Delta expression (<bold>B, B’</bold>), ectopically expressed <italic>vein-lacZ</italic> (<bold>C</bold>) and Knirps (<bold>D</bold>), not normally expressed by DT cells, but not Cut (<bold>E, E’</bold>) and activated the NRE-<italic>lacZ</italic> reporter (<bold>F, F’</bold>).

Second, Sal-expressing cells expressed Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), which is normally expressed in Sal-expressing DT cells and not in the DB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>).

Clones that ectopically expressed Delta in the DB non-autonomously activated <italic>vein-lacZ</italic> expression and Notch signaling in adjacent cells, and the affected regions had a diameter greater than the normal DB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>). <italic>vein</italic> was also expressed in DB clones that ectopically expressed Notch<sup>ACT</sup>, and the morphology of the region with the mutant cells was abnormal and more characteristic of the expanded proximal DB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, Delta-expressing clones in the DT, which also activated Notch signaling in adjacent cells, did not alter the morphology of the DT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Because <italic>vein</italic> is normally expressed by DB cells in the expanded region at the DT/DB junction, these phenotypes suggest that ectopic over-expression of Delta in the DB transformed adjacent cells to a junction identity and that normally, Delta-activated Notch signaling at the DT/DB junction induces <italic>vein</italic> expression and morphological specialization. This conclusion is consistent with the effects of Delta over-expression on another morphological feature of the expanded region of the proximal DB. Anti-cadherin staining revealed that the lumen in this region of the wild type DB is branched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

In the <italic>NotchRNAi</italic>-expressing trachea of wandering L3 larvae, the number and density of cells in the Tr2 branches appeared to be less than normal, and may reflect developmental delay. Comparison of trachea in younger, control L3 larvae (40–42 hrs post L2-L3 molt) that had a similar density of cells in the DT revealed that the proximal DB was normally broadened at this earlier stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

It is the only Drosophila organ generated by a tubulogenesis process that combines both cell division and morphogenesis, and it is therefore the only system to which the power of Drosophila developmental genetics can be applied to address the question that instigated the study described here – are cells that re-initiate cell cycling in a fully differentiated tubular organ (specifically in the L3 Tr2) descendants of un-differentiated subgroups (stem cells?), or do the differentiated cells re-enter mitotic cycling? Our initial assumption was that the tracheal remodeling is a product of pools of adult tracheoblasts that grow and assume a functional role only after the larval periods, but our previous studies showed that DT re-population in Tr2 involves the activation of mitotic cycling in differentiated larval cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2008</xref>). However, these studies did not establish whether the dividing cells represent a selected and specialized subgroup, or whether re-entry into the cell cycle was a general feature of the DT cells. The results of the clonal analysis reported here supports the idea that most or all cells in the early L3 DT contribute to re-population, and because their descendants can fully account for repopulation, we conclude that there is no other cell type involved. The varied locations and shapes of the clones suggest that the cells in the L3 DT constitute an equivalence group. Previous studies of re-population of the DB came to a similar conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weaver and Krasnow, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The clonal analysis yielded an unexpected property of Tr2: DT clones appeared to respect boundaries near the junctions of the DB and TC. We analyzed marked clones generated by eight regimens of recombination, including one that produced <italic>M</italic> clones in a <italic>M</italic> background and endows the marked cells with a growth advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morata and Ripoll, 1975</xref>), and two that produced GFP- and LacZ-expressing clones independently in the same animal. 79 clones were identified that appeared to respect a common border at the DT/DB junction and 55 clones (with &gt;1 marked cell) were identified that appeared to respect a common border at the DT/TC junction. A feature of these clones is the contrast between portions of their perimeter that appeared to be “straight” and abut the border, and the remaining portions of their perimeter, which were more irregular. This feature has been previously noted for the borders of developmental compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahmann and Basler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dominguez and de Celis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lawrence, 1997</xref>), and the question we consider is whether the apparent lineage borders at the DT/DB and DT/TC junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) represent borders of developmental compartments.</p><p>Developmental compartments have been characterized in the first abdominal segment of the adult, the wing, leg, eye-antennal and genital imaginal discs and the embryo. Their key distinguishing properties are that compartment borders confine all the descendants of their founding cells, and all their cells express a “selector” gene or set of genes that determine their identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia-Bellido, 1975</xref>). The compartment borders restrict the growth of their constituent cells to a defined geographical area and compartments are domains of gene expression.</p><p>We address the relevant features of the Tr2 branches by focusing on the DT. The Tr2 DT is contiguous with the DT metameres of Tr1 and Tr3 and is constituted by a single layer of epithelial cells. Doughnut-shaped node cells form the seams where the metameres join, but unlike the other cells of the DT, the Tr2 node cells do not divide during L3. Although we did not identify clones formed by dividing Tr2 DT cells that crossed into either Tr1 or Tr3, this cannot be considered evidence of lineage restriction because the non-dividing node cells may have, by their presence, barred expansion of clones into the adjacent metameres. In contrast, we detected no morphological feature that appeared to separate the DT from DB or TC cells into distinct populations, and the clonal analysis is not consistent with the presence of a group of non-dividing cells at the DT/DB and DT/TC junctions.</p><p>Although the non-planar nature of the intersection of the DT and DB complicates imaging because the rotational orientation was not the same for each specimen that was mounted for viewing, we found 79 clones that appeared to obey a common line of restriction at the DT/DB junction. Many of the marked patches were large (five were <italic>M</italic> and had &gt;50 cells) and many extended around at least half the perimeter of the junction. Six specimens were recovered that had two independently marked clones that met at the DT/DB junction. We suggest that these clones are strong evidence for a compartment border at the DT/DB junction and we found several other aspects of the junction that are consistent with this idea.</p><p>First, the clone borders that met the common line of lineage restriction appeared to be straighter than elsewhere. The “smooth” borders of clones at compartment boundaries is a characteristic that has been noted at the boundaries of the A/P) and dorsal/ventral (D/V) compartments of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dominguez and de Celis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</xref>), and at the A/P compartment boundaries of the leg disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lawrence et al., 1979</xref>) and first abdominal segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kornberg, 1981a</xref>). Although the smooth borders have been attributed to local cell interactions involving differential cell affinities or mechanical tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahmann et al., 2011</xref>), their basis is not understood. We have argued that this property is a consequence of signaling centers that form to one side and are not a property of the border itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang and Kornberg, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Second, the line of lineage restriction coincided with DB and DT gene expression domains. We defined these domains by expression of <italic>kni</italic> in DB cells and of <italic>sal, Ser</italic> and <italic>Delta</italic> in DT cells, and found that sal function is essential in DT cells for their identity and that <italic>sal</italic> expression in DB cells is sufficient to transform to a DT identity. DT cells that over-express <italic>kni</italic> ectopically appear to “sort out”, consistent with their transformation to a DB identity. These analyses suggest that cells in the DT and DB domains may be regulated by genes with “selector” function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia-Bellido, 1975</xref>), and establish the coincidence of lineage restriction and the expression domains at single cell resolution.</p><p>Third, DB cells at the DT/DB border expressed the Notch reporter NRE-<italic>lacZ</italic> and were juxtaposed to DT cells that expressed the Notch ligands Delta and Ser but did not express NRE-<italic>lacZ</italic>. NRE-<italic>lacZ</italic> expression was highest in the DB cells at the border and decreased in a graded manner in DB cells farther away. These properties suggest that the DT/DB border situates a Notch signaling center at this position. Both gene expression and morphology appeared to be polarized relative to the DT/DB border – suggesting that this border may be a site of polarity reversal, which is also a defining feature of the A/P compartment border of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Struhl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chuang and Kornberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia-Bellido and Santamaria, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawrence and Morata, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lawrence et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabata et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, the behavior of mutant clones suggests that segregation of DT and DB cells depended on Notch. <italic>vein</italic> and <italic>kni</italic> are normally expressed by DB border cells and not by DT cells, and cells in the DT that ectopically over-expressed <italic>kni</italic> appeared to “sort out” from their DT neighbors and expressed <italic>vein</italic>. In contrast, <italic>kni</italic>-expressing cells in the DT that also lacked normal Notch function did not sort out. They appeared to integrate with their neighbors and did not respect the compartment border. Consistent with the idea that Notch is involved in maintaining the segregation of DT and DB cells, conditions that ectopically activated Notch appeared to induce ectopic borders. DB clones that over-expressed <italic>sal</italic> ectopically activated Notch signaling in adjacent cells and DT clones of <italic>sal</italic> mutant cells induced Notch signaling and also appeared to sort out from their neighbors. Notch signaling is also required for the wing disc D/V compartment border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blair et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Micchelli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rauskolb et al., 1999</xref>), although the mechanism may not be the same. In contrast to the Tr2 borders where Notch activation is polarized and specific to only one side, Notch signaling is active on both sides of the wing disc D/V border.</p><p>The presence of a compartment border at the DT/TC junction is supported by the clones that define it from either side and by its coincidence with a Notch signaling domain. However the variable cell composition at the junction and the presence of large, non-mitotic cells on the TC side in many wandering stage larvae complicates interpretation of the apparent lineage restriction. We do not yet understand the basis for the variability, but assume that it represents a transient state and that these large cells begin to divide later than the others. If true, they likely prevent dividing cells on the DT and TC side from mixing, but this does not argue against the existence of a compartment border. The activation of Notch signaling and the fact that the Cut identity of the TC cells is sensitive to the presence of Sal support the idea that there is one and a model in which the DT represents a development compartment that is segregated from the DB and TC. Studies of the cell divisions that follow during pupal development may provide additional evidence for the lineage restriction we identified.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Perspectives</title><p>The discovery of developmental compartments in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc was a major advance that provided a novel conceptual basis to understand how groups of cells are programmed and how genetic programs regulate development independently of overt morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crick and Lawrence, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</xref>). Although the concepts were instrumental to understanding the function of the genes that segment the early embryo when these genes were later discovered, and although discoveries of developmental compartments in other imaginal discs and in the abdominal histoblast nests followed, their generality has remained an open question because the types of tissues in which they were found represent a limited subset. Studies that map gene expression in developing tissues have identified many examples in which expression is restricted to well-defined domains, and some studies have correlated these domains with cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marianes and Spradling, 2013</xref>), but it is not known whether these cases satisfy other criteria that have been ascribed to developmental compartments - such as association with signaling centers and developmental polarity. Although we do not know if all these criteria are important distinctions, we prefer to reserve the term developmental compartments for contexts that have them. Using this strict definition, the studies reported here are the first to identify developmental compartments in an internal tubular organ. We did not initiate these studies expecting to find developmental compartments, but discovered them in the course of a thorough clonal analysis. It is possible that similar studies may also find them in other internal organs, and in particular in the vascular system of vertebrates that are also branched and have regions with distinct identities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drosophila stocks</title><p>This work unless otherwise indicated.</p><p><italic>btl-Gal4 UAS-nlsGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guha and Kornberg, 2005</xref>)</p><p><italic>NRE-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furriols and Bray, 2001</xref>)</p><p><italic>sal-Gal4 UAS-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>)</p><p><italic>yw hsflp;actin&gt;CD2&gt;Gal4;UAS-nlsGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guha et al., 2008</xref>)</p><p><italic>yw hsflp;actin&gt;y+&gt;Gal4 UAS-GFP;MKRS/TM6B</italic></p> <p><italic>hsFLP tubGAL4 UAS-nlsGFP;+/+;M(3)i<sup>55</sup> tubGal80 FRT80B/TM6B</italic> (Bloomington #42732)</p><p><italic>hsFLP tubGal4 UAS-nlsGFP;tubGal80 FRT40A/FRT40A tubGal80</italic> (Bloomington #1816)</p><p><italic>FRT40A Df(2L)32FP-5/CyO (Df(2L)32FP-5 uncovers spalt and spalt-related)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Organista and De Celis, 2013</xref>)</p><p><italic>UAS-Sal;UAS-CD8GFP</italic> (Bloomington #29715)</p><p><italic>UAS-Delta</italic> (Bloomington #26694)</p><p><italic>UAS-knirps</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1998</xref>)</p><p><italic>UAS-N-RNAi</italic> (NIG-Fly #3936-R2))</p><p><italic>UAS-Nact</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hwang and Rulifson, 2011</xref>)</p><p>vein-lacZ (Bloomington #11749)</p><p><italic>yw hsflp;actin&gt;y+&gt;Gal4 UAS-GFP;NRE-lacZ</italic></p> <p><italic>yw hsflp;actin&gt;y+&gt;Gal4UAS-GFP;vein-lacZ</italic></p> <p><italic>actin&gt;stop&gt;nlslacZ</italic> (Bloomington #6355)</p><p><italic>en GAL4 UAS-myr-mRFP, NRE-EGFP</italic> (Bloomington #30729)</p><p><italic>fzr-lacZ</italic> (Bloomington #12241)</p><p><italic>wg-Gal4 UAS-CD8:GFP/CyO</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang and Kornberg, 2015</xref>)</p><p><italic>btl-LHG/CyO;lexO Cherry-CAAX/TM6B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roy et al., 2014</xref>)</p><p>The enhancer trap lines (collection generated by the U.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor), a guest Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews (which are attached for information) with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript reports the existence of three regions of restricted lineage (compartments) in the trachea of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva: Dorsal trunk (DT), Dorsal branch (DB) and Transverse connective (TC). The identity of each of these compartments is determined with a specific selector gene and the boundaries between them are sites of Notch signaling. This is the first demonstration of the process of compartmentalization in a tubular internal structure.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript reports the existence of three regions of restricted lineage (compartments) in the second tracheal metamere (Tr2) of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. Cell lineage experiments, using different marking methods, define three compartments: Dorsal trunk (DT), Dorsal branch (DB) and Transverse connective (TC). Marked clones initiated during the repopulation of the Tr2 metamere fail to cross well-defined borders between DT and DB and between DT and TC.</p><p>A key observation is that these same borders are independently defined by the expression of transcription factor encoding genes like <italic>spalt, knirps</italic> or <italic>cut</italic> that are specifically expressed in the DT, DB or TC. Conforming the classical selector gene hypothesis, these genes determine the identity of a specific compartment; alteration in their function (gain or loss) causes the corresponding alteration in compartment identity. This is reflected in the behaviour of, for example, <italic>sal</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) that sort out from DT cells and acquire expression of <italic>knirps</italic> that determines DB identity.</p><p>Furthermore, the DT/DB and DT/TC boundaries delimit Notch expression and of its ligands Delta and Serrate, suggesting that Notch signaling is involved in the formation and maintenance of those borders, just like in the D/V border in the wing disc. This aspect is not sufficiently documented, as I point out below.</p><p>So far compartments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been demonstrated only in flat epithelia e.g. imaginal discs and abdominal histoblasts. This is the first demonstration of developmental compartments in an internal tubular organ. It is a significant piece of novel information that adds to the universality of the phenomenon of compartmentalization. It also implicates the existence of specific &quot;genetic addresses&quot; that program the development of various tracheal branches.</p><p>The technical quality of the paper is high. The conclusions are based in clear experiments and the results allow firm conclusions. The images supporting the conclusions are also clear and convincing, especially those referring to the demonstration of clonal restrictions and the expression data.</p><p>Considering all together, this work is potentially publishable in <italic>eLife</italic>, but some aspects remain unclear that preclude acceptance at this point. The authors should be asked to consider the comments below and to perform additional experiments and changes in the manuscript to meet those criticisms.</p><p>A serious problem concerns the role of Notch signaling, which is not clearly established. This is a criticism raised by all the reviewers. It is also a major issue, for one of the strengths of the work is that, just like in the wing imaginal disc, the lineage borders described here are associated with Notch signaling, which is presumably necessary for the formation and maintenance of those borders. The authors show the Notch function is necessary for normal morphogenesis of the dorsal branch, but the requirement of Notch signaling for the maintenance of the DT/DB or the DT/TC boundaries has not been investigated. The authors should perform additional experiments to address this problem. For example, as indicated by an expert reviewer, it should be possible to conduct a lineage experiment in trachea depleted of Notch function (<italic>btl &gt;NotchRNAi</italic>) to check on the stability of the DT/DB border under those conditions.</p><p>Another problem is that the novelty of the results, that is, the functional connection between lineage restrictions, transcription factors and Notch signaling in building a tubular structure like the trachea, does not come out clearly in the manuscript. The authors should try to put their work in the context of what is known about the D/V border in the wing disc.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>The authors state that they have screened 1300 enhancer trap lines, but do not mention any specific result. Which new tracheal expression patterns were identified in this screen? Several factors mentioned in the manuscript have already been reported in previous publications that should cited.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The work submitted by Kornberg and colleagues describes the existence of lineage restriction boundaries in the developing larval tracheal system in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Using clonal analyses, forward and reverse genetic, the existence of developmental compartments is convincingly demonstrated. The role of Notch signaling is investigated and shown to be important for boundary formation. This is the first demonstration of developmental compartments in a branched organ, and it will be interesting to find out whether other branched organs are also organized in a similar manner. The experiments are well done and presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The submitted manuscript builds on the authors' previous work showing that cells in the second tracheal metamere (Tr2) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae reenter the cell cycle during the 3rd instar stage (Guha and Kornberg, 2005; Guha et al., 2008). This repopulation is an example of organ renewal and cell division by differentiated cells. The authors have now further investigated this repopulation phenomenon. By conducting lineage analyses they found that the repopulating cells do not intrude into adjacent tracheal branches (lineage restriction). This fits with the notion that the branches behave as developmental compartments. Adjacent developmental compartments are distinguished by differences in the expression of particular genes, such as selector genes. The authors found that in Tr2, adjacent branches could indeed be distinguished based on the expression of such genes. Clonal depletion (e.g. Sal<sup>-</sup>) in compartments where they are expressed led to a sorting out from the neighboring cells and the acquisition of gene expression patterns seen in the adjacent compartment. Notch activity is highest in the DB cells at the branch sites. Depletion of Notch in trachea led to a morphological defect at the proximal DB. Taken together with other observations the authors propose that the Tr2 represent developmental compartments.</p><p>Compartments are a fascinating phenomenon in development biology. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the wing disc, a sac-like organ in which the compartments and their boundaries were discovered, has been used as a model organ for studying compartments. The authors provide evidence that Tr2 is an additional but distinct type of <italic>Drosophila</italic> organ (an internal tubular organ) that also has developmental compartments. This makes the manuscript potentially interesting for developmental biologists. However I hesitate to recommend publication of the manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form due to the following reasons:</p><p>First, the relevance of the lineage restriction remains vague. The coincidence of lineage restriction and Notch signaling remains poorly investigated. Notch activity is high at branch points. Depletion of Notch in trachea caused a morphological defect at the proximal DB. The authors did not show how this influenced the lineage restriction. Is the lineage restriction at the junction of DB and DT still intact or have DB cells intruded the DT? The authors should conduct a lineage experiment in <italic>btl &gt;NotchRNAi</italic> conditions.</p><p>Why is it worth studying Tr2? Per se it is interesting however the authors do not sufficiently highlight the potential value of the discovery. It is alluded to in the Discussion but the relevance, significance, and novelty of the results remain vague. Prefacing the relevance in the Introduction might help.</p><p>The authors could also compare and contrast the molecular mechanisms underpinning the formation and characteristics of developmental compartments in the DV boundary of the wing disc and the Tr2.</p><p>Second, the novelty of some of the results is questionable. The authors describe their analysis of gene expression patterns in the Tr2 as if they are the first ones to discover the different expression domains by screening enhancer trap lines. However, most of the expression patterns have already been described and the fact that the authors did not mention these papers (please see subheading “Delimited gene expression domains of the dorsal trunk, dorsal branch and transverse connective”) gives the wrong impression. This oversight should be corrected.</p><p>It is not clear from the information provided if the branch specific gene expression patterns also exist in other metameres in the larva (possibly at lower levels) or in embryos. If they are common, then the lineage restriction is due to intrinsic gene patterns of all tracheal metameres, and not a consequence of repopulation in Tr2. If the pattern is very specific, then an unknown, Tr2-specific signal might impose both lineage restrictions and repopulation, and such a finding could explain why Tr2 is repopulated. The authors should at least discuss this.</p><p>Third, as written, the manuscript will be very difficult to understand for non-developmental biologists.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Developmental compartments have been well studied in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs and in the vertebrate nervous system, among other tissues. Regionalization depends on localized domains of gene expression (usually transcription factors) that confer compartment-specific identity. Signaling systems including Notch and Ephrin/Eph have been implicated in boundary formation and maintenance. Here, Rao et al explore the proliferation in the tracheal system, and provide evidence for a boundary of lineage restriction that coincides with gene expression domains. They present reasonable evidence that cells respect a boundary between dorsal trunk and dorsal branch that coincides with a domain of Spalt and Knirps expression, and some evidence that local activation of Notch signaling may be involved. Much of what is described is analogous to the roles of transcription factors and localized Notch activation in imaginal disc compartment systems, though much of this parallel is not explored in the text. The novelty here lies in the finding of these relationships within the tracheal system, in which the tubular epithelium has a different topology that the flat imaginal disc epithelia.</p><p>The data are generally clear-cut, and with the exception of the effects of manipulating Notch signaling produce results that are fully consistent with the authors’ model. The effects of manipulating Delta expression and Notch activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) appear less clear cut than those of manipulating Sal and Kni (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but the authors conclude that activity is required at the DT/DB border. I am not entirely persuaded that the data on Notch signaling fully supports the authors claim that Notch signaling &quot;was required for the identity and specializations of border cells&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08666.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: […] A serious problem concerns the role of Notch signaling, which is not clearly established.

This issue had been explored previously with such genotypes as the suggested <italic>btl &gt;Notch-RNAi</italic>, but informative results had not been obtained. We explored several different genetic contexts, and as described in the revised manuscript, one was found that compromised the mutant clones so they did not sort out from their neighbors and did not respect the border (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p><p>We addressed most of the minor points, but we are not able to provide more extensive descriptions of the enhancer trap screen as it was carried out many years ago and we lack sufficient documentation or access to the collection.

We have tried to reference all prior literature appropriately, but welcome any further suggestions from the reviewers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
