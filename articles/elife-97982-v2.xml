Child development encompasses many dimensions of a child’s well-being. It is generally described into specific streams or domains of development, including motor development, speech and language progression, cognitive abilities, and socio-emotional skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Neurogenesis starts in the intrauterine environment and continues to shape brain morphology and plasticity after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doi et al., 2022</xref>). The interval from birth to eight years represents a unique and critical period in which the development of a child’s brain can be significantly shaped. This phenomenon encompasses special sensitivity to experiences that promote cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">UNICEF, 2017</xref>). The acquisition of developmental skills results from an interplay between the development of the nervous system and other organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2020</xref>). Optimal brain development requires a stimulating environment, adequate nutrients, and social interaction with attentive caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britto et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The early childhood development (ECD) impacts long-term individual and population health outcomes, including the ability to learn, achievements in school and later life, citizenship, involvement in community activities, and overall quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van den Heuvel, 2019</xref>). An estimated 250 million children under five in low- and middle-income countries are at risk of not attaining their developmental potential, leading to an average deficit of 19.8% in adult annual income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 2017</xref>). In 2015, the importance of ECD was recognized and incorporated into the ‘United Nations Sustainable Development Goals’.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that early child metabolome disturbances may be implicated in the pathogenesis of non-typical neurodevelopment, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sotelo-Orozco et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>), communication skills development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>), and risk of impaired neurocognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moreau et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Children diagnosed with neurodevelopmental delays tend to experience more favorable treatment outcomes when these conditions are identified and addressed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, biomarkers are urgently needed to predict an infant’s potential risk for developmental issues while gaining new insights into underlying disease mechanisms. Although child development has been a focus of research for decades, studies in low- and middle-income countries on the potential role of circulating metabolites in ECD remain limited. The present study aims to identify associations between children’s serum metabolome and ECD. Identifying the relationships between metabolic phenotypes and ECD outcomes can elucidate pathways and targets for potential interventions, such as serum metabolites associated with food consumption in infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruce et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This cross-sectional study uses data from the Brazilian National Survey on Child Nutrition (ENANI-2019). ENANI-2019 is a population-based household survey with national coverage and representativeness of children aged &lt;5 years that has investigated dietary intake, anthropometric status, and micronutrient deficiency. Details of the ENANI-2019 sample design, study completion, and methodology have been published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alves-Santos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Castro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Vasconcellos et al., 2021</xref>). ENANI-2019 data collection took place from February 2019 and ended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Covariates</title><p>Trained interviewers administered a structured questionnaire to collect socio-demographic, health and anthropometric data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alves-Santos et al., 2021</xref>). The variables included in this study were: the child’s age (in months), sex (male or female), educational level of the mother/caregiver of the child (0–7, 8–10, and ≥11 completed years of education), mode of delivery (vaginal or c-section), monthly familiar income (&lt;62.2, 62.2–24.4, 124.5–248.7, &gt;248.7 USD). Body weight (kg) and length or height (m) were used to calculate the weight for length/height z-scores (w/h z-scores). Also, the w/h z-scores were classified based on the age and sex of the child, according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">WHO, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The child’s diet quality was assessed using the minimum dietary diversity (MDD) indicator proposed by the WHO (WHO &amp; United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2021). MDD requires the consumption of foods from at least five of eight food groups during the previous day. The eight food groups are (1) breast milk; (2) grains, roots, tubers, and plantains; (3) pulses (beans, peas, lentils), nuts, and seeds; (4) dairy products (milk, infant formula, yogurt, cheese); (5) flesh foods (meat, fish, poultry, organ meats); (6) eggs; (7) vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables; and (8) other fruits and vegetables. The variable was dichotomized as children who had consumed ≥5 or&lt;5 food groups. Data to produce this indicator was derived from the ENANI’s structured questionnaire related to foods consumed the day before the first interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de A Lacerda et al., 2021</xref>) Furthermore, in ENANI-2019 caregivers fulfilled one 24 hr food recall (R24h) reporting all children’s food and beverage intake in the day before the interview. Child fiber intake (grams) was obtained from the R24h.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Assessment of ECD</title><p>The Survey of Well-being of Young Children (SWYC) milestones questionnaire was used to assess ECD. This questionnaire inquiries about motor, language, and cognitive milestones appropriate for the age range of the form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whitesell et al., 2015</xref>). It is recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics and is a widely disseminated screening tool for identifying developmental delays in children aged 1–65 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipkin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The SWYC milestones questionnaire was developed and validated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sheldrick and Perrin, 2013</xref>, and a version of the SWYC (SWYC-BR) has been translated, cross-culturally adapted, and validated for use in Brazilian children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moreira et al., 2019</xref>). A recently published study evaluated the internal consistency of the SWYC-BR milestones questionnaire using the ENANI-2019 data and Cronbach’s alpha, which showed adequate performance (0.965; 95% CI: 0.963–0.968; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freitas-Costa et al., 2023</xref>). SWYC-BR comprises 12 distinct forms, each aligned with the recommended age for routine pediatric wellness visits from 1 to 65 months (specifically at 1–3, 4–5, 6–8, 9–11, 12–14, 15–17, 18–22, 23–28, 29–34, 35–46, 47–58, and 59–65 months). Each form is a 10-item questionnaire. For each item, a parent/caregiver can choose one of three answers that best describe their child (‘not yet’, ‘somewhat’, or ‘very much’).</p><p>The ENANI-2019 data collection system automatically selected the appropriate set of developmental milestones according to the child’s age. The corrected age was used to select the proper set of developmental milestones for children under two years who were born preterm (&lt;37 gestational weeks; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gould et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Developmental quotient</title><p>The Developmental quotient (DQ) is a continuous variable calculated by dividing developmental age by chronological age. The item response theory and graded response models were used to estimate development age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Samejima, 1997</xref>) according to the child’s developmental milestones already reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheldrick et al., 2019</xref>). The analysis used the full information method and incorporated the complex sample design in the Mplus software version 7 (Los Angeles, EUA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muthén and Muthén, 2017</xref>). The estimated model allowed the construction of an item characteristic curve (ICC) for each milestone, representing the change in the probability of a given response (sometimes or always) and the discrimination of each milestone development by age, estimating the development age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freitas-Costa et al., 2023</xref>). The ICC and its coefficients were used to estimate developmental age according to the developmental milestones reached by each child. This methodology has been previously used to assess ECD with the SWYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freitas-Costa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheldrick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sheldrick and Perrin, 2013</xref>) and the Denver Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de L Drachler et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Differently for test scores use, these methods avoid the influence of items set in the results. This approach enables the assessment of each item rather than just the final score, as the item set might be biased—meaning there could be an imbalance in the number of activities more commonly achieved among the specified items. Consequently, reaching the maximum score on the scale may be easier for certain age groups. The DQ was calculated by dividing the developmental age by the chronological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freitas-Costa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sheldrick and Perrin, 2013</xref>). DQ equals to 1 indicates that the expected age milestones are attained. DQ values &lt;1 or&gt;1 suggest attaining age milestones below or above expectations. This method allows analyzing the outcome as a continuous variable.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Blood collection</title><p>Details of the procedures adopted for blood collection and laboratory analyses have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Castro et al., 2021</xref>). Fasting was not required, and changes in medication were not necessary to draw the blood sample. Briefly, 8 mL of blood sample were drawn and distributed in a trace tube (6 mL) and EDTA tube (2 mL) and transported in a cooler with a controlled temperature (from 2 °C to 8 °C) to a partner laboratory. Aliquots from the trace tube were centrifugated and the serum was transferred to a second trace tube and stored at freezing temperature (–20 °C) until laboratory analyses were performed. Serum samples with sufficient volume were stored in a biorepository (–80 °C) prior to untargeted metabolome analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Serum processing and metabolome analysis</title><p>Untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed on serum filtrate samples using a high-throughput platform based on multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS). Samples were first thawed slowly on ice, where 50 µL were aliquoted and then diluted four-fold to a final volume of 200 µL in deionized water with an internal standard mix containing 40 µmol/L 3-chlorotyrosine, 3-fluorophenylalanine, 2-fluorotyrosine, trimethylamine-N-oxide[D9], γ-amino butyrate[D6], choline[D9], creatinine[D3], ornithine [<sup>15</sup>N2], histidine[<sup>15</sup>Na], carnitine[D3], 3-methylhistidine[D3] and 2 mmol/L glucose[<sup>13</sup>C6]. Diluted serum samples were then transferred to pre-rinsed Nanosep ultracentrifuge devices with a molecular weight cutoff of 3 kDa (Cytiva Life Sciences, Malborough, USA), and centrifuged at 10,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min to remove proteins. Following ultrafiltration, 20 µL of diluted serum filtrate samples were transferred to CE-compatible polypropylene vials and analyzed using MSI-CE-MS. A pooled QC was also prepared to evaluate technical precision throughput the study using 50 µL aliquots collected from the first batch of 979 serum samples processed. Overall, serum specimens were prepared and run as three separate batches of 979, 1990, and 2035 samples over an eighteen-month period. A QC-based batch correction algorithm was applied to reduce long-term system drift and improve reproducibility with QC samples analyzed in a randomized position within each analytical run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wehrens et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>High-throughput MSI-CE-MS metabolomic analyses was performed using an Agilent 6230B time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) with an electrospray ion source coupled to an Agilent G7100A capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA). The serum metabolome coverage comprises primarily cationic/zwitterionic and anionic polar metabolites (filtrate/unbound to protein) when using full-scan data acquisition under positive and negative ionization modes. Given the isocratic separation conditions with steady-state ionization via a sheath liquid interface, MSI-CE-MS increases sample throughput using a serial injection format where 12 samples and a pooled QC are analyzed within a single analytical run. Instrumental and data preprocessing parameters have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saoi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shanmuganathan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The technical precision for serum metabolites measured in pooled QC samples had a median coefficient of variation (CV) of 10.5% with a range from 2.7 to 31% (n=422), which were analyzed by MSI-CE-MS in every analytical run throughout the study following batch correction. Overall, seventy-five circulating polar metabolites were measured in most samples (frequency &gt;50%) with adequate technical precision (CV &lt;30%) with the exception of symmetric dimethylarginine that was removed. Most metabolites were identified by spiking (i.e. co-migration with low mass error &lt;5 ppm) and quantified with authentic standards, except for 13 unknown metabolites that were annotated based on their accurate mass (<italic>m/z</italic>), relative migration time (RMT), ionization mode (N or P), and most likely molecular formula. The metabolite distributions were severely asymmetric (average skewness = 40) and leptokurtic (average kurtosis = 1810). Therefore, a log<sub>10</sub> transformation was performed on each metabolite, which reduced average skewness to 2.4 and kurtosis to 20.8. Metabolite z-scores&gt;5 or &lt; –5 were considered outliers and were removed (0.12% of the data).</p><p>Missing data were treated following the procedures recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2018</xref> with one modification. Instead of using the “80% rule” of excluding metabolites with &lt;80% non-missing cases (&gt;20% missing cases) in all dependent variable categories, a less stringent 50% rule was applied to reduce the risk of excluding relevant serum metabolites. For the sole purpose of performing the exclusions, the DQ was recoded as a categorical variable (DQ ≥1 as ‘within or above expectations’, and DQ &lt;1 as ‘below expectations’) to avoid removing metabolites that had a missingness pattern associated with DQ. Cysteine-S-sulfate and an unknown anionic metabolite (209.030:3.04:N; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) had &gt;50% missing cases in both DQ categories and were thus excluded.</p><p>Of the remaining 72 serum metabolites that satisfied the above selection criteria, 12.5% of the data were missing due to matrix interferences, and 1.5% were missing due to non-detection (i.e. below method detection limit). Missing data due to matrix interference were imputed using the random forest (RF) method, and non-detection missing data were imputed using quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). The RF method used all serum metabolome data to predict what value the missing cases would likely have taken.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We carried out descriptive and inferential analyses. The descriptive analyses were based on frequency with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and <italic>Student</italic> t-test or ANOVA were used to compare DQ in groups.</p><p>The Pearson correlation was first used to explore the correlations between circulating metabolites (exposure) and DQ (outcome). To better assess the predictiveness of each metabolite in a single model, a partial least squares regression (PLSR) was conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Worley and Powers, 2013</xref>). Partial least squares (PLS)-based analyses are the most commonly used analyses when determining the predictiveness of a large number of variables as they avoid issues with collinearity, sample size, and corrections for multiple-testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blekherman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gromski et al., 2015</xref>). The PLSR reduces the metabolites to orthogonal components, which are maximally predictive of the outcome and generate an indicator of how much each metabolite contributes to predicting the outcome, called the variable importance projection (VIP). Because our goal was not to determine the components that are maximally predictive of DQ but to rank the metabolites on their contribution to predicting the outcome, we focused on the VIPs from this analysis.</p><p>The PLSR was trained on 80% of the data, and the remaining 20% was used as test data. Training and test data were randomly allocated. The model with the optimal number of components considering predictive value and parsimony was used to generate VIP values. Serum metabolites were selected for further analyses if they had a VIP ≥1.</p><p>The subsequent step was to disentangle the selected metabolites from confounding variables. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breitling et al., 2022</xref>) was used to more objectively determine the minimally sufficient adjustments for the regression models to account for potentially confounding variables while avoiding collider variables and variables in the metabolite-DQ causal pathways, which if controlled for would unnecessarily remove explained variance from the metabolites and hamper our ability to detect biomarkers. To minimize bias from subjective judgments of which variables should and should not be included as covariates, the DAG only included variables for which there was evidence from systematic reviews or meta-analysis of relationships with both the metabolome and DQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Birth weight, breastfeeding, child’s diet quality, the child’s nutritional status, and the child’s age were the minimal adjustments suggested by the DAG. Birth weight was a variable with high missing data, and indicators of breastfeeding practice data (referring to exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months and/or complemented until 2 years) were collected only for children aged 0–23 months. Therefore, those confounders were not included as adjustments. Child’s diet quality was evaluated as MDD, the child’s nutritional status as w/h z-score, and the child’s age in months.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the association between child serum metabolome and early childhood development.</title><p>Note: IUGR: intrauterine growth restriction.

We employed mediation analyses to explore the potential role of specific serum metabolites as mediators in the relationship between certain exposure variables related to the microbiome establishment in early life, such as mode of delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reyman et al., 2019</xref>), child’s diet quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldeon et al., 2023</xref>), as well as child fiber intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cronin et al., 2021</xref>) and DQ. For the mediation analyses, we adopted the approach proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tingley et al., 2014</xref>, which provides independent estimates for the average causal mediation effect (ACME - the effect of the exposure variable on DQ that is mediated by the metabolite), the average direct effect (ADE - controlling for metabolite concentrations) of the exposure variable on DQ, and the total effect of the exposure variable on DQ (mediation plus direct effect). Bootstrap tests using 5,000 iterations evaluated whether the effects were statistically significant. Due to the exploratory nature of the mediation analysis, significance was not corrected for multiple testing. The child’s age (in months) and w/h z-score were entered as covariates.</p><p>All other results were considered statistically significant at an adjusted-p ≤0.05 after the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons.

adjusted-p=0.018), PAG (β-interaction=0.04; adjusted-p=0.018), TMAO (β-interaction=0.05; adjusted-p=0.003), and Val (β-interaction=0.04; adjusted-p=0.039; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Association between serum metabolites and developmental quotient (DQ) of children with and without child age interaction term for children 6–59 months evaluated in a subset sample of ENANI-2019 (the Brazilian National Survey on Child Nutrition;

This is the first study to explore the association between child serum metabolome and ECD on a population-based level. According to our results, serum concentrations of PAG, CS, HA and TMAO were inversely associated with child DQ, a validated measure to express ECD. The associations of PAG, HA, TMAO, and Val on DQ were also age-dependent and showed stronger associations for children &lt;34 months. In addition, inverse associations were found for serum levels of MeHis and Crtn with DQ for children &lt;34 months, whereas direct associations were found for children &gt;34 months.</p><p>PAG is the glutamine conjugate of phenylacetic acid generated from the gut microbial-dependent metabolism of phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poesen et al., 2016</xref>). As circulating concentrations of the essential amino acid, phenylalanine, were not directly associated with DQ in our study, this suggests that differences in gut microbiome composition impacting PAG formation among children are likely a major determinant of DQ rather than dietary protein intake. Similarly, to our findings, a previous study involving 76 patients with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and 363 healthy children aged 1–18 years identified an inverse relationship between urinary PAG and ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tian et al., 2022</xref>). While the specific pathways contributing to such disorders remain to be fully elucidated, it is known that PAG is structurally similar to catecholamines and can activate adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huynh, 2020</xref>). The stimuli of adrenergic receptors may have broader implications on behavioral responses, potentially influencing neurological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Connors et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pliszka et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Likewise, in our study, circulating TMAO levels were inversely associated with child DQ.

Previous studies reported that TMAO can activate astrocytes and microglia and trigger a cascade of inflammatory responses in the brain, induce oxidative stress, superoxide production, and mitochondrial impairment, and cause inhibition of mTOR signaling in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mudimela et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Praveenraj et al., 2022</xref>). In this context, dysregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway may lead to substantial abnormalities in brain development, contributing to a wide array of neurological disorders, including ASD, seizure, learning impairments, and intellectual disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altomare and Gitto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee, 2015</xref>).</p><p>HA is a glycine conjugate derived from exposure to benzoic acid (i.e. preservative in processed foods), or generated via intestinal microbial fermentation of dietary polyphenols and phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Assem et al., 2018</xref>). Like other co-metabolized species, circulating HA concentrations depend on dietary exposures and host metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khan et al., 2022</xref>), in a case-control study involving 65 children with ASD and 20 children with typical development, reported that urinary HA was significantly higher in the ASD group, corroborating the inverse association found with DQ in our study. However, the effect of HA on metabolic health is still controversial as it has been proposed as a potential dietary biomarker for fruit and vegetable consumption in healthy children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krupp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pallister et al., 2017</xref>). HA also inhibits the Organic Anion Transporter (OAT) 3 function and contributes to the toxic action of other compounds, including indoxyl sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ticinesi et al., 2023</xref>), which may affect cognitive function by disrupting the brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>CS is a product of tyrosine fermentation in the gut involving more than 55 p-cresol producing bacteria prior to hepatic sulfate conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saito et al., 2018</xref>). CS was inversely associated with DQ in our study, and it has been studied in the early stages of life, particularly concerning conditions such as ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guzmán-Salas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Persico and Napolioni, 2013</xref>). Urinary p-cresol and CS are elevated in ASD-diagnosed children &lt;8 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altieri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Persico and Napolioni, 2013</xref>). Animal models have shown that CS is a gut-derived neurotoxin that can impact neuronal cell structural remodeling even at low doses via oxidative stress and secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tevzadze et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, p-cresol might impact developmental processes since it is related to impaired dendritic development, synaptogenesis, and synapse function in hippocampal neurons, which are crucial for cognitive and neural development in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guzmán-Salas et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Prior investigations have identified PAG, CS, HA, and TMAO as products of gut microbiota metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pallister et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reichard et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, dietary aromatic amino acids are metabolized by gut microbiota in the large intestine, converting phenylalanine into PAG and HA and tyrosine into CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reichard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ticinesi et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, TMAO originates from trimethylamine (TMA), which is produced from betaine compounds, including γ-butyrobetaine (dC0), choline, and carnitine via gut microbiota co-metabolism that is subsequently oxidized to TMAO in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reichard et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>These metabolic compounds in the bloodstream may elicit physiological responses influencing the central nervous system through direct passage across the blood-brain barrier or indirectly through vagus nerve stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morais et al., 2021</xref>). Such dynamics underscore the complex interactions between environmental exposures early in life, such as mode of birth and the child’s diet, and brain development in early childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azad et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Overall, serum PAG, HA, and TMAO showed a significant average causal mediation effect with dietary fiber intake that was inversely associated with DQ. However, the interpretation of mediation effects is limited by the observational nature of the data, and third variables may explain unexpected relationships between the variables in the analysis. Nevertheless, the results of our mediation analysis are an important step that future studies can build to further investigate the causal pathways leading to optimal DQ levels.</p><p>The age-dependent associations observed in our study are consistent with the age-related changes in metabolic profile reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Psihogios et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tian et al., 2022</xref>). Increased urinary TMAO and betaine levels were found in children aged six months, whereas creatine and Crtn levels increased significantly after six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>). Similar findings were reported by Gu et al. in a study that included children from newborn to 12 years of age. The urinary Crtn increased with age, whereas glycine, betaine/TMAO, citrate, succinate, and acetone decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). These changes may reflect a physiological age-dependent process related to the rapid growth occurring in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we observed that the child’s age changed the direction of the association between Crtn and MeHis with DQ. Crtn is generated non-enzymatically from creatine and is related to energy production within skeletal muscle tissue, whereas MeHis is related to protein turnover and has been evaluated as a biomarker for the rate of skeletal muscle breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kreider and Stout, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). For example, plasma and urinary MeHis are temporally associated with changes to a health-promoting Prudent diet in contrast to a Western diet, whose concentrations are positively correlated with greater self-reported daily protein intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wellington et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesize that higher serum concentrations of Crtn and MeHis in older children (&gt;49 months) may be due to the greater physical activity/mobility needed through the first years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our study provided valuable insights into the potential role of serum metabolome on ECD for children aged 6–59 months. One of the strengths of this study is the large sample size, which allows for a more comprehensive representation of the population on a national level. Using a subset of 5004 due to cost restrictions did not compromise the representativeness. The sample was randomly selected to constitute the final sample that aimed to represent the total number of children with blood drawn (8829 children). Hence, our efforts were to preserve the original characteristics of the sample and the representativeness of the original sample. Furthermore, our study employed a quantitative targeted and exploratory untargeted metabolomics method. This high-throughput metabolomics platform is strengthened by implementing rigorous quality control measures and batch-correction algorithms, ensuring the high accuracy and reproducibility needed for large-scale epidemiological studies. We used the DQ as a variable for evaluating ECD, which consists of a continuous parameter that integrates developmental milestones attained with the child’s chronological age at its achievement. DQ has been previously used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheldrick et al., 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freitas-Costa et al., 2023</xref>) has advantages such as enabling the assessment of each item rather than just the final score, as the item set might be biased—meaning there could be an imbalance in the number of activities more commonly achieved among the specified items. Consequently, reaching the maximum score on the scale may be easier for certain age groups. Some limitations are worth mentioning. First, this study did not include the analysis of hydrophobic/water-insoluble lipids, limiting overall metabolome coverage. Also, the inherent limitations of a cross-sectional study prevent us from making causal inferences concerning the temporal relationship between serum metabolic phenotypes and ECD trajectories. Moreover, birth weight and breastfeeding practices were available only for a limited number of participants and were not included in the regression adjustments. Concerning the child’s diet assessment, we estimated dietary diversity and fiber intake based on one1-day food intake reports, with the MDD specifically measuring dietary diversity within diet quality. Lastly, stool microbiome data was not collected from children in ENANI-2019 as it was not a study objective in this large population-based nutritional survey. However, the lack of microbiome data does not reduce the importance/relevance since there is no evidence that microbiome and factors affecting microbiome composition are confounders in the association between serum metabolome and child development.</p><p>In conclusion, this study represents a pioneering effort in Brazil, a population-based survey targeting children from 6 to 59 months of age that incorporated serum metabolome and ECD analysis. We found that serum PAG, HA, CS, and TMAO were inversely associated with ECD and that age can modify the effect of PAG, HA, TMAO, Crtn, and MeHis on development. Some circulating metabolites associated with DQ are relevant to microbiome health, it is possible that those circulating metabolites may be biomarkers of a beneficial effect of the microbiome on development. These results suggest that a panel of circulating metabolites might offer a preliminary warning of developmental risk and potentially be used as a screening tool to help identify children at risk for developmental delays at early stages of life.</p><p>We believe the results can contribute to the literature, which should be used to accumulate evidence to overcome knowledge gaps and support the formulation and redirection of public policies aimed at full child growth and development, the promotion of adequate and healthy nutrition and food security; the encouragement, support, and protection of breastfeeding; and the prevention and control of micronutrient deficiencies. Further prospective longitudinal studies, including stool-based microbiome analysis, are warranted to validate our findings and establish targeted intervention biomarkers besides providing further insights into possible mechanistic pathways.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The ENANI-2019 was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) under the number CAAE 89798718.7.0000.5257.

The decision was reached by consensus. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text.

Specifically, the Authors should consider the following points in their revision:</p><p>1) Inclusion of microbiome and factors affecting microbiome composition in the study as possible confounders</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment and suggestions. It is important to highlight that there is no data on microbiome composition. We apologize if there was an impression such data is available. The main goal of conducting this national survey was to provide qualified and updated evidence on child nutrition to revise and propose new policies and nutritional guidelines for this demographic. Therefore, collection of stool derived microbiome (metagenomic) data was not one of the objectives of ENANI-2019. This is more explicitly stated as a study limitation in the revised manuscript on page 17, lines 463-467:</p><p>“Lastly, stool microbiome data was not collected from children in ENANI-2019 as it was not a study objective in this large population-based nutritional survey. However, the lack of microbiome data does not reduce the importance/relevance, since there is no evidence that microbiome and factors affecting microbiome composition are confounders in the association between serum metabolome and child development.”</p><p>Besides, one must consider the difficulties and costs in collecting and analyzing microbiome composition in a large population-based survey. In contrast, the metabolome data has been considered a priority as there was already blood specimens collected to inform policy on micronutrient deficiencies in Brazil. However, due to funding limitations we had to perform the analysis in a subset of our sample, still representative and large enough to test our hypothesis with adequate study power (more details below).</p><p>We would like to argue that there is no evidence that microbiome and factors affecting microbiome composition are confounders on the association between serum metabolome and child development. First, one should revisit the properties of a confounder according to the epidemiology literature that in short states that confounding refers to an alternative explanation for a given conclusion, thus constituting one of the main problems for causal inference (Kleinbaum, Kupper, and Morgenstern, 1991; Greenland and Robins, 1986; VanderWeele, 2019). In our study, we highlight that certain serum metabolites associated with the developmental quotient (DQ) in children were circulating metabolites (e.g., cresol sulfate, hippuric acid, phenylacetylglutamine, TMAO) previously reported to depend on dietary exposures, host metabolism and gut microbiota activity. Our discussion cites other published work, including animal models and observational studies, which have reported how these bioactive metabolites in circulation are co-metabolized by commensal gut microbiota, and may play a role in neurodevelopment and cognition as mediated by environmental exposures early in life.</p><p>In fact, the literature on the association between microbiome and infant development is very limited. We performed a search using terms ‘microbiome’ OR ‘microbiota’ AND ‘child development’ AND ‘systematic’ OR ‘meta-analysis’ and found only one study: ‘Associations between the human immune system and gut microbiome with neurodevelopment in the first 5 years of life: A systematic scoping review’ (DOI 10.1002/dev.22360). The authors conclude: ‘while the immune system and gut microbiome are thought to have interactive impacts on the developing brain, there remains a paucity of published studies that report biomarkers from both systems and associations with child development outcomes.’ It is important to highlight that our criteria to include confounders on the directed acyclic graph (DAG) was based on the literature of systematic reviews or meta-analysis and not on single isolated studies.</p><p>In summary, we would like to highlight that there is no microbiome data in ENANI-2019 and in the event such data was present, we are confident that based on the current stage of the literature, there is no evidence to consider such construct in the DAG, as this procedure recommends that only variables associated with the exposure and the outcome should be included. Please find more details on DAG below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Possible shortcomings associated with the directed acyclic graph approach (clarifications as to the methodology employed; inclusion of the microbiome and additional factors affecting microbiome composition) and more broadly confounding variable selection</p></disp-quote><p>The use of DAGs has been widely explored as a valid tool for justifying the choice of confounding factors in regression models in epidemiology (Yan et al. 2024; Zhong et al. 2024; Al-Haddad et al. 2019; Chan et al. 2024). This is because DAGs allow for a clear visualization of causal relationships, clarify the complex relationships between exposure and outcome, and demonstrate the authors' transparency by acknowledging factors reported as important but not included/collected in the study. The statistical selection of variables, although classic, has become a less attractive approach as relies only on p-values and does not consider the biology and interaction between variables. This approach was a possibility, but the authors found the DAG is a more reliable and cutting-edge procedure. Besides, the DAG produced, and the suggested statistical adjustments performed to our regression models are very consistent.</p><p>Moreover, the DAG reduces the bias of data overfitting, which can lead to distortions in the results found. This error commonly occurs in other adjustment definition techniques, such as through bivariate statistical testing, since they do not guarantee causality, which is essential for causal inference. As described above, no evidence exists for the microbiome inclusion in DAG, which is otherwise not feasible to perform as stool specimens and metagenomic analyses were not collected/analyzed in ENANI-2019.</p><p>To make it clearer, we have modified the passage about DAG in the methods section. New text, page 9, lines 234-241:</p><p>“The subsequent step was to disentangle the selected metabolites from confounding variables. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG; Breitling et al., 2021) was used to more objectively determine the minimally sufficient adjustments for the regression models to account for potentially confounding variables while avoiding collider variables and variables in the metabolite-DQ causal pathways, which if controlled for would unnecessarily remove explained variance from the metabolites and hamper our ability to detect biomarkers. To minimize bias from subjective judgments of which variables should and should not be included as covariates, the DAG only included variables for which there was evidence from systematic reviews or meta-analysis of relationships with both the serum metabolome and DQ (Figure 1). Birth weight, breastfeeding, child's diet quality, the child's nutritional status, and the child's age were the minimal adjustments suggested by the DAG. Birth weight was a variable with high missing data, and indicators of breastfeeding practice data (referring to exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months and/or complemented until 2 years) were collected only for children aged 0–23 months. Therefore, those confounders were not included as adjustments. Child's diet quality was evaluated as MDD, the child's nutritional status as w/h z-score, and the child's age in months.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Lack of power calculations and sensitivity analyses to validate some of the strong assumptions made in subject selection, stratifications and covariate identifications</p></disp-quote><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no peer-reviewed manuscripts or books describing power calculation procedures for partial least squares (PLS)-based analyses. However, given our large sample size, we do not believe power was an issue with the analyses. For our regression analyses, which typically have 4 predictors, we had 95% power to detect an f-squared of 0.003 and an r of 0.05 in a two-sided correlation test considering an alpha level of 0.05.</p><p>Changes to the text were made to make this clearer to the reader. New text, page 11, lines 296-300:</p><p>“Given the size of our sample, statistical power is not an issue in our analyses. Considering an alpha of 0.05 for a two-sided test, a sample size of 5000 has 95% power to detect a correlation of r = 0.05 and an effect of f2 = 0.003 in a multiple regression model with 4 predictors. As an initial assessment of the zero-order associations between DQ and serum metabolites, Pearson’ s correlations were performed. This revealed 26 negative and 2 positive statistically significant associations (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Relevance/appropriate use of PLSR</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the question. PLS-based analyses are among the most commonly used analyses for parsing metabolomic data (Blekherman et al., 2011; Wold et al., 2001; Gromski et al. 2015). This procedure is especially appropriate for cases in which there are multiple collinear predictor variables as it provides estimates of the metabolite predictiveness which are unbiased by multicollinearity between the metabolites, something a multiple linear regression analysis would be unable to achieve. PLSR is also more advantageous than testing each metabolite in separate analyses corrected for multiple comparisons (which would avoid bias from multicollinearity) because the correlated nature of the metabolites means the comparisons are not truly independent and would cause the corrections to be overly strict. Finally, the PLSR is more appropriate than the PLS-DA for our data because the dependent variable is continuous. Dichotomizing the dependent variable to be able to run a PLS-DA would entail a loss of information in the variable and less statistical power to detect relevant associations.</p><p>One of the reviewers questioned the use of PLSR on the basis that it merely ruled out some of the metabolites. Given that our goal is to select the most predictive serum metabolites in children from ENANI-2019, ruling out the less predictive metabolites is precisely what we aim to achieve. As explained above, the PLSR model allows us to reach that goal without introducing bias in our estimates or losing statistical power.</p><p>Considering this point, a passage on this aspect was added to the paper text.</p><p>New text, page 8, lines 220-224:</p><p>“To better assess the predictiveness of each metabolite in a single model, a PLSR was conducted. PLS-based analyses are the most commonly used analyses when determining the predictiveness of a large number of variables as they avoid issues with collinearity, sample size, and corrections for multiple-testing (Blekherman et al., 2011; Wold et al., 2001; Gromski et al. 2015).”</p><p>New text, page 12, lines 312-314:</p><p>“In PLSR analysis, the training data suggested that three components best predicted the data (the model with three components had the highest R2, and the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was only slightly lower with four components). In comparison, the test data showed a slightly more predictive model with four components (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discuss the use of DQ as a viable outcome</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We are confident developmental quotient (DQ) is a viable outcome measure. The use of DQ has been discussed further in the manuscript to show is a consistent and useful measure of infant development.</p><p>In short, this method has been conceptualized by Sheldrick and Perrin (2013) and Sheldrick et al. (2019), the Survey of Well-being of Young Children creators. The goal was to provide an alternative for continuous assessments, considering that often times, development obeys a continuum, and its delay does not happen only when a threshold is reached. The DQ has been used previously by our team (Freitas-Costa et al. 2023) and other authors have used with different development tests, such as the Denver test (Drachler et al. 2007).</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>The DQ is a continuous variable calculated by dividing developmental age by chronological age. The developmental age was estimated using the item response theory according to the child's developmental milestones already reached. Differently for test scores use, these methods avoid the influence of items set in the results This method allows the evaluation of each responding item and not only the final score, as the item set can be biased—that is, there may be a disproportion in the number of activities more commonly achieved among the specified items. Therefore, reaching the maximum score on the scale may be easier in some age groups.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This procedure allowed estimation in all the 12 age groups listed before, including milestones that did not apply and using chronological age as one of the estimators. The estimated model allowed the construction of an item characteristic curve (ICC) for each milestone, representing the change in the probability of a given response (sometimes or always) from birth to 62 months of age (age maximum in our data) and estimating the age of development.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The final model generated ICC and 2 parameters (α and β) for each milestone. α1 and α2 refer to the probable age at which children reach each developmental milestone, performing them sometimes (α1) or always (α2), respectively. β refers to the discrimination of each milestone. It describes the curve slope, indicating the probability of reaching the developmental milestone, which increases with the child’s chronological age. ICC, α1, α2, and β made it possible to estimate developmental age according to the developmental milestones reached by each child.</p></list-item></list><p>Please find below a new paragraph that has been included in the Materials and methods section and new text in the Discussion section too with the main advantages of using DQ.</p><p>New text, page 16, lines 448-452:</p><p>“DQ has been previously used (Sheldrick et al., 2019 and Freitas-Costa et al., 2023) has advantages such as enabling the assessment of each item rather than just the final score, as the item set might be biased—meaning there could be an imbalance in the number of activities more commonly achieved among the specified items. Consequently, reaching the maximum score on the scale may be easier for certain age groups.”</p><p>New text, page 5-6, lines 134-152:</p><p>“The Developmental quotient (DQ) is a continuous variable calculated by dividing developmental age by chronological age. The item response theory and graded response models were used to estimate development age (Samejima, 1997) according to the child's developmental milestones already reached (Sheldrick et al. 2019). The analysis used the full information method and incorporated the complex sample design in the Mplus software version 7 (Los Angeles, EUA) (Muthén and Muthén, n.d.). The estimated model allowed the construction of an item characteristic curve (ICC) for each milestone, representing the change in the probability of a given response (sometimes or always) and the discrimination of each milestone development by age, estimating the development age (Freitas-Costa et al., 2023). The ICC and its coefficients were used to estimate developmental age according to the developmental milestones reached by each child. This methodology has been previously used to assess ECD with the SWYC (Freitas-Costa et al., 2023; Sheldrick et al., 2019; Sheldrick and Perrin, 2013) and the Denver Test (Drachler et al., 2007).</p><p>Differently for test scores use, these methods avoid the influence of items set in the results.

Consequently, reaching the maximum score on the scale may be easier for certain age groups. The developmental quotient (DQ) was calculated by dividing the developmental age by the chronological age (Freitas-Costa et al., 2023; Sheldrick and Perrin, 2013). DQ equals to 1 indicates that the expected age milestones are attained. DQ values &lt; 1 or &gt; 1 suggest attaining age milestones below or above expectations, respectively. This method allows analyzing the outcome as a continuous variable.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Biases in subject selection (towards higher socio-economic status) and generalizability of the study</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this point. The ENANI-2019 is a population-based household survey with national coverage and representativeness for macroregions, sex, and one-year age groups (&lt; 1; 1-1.99; 2-2.99; 3-3.99; 4-5). Furthermore, income quartiles of the census sector were used in the sampling. The study included 12,524 households 14,588 children, and 8,829 infants with blood drawn.</p><p>Due to the costs involved in metabolome analysis, it was necessary to further reduce the sample size to around 5,000 children that is equivalent to 57% of total participants from ENANI-2019 with stored blood specimens. To avoid a biased sample and keep the representativeness and generability, the 5,004 selected children were drawn from the total samples of 8,829 to keep the original distribution according age groups (6 to 11 months, 12 to 23 months, and 24 to 59 months), and some health conditions related to iron metabolism, e.g., anemia and nutrient deficiencies. Then, they were randomly selected to constitute the final sample that aimed to represent the total number of children with blood drawn. Hence, our efforts were to preserve the original characteristics of the sample and the representativeness of the original sample.</p><p>The ENANI-2019 study does not appear to present a bias towards higher socioeconomic status. Evidence from two major Brazilian population-based household surveys supports this claim. The 2017-18 Household Budget Survey (POF) reported an average monthly household income of 5,426.70 reais, while the Continuous National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) reported that in 2019, the nominal monthly per capita household income was 1,438.67 reais. In comparison, ENANI-2019 recorded a household income of 2,144.16 reais and a per capita income of 609.07 reais in infants with blood drawn, and 2,099.14 reais and 594.74 reais, respectively, in the serum metabolome analysis sample.</p><p>In terms of maternal education, the 2019 PNAD-Education survey indicated that 48.8% of individuals aged 25 or older had at least 11 years of schooling. When analyzing ENANI-2019 under the same metric, we found that 56.26% of ≥25 years-old mothers of infants with blood drawn had 11 years of education or more, and 51.66% in the metabolome analysis sample. Although these figures are slightly higher, they remain within a reasonable range for population studies.</p><p>It is well known that higher income and maternal education levels can influence child health outcomes, and acknowledging this, ENANI-2019 employed rigorous sampling methods to minimize selection biases. This included stratified and complex sampling designs to ensure that underrepresented groups were adequately included, reducing the risk of skewed conclusions. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that the ENANI-2019 sample is broadly representative of the Brazilian population in terms of both socioeconomic status and educational attainment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would recommend that the authors include all study covariates in Table 1, Supplementary Table 1 and the Methods section Covariates to prevent confusion.

For example, “Overall, children had lower DQs if they were male (p = 2 x 10<sup>-14</sup>), older (p &lt; 2 x 10<sup>-16</sup>)…”</p><p>The reviewer recommendation to disregard the use of the DAG lacks a clear rationale and seems to be made because this is new to the reviewer or not used at all in his/her field. We would like to invite the reviewer to read a few seminal manuscripts about the procedure and consider other initiatives beyond the classic approaches (Greenland, Pearl and Robins, 1999; Hernán and Robins, 2020).</p><p>The use of DAGs for the selection of confounders of causal relationships is considered a cutting-edge procedure in the modern epidemiology literature (Yan et al. 2024; Zhong et al. 2024; Al-Haddad et al. 2019; Chan et al. 2024). Its advantages are exactly the opposite of what the reviewer says are its drawbacks. The DAG displays variables well documented considering systematic literature reviews and meta-analysis. Therefore, it does not include variables based on authors perceived relevance.</p><p>The DAG’s purpose is to reduce bias from subjective decisions on which variables to include and to select the appropriate covariates which are less likely to be colliders or to otherwise interfere with the estimates of the association between DQ and the metabolome.

Furthermore, we would like to clarify that all unknown ions reported in the ENANI-2019 study that were not identified with high confidence (level 1) by spiking with authentic standards and/or collision-induced dissociation experiments by MS/MS were annotated based on their accurate mass, relative migration time and ionization mode detected when using MSI-CE-MS. These unknown ions were also further authenticated after verifying that they were measurable with adequate precision in repeat pooled quality control (QC) samples throughput the study (mean CV &lt; 40%), did not exhibit a signal in the blank (i.e., excluding background ions or artifact signals) and were also detected with adequate consistency in serum samples analyzed from the ENANI-2019 study (detection frequency &gt; 70%). Furthermore, a tentative identification (level 3) was proposed for certain unknown ions after completing a search on the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB, https://hmdb.ca) based on viable candidates consistent with their charge state or functional group (e.g., basic amino functional group for cation or carboxylic acid functional group for anion) with reported concentrations in blood that were likely measurable (above low micromolar levels), whereas in other cases no candidate was reported. Further details on our data workflow for rigorous selection of molecular features when using performing untargeted serum metabolomic analyses as well as criteria used for metabolite annotation and identification is described elsewhere (Shanmuganathan et al.

Because our study is concerned with serum metabolomic biomarkers of DQ, we focused on them instead of other covariates. Nevertheless, we ran the PLSR with the same covariates as in the regression models and found that, except for age (which is more strongly associated with DQ, as reported in the manuscript, r = 0.31), the covariates were less predictive of DQ than the majority of the metabolites (VIPs for age = 3.9, height/weight = 0.7, dietary diversity = 0.7). However, these results are difficult to interpret; we are unsure how the differing scales and distributions of the covariates, when compared to the metabolite data, affect their interpretation. Furthermore, the research we are familiar with does not include covariates in PLS analyses, so we believe it is safer to not include them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All abbreviations included in the manuscript should be defined at their first instance.</p></disp-quote><p>All abbreviations have been defined at their initial appearance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the DQ is an invaluable metric, it would also be of interest to explore the relationship between serum metabolite biomarkers and the different neurodevelopmental domains (e.g., motor, cognitive, language, socio-emotional) if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be very interesting to explore the relationship between metabolomics and the different domains of child development. However, the SWCY is a screening tool that assesses the motor, language, and cognitive domains all together. Therefore, the result concerns the global/overall development. It is unfortunate but is not possible to distinguish which domain is at risk of delay. We chose this questionnaire because it is freely accessible, quick, easy to apply and can be used as a continuous outcome. In addition, it has been translated and cross-culturally adapted for use with the Brazilian population (Moreira et al., 2019). Therefore, it is feasible to be used in a population-based household survey conducted in a country with continental dimensions, such as Brazil. In the methods section and 'Assessment of ECD' subsection (page 5, lines 113-131), we describe the details of the SWYC and the domains it assesses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Why was sensitivity analysis not done? Why was mediation analysis done and stopped? Shouldn't other testing have been done?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the question. It is unclear to us which sensitivity analysis the reviewer would have liked us to perform. We tested the association of serum metabolites and DQ under a number of different conditions (zero-order correlations, regressions with potential confounders, interactions with sex and age) and reported which metabolites held up across the analyses. In our view, this functions as a set of sensitivity tests for the metabolite-DQ relationship.</p><p>Regarding the mediation analyses, we noticed that our theoretical justifications for running it were in the statistical analysis section rather than the Results section. Therefore, our reasoning for running it was not clear when we presented the results. We have the new text from the statistical analysis section (page 9, lines 250-255):</p><p>“Since several circulating metabolites most associated with DQ are relevant to microbiome health, those circulating metabolites may be biomarkers of a beneficial effect of the microbiome on development. We employed mediation analyses to explore the potential role of specific serum metabolites as mediators in the relationship between certain exposure variables related to the microbiome establishment in early life, such as mode of delivery (Reyman et al., 2019), child's diet quality (Baldeon et al., 2023), as well as child fiber intake (Cronin et al., 2021) and DQ.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Though it is a large sample size, the sampling technique was convenience sampling. In resource-poor settings this may be the methodology that is followed but has funding been applied for? What are the plans for further study?</p></disp-quote><p>The ENANI-2019 is a complex sampling household-based population survey on food and nutrition in children under five years of age. The sample was calculated at 15,000 households distributed across 123 municipalities (counties) in Brazil’s 26 states and the Federal District. The sample size, 3,000 households in each of the five major geographic regions, was defined to estimate a minimum proportion of 2% with a relative error of 35% (representing a range from 1.3% to 2.7%), 95% confidence level, and sampling design effect set at 2.</p><p>Brazil’s 5,570 municipalities, stratified in state capitals, large municipalities (population &gt; 500,000), and other municipalities, were grouped by the major geographic regions. All the state capitals and large municipalities were included in the sample. In contrast, in the other strata, the municipalities were selected with probability proportional to the estimated number of children under five years of age on July 1, 2016. In the sampled municipalities, the census tracts were stratified by mean household income quartiles and selected with probability proportional to the number of children under five years of age, according to the 2010 Population Census, using Pareto sampling. The selection of households used an inverse sampling strategy until 10 households had been obtained in the tract or all the addresses in the tract had been visited, with any number of households interviewed. Details on the sampling plan are available in Vasconcellos MTL, Silva PLN, Castro IRR, Boccolini CS, Alves-Santos NH, Kac G.

What was the time period of the data collection? Which year? Is it relevant in the world of 2024?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in Materials and methods – Study design and participants – ENANI-2019 data collection took place from February 2019 and ended in March 2020. Although time has passed since data was collected, we are confident that the results of this manuscript are relevant because the study aims to present the associations between children’s serum metabolome and early child development (ECD), a topic with limited literature and of great relevance. The presence or absence of this association is independent of the time or sociodemographic and epidemiological context, given that the association is intrinsic to metabolism and infant development characteristics. However, we agree that sociodemographic and epidemiological contexts may influence the metabolome and ECD, and these factors may have changed since the data collection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Can the data be compared with data from Brazil where the children were from lower socioeconomic strata or where mothers or caregivers education was lower or higher than what is mentioned in the study?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. This has been already discussed in reply #6 to the reviewer #2 that has been pasted below for convenience.</p><p>Thank you for highlighting this point. The ENANI-2019 is a population-based household survey with national coverage and representativeness for macroregions, sex, and one-year age groups (&lt; 1; 1-1.99; 2-2.99; 3-3.99; 4-5). Furthermore, income quartiles of the census sector were used in the sampling. The study included 12,524 households 14,588 children, and 8,829 infants with blood drawn.</p><p>Due to the costs involved in metabolome analysis, it was necessary to further reduce the sample size to around 5,000 children that is equivalent to 57% of total participants from ENANI-2019 with stored blood specimens. To avoid a biased sample and keep the representativeness and generability, the 5,004 selected children were drawn from the total samples of 8,829 to keep the original distribution according age groups (6 to 11 months, 12 to 23 months, and 24 to 59 months), and some health conditions related to iron metabolism, e.g., anemia and nutrient deficiencies. Then, they were randomly selected to constitute the final sample that aimed to represent the total number of children with blood drawn. Hence, our efforts were to preserve the original characteristics of the sample and the representativeness of the original sample.</p><p>The ENANI-2019 study does not appear to present a bias towards higher socioeconomic status. Evidence from two major Brazilian population-based household surveys supports this claim. The 2017-18 Household Budget Survey (POF) reported an average monthly household income of 5,426.70 reais, while the Continuous National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) reported that in 2019, the nominal monthly per capita household income was 1,438.67 reais. In comparison, ENANI-2019 recorded a household income of 2,144.16 reais and a per capita income of 609.07 reais in infants with blood drawn, and 2,099.14 reais and 594.74 reais, respectively, in the serum metabolome analysis sample.</p><p>In terms of maternal education, the 2019 PNAD-Education survey indicated that 48.8% of individuals aged 25 or older had at least 11 years of schooling. When analyzing ENANI-2019 under the same metric, we found that 56.26% of ≥25 years-old mothers of infants with blood drawn had 11 years of education or more, and 51.66% in the metabolome analysis sample. Although these figures are slightly higher, they remain within a reasonable range for population studies.</p><p>It is well known that higher income and maternal education levels can influence child health outcomes, and acknowledging this, ENANI-2019 employed rigorous sampling methods to minimize selection biases. This included stratified and complex sampling designs to ensure that underrepresented groups were adequately included, reducing the risk of skewed conclusions. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that the ENANI-2019 sample is broadly representative of the Brazilian population in terms of both socioeconomic status and educational attainment.</p><p>References used on the rebuttal letter</p><p>Blekherman, G., Laubenbacher, R., Cortes, D.
