One of the reasons why the internal milieu of the GI system is poorly investigated is because visceral organs are difficult to access and monitor. To directly measure the influence of endoluminal markers of GI activity on the emotional experience, we asked a group of healthy male participants to ingest a pill that measured pH, pressure, and temperature of their GI tract while they watched video clips that consistently induced disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or a control neutral state. In addition to the objective physiological markers of GI activity, subjective ratings of perceived emotions and visceral (i.e. gastric, respiratory and cardiac) sensations were recorded, as well as changes in heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) and spontaneous eyes blinks as non-gastric behavioral and autonomic markers of the emotional experience. We found that when participants observed fearful and disgusting video clips, they reported to perceive not only cardiac and respiratory sensations but also gastric sensations, such as nausea. Moreover, we found that there was a clear relation between the physiology of the stomach and the perceived emotions. Specifically, when disgusting video clips were displayed, the more acidic the pH, the more participants reported feelings of disgust and fear; the less acidic the pH, the more they reported happiness. Complementing the results found in the deep gastric realm, we found that disgusting stimuli induced a significant increase in HRV compared to the neutral scenarios, and together with fearful video clips a decrease in HR. Our findings suggest that gastric signals contribute to unique emotional states and that ingestible pills may open new avenues for exploring the deep-body physiology of emotions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>emotions</kwd><kwd>gut</kwd><kwd>ingestible pills</kwd><kwd>pH</kwd><kwd>interoception</kwd><kwd>visceral sensations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>789058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aglioti</surname><given-names>Salvatore Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019470</institution-id><institution>Lazio Innova</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A0375-2020-36612</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panasiti</surname><given-names>Maria Serena</given-names></name><name><surname>Aglioti</surname><given-names>Salvatore Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id><institution>Ministero della Salute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-2367636</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Porciello</surname><given-names>Giuseppina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id><institution>Ministero della Salute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-12372815</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Porciello</surname><given-names>Giuseppina</given-names></name><name><surname>Panasiti</surname><given-names>Maria Serena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004271</institution-id><institution>Sapienza Università di Roma</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SEED PNR21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Porciello</surname><given-names>Giuseppina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Direct measures of inner gastrointestinal signals via ingestible capsules highlight the role of stomach pH in shaping human feelings of disgust, fear and happiness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>The neglected role of gastrointestinal (GI) system in emotions</title><p>Whether specific patterns of physiological signals coming from visceral organs trigger a unique emotional state is a hotly debated question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James, 1894</xref>). Somatic theories of emotions posit that afferent physiological signals are essential for experiencing distinct emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Damasio, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James, 1894</xref>). However, so far the large majority of the studies on the influence of visceral signals on emotions focused on the role of cardiac and respiratory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kreibig, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rainville et al., 2006</xref>), neglecting the potential role of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</p><p>Yet, the GI system is directly connected with the central nervous system via vagal and spinal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzalini et al., 2019</xref>). In turn, different cortical areas directly influence parasympathetic and sympathetic control of the stomach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levinthal and Strick, 2020</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that the slow electrical rhythm (~0.05 Hz) generated in the stomach by the interstitial cells of Cajal interacts with resting-state neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rebollo et al., 2018</xref>). This interaction, described as the ‘<italic>gastric network</italic>’ and mostly composed by sensory-motor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rebollo and Tallon-Baudry, 2022</xref>), seems to be stronger during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeanne et al., 2023</xref>), and to go beyond food intake and weight regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levakov et al., 2021</xref>), possibly playing a role in higher order cognitive and emotional functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzalini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Porciello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebollo et al., 2021</xref>). That the GI system plays a fundamental role in the experience of emotions has been suggested by studies in which healthy participants were asked to associate basic and complex emotions with the subjective perception of changes taking place in specific parts of the body, including the heart, the lungs, and the GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nummenmaa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nummenmaa et al., 2014</xref>). Tellingly, people tend to link changes of activity in the stomach and the bowel with the experience of disgust and happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nummenmaa et al., 2014</xref>). It is worth noting that, although insightful, these findings derive from mere self-report data. Studies of objective indices of association between deep body activation and emotions are meager. To the best of our knowledge, these few studies show a direct contribution of the GI system to the emotional experience of disgust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shenhav and Mendes, 2014</xref>) using electrogastrography (EGG), a technique that allows recording the myoelectric activity of the stomach through electrodes applied to the skin overlying the epigastric region. Overall, these experiments suggest that the gastric myoelectric dysrhythmias contribute to the emotional experience of disgust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shenhav and Mendes, 2014</xref>) and that disgusting stimuli specifically reduce slow gastric activity (bradygastria) and increase normal (normogastria) and high (tachygastria) gastric activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gianaros et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peyrot des Gachons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shenhav and Mendes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stern et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vianna and Tranel, 2006</xref>). In line with these findings, a recent randomized, placebo-controlled study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nord et al., 2021</xref>) run on healthy participants showed that oculomotor avoidance (a marker of disgust) evoked by disgusting stimuli significantly decreases after taking domperidone, an antiemetic and prokinetic agent that seems to reduce gastric dysrhythmias. Unfortunately, though, no EGG or any other objective measure of gastric physiology was provided.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Ingestibles as an innovative method for exploring the deep physiology of emotions</title><p>One of the reasons why the endoluminal milieu of the GI system is poorly known is because internal organs are difficult to access and monitor using non-invasive or minimally invasive tools. To overcome this limitation, recent technologies, such as ingestible sensors, have been developed in animal (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mimee et al., 2018</xref>) and clinical research for non-invasive diagnostics of diseases affecting the GI system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mandsberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Min et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rao et al., 2011</xref>), for local drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mandsberg et al., 2020</xref>), and for mapping heart rate, respiratory rate and apneic events, from within the human gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Traverso et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, recent findings show that ingestible pills can be used to explore higher-order cognitive and emotional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayeli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mayeli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monti et al., 2022</xref>). In particular, we used an ingestible capsule (SmartPill Motility Testing System, Medtronic plc) able to record pH, pressure and inner temperature throughout the entire GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saad, 2016</xref>) when participants experienced the illusion of embodying a virtual breathing agent (referred to as the Embreathment, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cantoni et al., 2024</xref>). We have provided the first evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monti et al., 2022</xref>) that specific patterns of GI signals co-vary with distinct facets of bodily self-consciousness (i.e. feelings of body location, agency, and disembodiment). Instead, the group led by Khalsa used a vibrating ingestible capsule (Vibrant Ltd) in combination with electroencephalography (EEG), and found an increase in late positive deflections in the event-related potentials (ERPs), maximally located over parieto-occipital electrodes during vibratory gut stimulation. This increase in amplitude correlated with participants’ perceptual accuracy in detecting the vibrating stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayeli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mayeli et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we used the SmartPills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saad, 2016</xref>) while participants watched a validated set of short video clips that reliably induced four basic emotions: fear, disgust, sadness, and happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tettamanti et al., 2012</xref>), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for a graphical illustration of the emotional induction procedure. The gastric internal parameters detected through SmartPills were complemented with standard surface EGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yin and Chen, 2013</xref>) that primarily mapped myoelectric activity of the stomach but also cardiac activity, and with vertical electrooculogram that mapped spontaneous eye blinks. Our approach allowed us to identify internally and externally recorded physiological and behavioral markers associated with specific emotional experiences. We also collected self-report ratings of emotions, visceral feelings, and perceived arousal. In this way, we checked the efficacy of our stimuli and measured how the emotional experience induced by the video clips made our participants aware of their visceral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig, 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the emotional induction procedure.</title><p>Participants were asked to observe five blocks of 24 video clips each.

With respect to the GI physiological signals, our hypotheses relied on a limited number of prior studies that did not make use of the pill technology. Hence, the present study should be considered as the first attempt to explore the neglected contribution of GI internal markers to the emotional experience. On the basis on the published literature on core disgust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nord et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shenhav and Mendes, 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that the subjective experience of disgust during the observation of the disgusting video clips would be linked to individual gastric rhythm as indexed by the EGG traces and the GI pressure recorded by the ingestible pill. Moreover, based on single case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett and Venables, 1920</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wolf and Wolff, 1947</xref>), we also predicted that the subjective experience of disgust, fear, and sadness would be associated with more acidic pH in the stomach. Based on the literature showing that externally recorded oral or axillary body temperature increases after the observation of disgusting and stressful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marazziti et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>), we predicted that, compared with happy and neutral emotional states, disgust, fear, and sadness, triggered by the corresponding video clips, would be associated with an increase of GI temperature.</p><p>Furthermore, building upon literature that proposes specificity in autonomic nervous system responses associated with distinct subtypes of emotions (as extensively reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kreibig, 2010</xref>) and supported by experimental findings revealing that different rates of spontaneous eye blinks rates correspond to distinct emotional categories (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maffei and Angrilli, 2019</xref>), we also expected variations in heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and the amount of spontaneous eye blinks as additional non-gastric indicators of distinct emotional experiences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subjective emotional experience</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Capsule in the stomach (Session 1)</title><p>To verify the effectiveness of our video clips in eliciting distinct emotional states, we conducted a Friedman ANOVA to compare the perceived emotional experiences (i.e. disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) triggered by the five types of video clips (varying for their content, i.e. disgusting, fearful, happy, sad, and neutral) during the first session (namely when the capsule was in the stomach). In agreement with the hypotheses, we found that Friedman ANOVA was statistically significant (χ<sup>2</sup> (19)=296.91; p&lt;0.0001), suggesting that participants perceived different emotions after observing the different content of the video clips.

In particular, gastric sensations evoked by disgusting and fearful videos were significantly higher than those evoked by happy video clips (all <italic>Z</italic>s ≥2.824; all ps ≤0.005). Gastric sensations evoked by disgusting video clips were significantly higher than those evoked by neutral video clips (<italic>Z</italic>=2.777; p≤0.005), while gastric sensations evoked by fearful video clips were only marginally (considering the Bonferroni corrected significance threshold of 0.0125) higher than those evoked by neutral video clips (<italic>Z</italic>=2.375; p=0.018). Gastric sensations evoked by sad video clips were significantly higher only with respect to those evoked by happy video clips (<italic>Z</italic>=2.830; p≤0.005). As to the <italic>cardiac sensations</italic>, we found that all the emotional video clips evoked higher cardiac sensations with respect to the neutral video clips (all Zs ≥3.295; all ps ≤0.001). As for the <italic>respiratory sensations</italic>, we found that they were maximally evoked by disgusting, fearful, and sad videos (i.e. those inducing negative emotions). In particular, respiratory sensations evoked by disgusting, fearful and sad videos were significantly higher than those evoked by happy and neutral video clips, (all <italic>Z</italic>s ≥3.036; all ps ≤0.002). Happy video clips evoked higher respiratory sensations than neutral video clips (<italic>Z</italic>=2.515; p≤0.012).

Specifically, we induced disgust, fear, sadness, and happiness three times, when an inert ingestible pill that gauged pH, temperature and pressure was in the stomach, small and large bowel. When the pill was in the stomach we also recorded, via electrogastrography (EGG), participants’ gastric myoelectric activity.</p><p>In addition to the objective GI measures, we collected participants’ subjective perception evoked by the different stimuli. Specifically, at the end of each emotional block, we asked participants to evaluate by means of 0–100 visuo-analogue scales (VAS) their perceived emotions, visceral sensations (gastric, cardiac, and respiratory) and arousal.</p><p>Finally, to complement those measures with more consolidated ones, we also collected changes in heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and spontaneous eye blinks as non-gastric behavioral and autonomic markers of the emotional experience.</p><p>In keeping with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tettamanti et al., 2012</xref>), we found that the four emotional categories of the video clips were clearly able to induce all the intended emotions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The effect was present in all the three experimental sessions, indicating that emotional induction was successful and no habituation over time occurred. It is also worth noting that the four types of emotional video clips differed from the neutral ones which were perceived as less arousing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, bottom right panel). These findings are consistent with previous literature suggesting that perceived arousal is indeed an essential component of the emotional experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Posner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Russell and Barrett, 1999</xref>) even if, unlike previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vianna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vianna and Tranel, 2006</xref>), we did not find higher ratings of arousal triggered by negative vs. positive video clips suggesting that the reported effects are genuinely associated with emotional experience in general.</p><p>Our results on the visceral sensations suggest that the subjective perception of different bodily signals, particularly of gastric feelings, varied across the different emotions. Specifically, gastric sensations were higher after observing fearful videos and maximal after observing disgusting videos, compared to the other emotional video clips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, upper left panel). Respiratory sensations, in turn, were higher after observation of disgusting, fearful and sad video clips, compared to the happy and neutral ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, bottom left panel). Cardiac sensations instead did not differ between the emotional categories and were higher with respect to non-emotional stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, upper right panel). These results confirmed the idea that interoception (i.e. the awareness of physiological changes coming from internal organs) is a key component of emotional feelings. This is in line with theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrett, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrett, 2014</xref>) that suggest a key role of bodily signals in the experience of emotions. However, the results also suggest that specific visceral signals uniquely characterize each emotional state, indicating that conceiving distinct emotional experience (in line with somatic theories of emotions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Damasio, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">James, 1994</xref>) provides a clearer description of our data. With respect to our main hypothesis – that internally and externally recorded GI markers are linked to emotions – we found that gastric physiology does play a significant role in emotional experiences. Specifically, the more acidic the pH recorded in participants’ stomach, the more they reported disgust and fear; the less acidic the gastric environment, the more participants reported happiness, independently from the observed category of video clips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). Moreover, when participants were exposed to disgusting video clips, more acidic gastric pH was associated with higher reports of disgust and fear, while less acidic gastric pH was associated with higher reports of happiness. Similarly, when participants were exposed to fearful video clips, the less acidic was their pH, the more they reported to perceive happiness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Overall, these results were only found for the stomach and did not extend to the (small and large) bowel. Although it is true that the order was fixed, so that intestine data were always recorded after participants had already been exposed to a first round of video clips when the capsule was in the stomach, at the subjective level (i.e. emotional and visceral VAS ratings) emotional stimuli did induce the same experience in all the three sessions. In the light of this evidence and of the literature, it seems that stomach physiology, and not a pure novelty effect triggered by the emotional stimuli, plays a specific and crucial role in subjective emotional experience.</p><p>To complement results showing a key role of the stomach pH in the perceived emotional experience, we also tested the hypothesis that independently from the conscious emotional experience (i.e. emotional VAS ratings) the pH varies during the observation of the different types of video clips. In fact, we found that stomach pH was generally more acidic when participants observed disgusting video clips and generally less acidic when participants observed happy video-clips. These effects did not change over time. Differently, we found that stomach pH was more acidic when participants observed fearful compared to happy video-clips, and less acidic compared to neutral and sad scenarios, with a general decrease over time of the pH, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>Our findings about the link between pH acidity of the stomach and (perceived) emotions (disgust, fear, and happiness) are in line with the anecdotal reports described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaumont, 1833</xref> about Alexis St. Martin. He was a Canadian fur trader with a gunshot-created permanent fistula, through which Beaumont could access secretion samples from the patient’s stomach and report that when he was exposed to emotional experiences, mainly stress and anger, his gastric secretion changed color. Following these first inspiring but qualitative findings, very few studies explored changes in the human gastric milieu during higher-order cognitive and emotional processes. To the best of our knowledge, two single case studies conducted in the past century reported changes at the level of gastric acid output following anxiety induction procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett and Venables, 1920</xref>) and a decrease in stomach motility and acid secretion during depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wolf and Wolff, 1947</xref>). Only after more than four decades, a somewhat systematic investigation showed that an acute psychological stress (i.e. caused by performing mental arithmetic and solving anagrams) not only increased arterial blood pressure and heart rate, but also stimulated gastric acid output recorded by means of a nasogastric tube in healthy participants scoring high in impulsivity traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holtmann et al., 1990</xref>). Although in the present study we did not measure gastric secretion, which is a procedure that usually relies on invasive techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>), we show that stomach pH might be an important marker of emotional experience and that ingestible pills could be a non-invasive and sensitive tool to measure it.</p><p>Regarding the EGG data, we did not find any association between the perceived emotions (i.e. emotional VAS ratings) and individuals’ peak frequency of the normogastric and tachigastric band, differently to what previous literature suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shenhav and Mendes, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gianaros et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peyrot des Gachons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shenhav and Mendes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stern et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vianna and Tranel, 2006</xref>). However, the emotional induction did influence the EGG tachigastric peak frequency. Post hoc analyses showed that during the happy videos the gastric cycle was faster compared to fearful video clips. Future studies with longer emotional induction procedures, more sophisticated analyses, and multiple-channel montage are needed to better investigate if and how emotional video clips might affect over time the whole spectrum of gastric frequencies and clarify the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Unlike stomach pH, neither GI pressure nor temperature were associated with the emotional experience in the present study. It is important to underline that SmartPill capsules record temperature with a relatively low sample rate (every 20 s). Therefore, it is possible that different technologies with higher sample rates might be more sensitive to detect changes of endoluminal temperature triggered by the emotional experience.</p><p>Complementing the results found in the deep gastric realm, we also found that disgusting stimuli induced a significant increase in heart rate variability (HRV), as indexed by an increase in the root mean square of successive beat-to-beat interval differences (RMSSD), compared to the neutral scenarios and that, together with fearful ones, induced a decrease in heart rate (HR). The results concerning fearful video clips contradict several pieces of evidence published in literature reporting an increase of HR (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kreibig et al., 2007</xref>). However, they align with a few studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fredrickson and Levenson, 1998</xref>) that have instead documented a decrease in heart rate in response to video clips eliciting fear of falling (which was also present in the fearful video clips we used). With respect to the results on disgust, they align with evidence published in literature reporting a decrease in HR (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldaro et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meissner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Palomba et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rohrmann and Hopp, 2008</xref>) and an increase in HRV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rohrmann and Hopp, 2008</xref>) suggesting that during induction of disgust there is a sympathetic-parasympathetic coactivation with eventually a heightened parasympathetic activity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brownley et al., 2000</xref>). It is also important to consider that disgust is not a unidimensional construct, and that the different results found in the literature about the role of autonomic nervous system might depend on the stimuli used to induced it (e.g. core disgust stimuli; blood/body boundary violation disgust stimuli or moral disgust stimuli), see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ottaviani et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shenhav and Mendes, 2014</xref>.</p><p>Finally, we also found a general decrease of the spontaneous eye blinks during the observation of both positive and negative emotions compared to neutral scenarios with the only exception of the sad video clips. These findings support the idea that besides hydrating the eyes and protecting them against foreign objects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evinger et al., 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evinger et al., 1991a</xref>) blinking is a physiological mechanism that regulates information loss. It is linked to cognitive functions, particularly those related to attention and vigilance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McIntire et al., 2014</xref>), and thus might be conceived as an index of the salience triggered by the stimuli.</p><p>Overall, and in line with theoretical and empirical evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Damasio, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">James, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lettieri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stephens et al., 2010</xref>), our findings suggest that specific patterns of subjective, behavioural, and physiological measures are linked to unique emotional states.</p><p>We acknowledge that our results, although novel, are restricted to a sample of male participants, and more importantly they need to be replicated. We also acknowledge that future studies should better investigate the mechanisms underlying the role of the pH in the emergence of specific emotion. For instance, pharmacologically manipulating stomach pH during emotional induction, not only for basic emotions but also for exploring complex emotions such as moral disgust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rozin et al., 2009</xref>), would enable researchers to generalize these findings and examine the directionality of this relationship. In particular, it would be interesting to see how emotions are experienced when classic anti-acids or proton pump inhibitors are administered or to see what happens to emotional experience after normalization of the gastric rhythm when an <italic>anti-emetic</italic> and a prokinetic agent, such as domperidone, is administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nord et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Delving into the neural correlates underlying these phenomena, specifically focusing on the bidirectional pathways linking the stomach and the brain would also be of significant interest. For instance, investigating the potential role of brain regions like the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insula (AI), conceived as primary interoceptive cortices with functions encompassing homeostatic, emotional, limbic, and sensorimotor processes, would be valuable. Moreover, considering regions such as the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the brainstem, which serves as the pathway for major inputs projecting information to higher-order brain areas, could provide crucial insights (see the recent systematic review on the neural networks that underpin nausea in humans by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Varangot-Reille et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, it will be pivotal to map differences in stomach-brain coupling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rebollo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rebollo and Tallon-Baudry, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Richter et al., 2017</xref>) during different emotional experiences.</p><p>We believe that the present findings suggest that the stomach plays a fundamental role in emotional experience and have the potential to open new avenues for studying the unexplored influences of the neurobiology of the GI system on typical and atypical emotional processes. Our approach may be adopted for example when studying the contribution of the gastric signals in people showing dysfunctional emotional processing like autism spectrum conditions and depression. Evidence shows that the above-mentioned conditions are characterized by comorbidities with GI problems (people with irritable bowel syndrome [IBS] are much more likely to develop depression than healthy controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shah et al., 2014</xref>, and autistic persons are more likely to develop IBS compared to controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, our approach can be also adopted for studying emotional processes in conditions characterized by alterations of the GI physiology itself and its awareness, like persons with eating disorders (for a recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khalsa et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>To avoid the confounding effects played by sex both at level of emotional processing/experience (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kret and De Gelder, 2012</xref>) and of gastric physiology (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tolj et al., 2007</xref>), we choose to recruit only male participants to test a more homogeneous sample. Also, considering sex differences within emotional experience, testing men constitutes a conservative approach. We are well aware, though, that studies in women are necessary to generalize these findings and we are already working on this aspect.</p><p>Here, 31 healthy male participants (age: M=24.42, S.D.=2.8, range = 20–30 years) were recruited via the Social and Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory volunteer database and through personal contacts to take part in this study. A preliminary structured questionnaire ensured they all were eligible to the experimental procedure and to the SmartPill (SmartPill Motility Testing System, Medtronic plc) capsule ingestion (see the SmartPill system paragraph for a detailed description of this device). Exclusion criteria included diagnosis of psychiatric, neurological, or swallowing disorders; gastric bezoars; history of any abdominal/pelvic surgery within the previous three months; suspected or known strictures, fistulas, or physiological/mechanical obstruction within the GI tract; dysphagia to food or pills; Crohn’s disease or diverticulitis; body mass index ≥40; age &lt;18 years; cardiac pacemakers or defibrillators; assumption of any medication or substance that could interfere with pH values and GI motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saad, 2016</xref>), such as tobacco (within 8 hr prior to capsule ingestion), antacids and alcohol (within 24 hr), laxatives (within 48 hr); antihistamines, prokinetics, antiemetics, anticholinergics, antidiarrheals, narcotic analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (within 72 hr), or proton pump inhibitors (within seven days). The protocol of this study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (Fondazione Santa Lucia ethics committee, Protocol CE/PROG.636) and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1991). All participants were naïve to the purpose of the experiment, provided their written informed consent before starting the experimental procedure, and received a reimbursement for their participation at the end of the study. The same day of the experiment, they also took part in two additional studies, each with different aims and different hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>SmartPill system</title><p>The SmartPill system (SmartPill Motility Testing System, Medtronic plc) was originally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the evaluation of suspected gastroparesis and colonic transit in patients with chronic idiopathic constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aburub et al., 2018</xref>). In a position paper, the American and European Neurogastroenterology and Motility Societies indicated that this system is useful in the assessment of clinical disorders affecting the GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rao et al., 2011</xref>). The SmartPill system consists of a wireless, single-use, ingestible capsule; a receiver; a docking station; and software (i.e. MotiliGI) installed on a dedicated laptop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The ingestible pill is a cylindrical polyurethane capsule, 26.8 mm long, 11.7 mm wide, and it weighs 4.5 g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hasler, 2014</xref>). It houses a pH sensor with a range of 1–9 units (accuracy of ±0.5 units); a solid state temperature sensor with a range of 20–42°C (accuracy of ± 1 °C), a solid-state pressure sensor with a range of 0–350 mmHg (accuracy of ± 5 mmHg for values &lt;100 mmHg and accuracy of ±10% for values &gt;100 mmHg), two silver oxide batteries (duration &gt;5 days), and a transmitter (broadcast frequency: 434.2 MHz). Prior to ingestion, the capsule is activated through a magnetic fixture and the pH sensor is calibrated through a buffer solution. After ingestion, the capsule starts recording intraluminal pressure, pH, and temperature and sending these data to the external radio receiver that participants wear around their waist. For the first 24 hr, temperature data are transmitted every 20 s, pressure every 0.5 s, and pH every 5 s; after the first day, sampling frequencies are halved. By means of the MotiliGI software (Medtronic), pH, temperature, and pressure data can be graphically displayed in real time or reviewed after the pill expulsion. Combining pH and temperature data, MotiliGI identifies the specific region of the GI tract in which the pill is located. The arrival of the capsule in the stomach is indicated by a rapid rise in temperature from ambient to body temperature and by a drop in pH (reflecting passage into the acidic environment of the stomach). The arrival of the capsule in the small intestine through the pylorus is instead indicated by an abrupt increase of ≥2 pH units from the gastric baseline. Likewise, a subsequent gradual decrease of ≥1 pH unit for at least 10 consecutive minutes is considered as a sign that the pill left the small intestine and entered the large intestine. If the pH decrease cannot be observed, the MotiliGI software relies on pressure data to mark the transition between small and large bowel. The expulsion of the capsule is defined by a drastic drop in temperature followed by loss in recorded signal after the subject defecated. In our sample, 30 out of 31 subjects displayed a prototypical pattern of pH increase and decrease, thus indicating when the pill was in each of the three areas of interest. For the remaining subject, the software was still able to localize the GI regions that the pill went through based on temperature, pressure, and time data.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Gastro-intestinal (GI) markers collected in the present study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Shows the SmartPill capsule used to record temperature, pH, and pressure of the gut and the intestine as well as a typical graph created by the dedicated MotiliGI software, plotting temperature (blue line), pH (green line), and pressure (orange bars) across the entire the GI tract.

Electrogastrography (EGG) is a non-invasive technique that allows the recording of (i) the slow (~0.05 Hz) electrical gastric rhythm, constantly generated in the stomach wall within the so-called ‘dominant pacemaker’ area located in the greater curvature of the mid/upper corpus; (ii) the more transient smooth muscle activity inducing gastric peristaltic contractions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wolpert et al., 2020</xref> for an extensive review). Here, we used a 1-channel EGG bipolar montage that consists of three pre-gelled disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes placed in a standardized position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yin and Chen, 2013</xref>) and attached to a PowerLab data acquisition device (ADInstrument Ltd). Specifically, the first recording electrode was placed halfway between participants’ xiphoid and their umbilicus, the second 5 cm up and 5 cm to the left of the first (taking the left side of participants as a reference), and the ground electrode was placed on the left costal margin (see the left part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). By placing the three electrodes on the abdomen of the participants, we also acquire participants’ electrocardiogram (i.e. ECG) that we used to specifically calculate heart rate (HR) and heart variability measures (HRV). For the HRV we focused on an index of variability in the domain of time, the root mean square of successive beat-to-beat interval differences (RMSSD, ms), since we did not have a long period of ECG registration. The RMSSD is considered a measure of vagal regulation of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shaffer and Ginsberg, 2017</xref>). To do that firstly filtered the raw data using a band pass filter (0.1–30 Hz), we visually inspected them, finally we imported them on Kubios HRV software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tarvainen et al., 2014</xref>). Artifacts and ectopic beats were corrected using a threshold-based correction, R peaks were automatically detected and HR and RMSSD measures were extracted for each participant and each experimental condition. Finally, by placing two bipolar electrodes above and below the right eye, vertical electro-oculograms (EOGs) were recorded. Number of spontaneous blink movements were calculated for each participant and each condition using LabChart 7 software (AD Instruments, Australia).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Emotional induction task</title><p>An illustration of the emotional induction procedure adopted in this study is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Participants were asked to observe four blocks of a series of emotional video clips with different emotional content. Each block aimed at triggering a specific basic emotion, namely disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness. In addition to the four blocks, participants also observed one block containing a series of neutral video clips (control condition). The five blocks were presented in randomized order across participants and contained 24 emotional video clips each. Video clips were edited color soundless film excerpts lasting ~9 s each. The order of video clips within each block was randomized. All the 120 video clips were selected and validated by Tettamanti and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tettamanti et al., 2012</xref>). Clips showing mutilations or contamination scenarios (e.g. getting in touch with offensive or infective agents) triggered disgust; clips portraying human or animal aggressions and dangerous situations (e.g. falling or drowning) elicited fear; clips depicting amusement scenes, significant achievements or meaningful human interactions (e.g. a meeting between lovers) triggered happiness; clips containing scenarios of death, loss or sickness, (e.g. someone holding their beloved dead) triggered sadness; finally, clips with scenarios of routine human actions and activities (e.g. working or speaking) did not contain any specific emotion and therefore were considered neutral. For a detailed description of the stimuli (and their validation), please refer to the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tettamanti et al., 2012</xref>) and to the <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table8">Appendix 1—table 8</xref>, in which a brief description of the content of each of the video clips employed in our study is provided. At the end of each block, participants answered an 8-item questionnaire relative to their emotional and visceral feelings induced by the observation of the video clips. Four items measured the <italic>emotional experience</italic> in terms of perceived intensity of each emotion, three additional items measured the <italic>visceral experience</italic> in terms of perceived intensity of each visceral feeling and one item measured the perceived <italic>arousal</italic>. Items were presented in a randomized order and participants provided their responses by clicking with the mouse on separate 0 (‘Not at all’) - 100 (‘Very much’) visuo-analogue scales (VAS). To avoid carryover effects induced by each category of the emotional video clips, blocks were interspersed with two-minutes washout pauses in which participants simply rested.

Participants read, filled, and signed the informed consent form. After verifying that all the requirements for the participation were met, participants ate a standardized ~260 kcal breakfast consisting of egg whites (120 g), two slices of bread and jam (30 g) to make sure that GI transit times of the SmartPill capsule were not affected by meal variability. Meanwhile, in a dedicated room, we activated the capsule through a magnetic fixture and calibrated the capsule pH sensor (see Materials and methods above). After pH calibration was complete, the pill started transmitting data to the radio receiver. PH calibrations were performed correctly in all but one participant, therefore pH data from one participant were not considered in the statistical analyses since they were not reliable. Thus pH data were available for 30 out of 31 participants. Data recorded through the capsule came with a relative timestamp indicating the number of seconds elapsed from calibration. Since SmartPill data were not associated with an absolute time frame, we synchronized each calibration with an external clock that provided us with the required absolute time frame (see <italic>Data analysis</italic> session for a detailed description of the data pre-processing). At that point, participants swallowed the SmartPill capsule while drinking a glass of water (120 ml). A medical doctor supervised the ingestion procedure to help in case of swallowing problems. All participants ingested the pill without any trouble. After the ingestion, they fastened the receiver around their belt and lay supine on a deck chair. The experimenter cleaned the skin corresponding to the position of the EGG electrodes and afterwards attached them according to a 1-channel bipolar montage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yin and Chen, 2013</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). After checking that a highly acidic pH (~1–2) was recorded by the capsule, indicating that it reached the stomach, a 15-min resting-state SmartPill capsule/EGG baseline session started. During this 15-min resting-state session, participants were left alone in the room and instructed to relax while keeping their eyes open. At the end of the baseline session, participants underwent the emotional task during which they observed five blocks of film excerpts while stomach pH, temperature, pressure, and EGG signal were recorded. After each block, participants answered the 8-item questionnaire relative to their subjective emotional and visceral experiences triggered by the video clips. Participants repeated the emotional task two more times, namely when the SmartPill capsule reached the small intestine (usually after 2–5 hr from the capsule ingestion) and when it reached the large intestine (usually after 2–6 hr from the stomach-small bowel transition). After around 6 hr from the beginning of the experimental session, participants were provided with a meal and ad libitum water. After 8 hr, they were also allowed to smoke. Between the experimental sessions they were free to work, study, or rest, although they were asked to avoid strenuous physical exercise and alcohol consumption. At the end of the last experimental session, that is at the end of the emotional task and while the capsule was in the large bowel, participants could leave the laboratory. They were asked to keep the receiver with them until they noticed that after defecation data transmission stopped due to pill expulsion, an event that ordinarily happens after 10–59 hr from ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saad, 2016</xref>). After the expulsion, participants came back in the lab to return the receiver.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Details on SmartPill and EGG data pre-processing can be found in the Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical data analyses</title><p>To exclude habituation effects, we tested whether the five blocks of video clips triggered different subjective emotional and visceral experiences in our participants in all the three experimental sessions. To do so, separate Friedman ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests (p≤0.0125 was considered as significance threshold) were performed on the VAS ratings relative to the emotional and visceral experience triggered by the different types of video clip. A non-parametrical approach was used because in several conditions VAS ratings were not normally distributed according to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) tests and Skewness and Kurtosis z-scores, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Field, 2009</xref>. During the first session, that is when the capsule was in the stomach, we also tested changes in heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and number of spontaneous eye blinks in response to emotional experiences triggered by five types of video clip (disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, compared to neutral). To do this, after verifying via Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests that all data distributions were normally distributed (all ps &gt;0.05), we conducted three separate repeated-measures ANOVAs with type of video clip as a within-subjects factor and HR, HRV and individual HR, RMSSD and number of eye blinks respectively as dependent variables. Post-hocs with Bonferroni correction was adopted when significant main effects were found.</p><p>Then, we estimated the impact of GI pH, temperature, and pressure (as measured by the SmartPill capsule) on the emotional experience (as reflected in the VAS ratings). To do so, three separate mixed-effects models (Model 1; Model 5; and Model 6) were run, one for each GI region (stomach, small bowel, and large bowel) having as dependent variable the VAS ratings relative to the emotional experience questionnaire, and as fixed factors <italic>emotion</italic> (induced by the different type of the video clip: disgust, fear, happy, neutral, and sad) and <italic>item</italic> (the type of question participants were required to answer: perceived disgust, fear, happiness and sadness) as fixed factors, <italic>pH, temperature and pressure (mean-centred and scaled</italic>) as continuous fixed factors, and by-subject intercepts as random effects. Significant main or interaction effects were replicated if the random slope of the <italic>emotion</italic> was included as a random effect in the mixed models. Moreover, to reduce the probability to describe false positives due to multiple comparisons, we used the <italic>emtrends</italic> function of the <italic>emmeans</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lenth, 2019</xref>) to perform post hoc tests on the more conservative model (the one with the condition as random slope) with Bonferroni-adjusted p values (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref> for the detailed results). Due to the fact that models with random slopes yielded a boundary (singular) fit we decided to report the results coming from the less complex, intercept-only models in the main text. Finally, to better explore the role of the pH on emotional experience, and check variations of pH in function of the type of video clip and time, we ran an additional model, Model 2. This time, to increase the power of the analysis, we considered all the datapoints collected by using the Smartpills (not only the average pH per condition) regardless of the participants’ emotional experience (i.e. emotional VAS ratings). Thus, Model 2 had the pH recorded through the capsule in the stomach as dependent variable, as fixed factors the type of video clip and the number of the datapoints, and the by-subject intercepts as random effects. Models (1; 2; 5 and 6) are fully described in the Appendix 1. When statistically significant main or interaction effects were found, robust p-values were bootstrapped through the <italic>mixed</italic> function of the <italic>afex</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singmann et al., 2015b</xref>). Post-hoc simple slope analyses of the statistically significant interactions were run using the <italic>sim_slopes</italic> function of the <italic>interaction</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long, 2019</xref>). A third and fourth mixed-effect models were run to estimate the impact of EGG (normogastric and tachigastric respectively) peak frequency over the emotional VAS ratings. Those models featured <italic>emotion</italic> and <italic>item</italic> as fixed factors, but had the block-specific (centred and scaled) <italic>EGG</italic> (normogastric or tachigastric respectively) <italic>peak frequencies</italic> as continuous fixed factor and included by-subject intercepts as random effects.</p><p>For the detailed description of the models and the softwares/packages used, please see the Appendix 1.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The protocol of this study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (Fondazione Santa Lucia ethics committee, Protocol CE/PROG.636) and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1991).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ignacio Rebollo (Reviewer #1); Camilla L. Nord (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Include more information about the methods and statistical analyses.</p><p>2) Provide more support for the main findings (e.g., ruling out influence of outliers, false positives, or specific analysis choices), including changes to Figure 4.</p><p>3) Include effect sizes</p><p>4) Conduct additional analyses to gain more insight into possible mechanisms, e.g., on the EGG data or the relation between subjective and objective measures</p><p>5) The reviewers also make useful suggestions for streamlining the presentation of the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below suggestions that I believe could improve the impact of the paper.</p><p>The authors explore the link between multiple emotions, subjective reports, gut compartments, and multiple gut indices, but the main finding is limited to the stomach and Ph. Currently, the Results section can be a bit repetitive, as the same analysis is repeated for each gut segment or question. Moreover, Ph changes beyond the stomach are not to be expected. Thus authors could consider prioritizing the Ph stomach results and moving other material to the supplements. Additionally, figure 4 which provides the most important results, could be improved, for instance, by present separately the scatter plot of disgust ratings vs stomach ph only for disgusting movies, as it is currently quite cluttered.</p><p>Since this is a new phenomena authors discovered with a relatively new methodology for the field, I believe authors should provide more evidence to validate and further characterize these findings. Right now the main results is backed up by a statistical model which shows a correlation across participants but tells little about the actual mechanisms underlying the phenomena. How long it takes acid to be secreted after a film? does it happen in each participant or only on some, how does it relate to tachygastria? These are some questions authors could tackle with their data to further convince their readers of the strength of their findings. Moreover, authors should also provide more info on the quality of the EGG recordings, and communicate to the reader that the lack of effects on the EGG could be due to the use of only one recording point in the stomach.</p><p>While the authors acknowledge that the evidence provided is correlational only, I think the manuscript would greatly benefit if a discussion of potential brain mechanisms and pathways was included explaining the mechanism linking the experience of disgust to secretion of acid in the stomach.</p><p>Finally, I understand that the results shed no insights on the discrete vs emotion debate, and this should be taken out from the discussion or further argumented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– A little more detail about the measurements/analysis in the main text would be appreciated, if there is space – for example, has pH been normalised in Figure 4? Were any participants' datasets excluded from any of the measures (and if so new Ns should be reported)?</p><p>– I think there is probably one further analysis for the authors to run if they want to claim &quot;these results were specific to the stomach&quot; (page 15). That is a higher-level ANOVA that includes measurements from all 3 locations, and shows an interaction with location, justifying the separate analysis. I also think this would help a minor issue I had with respect to multiple comparison correction (below).</p><p>– The authors have used Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, which is great, but it was not clear to me exactly how many comparisons they were correcting for. As it stands, for the ph/pressure/temperature analyses, I think it should be at least 9 (3 locations x 3 measures per location), unless (as above) an initial ANOVA is run with all 3 locations, showing an interaction with location, in which case I think 3 is appropriate. This could be clarified on page 22-23 ('Statistical data analysis').</p><p>– It would be helpful if the authors included effect sizes of their main effects.</p><p>– Is there a (statistical) outlier in Figure 4. (top left – Disgusting) – the 'Happy' datapoint that has a much higher stomach pH than others (around 2.5 on the x axis)?</p><p>– I wonder if the authors might consider including one final post-hoc analysis simply examining valence (collapsing across negative vs positive emotions) and pH of the stomach. I think this would lend itself well to the Discussion section on specificity (or not) of gastric contribution to emotional state. This might be distinct from a concept of 'arousal' (all emotions).</p><p>– Was there a relationship between gastric sensations and pH/pressure/temperature in the same location of the GI tract? This might be useful to highlight with respect to its utility for future measures of gastric interoception.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>-The Introduction would be more easily readable if it would have a paragraph structure.</p><p>-Several of the reported results are not central to the project and could be summarized (with full results in Supplementary materials). For example, the first two pages extensively report that the stimuli were perceived as intended (as also shown in previous studies using these stimuli). The interest here may be on the differences across sessions. If so, Session could be included as a factor in the ANOVA. (still, this would be a rather minor point compared to the subsequent analyses).</p><p>-The results are now mostly presented as a series of statistical tests, starting with &quot;The Friedman ANOVA…&quot;. It would be helpful if the tests are motivated and explained, for example based on the hypotheses in the Introduction (e.g., &quot;To test the hypothesis that participants would report higher gastric sensations.…, we compared subjective ratings of gastric sensations between.…&quot;). Reporting the results in a more hypothesis-driven manner may also reduce the number of comparisons.</p><p>-Figure 4, the key results figure, could be improved to make a more convincing case for a relation between pH and Vas ratings (if it exists). The red dashed lines (Disgust) include dots, which cannot be distinguished from the actual data. The legend does not indicate what the dots represent (participants?) or what the regression lines and shading around it reflect. The axes labels are very small (particularly the lower three panels).</p><p>-The statistical analysis was not entirely clear to me; further motivation for the statistical approach would be welcome. The Results section refers to Model 1, but numbered models are not explicitly mentioned in the Methods, as far as I could tell. The other models (2 and 3) are not mentioned in the Results. Did you confirm your findings with other kinds of statistical tests, e.g., was there a simple correlation between gastric pH and disgust ratings?</p><p>-How did you deal with outliers (e.g., pH values in Figure 4)?</p><p>-Because the methods section is at the end, the results should be understandable without having read the methods section. This means that the measures and statistical models need to be explained in the Introduction or Results. For example, p.11 refers to &quot;Model 1&quot;, but it is not clear what this model is. Similarly, it would be helpful if the procedure for the measures of &quot;perceived visceral experience&quot; (p.8) would be briefly explained.</p><p>-It would be relevant to know how objective and subjective measures of gastric changes relate to each other. Is gastric pH correlated with perceived gastric sensations? and, separately, is perceived gastric sensations correlated with subjective perception of emotions?</p><p>-Results are repeated on p.11: line 293-300 appear again on line 305-313. I think these should actually refer to different results (across items vs specific to disgust videos), correct?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85567.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Below suggestions that I believe could improve the impact of the paper.</p><p>1.

This model included all the pH datapoints registered using the Smartpill as dependent variable, the type of video clip and the number of the datapoints (“Time”) as fixed effects, and the by-subject intercepts as random effects (see Appendix 1 for a detailed description of the model). Model 2 had a marginal R<sup>2</sup> = 0.014 and a conditional R<sup>2</sup> = 0.79. Visual inspection of the plots did reveal some small deviations from homoscedasticity, visual inspection of the residuals did not show important deviations from normality. As for collinearity (tested by means of vif function of car package), all independent variables had a (GVIF^(1/(2*Df)))^2 &lt; 10.</p><p>Type III analysis of variance of Model 2 showed a statistically significant main effect of the Time (F = 20.237, p &lt; 0.001, Eta2 &lt; 0.01) suggesting that independently from the type of video clip observed, the stomach pH significantly decreased as a function of the time of exposure to the induction.</p><p>A significant main effect of the type of video clip was also found (F = 22.242, p &lt; 0.001, Eta2 = 0.01) suggesting that pH of the stomach changes when participants experienced different types of emotions. In particular, post hoc analysis revealed that pH was more acidic when participants observed disgusting compared to fearful (t = -11.417; p &lt; 0.001), happy (t = -15.510; p &lt; 0.001) and neutral (t = -3.598; p = 0.003) video clips.</p><p>Also, pH was more acidic when participants observed fearful compared to happy (t = -4.064; p &lt; 0.001), and less acidic compared to neutral (t = 7.835; p &lt; 0.001) and sad scenarios (t = 9.743; p &lt; 0.001). Finally, pH was less acidic when participants observed happy compared to neutral (t = 11.923; p &lt; 0.001). and sad videoclips (t = 13.806; p &lt; 0.001), see Figure 6, left panel.</p><p>Interestingly, also the double interaction Time X Type of video clip was significant (F = 3.250, p = 0.0113, Eta2 &lt; 0.01) suggesting that the time of the exposure to the induction differentially influenced the pH of the stomach depending on to the type of the observed video clip. Simple slope analysis showed that while pH did not change over time when observing disgusting (t = -1.2691; p = 0.2045) and happy (t = 0.4466; p = 0.6552) clips, it did significantly decrease over time when observing fearful (t = -4.4212; p &lt; 0.001), sad (t = -2.0487; p = 0.0405) and neutral video clips (t = -2.7956; p = 0.0052), see Figure 6, right panel.”</p><p>We also changed the discussion accordingly (Page 20, lines: 557-564):</p><p>“To complement results showing a key role of the stomach pH in the perceived emotional experience, we also tested the hypothesis that independently from the conscious emotional experience (i.e. emotional VAS ratings) the pH varies during the observation of the different types of video clip. In fact, we found that stomach pH was generally more acidic when participants observed disgusting video clips and generally less acidic when participants observed happy video-clips. These effects did not change over time. Differently, we found that stomach pH was more acidic when participants observed fearful compared to happy video-clips, and less acidic compared to neutral and sad scenarios with a general decrease over time of the pH, see Figure 6.”</p><p>3) We included new evidence coming from different physiological markers that we did not analyse in the original manuscript. In fact the very same electrodes used to record the EGG signals also pick up the heart signal and thus we had the possibility to extract and analyse two markers of cardiac and autonomic nervous system activity, namely the heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV). Specifically, we analysed if and how the root mean square successive difference between heartbeats (RMSSD) changed across the different emotional scenarios. According to the Task Force guidelines (1996), the RMSSD reflects the integrity of vagus nerve-mediated autonomic control of the heart. Therefore this analysis helped in discussing the effect of our emotional induction procedure in the non-gastric domain. In addition to that, we investigated the number of spontaneous eye blinks comparing them between the different emotions. In fact, besides hydrating the eyes and protecting them against foreign objects (e. g. Evinger, 1991, 1995) spontaneous blinking is a physiological mechanism that regulates information loss. It is linked to cognitive functions, particularly those related to attention, vigilance, and emotional states (e.g. Maffei &amp; Angrilli, 2019; McIntire et al. 2014, Martin et al., 2015), and thus might be conceived as a measure of the salience triggered by the stimuli, in our case emotional video clips. To integrate results related to the HR, HRV and eye blinks we revised the main text as follows, Pages 12 and 13, Lines: 312-350:</p><p>“Autonomic and behavioural (oculomotor) markers of perceived emotions: heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and spontaneous eye blinks</p><p>During the first session, i.e. when the capsule was in the stomach, we tested changes in heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and number of spontaneous eye blinks in response to emotional experiences triggered by five types of video clip (disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, compared to neutral). To do this, after verifying via Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests that all data distributions were normally distributed (all ps&gt; 0.05), we conducted three separate repeated-measures ANOVAs with type of video clip as a within-subjects factor and HR, HRV and number of eye blinks as dependent variables. We found a main effect of the type of video clip on HR (F(4, 112) = 5.652, p = 0.00035, η2 = 0.17) suggesting that participants’ HR changed across different emotions. Specifically, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc analysis showed that HR was higher when participants observed the control neutral scenarios compared to the disgusting and fearful ones (all ps ≤ 0.008). All the other differences were not significant (all ps ≥ 0.124), see Figure 4, panel A for a graphical representation of the results.</p><p>Additionally, we found a significant main effect of the type of video clip on the RMSSD, (F(4, 112) = 2.658, p = 0.036, η2 = 0.09), suggesting changes in participants’ HRV across different emotions. Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc analysis revealed that HRV was higher when participants observed the disgusting video clips compared to the control neutral ones (p = 0.049), see Figure 4, panel B for a graphical representation of the results.</p><p>Regarding the spontaneous blinks, we found a main effect of the type of video clip (F(4, 108) = 12.371, p ≤ 0.0001, η2 = 0.32), suggesting that participants’ spontaneous eye blinks change across the different emotions. Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc analysis showed that participants blinked less when they observed the disgusting, fearful and happy video clips compared to the control neutral ones (all ps ≤ 0.009). Furthermore, they blinked more when they observed the sad videos compared to when they observed the disgusting and the fearful ones (all ps ≤ 0.001), but not when they observed the happy and neutral ones (all ps ≥ 0.228), see Figure 4, panel C for a graphical representation of the results.”</p><p>Finally, we also modified the introduction and the discussion to include these new results.</p><p>1.

Unfortunately, at the moment we do not have any data that may help to disclose the brain mechanisms underlying these effects. However, we are currently working on this important open issue. We added to the revised discussion a few speculation lines which are also copied and pasted below (Page 22, Lines: 635-645).</p><p>“Delving into the neural correlates underlying these phenomena, specifically focusing on the bidirectional pathways linking the stomach and the brain would also be of significant interest. For instance, investigating the potential role of brain regions like the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insula (AI), conceived as primary interoceptive cortices with functions encompassing homeostatic, emotional, limbic, and sensorimotor processes, would be valuable. Moreover, considering regions such as the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the brainstem, which serves as the pathway for major inputs projecting information to higher-order brain areas, could provide crucial insights (see the recent systematic review on the neural networks that underpin nausea in humans by Varangot-Reille et al., 2023). Additionally, it will be pivotal to map differences in stomach-brain coupling activity (Richter et al., 2017; Rebollo et al.,2018, 2022) during different emotional experiences.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Finally, I understand that the results shed no insights on the discrete vs emotion debate, and this should be taken out from the discussion or further argumented.</p></disp-quote><p>As previously mentioned, we revised the discussion in order to better describe our results and toned down the interpretation that the present findings as directly supporting the discrete nature of emotions.</p><p>Please see the specific paragraph at page 21 lines 622-624 reads as follows and the revised discussion of the main text:</p><p>“Overall, and in line with theoretical and empirical evidence (Stephens et al., 2010, Damasio, 1999; Harrison et al., 2010; James, 1994, Lettieri et al., 2019; Stephens et al., 2010), our findings suggest that specific patterns of subjective, behavioural, and physiological measures are linked to unique emotional states.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. A little more detail about the measurements/analysis in the main text would be appreciated, if there is space – for example, has pH been normalised in Figure 4?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not reporting this information in the previous version of the manuscript. Yes, pH, temperature and pressure were mean-centred (and scaled) to be used as regressors in our models.</p><p>To make this point clear, we changed the Methods section (Page 30, Lines 861-868) that now reads as follows:</p><p>“To do so, three separate mixed-effects models (Model 1; Model 5 and Model 6) were run, one for each GI region (stomach, small bowel, and large bowel) having as dependent variable the VAS ratings relative to the emotional experience questionnaire, and as fixed factors emotion (induced by the different type of the video clip: disgust, fear, happy, neutral and sad) and item (the type of question participants were required to answer: perceived disgust, fear, happiness and sadness) as fixed factors, pH, temperature and pressure (mean-centred and scaled) as continuous fixed factors, and by-subject intercepts as random effects.”</p><p>We also modified the caption of Figure 5, that now reads as follows:</p><p>“Figure 5 Association between the Stomach pH and perceived emotions (3-way interaction between item, stomach pH, and type of video-clip). Association between stomach pH and perceived emotions (disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness) across the five categories of video clips (disgusting, fearful, happy, neutral, and sad).

Thus pH data were available for 30 out of 31 participants.”</p><p>For what concerns the EGG analysis, approximately 10% of the data was lost due to technical reasons or signal noise in certain experimental conditions/participants.

I think there is probably one further analysis for the authors to run if they want to claim &quot;these results were specific to the stomach&quot; (page 15). That is a higher-level ANOVA that includes measurements from all 3 locations, and shows an interaction with location, justifying the separate analysis. I also think this would help a minor issue I had with respect to multiple comparison correction (below).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. We opted to conduct separate analyses based on the district since the stomach and intestine exhibit macroscopic physiological differences owing to their distinct functions. For instance, the stomach's digestive function results in significantly different pH acidity compared to that characterizing the intestine. However, to explore the effect of different GI parts, we conducted a mixed-model ANOVA with pH as the dependent variable and district as the independent variable. The analysis revealed a significant and notably strong main effect of the district. Below, we copied and pasted the output of the analysis and the plot, indicating the Bonferroni corrected significant differences. These differences were attributed to distinct pH values across the three districts. The most acidic values characterize the stomach. Moreover, we are aware of this intrinsic limitation, and in order to deal with the Reviewer’s comment, we have revised the main text and eliminated sentences that might imply a comparison between the three districts.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Type III Analysis of Variance Table with Satterthwaite's method.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom">Sum Sq</th><th valign="bottom">Sum Sq</th><th valign="bottom">NumDF</th><th valign="bottom">DenDF F value</th><th valign="bottom">Pr(&gt;F)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">district</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1509.5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">754.74</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2 1681.4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">9023</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&lt; 2.2e-16 ***</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85567-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

By doing that, we found that only in the stomach the perceived emotions were predicted by pH changes (we replicated this analysis with a similar and more robust approach showing how ph changes in relation to the different emotional inductions). In order to test which slope was significantly different from zero we used the sim_slopes function of the interaction package (Long, 2019). Then, to check and avoid false positives we performed, by using emtrends function of the emmeans R package (Lenth et al., 2019), post hoc tests using the more conservative model (the one with the condition as random slope); and automatically corrected (namely for the different condition and perceived emotions) for Bonferroni by using the “adjst” argument and by specifying Bonferroni as correction.

We replicated the main analysis, this time without the influence of more extreme values.</p><p>Results of this analysis are described in point 1.7, below and, can be found in track change in the manuscript at Page 15&amp;16, lines: 411-446 in the main text.</p><p>“To explore how the emotional induction could modulate the pH of the stomach and how the length of the exposure to that specific emotional induction could also play a role in modulating pH variations, we ran an additional model, Model 2.

Model 2 had a marginal R<sup>2</sup> = 0.014 and a conditional R<sup>2</sup> = 0.79.

Simple slope analysis showed that while pH did not change over time when observing disgusting (t = -1.2691; p = 0.2045) and happy (t = 0.4466; p = 0.6552) clips, it did significantly decrease over time when observing fearful (t = -4.4212; p &lt; 0.001), sad (t = -2.0487; p = 0.0405) and neutral video clips (t = -2.7956; p = 0.0052), see Figure 6, right panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I wonder if the authors might consider including one final post-hoc analysis simply examining valence (collapsing across negative vs positive emotions) and pH of the stomach. I think this would lend itself well to the Discussion section on specificity (or not) of gastric contribution to emotional state. This might be distinct from a concept of 'arousal' (all emotions).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this insightful and cogent comment which we are happy to take into consideration. However, we need to firstly point out that we have three negative emotions (fear, disgust and sad) and only one positive emotion (happy), therefore the observations will be not balanced. Additionally, we did not inquire about perceived valence but instead utilized discrete emotional ratings. At any rate, to comply with this potentially important request, we categorized the experimental conditions into three groups: negative valence video clips (fear, disgust, and sadness), positive valence video clips (happiness), and neutral ones (control). The analysis did not reveal any significant double or triple interactions with the pH. This suggests that pH may play a specific role in distinct emotional experiences and may not be inherently linked to negative valence alone.</p><p>Given the already mentioned methodological limitations of this analysis, if the referee agrees, we would prefer not to include it in the manuscript.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><caption><title>anova(Stomach_VASvalence,type=3,ddf=&quot;Satterthwaite&quot;) Type III Analysis of Variance Table with Satterthwaite's method.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom">Sum Sq</th><th valign="bottom">Mean Sq</th><th valign="bottom">NumDF</th><th valign="bottom">DenDF</th><th valign="bottom">F value</th><th valign="bottom">Pr(&gt;F)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">valence</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">12073</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">12072.7</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">507.44</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">23.6486</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">1.545e-06 ***</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">item</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">43487</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">14495.8</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">502.15</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">28.3949</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">&lt;

To deal with it, we ran an additional exploratory analysis to check whether subjective gastric sensations were associated with changes of gastric pH, temperature and pressure. To test for the presence of this association, we built a model similar to the one used for testing the relationship between pill data (i.e. gastric pH, temperature and pressure) and perceived emotions (i.e. VAS ratings). This model had as dependent measure the 0-100 VAS ratings and the Type of item (type of perceived visceral sensations: cardiac, respiratory and gastric) as fixed effects, and pH/temperature and pressure of the stomach as covariates. We only found a significant and potentially interesting double interaction between Type of item X stomach pH (F(2, 333.26) = 4.6049, p = 0.01065).

To deal with the first comment raised by this Reviewer, we ran an additional exploratory analysis to check whether subjective gastric sensations (i.e. subjective gastric measures) were associated with changes of gastric pH, temperature and pressure (i.e. objective gastric measures). To test for the presence of this association, we built a model similar to the one used for testing the relationship between pill data (i.e. gastric pH, temperature and pressure) and perceived emotions (i.e. VAS ratings). This model had as dependent measure the 0-100 VAS ratings and the Type of Item (type of perceived visceral sensations: cardiac, respiratory and gastric) as fixed effects, and pH/temperature and pressure of the stomach as covariates. We only found a significant and potentially interesting double interaction between Type of item X stomach pH (F(2, 333.26) = 4.6049, p = 0.01065). However, when we ran post-hoc tests, namely simple slopes analyses, no effect turned out to be statistically significant.</p><p>As to the last point i.e. running correlation analyses between self-reported gastric sensations and self-reported perceived emotions. To comply with the request we ran exploratory correlation analysis within the emotions that have been found to be linked to the gastric activity, i.e. disgust, fear and happy. We did not find a general association between the two variables, rather a specific a positive relationship between perceived disgust and perceived gastric sensation (r = 0,4945; p = 0. 0064) suggesting that the higher the gastric sensations the higher the perception of disgust. The same correlation was not significant for happy and fear clips (all r &lt; (abs) 0.131; all ps &gt; 0.499). If the Reviewer thinks that this analysis should be reported in the main or supplementary materials (now called Appendix, following <italic>eLife</italic> rules) we will be happy to include it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Results are repeated on p.11: line 293-300 appear again on line 305-313. I think these should actually refer to different results (across items vs specific to disgust videos), correct?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, correct they are different results. The first refer to the double interaction (pH * item), namely how VAS ratings changed with respect to the pH and the type of question participants were requested to answer, thus independently from the type of video participants observed. The second refer to the triple interaction (pH * item * emotion contained in the video clips).</p><p>To avoid ambiguity, we added two sentences in yellow below, and in track-change in the main text and we now hope that results are presented in a clear way.</p><p>Page 13 and 14, lines 364-386</p><p>“Type III analysis of variance of Model 1 showed a statistically significant 2-way interaction between item (i.e. perceived disgust, fear, happiness and sadness) and gastric pH (F = 8.214, p &lt; 0.0001, bootstrap p-value &lt; 0.001, Eta2 (partial) = 0.05, Appendix 1, Figure 5), suggesting that the emotional experience reported by participants on the VAS ratings, irrespective of the type of observed video clip, varied according to the pH of the stomach and the type of perceived emotion. Specifically, the follow-up post hoc simple slope analysis, conducted to explore the significant 2-way interaction (gastric pH*item), showed that the lower (i.e., more acidic) was the pH of the stomach, the more our participants reported to feel disgusted and afraid, while the higher the pH of their stomach (i.e., less acidic), the more they reported to feel happy.</p><p>The 2-way interaction was further defined by a 3-way interaction between video-clip content, item, and pH (F = 1.978, p = 0.025, bootstrap p-value = 0.026, Eta2 (partial) = 0.05, Figure 5), suggesting that emotional experience reported by participants on the VAS ratings varied also as a function of the content of the projected video clips, besides the pH of their stomach and the type of emotion perceived. Follow-up post hoc simple slopes analysis, performed to explain the significant 3-way interaction (gastric pH*item*type of video clip), showed that the lower (i.e. more acidic) was the pH of the stomach, the more our participants reported to feel disgusted and afraid, after observing disgusting video clips, while the higher was the pH of their stomach (i.e. less acidic) the more reported to feel happy.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
