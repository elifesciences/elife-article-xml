Severed axons degenerate following the activation of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway, which culminates in the activation of SARM1 in mammals to execute the pathological depletion of the metabolite NAD<sup>+</sup>. SARM1 NADase activity is activated by the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). In mammals, keeping NMN levels low potently preserves axons after injury. However, it remains unclear whether NMN is also a key mediator of axon degeneration and dSarm activation in flies. Here, we demonstrate that lowering NMN levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> through the expression of a newly generated prokaryotic NMN-Deamidase (NMN-D) preserves severed axons for months and keeps them circuit-integrated for weeks. NMN-D alters the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolic flux by lowering NMN, while NAD<sup>+</sup> remains unchanged in vivo. Increased NMN synthesis by the expression of mouse nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (mNAMPT) leads to faster axon degeneration after injury. We also show that NMN-induced activation of dSarm mediates axon degeneration in vivo. Finally, NMN-D delays neurodegeneration caused by loss of the sole NMN-consuming and NAD<sup>+</sup>-synthesizing enzyme dNmnat. Our results reveal a critical role for NMN in neurodegeneration in the fly, which extends beyond axonal injury. The potent neuroprotection by reducing NMN levels is similar to the interference with other essential mediators of axon degeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon degeneration</kwd><kwd>NAD metabolism</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>176855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neukomm</surname><given-names>Lukas Jakob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>211015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neukomm</surname><given-names>Lukas Jakob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S009582/1a</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilley</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001708</institution-id><institution>International Foundation for Research in Paraplegia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neukomm</surname><given-names>Lukas Jakob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>190919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neukomm</surname><given-names>Lukas Jakob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005758</institution-id><institution>Università Politecnica delle Marche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orsomando</surname><given-names>Giuseppe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>210904/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loreto</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>John and Lucille Van Geest Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coleman</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201535</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Pei-Hsuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Axon degeneration is also an early hallmark of nervous system injury and a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coleman and Höke, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mariano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merlini et al., 2022</xref>). Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms may facilitate the development of treatments to block axon loss in acute or chronic neurological conditions.</p><p>Wallerian degeneration is a well-established, evolutionarily conserved, and simple system to study how injured axons execute their self-destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Llobet Rosell and Neukomm, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Waller, 1850</xref>). Upon axonal injury (axotomy), distal axons separated from their soma degenerate within a day. Axotomy activates a signaling pathway (programmed axon degeneration, or axon death) that actively executes the self-destruction of severed axons. Induced signaling culminates in the activation of sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing protein 1 (dSarm and SARM1 in flies and mice, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>). As NADase, once activated, dSarm/SARM1 executes the pathological depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) in severed axons, culminating in catastrophic fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Figley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>). Initially thought to be activated only after injury, evidence accumulated over recent years that axon death signaling is also activated in many non-injury neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Figley and DiAntonio, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hopkins et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, SARM1 activation is tightly controlled by metabolites in the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic pathway. The labile enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is constantly transported into the axon, where it is degraded by the E3 ubiquitin ligase PAM-Highwire-Rpm-1 (PHR1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babetto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilley and Coleman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). This steady state results in sufficient NMNAT2 that consumes nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) to synthesize NAD<sup>+</sup>. Upon axonal injury, axonal transport halts. Subsequently, NMNAT2 is rapidly degraded. It leads to a temporal rise of axonal NMN and a halt in NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Stefano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di Stefano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loreto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loreto et al., 2015</xref>). NMN and NAD<sup>+</sup> compete by binding to an allosteric pocket in the SARM1 armadillo-repeat (ARM) domain, which is crucial for SARM1 activation. While a rise in NMN activates SARM1 by inducing its conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Figley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), NAD<sup>+</sup> prevents this activation by competing for the same pocket in the ARM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). This competitive binding occurs at physiologically relevant levels of NMN and NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angeletti et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that expression of the prokaryotic enzyme PncC–also known as NMN-Deamidase (NMNd)–converts NMN to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galeazzi et al., 2011</xref>), prevents SARM1 activation and preserves severed axons in mammals and zebrafish: for instance, axons with NMNd remain preserved up to 96 hr in murine neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di Stefano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loreto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>), 24 hr in zebrafish and 3 weeks in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Stefano et al., 2017</xref>). It remains currently unclear whether NMNd expression levels determine the extent of preservation.</p><p>Much of this mechanism of axon death signaling is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Llobet Rosell and Neukomm, 2019</xref>). However, flies harbor some notable differences. A single <italic>dnmnat</italic> gene provides a cytoplasmic and nuclear splice protein variant; consequently, <italic>dnmnat</italic> disruption results in cellular dNmnat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruan et al., 2015</xref>). dNmnat turnover is regulated solely by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Highwire (Hiw) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>) but not by MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neukomm et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the BTB/Back domain-containing Axundead (Axed) executes catastrophic fragmentation downstream of NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, while the mammalian paralog(s) remain to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neukomm et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The role of NMN in axon degeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is controversial. Flies lack nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gossmann et al., 2012</xref>). NMN might, therefore, be a dispensable intermediate in the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic pathway, thus playing a minor role as a mediator of axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerdts et al., 2016</xref>). The Gal4/UAS-mediated NMNd expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons preserves severed axons for 3–5 days after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2021</xref>). It contrasts with the phenotype of other axon death signaling mediators, such as loss-of-function mutations in <italic>hiw, dsarm,</italic> and <italic>axed,</italic> as well as over-expression of <italic>dnmnat</italic> (<italic>dnmnat<sup>OE</sup></italic>), all of which harbor severed axons that remain preserved for weeks to months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neukomm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neukomm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the role of NMN as an axon death mediator in <italic>Drosophila</italic> remains to be formally determined.</p><p>Here, we report that NMN is an essential mediator of injury-induced axon degeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Genetic modifications resulting in low NMN levels protect severed axons for the lifespan of the fly, while the addition of an extra NMN synthesizing activity forces axons to undergo faster degeneration after injury. NMN induces the dSarm NADase activity<italic>,</italic> demonstrating its role as a crucial activator in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Robust expression of prokaryotic NMN-Deamidase in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>Mutations in <italic>hiw</italic>, <italic>dsarm</italic>, or <italic>axed</italic> attenuate axon death signaling resulting in morphological preservation of severed axons for approximately 50 days, the average lifespan of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neukomm et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neukomm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, neuronal expression of prokaryotic NMN-Deamidase (NMNd) to consume NMN results in less than 10% of severed axons being preserved at 7 days post axotomy (dpa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2021</xref>). We performed an established wing injury assay to confirm this observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paglione et al., 2020</xref>).

However, the expression of NMNd fails to attenuate axon death signaling to the extent of axon death mutants, suggesting that NMN does not play an essential role in activating axon death supported by the absence of the NMN-synthesizing enzyme Nampt in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gossmann et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatviely, NMNd expression and the resulting NMN consumption is simply not sufficient for potent attenuation of axon death signaling and preservation of severed axons.</p><p>Based on the above observations, we decided to generate an N-terminal GFP-tagged NMN-Deamidase (GFP::NMN-D) to increase protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rücker et al., 2001</xref>).

This difference is likely due to the N-terminal GFP tag in GFP::NMN-D, which can increase protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rücker et al., 2001</xref>). This is supported by our newly generated anti-PncC antibodies and suggests that NMN-D expression levels dictate the reduction of NMN, and therefore the preservation of severed axons.</p><p>We also demonstrate that increasing the synthesis of NMN provokes a faster degeneration of severed axons in vivo, which requires all axon death mediators. Mammals synthesize NMN with two distinct enzymatic reactions: NR consumption by NRK1/2 and NAM consumption by NAMPT, both ensuring NMN supply. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, NAMPT activity is absent, and NMN appears to be synthesized by Nrk alone, yet dietary NMN supplementation might also contribute to NMN levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshino et al., 2018</xref>). We used mNAMPT as an extra source of NMN synthesis. However, in contrast to the NMN-D-induced change in the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolic flux, mNAMPT had only a minor impact under physiological conditions. It is challenging to measure the specific axonal rise in NMN after injury in vivo. However, NMNAT2 is rapidly disappearing in severed axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilley and Coleman, 2010</xref>), and so is dNmnat in <italic>Drosophila</italic> axons and synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>), through PHR1 and Hiw, respectively, while NAMPT persists longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di Stefano et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore likely that persisting mNAMPT in severed <italic>Drosophila</italic> axons continues NMN synthesis, leading to faster NMN accumulation, dSarm activation, and faster axon degeneration.</p><p>While NMN activates dSarm by inducing a conformational change in a pocket of the inhibitory ARM domain, NAD<sup>+</sup> competes for the same pocket, acting as an inhibitor of dSarm activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Our simultaneous manipulation of NMN and NAD<sup>+</sup> levels (by NMN-D expression and <italic>nadsyn<sup>RNAi</sup>,</italic> respectively) further supports that this competition is crucial in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to regulate dSarm activity and, consequentially, axon degeneration after axotomy in vivo.</p><p>Finally, we expanded our investigations beyond injury, by looking at NMN in a model of neurodegeneration. dNmnat is essential for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis. While neuronal clones with mutant <italic>dnmnat<sup>1</sup></italic> start to degenerate after they are born, intriguingly, co-expression of NMN-D resulted in a preserved neuronal morphology for at least 5 days, before degeneration started with similar kinetics. Our results suggest that a rise in NMN, rather than the lack of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis, is a trigger for neurons to degenerate also in this model, at least within the first 5 days. Once NAD<sup>+</sup> levels drop beyond neuronal survival, neurons eventually degenerate. This is supported by observation with forced NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion by dSarm<sup>∆ARM</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neukomm et al., 2017</xref>) and inhibition of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis in murine neurons with FK866 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di Stefano et al., 2015</xref>). Still, it is surprising to observe that neurons lacking NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis can survive for days. It suggests either that the NAD<sup>+</sup> turnover is slower than expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) or mechanisms are in place to compensate for NAD<sup>+</sup> loss, at least in the short term.</p><p>In conclusion, NMN is a potent mediator of axon- and neurodegeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our newly developed NMN-D tool will be useful in many degenerative aspects beyond injury, such as in axon morphogenesis and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izadifar et al., 2021</xref>) and in dendrite pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji et al., 2022</xref>).

Relative transcript abundance was calculated using the ΔΔCt method. α-tubulin, an mRNA that remains unchanged in mutant and transgenic flies based on qPCR analysis, was used for normalization. Statistical significance was calculated using the one-way ANOVA test. The post hoc Tukey test was performed for statistically different groups determined by the ANOVA test (p-value &lt;0.05). The resulting p values from the Tukey test are reported.</p><p>Primers used (forward and reverse, respectively, 100–200 bp amplicons, all isoforms included):</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>NMN-D</italic>: <named-content content-type="sequence">TCGTGCTGATTATGCCGTGT</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">AAAAGCAAACCAGGTGC</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>mNAMPT</italic>: <named-content content-type="sequence">TGGGGTGAAGACCTGAGACA</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">TGGCAGCAACTTGTAGCCTT</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>dsarm</italic>: <named-content content-type="sequence">AGGAGAACATGGCCAAGACG</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">GTTGTCAATTGCCCGCCT</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>axed</italic>: <named-content content-type="sequence">CATTCCCTACCGCGCTCACA</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">TTTGGTGCTGGTTGGTCAGT</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>hiw</italic>: <named-content content-type="sequence">CTCACCCAGCGTCAGAAGTT</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">CCATTGGCTCCAATCCAGGT</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>dnmnat</italic>: <named-content content-type="sequence">TTGCTGTTCCAGGCCTATGG</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">CAACGTGGAGCTCACCTCAT</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>dnaam</italic>: <named-content content-type="sequence">CAATGGACGCCTGTTTCACG</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">TTCGTATCGAAGGCGAA</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>dnrk</italic>: <named-content content-type="sequence">GCGTGTCCCATGGAGCAATA</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">AGCCACGATTCGGAGAAGTA</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>naprt</italic>: <named-content content-type="sequence">TCCTATGCCATCGCATTCCC</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">TTGGCGGACTGTTCTCAGAC</named-content></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>nadsyn</italic>: <named-content content-type="sequence">AATATGCTGGTGGACGTGGG</named-content>, <named-content content-type="sequence">GGCGATTAAAGAACGCCACC</named-content></p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Replicates</title><p>For all experiments, at least 3 biological replicates were performed for each genotype and/or condition.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Pete Williams (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarification of arguments and outcomes of your experiments:</p><p>a. Please see Reviewer 1's comments 1. and 3., on why low NMN should provide stronger protection than the loss of dSARM, and on the distinction between the behavior of axed and hiw/dSARM, respectively.</p><p>b. Reviewer 3: Better characterize the conclusions regarding NMN since the effects are so strong. Please characterize this in more detail. For example, the NAD concentration in axons should still decline after injury because NMNAT is degraded. Why are the axons not dying? Does NMN also affect NMNAT stability? Or is the NAD present in the axons before injury so stable it can provide for the lifetime?</p><p>2) Quantification:</p><p>a. Reviewer 1: In Figure 1E, the authors demonstrate protection at 10, 30, and 50 dpa but the data is not quantified. These data should be quantified, especially given the long-lived claims mentioned above.</p><p>b. Reviewer 1: The authors should make the distinction between the behavior of axed and hiw/dSARM clear in the text and run statistical comparisons among the groups.</p><p>3) Reviewer 2: Test the opposite of their experiment to produce prolonged reduced levels of NMN, that is, whether high levels of NMN trigger axon degeneration. You introduced the murine version of NAMPT (mNAMPT) which catalyzes NAM to NMN.</p><p>Reviewer 2 queries whether this is through the hypothesized mechanism, as mNAMPT fails to increase NMN levels, and suggests that you try to demonstrate a mechanism in which high NMN triggers axon degeneration: e.g. increasing NR or NRK whilst decreasing downstream enzymes. One hypothesis is that NMN levels are not critically reliant on mNAMPT levels until there has been a neurodegenerative injury. A (seemingly) easy way to test this is to assess NMN levels in the mNAMPT transgenic and control pre- and post-injury, to interrogate whether dynamics of the pathway results in differential regulation of the genes/proteins in the pathway. Targeted protein or gene profiling (e.g. simple qPCR or WB) would help assess this. This should not be too difficult unless you argue otherwise.</p><p>4) Description of the generation/availability of the novel/new PncC antibody mentioned.</p><p>5) Include data on the Olfactory receptor neuron degeneration assays shown in Figure 1.</p><p>6) Clarify Metabolome data:</p><p>a. Reviewer 2 in his &quot;Weaknesses&quot; points: you use metabolic profiling to display individual metabolites during axon degenerative events and treatments, but it is unclear if any of these proteins or genes change as a consequence.

Is there a fly bioavailable version of NMN that could be added directly to diet? One hypothesis could be that NMN levels are not critically reliant on mNAMPT levels until there has been a neurodegenerative injury. A (seemingly) easy way to test this is to assess NMN levels in the mNAMPT transgenic and control pre- and post-injury. It could also be that changing the dynamics of the pathway results in differential regulation of the genes/proteins in the pathway.

First, we were able to detect the expression of both FLAG-tagged enzymes. Second, we measure metabolites in whole heads, but no significant change in the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism was observed. Third, we applied the wing injury assay, but no change in axon degeneration was observed within the first 12 hours. Unfortunately, by manipulating dNrK/mNRK1 combined with dietarily supplemented NR, we were not able to observe faster degeneration (data not shown).</p><p>2) We repeated the same approach with NAM and mNAMPT.

It is robust enough to generate a modest additional amount of NMN (but not NAD<sup>+</sup>), but not as massive that under physiological condition, a significant increase of NMN (and NAD<sup>+</sup>) results in the opposite phenotype as observed in mammals.</p><p>In the Results section, we included the following conclusion:</p><p>“Strikingly, in our wing injury assay, while axons with GFP showed signs of degeneration starting from 6 hours post axotomy (hpa), mNAMPT expression resulted in significantly faster axon degeneration with signs of degeneration at 4 hpa (Figure 4D, E). This accelerated degeneration is likely linked to increased NMN production, but other mechanisms cannot be excluded as there is no increase in NMN under physiological conditions.”</p><p>Measuring NMN pre- and post-injury:</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot measure NMN in severed axons in the head of <italic>Drosophila</italic> after injury.

The first indicates the detection of all transcripts (e.g., axon death and NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis genes), the second demonstrates that neither of them is drastically changed with NMN-D or NMN-D<sup>dead</sup> expression. The third demonstrates that neither of them is drastically changed with mNAMPT expression.</p><p>We changed the results accordingly (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1):</p><p>“Before measuring the effect of NMN-D on the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolic flux, we measured the activities of the various NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in fly heads (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1A, Figure 2A) (Amici et al., 2017; Zamporlini et al., 2014).

However, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Qaprt homolog that catalyzes the conversion from quinolinate to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) remains to be identified (Katsyuba et al., 2018). We also confirmed the absence of NAMPT activity (Gossmann et al., 2012) (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1A). In addition, we confirmed the expression of genes involved in NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis and axon death signaling that are involved in NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism by measuring respective mRNA abundance in fly heads (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1B). We note that the expression and activity of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolic enzymes can be readily detected fly heads.”</p><p>Figure 2 —figure supplement 2:</p><p>“Prompted by such a significant change in the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolic flux, we wondered whether the change could alter the expression of genes involved in NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism or axon death signaling.
