that lacks kinase activity. While specific binding to phosphoinositides has been reported for the prolactin receptor (PRLR), the role of lipids in PRLR signaling is unclear. Using an integrative approach combining nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cellular signaling experiments, computational modeling, and simulation, we demonstrate co-structure formation of the disordered intracellular domain of the human PRLR, the membrane constituent phosphoinositide-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) and the FERM-SH2 domain of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). We find that the complex leads to accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the transmembrane helix interface and that the mutation of residues identified to interact specifically with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> negatively affects PRLR-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Facilitated by co-structure formation, the membrane-proximal disordered region arranges into an extended structure. We suggest that the co-structure formed between PRLR, JAK2, and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> locks the juxtamembrane disordered domain of the PRLR in an extended structure, enabling signal relay from the extracellular to the intracellular domain upon ligand binding. We find that the co-structure exists in different states which we speculate could be relevant for turning signaling on and off. Similar co-structures may be relevant for other non-receptor tyrosine kinases and their receptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IDP</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>simulation</kwd><kwd>JAK2</kwd><kwd>single pass receptor</kwd><kwd>integrative structural biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF18OC0033926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kragelund</surname><given-names>Birthe B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF15OC0016670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kragelund</surname><given-names>Birthe B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BRAINSTRUC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindorff-Larsen</surname><given-names>Kresten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The prolactin receptor, Janus kinase 2, and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> form a co-structure with the membrane resulting in orientations with different accessibility fixing the disordered juxtamembrane domain of the receptor in an extended structure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytokine receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins that bind cytokines on the cell surface and transduce signals across the membrane to the interior of the cell. This, in turn, activates signaling pathways leading to multiple outcomes including induction of immune responses, cell proliferation, altered metabolism, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2016</xref>). Class 1 cytokine receptors constitute a subclass of receptors that transverse the membrane by a single α-helical transmembrane domain (TMD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2016</xref>), separating a folded extracellular domain (ECD) from a disordered intracellular domain (ICD). The prolactin (PRL) receptor (PRLR) is one of the structurally most simple cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Signaling by the PRLR/PRL complex is implicated in the regulation of more than 300 biological functions in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bole-Feysot et al., 1998</xref>), and its function is especially well-known for its essential role in mammary gland development and lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hannan et al., 2023</xref>). Apart from this, deregulation of PRLR/PRL signaling is associated with several pathologies in humans of which hyperprolactinemia resulting in reproductive failure is best described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachelot and Binart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Newey et al., 2013</xref>). Deregulation of PRLR/PRL signaling is linked to other diseases and, although still debated, suggested to be implicated in the development and progression of prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sackmann-Sala and Goffin, 2015</xref>) and breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clevenger and Rui, 2022</xref>) cancers.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematics of the PRLR:PRL:JAK2 complex in the membrane.</title><p>The PRLR is shown in light blue, the PRL as a dark blue triangle, the PRLR-ICD as a disordered chain, and JAK2 in purple.

Thus, association of auxiliary kinases is mandatory for signaling, with the Janus kinases (JAK1–3 and TYK2) being the most thoroughly described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morris et al., 2018</xref>). A proline-rich region constituting the so-called BOX1 motif close to the membrane, as well as a second hydrophobic motif termed BOX2, are known to be essential for JAK binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rowlinson et al., 2008</xref>). However, although progress has been made in the molecular understanding of cytokine binding and despite several structures of folded ECDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broutin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Vos et al., 1992</xref>), TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bocharov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bugge et al., 2016</xref>), a complete receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kassem et al., 2021</xref>), and a receptor ICD in complex with JAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glassman et al., 2022</xref>) have emerged, it is still not clear how the signal inside the cell is received by the disordered region to elicit and control signal transduction.</p><p>A subset of class 1 cytokine receptors form homodimers and trimeric complexes with their ligands, with the main dimerization occurring in the TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gadd and Clevenger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kubatzky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Seubert et al., 2003</xref>). This group includes the growth hormone receptor (GHR), the erythropoietin receptor, the thrombopoietin receptor, and the PRLR, which have become well-established paradigmatic models. Recently, signal transduction by the GHR has been suggested to occur via a rotation of the transmembrane helices within the dimer leading to a subsequent separation of the ICDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2005</xref>). A torque is hereby exerted on the associated JAK2s, which is thought to relieve inhibition by the pseudokinase domains, initiating signaling. The ICDs of these receptors have been shown to be highly disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haxholm et al., 2015</xref>), a feature which is preserved in models of the PRLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bugge et al., 2016</xref>) and the full-length GHR in nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kassem et al., 2021</xref>). This brings forward the question of how signaling is orchestrated by disorder and how a disordered linker region between the TMD and the region bound to the kinases can communicate and transduce information.</p><p>For both the PRLR and the GHR, lipid interaction domains (LID) with affinity for negatively charged lipids have been identified in their ICDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haxholm et al., 2015</xref>). Common to both receptors is that they contain a LID proximal to the membrane, directly overlapping with the JAK2 interaction sites, BOX1 and BOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Seiffert et al., 2020</xref>). Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we identified three LIDs in the PRLR-ICD termed LID1, LID2, and LID3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haxholm et al., 2015</xref>), and using lipid dot-blots, we showed that the PRLR-ICD has variable affinities for different membrane constituents, including for different phosphoinositides (PIs). In particular, PRLR has a distinct affinity for PI-4,5-bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P<sub>2</sub>) and lacks affinity for PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haxholm et al., 2015</xref>). PIs are important constituents of the membrane and play key roles in signaling, both as membrane interaction partners that can be specifically modulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carracedo and Pandolfi, 2008</xref>) and as secondary messengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McLaughlin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Suh and Hille, 2005</xref>). Indeed, some single-pass receptors contain conserved anionic lipid interaction sites close to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hedger et al., 2015</xref>), and increasing evidence suggests lipid interaction to take on important regulatory roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McLaughlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Metcalf et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was shown to sequester PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by accumulating it around the TMD regulating the dimer/monomer equilibrium and with a possible positive feedback loop through the activation of the phospholipase C (PLC) – diacylglycerol (DAG)-IP<sub>3</sub> pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maeda et al., 2018</xref>). This will lead to subsequent conversion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and hence depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> from the membrane. Similar depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> from the plasma membrane has been noted under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). For class 1 cytokine receptors, the role of PIs in signaling is less clear.</p><p>In a cellular context, signaling-related proteins can be membrane anchored through modifications such as acylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Patwardhan and Resh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rawat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rawat and Nagaraj, 2010</xref>) or via designated lipid-binding domains. This includes the four point-1, ezrin, radixin moesin (FERM) domain of radixin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the protein tyrosine phosphatase L1 (PTPL1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bompard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamada et al., 2000</xref>), the SH2 domains of the Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheng et al., 2016</xref>), and the FERM-SH2 domain of merlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mani et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, colocalization of receptors and related signaling proteins can occur at the plasma membrane without necessarily being bound within a complex. It is, however, unclear whether such membrane co-localization has functional consequences, such as enhancing signaling speed, and whether the membrane may act as an additional scaffolding platform that enhances binding via restriction in the two-dimensional plane.</p><p>Recent work on disorder in membrane proteins and on the interplay between membrane proteins and lipids has revealed the need for strong integrative methods, combining successfully various structural biology techniques, biophysics, and computational biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basak et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Larsen et al., 2022</xref>). These include NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering, crosslinking-mass spectrometry, and single molecule fluorescence combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chavent et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goretzki et al., 2023</xref>). These efforts have provided important insights into the role of lipids in regulation of membrane proteins. For TRPV4, a member of the TRP vanilloid channel family, it was shown that an autoinhibitory patch of the receptor competed with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding at the membrane to attenuate channel activity, and MD simulation showed that lipid binding affected the ensemble dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goretzki et al., 2023</xref>). For EphA2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, an integrative study showed how PIs mediate the interaction between the kinase domains, facilitated by clustering of PIPs via binding to the receptor juxtamembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chavent et al., 2018</xref>), further promoting conformation specific dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stefanski et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, studying dynamic processes at the membrane interface is an emerging field requiring integrative structural biology approaches for detailed atomic resolution information.</p><p>For the PRLR, it is still not clear whether, and if so how, interactions between the ICD and the membrane impact signal transduction and association with JAK2. Nor is it understood how structural disorder can relay and transmit information from the TMD to initiate signaling. To shed light on the molecular details underlying a potential interplay between the receptor, membrane, and kinase, we focused on the human PRLR and its LID1 closest to the membrane, facilitating the first intracellular step in signaling. Using an integrative approach combining NMR spectroscopy, cell biology, and computational modeling, we demonstrate the formation of a co-structure composed of the disordered PRLR-ICD, the membrane constituent PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and the FERM-SH2 domain of the JAK2. Facilitated by this co-structure, the disordered region closest to the membrane forms an extended structure, which we suggest stabilizes the disordered domain, allowing signal relay from the extracellular to the ICD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LID1 is disordered in solution and when tethered to the transmembrane helix</title><p>Membrane interactions by PRLR-ICD have previously been studied in the absence of anchoring to the TMD defining three LIDs, with LID1 closest to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haxholm et al., 2015</xref>). Since tethering would increase the local concentrations at the membrane and the ICD, this could affect affinity, complex lifetime as well as the degree by which structure formation would be captured. Furthermore, the first LID, LID1, is disordered and is located in the juxtamembrane region where it is responsible for transmitting information on extracellular hormone binding to the bound JAK2. As this constitutes the very first step on the intracellular side and given the distance to the other two LIDs (LID2 and LID3) and their disconnect from the TMD by long disordered regions, we focused exclusively on LID1. We recombinantly expressed the TMD (residues 211–235 with numbering corresponding to the processed protein) with five residues added at the two termini (TMD<sub>F206-V240</sub>), and the TMD with the first 35 residues of LID1, TMD-ICD<sub>F206-S270</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then examined their structural propensities in detergents and in small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) by NMR spectroscopy. In 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) micelles, most of the TMD resonances of the TMD<sub>F206-V240</sub> and TMD-ICD<sub>F206-S270</sub> variants were readily superimposable in the <sup>15</sup>N,<sup>1</sup>H-HSQC spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the conformation of the TMD was not affected by the presence of the ICD. For the TMD-ICD<sub>F206-S270</sub>, C<sup>α</sup> NMR resonances were collected for most of the disordered region, while backbone carbon resonances for the TMD, except for A222, and the region G236-P246 immediately following it were broadened beyond detection in the 3D spectra, preventing assignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This may suggest that the first 10 residues of the ICD interact with, are buried in the micelles, or are affected by the overall slower tumbling of the micelle, whereas the complete overlap of the TMD residues in the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra confirm the helical structure as seen previously. We assigned the backbone nuclei of the detectable resonances of TMD-ICD<sub>F206-S270</sub> in DHPC micelles and compared the secondary chemical shifts (SCSs) to those of the ICD alone (ICD<sub>G236-Q396</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Whereas the region of the ICD that is undetected in TMD-ICD<sub>F206-S270</sub> formed transient extended structures in the absence of the TMD, the observable parts were highly similar suggesting lack of structure induction by TMD tethering. In 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) SUVs, only the resonances of the most C-terminal residues of TMD-ICD<sub>F206-S270</sub> were detectable; however, the chemical shifts suggested that the residues were disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that most of the ICD residues remain disordered when tethered to the TMD and in the presence of a neutral membrane mimetic.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The intracellular juxtamembrane (ICJM) region of the prolactin receptor (PRLR) interacts with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of investigated PRLR variants.

The chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) were modest, whereas substantial intensity changes were observed throughout the chain, supporting a direct interaction between the ICD and lipids. The resonances from G236 to F244 completely disappeared suggesting exchange on an intermediate NMR timescale, while intensities were substantially reduced in the V247–S290 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In the region from D285 to E292, we observed an almost inverse correlation between the CSPs and the intensities. This suggests that in contrast to the preceding region, a faster local exchange rate allows us to follow the resonances from the bound state in this region, giving rise to the large CSPs. From this region and to the C-terminus, only moderate intensity changes were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These findings suggest that the primary PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding site is located closest to the membrane in what we define as the intracellular juxtamembrane (ICJM) region (K235-C242). The ICJM is located N-terminally to the BOX1 motif (<sub>243</sub>IFPPVPGPK<sub>251</sub> [UNIPROT]; <sub>245</sub>PPVPGPK<sub>251</sub> [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elm.eu.org/">http://elm.eu.org/</ext-link>]).</p><p>As the resonance-broadening precluded observation of the bound state, two overlapping peptides, Pep1 (K235-D256) and Pep2 (K253-T280), were constructed and evaluated by CD spectroscopy.

Pep1 and Pep2 were titrated with C<sub>8</sub>-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and the structural changes monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). For Pep2, the far-UV CD signal was unaffected by the presence of C<sub>8</sub>-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, for Pep1, large spectral changes were seen, which were unrelated to helix formation. Subtracting the spectra in the presence and absence of C<sub>8</sub>-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> revealed a negative ellipticity minimum at 218 nm, a strong indicator of β-strands, showing that when bound to C<sub>8</sub>-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, a distinct extended (strand-like structure) signature was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This suggests that this region of LID1 changes its conformational properties upon binding to C<sub>8</sub>-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. We evaluated the intrinsic helical propensities of the two ICD segments by exposure to high trifluorethanol (TFE) concentrations.

Here, we measured the number of protein-lipid contacts focusing either on interactions between the protein and lipid headgroups or the protein and lipid acyl chains. In both cases, we determined the fraction of the simulation time that the protein and different parts of the lipid were within 7 Å of each other. In general, we observed that residues in the N-terminal part of the LID1 (K235 - D255), which includes the ICJM and BOX1, established contacts with the bilayer in all three membrane systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, a hydrophobic region rich in prolines (V240–P250) made consistent contacts with the acyl-chains and much more than to the headgroups, indicating penetration into the lower-leaflet. Similar behavior has been reported with CG-MD simulations for the juxtamembrane region of other single-pass transmembrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hedger et al., 2015</xref>). For PRLR, the pattern of interaction was independent on the lipid composition, at least in terms of protein-POPC contacts, and the region interacting with the lipids was similar in all three membrane systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Although the extent and pattern of protein–lipid interactions appeared constant, a striking observation was made in both systems containing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Here, protein–lipid interactions between residues K235 and K253 and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> were present during a large fraction (≥50%) of the simulations, despite PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> being present at only 5 or 10% of the total lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This was also observed in simulations with the Martini2 force field, in which the LID1 promptly collapsed in a globular and unstructured coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggested that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> spontaneously accumulated, or in other ways became concentrated around the TMD-ICD<sub>F206-H300</sub>. The computed average density maps for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> indeed showed that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> formed a microdomain around the TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The low frequency of contacts between the protein and POPS suggests that POPS did not accumulate or compete with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for binding to the TMD-ICD<sub>F206-H300</sub>, further supporting the preference for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> observed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haxholm et al., 2015</xref>). Similar preference was also observed with 5% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) as well as with Martini2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>).</p><p>A more detailed analysis of LID1-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> contacts revealed a preference for certain residues, shown as peaks in the protein-headgroup contact profiles. In particular, K235, S238, T241, K251, and K253, which define a KIK motif suggested as a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kjaergaard and Kragelund, 2017</xref>), engaged in highly populated contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The pattern of contacts was not affected by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> concentration; however, the frequency of contacts almost doubled as a result of the increase from 5 to 10% of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. The hydrophobic residues in the ICJM and BOX1 penetrate the headgroup layer and facilitate the approximation of the KIK motif to the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> headgroups. The stabilization of the structure provided by the hydrophobic residues from the ICJM and BOX1 is also reflected in their decrease in flexibility, observed as a shoulder on the backbone RMSF plot, for the residues that comprise the ICJM and BOX1 of PRLR-LID1. Very similar profiles of the backbone RMSF plot were obtained for the systems with respectively 5 and 10% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in POPC:POPS, suggesting that the loss in flexibility is coupled to the buried hydrophobic residues rather than to specific PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Contributions from other positively charged residues such as K262 and K264 were very small. To validate the observations from the simulations, we compared the pattern of protein:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interactions observed in the NMR experiments to those from the simulations containing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A clear correlation between loss of NMR signal and a high amount of protein-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and POPC/POPS contacts in the 80:10:10 simulation was observed, reinforcing that the simulations are able to capture the specificity of protein-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interactions. Furthermore, both experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) show that the residues involved in binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes overlap with those that are involved in binding to JAK2.</p><p>In summary, the CG-simulations of TMD-ICD<sub>F206-H300</sub> near lipid membranes showed accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> around the TMD and the N-terminual part of LID1 involving the ICJM and BOX1. The residues made contact with the membrane independently of lipid type, with BOX1 residues acting as a tether by penetrating the headgroups. This tethering keeps positively charged residues, such as K251 and K253, near the membrane. This may be the driver for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> recruitment, enhanced by higher PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> concentration. Intriguingly, we observed that the same regions involved in JAK2 binding (BOX1) also play roles in membrane association and lipid recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>JAK2-FERM-SH2 and PRLR-ICD<sub>LID1</sub> form co-structures with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> on membranes</title><p>It has been suggested that JAK2 and PRLR interact constitutively in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campbell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rui et al., 1994</xref>), although recent data for the GHR have shown that the Src family kinase Lyn competes for this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chhabra et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, given our observations that residues from LID1 form lipid-specific contacts with the membrane constituents using the same region covering the binding interface with the FERM domain of JAK2, we decided to explore the structure and dynamics of the JAK2(FERM-SH2):PRLR(LID1) complex near lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To do so, an atomistic model of the complex of a smaller region of PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> bound to the JAK2-FERM-SH2 domains (residues P37 to T514) was built, taking advantage of crystal structures of JAK2-FERM-SH2 and of JAK1-FERM-SH2 and TYK2-FERM-SH2 bound to analogous fragments of the ICDs of the interferon λ- and α-receptors (IFNLR1 and IFNAR1), respectively. This model was used to perform all-atom MD simulations in a water-box to obtain equilibrated structures for further simulations and to study the dynamics of the protein complex. The average contact map between JAK2-FERM-SH2<sub>P37-T514</sub> and PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> showed clusters of contacts in which residues from BOX1 of LID1 formed close contacts (avg. dist. ≤4 Å) with residues from the F2 lobe (and the F1–F2 linker) and the SH2 domain of JAK2-FERM-SH2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

A number of randomly positioned starting orientations was placed ~7 Å below the lower leaflet (16 orientations for the POPC:POPS:PI[4,5]P<sub>2</sub> [80:10:10] membrane and eight for the POPC:POPS [70:30] membrane). In addition, we included 12 orientations of JAK-FERM-SH2 without the PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> placed near a POPC:POPS:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (80:10:10) membrane. For the JAK2-FERM-SH2:PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> complex near a 70:30 POPC:POPS membrane, binding to the lower leaflet was observed for only three of the eight systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, when PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was present (10%), rapid binding of the complex to the membrane was observed in all simulations reaching 97% saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Both proteins in the complex showed specific clusters of residues with contacts to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, POPS, and POPC, independent of the initial orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BC</xref>). The number of contacts formed was higher for the simulations with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. This suggests that contacts with other components of the membrane occur close to the bound PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the PRLR-ICD <sub>K235-E284</sub> showed a pattern of lipid contacts similar to the simulations of PRLR TMD-ICD<sub>G204-H300</sub> with the POPC:POPS:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (80:10:10) membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), with residues K<sub>235</sub>GY<sub>237</sub> contacting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> headgroups for at least 50% of the total contact time and with insertion into the membrane; note that this occurs even though PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> is not tethered to the membrane via the TMD. Also, like in the PRLR TMD-ICD<sub>G204-H300</sub> simulations, contacts made by C242 and I243 to POPC were still present. In contrast, contacts by other residues from BOX1 and the KIK motif have lower populations. However, and as expected from the location of the most frequent PRLR-ICD <sub>K235-E284</sub>/lipid contacts, JAK2-FERM-SH2 had more contacts in the F2 lobe of the FERM domain, mainly involving residues I223, L224, R226, K227, and R230, constituting the regions where the N-terminus of PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> is bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the JAK2-FERM-SH2 simulations without PRLR-ICD and near a POPC:POPS:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (80:80:10) membrane, we observed that simulations initiated in 11 out of the 12 orientations ended up binding to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In this case, the overall binding pattern of protein-lipid contacts remained similar.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that the Martini2 force field model underestimates cation-π interactions between surface aromatic residues and choline headgroups on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khan et al., 2020</xref>). However, this may not be applicable to other types of protein–membrane interactions, particularly where negatively charged headgroups are present. Our simulations involving PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and POPS suggest that interactions between PRLR and the bilayer are primarily driven by positively charged residues in the protein and that other protein–membrane interactions are secondary or occur between the lipids and residues that surround positively charged residues interacting with a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (or POPS) lipid. As a result, cation-π interactions may not be as important for the protein–lipid contact patterns we observed but could be one explanation as to why we observe less frequent binding in the POPC:POPS systems.</p><p>In summary, our simulations showed that binding of JAK2 to the membrane was enhanced by the presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and that the ICD from PRLR and JAK2 formed a co-structure with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> maintaining the contacts to the lipids observed for the individual proteins. The presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was essential for the membrane interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The complex between JAK2-FERM-SH2 and LID1 shows preferential bound orientations with membranes containing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></title><p>To characterize the membrane-bound modes of the complex in more detail, we took inspiration from Vogel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>) and constructed a map that represents the populations of different orientations of the JAK2-PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> complex relative to the membrane and extracted conformations to represent the most populated orientations as classified into states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). For the JAK2-PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> complex bound to the POPC:POPS:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (80:10:10) membrane, states 1–4 (~31% of the total contact time) showed the complex in an orientation where the N-terminus of PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> contacted and inserted into the bilayer similarly to what was observed in the PRLR TMD-ICD<sub>G204-H300</sub> simulations near a POPC:POPS:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> bilayer. Of these four states, states 1, 2, and 3 had the F2 lobe of the JAK2-FERM domain and the ICJM region of PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> in contact with the membrane, penetrating below the headgroups, and acting as a pivot over which the protein-complex rotates, leaving the complex to hang as a ‘Y’ from the membrane (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DE</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). State 4 on the other hand, while retaining the main contact points, assumed a ‘flat’ orientation with larger sections of the F2 lobe and F1–F2 linker from JAK2-FERM and the entire N-terminal half of PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> (residues K235-G263) making a substantial number of contacts with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DF</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). To examine whether the identified states are compatible with functional states of the full-length kinase, we superimposed representative conformations of states 1–6 with that of the full-length JAK2 model obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (UNIPROT O60674; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>). This procedure revealed that both the Y (states 1, 2, and 3), and Flat (state 4) states keep the other domains of JAK2 oriented toward the cytoplasmic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), supporting that these states could be functionally relevant. Furthermore, in the context of JAK2 dimerization required for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrao et al., 2018</xref>), these states allow for the correct orientation for kinase domain dimerization. The two remaining states (states 5 and 6) showed an inverted orientation in which the main protein–lipid interactions were formed by residues from the F3 lobe of FERM and the SH2 domain, bringing the F2 lobe and the ICJM region of the PRLR-ICD unrealistically far away from the membrane and from the connecting end of the TMD. Thus, states 5 and 6 appear functionally irrelevant, as further demonstrated by the superposition of the full-length AlphaFold model of JAK2 in which the kinase domains would clash with the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E, F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Different membrane co-structures have different exposures relevant to signaling</title><p>We analyzed the protein–lipid interactions formed by states 2 (Y) and 4 (Flat) in more detail, and despite overall similar contact profiles, some key differences were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>). For the Flat state, an increase in contacts was seen for residues K235 to L260 of PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> with a pattern similar to the one observed in the PRLR-TMD-ICD<sub>G204-H300</sub> simulations with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> present. Dominant PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> contacts were seen for K235–C242, followed by POPC contacts for residues C242–P248, with a second PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> contact peak for K251 and a third around H257. For the Y state, only residues K235–Y237 made substantial contacts with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and/or POPC, leaving BOX1 and the KIK motif exposed to the solvent and making contacts with JAK2. For JAK2-FERM-SH2, the main difference between the Y and Flat states was a large decrease in contacts to the F2 lobe in the Flat state accompanied by an increase in contacts in F3 and SH2. Residues in the F2 lobe involved in homodimerization, orientation, and activation, including L224, K227, R230, and R234 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wilmes et al., 2020</xref>), were only accessible in the Y state and not in the Flat state. Thus, we speculate that the Y and Flat states may mimic functionally relevant conformations pertaining to active and inactive states of the signaling complex. Mapping of residues that make contacts with the bilayer in the two states to the conservation maps shows that several positively charged residues of JAK2-FERM-SH2 are largely conserved. Particularly, K207, R226, K227, and R228 in F2 with high population contacts with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the Y state are highly conserved. Similar conservation was seen for the positively charged residues K235, K414, K415, and R513 that form contacts with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the Flat state.</p><p>Similar simulations were performed near a POPC:POPS 70:30 bilayer, which resulted in only one of eight systems showing stable binding to the bilayer characterized by only one state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Here, residues from the F2 lobe of JAK2 form contacts with POPS lipids in a narrow peak containing residues Q219–R230, while for PRLR-ICD <sub>K235-E284</sub>, residues from the ICJM (K235–C242), and the BOX1 region (C242–P248) make high-frequency contacts with both POPS and POPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Overall, this state is somewhat similar to state 3 observed for the simulations with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, for our simulations of JAK2-FERM-SH2 without PRLR near a bilayer with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, 11 out of 12 stable binding conformations revealed three most populated states (E1, E2, and E3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Characterization of these in terms of protein–lipid contact profiles revealed that the positively charged residues in the F2 lobe play an important role in binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in a similar manner as observed for the Y and Flat states of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Indeed, states 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>) show remarkable similarities with the Flat and Y states from the simulations of the JAK2-FERM-SH2:PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> complex near a similar bilayer.</p><p>Overall, the simulations highlight preferential binding of both JAK2-FERM-SH2, both alone and in complex with PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-E284</sub> to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and show that the absence of this lipid decreases the level of LID1 binding to the bilayer. Even in the absence of TMD tethering, the most populated bound states recapitulate the binding mode observed for the PRLR-ICD alone. Another key observation is the existence of different states in which different regions of both JAK2 FERM-SH2 domain and LID1 of PRLR are exposed to the solvent or hidden below the bilayer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Key residues for membrane interaction control cellular signaling efficiency</title><p>From the NMR experiments and MD simulations, we identified residues in LID1 that interact with different components of the membrane and/or the FERM-SH2 domain of JAK2. This resulted in four clusters positioned in the ICJM (K235–C242), the BOX1 region (C242–P248), two basic patches of the KxK motif type (K251–K253 and K262–K264), and hydrophobic residues in the region connecting them, respectively. To decipher the specific role of these clusters for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interaction, we introduced four sets of mutations in ICD<sub>K235-G313</sub> and investigated the effect on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interaction using NMR spectroscopy. Based on the NMR data and simulations, we focused on the KxK motifs, which would be involved in binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and JAK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), the CIF sequence, indicated to be important to membrane binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>) and four hydrophobic residues, where at least two were seen to be important for JAK2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We avoided interfering directly with the BOX1 core motif (P245–P250; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pezet et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, the CIF motif (C242–F244) was mutated to GAG (GAG mutant: C242G, I243A, and F244G), while the lysines in the KxK motifs (251–253 and 262–264) were all mutated to either glycines (K4G mutant: K251G, K253G, K262G, and K264G) or, for charge reversal, to glutamates (K4E mutant: K251E, K253E, K262E, and K264E). Finally, four hydrophobic residues (I<sub>252</sub>, F<sub>255</sub>, L<sub>259</sub>, and L<sub>260</sub>) were mutated to glycines (φ4G mutant). <sup>15</sup>N-PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-G313</sub> and the four variants were titrated with up to 25×molar excess of C<sub>8</sub>-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, keeping the concentration below the CMC. <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra were recorded at each titration point, and the changes in chemical shifts and signal intensities were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similarly to wild type (WT), all variants showed negligible chemical shift changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) but large peak intensity changes. Decreased peak intensities were observed for all variants in the region of G236–D295, where the changes were largest for the φ4G mutant and K4G, and similar to WT, while smaller effects were seen for the GAG and the K4E variants, suggesting weaker affinities. Together, this indicates that the KxK motifs and the CIF-motif are involved in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interaction, as expected from the contacts predicted from simulation and NMR and CD data, yet none of these residues are essential for binding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>PRLR variants with mutations in lipid interacting residues exhibit decreased PRL-stimulated STAT5 activation in AP1-2PH-PLCδ-GFP cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NMR peak intensity changes of PRLR-ICD<sub>K235-G313</sub> variants: WT, K4G, K4E, φ4G, and GAG variants upon titration with 5×, 10×, and 25× molar excess C<sub>8</sub>-PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> plotted against residue number.

The cells were subjected to fluorescence microscopy analysis of PRLR and the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and to western blot analysis of STAT5-activating phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D and F–G</xref>). None of the mutations fully abolished PRLR membrane localization. Western blot analysis showed that the protein expression levels were similar for WT PRLR and all PRLR variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, compared to WT, the K4G, K4E, and φ4G variants exhibited a significant reduction in membrane localization as determined by line scan analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>). This is in accordance with their predicted JAK2 contacts obtained from the simulations, as JAK2 is known to be important for PRLR trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2001</xref>). The PRL-induced STAT5 activation was significantly decreased in cells expressing either the K4G, K4E, or the φ4G variants, whereas STAT5 activation in cells expressing the GAG variant was not significantly different from that of WT expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and F</xref>). Decomposing the K4E variant into two individual mutants, in which only one of the two KxK motifs was changed (K2E<sub>251</sub> and K2E<sub>262</sub>), showed that the reduction in STAT5 activation was attenuated in the variants with the individual mutations, compared to the drastic decrease observed for the K4E mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and G</xref>). Thus, both KxK motifs are important for JAK/STAT activation, which suggests that both PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and JAK2 binding are important in this regard.</p><p>Taken together, these results show that while our data are consistent with the decreased membrane localization contributing to the reduction of STAT5 activation, it is unlikely to account fully for the effect observed for the K4G, K4E, or the φ4G variants. Part of this reflects impaired binding to JAK2, known to affect the amount of receptor at the cellular membrane. The MD simulations indicated that only the first KxK motif is involved in lipid interaction while the second KxK motif is involved in JAK2 interaction. Thus, a part of the the reduction in JAK/STAT activation in these variants could arise from a combined effect of abolishing both PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>- and JAK2 interaction within the LID1 region, which support the suggestion that co-structure formation between JAK2, PRLR, and the membrane is critical for optimal JAK/STAT signaling. However, within this co-structure, the involved residues will likely affect several binding events, and thus, separation of function by selective mutations may not be straightforward.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The sequence of the human PRLR has been known for more than 35 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boutin et al., 1988</xref>). Little attention has, however, been given to the role of membrane composition for PRLR signaling, despite it being placed in the plasma membrane where PI levels are highly dynamic and spatially variable and being linked to cancer with lipid deregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dadhich and Kapoor, 2022</xref>). Here, we asked if JAK2 and PRLR-ICD share a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding site and if and how the binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> plays a role in the orientation of these proteins with respect to the membrane. Integrating MD simulations with biophysical and cellular experiments has been critical in this endeavor. Our first goal was to identify the residues of LID1 involved, as well as the structure formed—if any—in the protein–lipid complex. Our results suggest that the residues that form the ICJM and BOX1 regions of the ICD interact with the lipids via non-specific hydrophobic interactions that involve penetration of the bilayer below the headgroups. This in turn enables positively charged residues of the <sub>251</sub>KIK<sub>253</sub> motif to establish ionic interactions with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and in doing so the region folds into an extended structure, similar to structures of other cytokine receptors in complex with either JAK1 or TYK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wallweber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In turn, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids accumulate around the TMD and LID1 of PRLR, suggesting a relevant functional role of the interaction.</p><p>The results highlight the capacity of the LID1 to establish highly populated and specific interactions with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> via residues essential for its interaction with JAK2. Therefore, we addressed whether LID1 in complex with the FERM-SH2 domain of JAK2 could engage with the lipid bilayer in the absence of the TMD and with or without PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids. Indeed, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was required for binding of the complex to the membrane, as the presence of only POPS in the lower leaflet was not enough to sustain binding despite its negative charge. Remarkably, when PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was present, we observed specific binding orientations that positioned the ICJM region of the LID1 in the same position as when tethered to the TMD. Furthermore, in the complex, the protein–lipid contact profiles were similar to the one observed for LID1 alone suggesting the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding pattern to be maintained in complex with JAK2. A detailed study of two of the most populated PRLR-bound states of JAK2 revealed a striking difference in orientation and contact pattern with the lipids that could shed light on functionally relevant states. For example, the most populated state, the Y state, had contacts from the F2 lobe of the JAK2-FERM-SH2 domain and the ICJM of the PRLR, which penetrated the membrane forming hydrophobic interactions with the acyl chains. In this orientation, regions of both JAK2 and the PRLR that have been associated with receptor dimerization and activation for signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wilmes et al., 2020</xref>) are exposed to solvent and available for interactions. We note that this orientation has resemblance to that shown in recent cryo electron microscopy (EM) structures of JAK1 bound to IFNAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glassman et al., 2022</xref>). For the Flat state, we observed a drastic change in the protein–lipid contact profiles for both proteins but more markedly for LID1. While the main interaction site remains the F2 lobe of JAK2 and the ICJM of the PRLR, the N-terminal residues of the LID1 now lie sandwiched between the membrane and JAK2-FERM-SH2 domain and recapitulates the binding pattern observed from TMD-ICD<sub>F206-H300</sub> simulations with membranes containing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Remarkably, in this Flat state, most of the accessible regions in the Y states are now hidden under the membrane. Thus, we speculate that the Y and Flat states may mimic an available and hidden state, respectively, that could be relevant for regulation of dimerization and activation of signaling. Interestingly, one residue that has been suggested to play a major role in JAK2 membrane association, orientation, dimerization, and activation is L224 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wilmes et al., 2020</xref>). This residue anchors into the membrane only in the Y state and not in the Flat state. Similarly, in simulations where L224 was mutated to glutamate, a change in preferred orientation together with loss of dimerization and JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wilmes et al., 2020</xref>). This further highlight that the orientation of the PRLR-JAK2 complex relative to the membrane has functional relevance. Importantly, the presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in the membrane structurally tightens the path from the ECD, folding the ICJM and BOX1 in an extended structure, making transmission of information of hormone binding possible. Thus, signal relay by disordered linker of the PRLR can now be possible through its complex formation with the membrane and JAK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of how co-structure formation between JAK2, prolactin receptor (PRLR), and PI4(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> may contribute to signaling fidelity.</title><p>The suggested states in signaling would be (<bold>A</bold>) the inactive state of the co-structure exemplified by the Flat orientation.

Both KxK motifs and the hydrophobic residues connecting them were important for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interaction, PRLR membrane localization, and cellular JAK2/STAT5 signaling. From the MD simulation, it was however evident that not all residues in these motifs were in direct contact with the membrane, further highlighting that co-structure formation between PRLR, JAK2, and the membrane is essential for optimal signal transduction. Another interesting observation was that even though mutating the CIF motif had the largest impact on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding, it had only a limited effect on cellular JAK2/STAT5 signaling. Since the NMR results suggested that the ICJM serves as a primary PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> anchoring point facilitating additional contacts along the chain, this could indicate that a cooperative interaction within the co-structure is needed to control signaling and that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> interaction is necessary for proper and substantial co-structure formation.</p><p>The PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-specific interactions observed point toward a possible regulatory role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in PRLR signaling. Our simulations showed that the membrane embedded TMD-ICD<sub>F206-H300</sub> was associated with an accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> around the TMD. One of the suggested roles of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> as a regulatory lipid is indeed to form microdomains around proteins and reduce their lateral movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Trimble and Grinstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">van den Bogaart et al., 2011</xref>). Another possible role can be inferred from previous studies on the EGFR. Evidence suggests a positive feedback loop where inhibition is released upon activation because PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is hydrolyzed to DAG and IP<sub>3</sub> by PLC<sub>y</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McLaughlin et al., 2005</xref>). Specifically, we have previously shown that PRLR does not interact with PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haxholm et al., 2015</xref>). As PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is phosphorylated by the PI3-kinase to PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> during PRLR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksamitiene et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yamauchi et al., 1998</xref>), this could indicate a way of attenuating signaling. Whether hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by PLC<sub>y</sub> is relevant for PRLR signaling is not known.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Signal transduction by single-pass receptors through the membrane is still an enigma. In the present work, we identify co-structure formation of the disordered LID1 of the PRLR, the membrane constituent PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and the FERM-SH2 domain of the JAK2 and demonstrate its importance for PRLR signaling. This co-structure has at least two orientations, a Y-shaped state extending from the membrane and a Flat state with sites hidden in the membrane, the functional roles of which await further elucidation. The co-structure led to accumulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the TMD interface and mutation of residues identified to specifically interact with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> negatively affected PRL-induced STAT5 activation. Facilitated by the co-structure, the disordered ICJM folds into an extended structure, tightening the path from the ECD to the ICD. We suggest that the co-structure formed between receptor, kinase, and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is critical for signal relay from the extracellular to the intracellular side of the membrane and that different orientations of the co-structure exist that may represent inactive and active states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of TMD <sub>F206-V240</sub>, TMD-ICD <sub>F206-S270</sub>, and ICD<sub>G236-Q396</sub></title><p>PRLR-ICD<sub>G236-Q396</sub> was produced as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haxholm et al., 2015</xref>, and TMD<sub>F206-V240</sub> and TMD-ICD<sub>F206-S270</sub> were produced as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bugge et al., 2015</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Expression and purification of ICD<sub>K235-G313</sub> and variants (K4E, K4G, ϕ4G, and GAG)</title><p>ICD<sub>K235-G313</sub> and variants hereof, K4E (K251E, K253E, K262E, and K264E), K4G (K251G, K253G, K262G, and K264G), ϕ4G (I252G; F255G, L259G, and L260G), and GAG (C242G, I243A, and F244G) were all produced as follows: competent BL21(DE3) were transformed using heat shock transformation with pET24a+ plasmids encoding the protein of interest with N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO tag.

The structure of hPRLR-TMD (PDB 2N7I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bugge et al., 2016</xref>]) was used as template for the transmembrane helix (in this structure, the residue at position 204 [P] was mutated to a G thus, in our model position 204 corresponds to a glycine), and due to the lack of structural templates for the ICD, it was modeled as a disordered coil. This all-atom model was used to build CG simulation systems where the TMD was embedded in different lipid bilayers composed of POPC in the upper leaflet and either: (i) POPC:POPS (70:30), (ii) POPC:POPS:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (90:5:5), and (iii) POPC:POPS:PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (80:10:10) in the lower leaflet using the CHARMM-GUI martini_maker module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qi et al., 2015</xref>).

Briefly, a time step of 20 fs was used, and the Verlet cutoff scheme was used considering a buffer tolerance of 0.005 kJ/(mol ps atom). The reaction-field method was used for Coulomb interactions with a cutoff of 11 Å and a relative permittivity of ε<sub>r</sub> = 15. For van der Waals’ interactions, a cutoff of 11 Å was used.

A semi-isotropic pressure coupling was used for all the systems that contained a lipid bilayer. For all systems, an initial round of equilibration with decreasing constraints applied to the protein beads and lipid beads was performed following the protocol provided by CHARMM-GUI Martini maker module. For the PRLR-TMD-ICD<sub>K235-L284</sub> simulations, a total of 11 µs of unconstrained MD were performed of which the first microsecond was considered as equilibration and the last 10 µs as production and used for analysis. For the JAK2-FERM-SH2 and the complex between JAK2-FERM-SH2 in solution, 1 µs of unconstrained simulation was performed. In the case of JAK2-FERM-SH2 or the complex between JAK2-FERM-SH2 and PRLR-TMD-ICD<sub>K235-L284</sub> near a lipid bilayer, an unconstrained run of 5 µs was performed for each system, and the complete trajectory was considered for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>All-atom MDs simulations</title><p>All-atom MD simulations were performed using GROMACS 2016 and 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>), using the CHARMM36m force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) for proteins and the TIP3P model for water.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Amy Andreotti as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Frauke Gräter (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The introduction needs to be updated to include the motivation for focusing specifically on LID1. In addition, more detailed descriptions of the methodologies used need to be included, specifically how these have been previously successfully applied by researchers to study equivalent membrane systems.</p><p>2) Please provide a better connection between the JAK2-PRLR complex conformational states and their functional relevance. This is an important point, as the majority of the simulation part of the paper centers on suggesting different states of the PRLR-JAK2 complex, and their hypothesized functional relevance is presented as a major result, yet not verified by experiments.</p><p>3) The connection between simulations and mutational study is not very direct. It is not clear that the mutants can distinguish between the effects of PRLR-PIP2 interaction or PRLR-JAK2 interaction, yet this conclusion is still drawn from the data.</p><p>4) Please provide some evidence (from experiments or simulations) regarding the role of PIP3 interactions. Currently (very strong) experimental evidence is provided only for PIP2, showing it to be an important regulator, while no results are provided for PIP3, despite being included in the final model.</p><p>5) The conclusions drawn from the mutagenesis study (lines 547-555) are not directly supported by data. There is only a partial correlation between PRLR membrane localisation and STAT5 activation, and this is insufficient to attribute the unexplained part of the STAT5 activation to PRLR-JAK2 interactions without further studies.</p><p>6) Based on the method section, the JAK2-FERM-SH2 CG-MD simulations are based on Martini 2.2 forcefield. If it is the case, the results of the orientation of the protein towards the membrane may be affected, as there can be some underestimations of the aromatics-choline interactions (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01194). This issue seems to be corrected in the new Martini3 version. Would it be possible to run a few control simulations using Martini3 to compare with Martini2.2 results and see if the protein orientation is affected? Otherwise, this limitation should at least be mentioned in the Discussion section.</p><p>7) Relatively large chemical shift changes are detected in PRLR res 285-290 upon lipid binding, these need to be discussed.</p><p>8) You might want to move some of the main figures to the supplementary data and further emphasize some of the major conclusions (for example Figure 3H and 3I).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The data of Figure 5A are explained as changes in peak intensities are the smallest for φ4G mutant. This is not true as K4G shows similar changes, and K4E shows even fewer changes.</p><p>Also, the explanation for the increase in intensity with titration to be due to weak binding is also not convincing. Could binding be measured by ITC for example to show indeed that one mutant binds weaker than the other?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study would benefit from a clearer distinction of mutation effects on PRLR-PIP2 interaction or PRLR-JAK2 interaction by designing mutants that only affect one and not the other, if possible. The same applies to the JAK5 activation: experimental evidence is currently lacking.</p><p>Also, the connection between simulations and mutant experiments could be more direct:</p><p>– CIF motif identified to be involved in PIP2 interaction using NMR and simulation.</p><p>– KxK motif 1 (residue ~252) identified in simulation to interact with PIP2.</p><p>– KxK motif 2 (residue ~262) not identified in simulation or NMR as PIP2 contact but as a contact point with JAK2 in simulation (Figure 4 figure supplement 1).</p><p>– Parts of φ4G contact point with JAK2 in simulation but L252 is part of KxK motif 1.</p><p>Finally, the discussion of different conformational states needs to be revisited and refined: which state should be functionally rather switched off, which state switched on, and how is function inferred from the conformations?</p><p>Also, experiments/simulations on PIP3 or at least a discussion on how PIP3 interactions can be inferred from the results on PIP2 would strengthen the study (point 5 above).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are a few points that need to be clarified:</p><p>1. In the introduction. While the biological context of this work is well explained, the methodological context is not really detailed. It gives the impression that technically speaking, this work is completely new, which is not the case. There are numerous published studies (both in terms of NMR and modelling) studying PIP2 lipids, IDPs, and membrane receptors. Thus, it may be interesting for the reader to see that other research has already been successfully applied to study equivalent membrane systems showing that the authors' strategy is indeed robust.</p><p>2. Figure 3 and Figure 3 supplement1: an RSMF analysis of the peptide LID1 would be useful to evaluate its degree of flexibility for each membrane system. It may help better understand how PIP2 lipids may partly structure the peptide.</p><p>3. From the method section, it is not clear where the PIP2 CG model is coming from. How this model can be compared with the recent parametrization of PIP2 (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00615)? If the two models are different how this can affect the modelling results?</p><p>4. My main concern is related to the JAK2-FERM-SH2 CG-MD simulations (Figure 4). Based on the method section these simulations seem to be based on Martini 2.2 forcefield. If it is the case, the results of the orientation of the protein towards the membrane may be affected as there can be some underestimations of the aromatics-choline interactions (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01194). This issue seems to be corrected in the new Martini3 version. Would it be possible to run a few control simulations using Martini3 to compare with Martini2.2 results and see if the protein orientation is affected? Or, at least, mention this limitation in the Discussion section.</p><p>Typos and format:</p><p>p.6, figure2-A: MD simulations box: K335 needs to be changed to K235.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84645.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The introduction needs to be updated to include the motivation for focusing specifically on LID1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided our rationale for selectively focusing on the LID1 region in the PRLR.

We refer to various membrane systems of relevance and explain the rationale for choice of methodology for the study (p. 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please provide a better connection between the JAK2-PRLR complex conformational states and their functional relevance. This is an important point, as the majority of the simulation part of the paper centers on suggesting different states of the PRLR-JAK2 complex, and their hypothesized functional relevance is presented as a major result, yet not verified by experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript we already provided a detailed analysis of the different states, highlighting accessible residues and lipid interacting residues and comparing these across the states. From our experiments, including the cellular assays, we cannot with certainty link the two major states to active and/or inactive states, and therefore do not claim this in the manuscript. What we do put forward as a major result, is the presence of <italic>more</italic> than one major state as also stated in the abstract and in the conclusion of the result section as follows (p xx):</p><p>“Another key observation is the existence of different states in which different regions of both JAK2 FERM-SH2 domain and LID1 of PRLR are exposed to the solvent or hidden below the bilayer.”</p><p>In the discussion we do speculate as to which state may be the active and/or inactive dimer/monomer but we do not make conclusions. We have now made the finding of more states clearer in the text, and further compare the two major states, the Y and the Flat state, to the recent cryo-EM structures of JAK1 bound to IFNAR1, which lends some support to our speculations. The abstract now reads:</p><p>“We find that the co-structure exists in different states which we speculate could be relevant for turning signalling on and off.”</p><p>To discern the functional relevance of these state, if possible, will require experiments also in cells that by themselves would be a new study. We have to the best of our ability clarified that the functional relevance of the states has not been elucidated by the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The connection between simulations and mutational study is not very direct. It is not clear that the mutants can distinguish between the effects of PRLR-PIP2 interaction or PRLR-JAK2 interaction, yet this conclusion is still drawn from the data.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point, and we thank the reviewer for pointing out that we did not sufficiently clearly describe our choices and the connection between the experimental data, the simulations, and the mutational study. As highlighted by Reviewer 2, the experimental data have provided a guideline for the selection, however, the arguments for choosing the mutations were unfortunately omitted from the text.</p><p>We have now explained these points in more detail, both regarding the choices (p. 16,17) and the data analysis and conclusions (p. 19,20). Furthermore, we have emphasized that in the case of PRLR, where a co-structure is formed, separating functions by mutation may be complicated by the intimate interplay of the structural preferences among the three components.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please provide some evidence (from experiments or simulations) regarding the role of PIP3 interactions. Currently (very strong) experimental evidence is provided only for PIP2, showing it to be an important regulator, while no results are provided for PIP3, despite being included in the final model.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous work addressing the affinity for different phosphoinositides using lipid dot blots we observed a preference for certain species, including PI(4,5)P2 (Haxholm et al., BJ, 2015). In that study, we also observed that there was no detectable affinity for PI(3,4,5)P3. We have now more explicitly described these data, both in the introduction (p.4), in the result section (p. 8) and later in the discussion (p. 21). We thank the reviewer for bringing this up.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The conclusions drawn from the mutagenesis study (lines 547-555) are not directly supported by data. There is only a partial correlation between PRLR membrane localisation and STAT5 activation, and this is insufficient to attribute the unexplained part of the STAT5 activation to PRLR-JAK2 interactions without further studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have toned down the conclusion. In conjunction with the more in-depth clarification of the results in this section, the conclusions should now more clearly reflect the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Based on the method section, the JAK2-FERM-SH2 CG-MD simulations are based on Martini 2.2 forcefield. If it is the case, the results of the orientation of the protein towards the membrane may be affected, as there can be some underestimations of the aromatics-choline interactions (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01194). This issue seems to be corrected in the new Martini3 version. Would it be possible to run a few control simulations using Martini3 to compare with Martini2.2 results and see if the protein orientation is affected? Otherwise, this limitation should at least be mentioned in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment and acknowledge the potential limitation of using the Martini2.2 forcefield in our simulations. As the reviewer mentions, the Martini2.2 forcefield may underestimate the aromatic-choline interactions, which could affect the orientation of the protein towards the membrane. While we did not directly address this issue in our study, we note that the main protein – lipid interactions we observe are driven by electrostatic interactions between positively charged residues (K and R) and the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> headgroups (and POPS in the systems without PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) which could mitigate the impact of the underestimation of cation-π interactions. As suggested by the reviewer, we have included a discussion of these limitations in the revised manuscript (p. 14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Relatively large chemical shift changes are detected in PRLR res 285-290 upon lipid binding, these need to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The region referred to contributes to binding but is on the edge of the main binding site and where the local affinities are weaker. Therefore, the exchange rate is high and allows for following the chemical shift changes. In support of this, we see an almost inverse correlation between the CSPs and the changes in intensities. For the main binding site, the exchange rate between bound and free states is slower because the affinity is stronger. Therefore, we cannot follow the chemical shifts to extract the CSPs to the bound state, as the peaks disappear. We have commented on this in the main text (p.8) as follows:</p><p>“In the region from D285-E292 we observed an almost inverse correlation between the CSPs and the intensities. This suggests that in contrast to the preceding region, a faster local exchange rate allows us to follow the resonances from the bound state in this region, giving rise to the large CSPs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) You might want to move some of the main figures to the supplementary data and further emphasize some of the major conclusions (for example Figure 3H and 3I).</p></disp-quote><p>A new version of Figure 3 has been generated to consider the reviewers’ comments and suggestions. This figure has been restructured to further emphasize some of the major conclusions obtained from the simulations. We have moved the former Figure 3 A, B, C and D to the supplemental information to increase the focus. Thus, the former Figure 3H is now Figure 3C and it has been significantly enlarged and include some corrections and edits: There was an error in the script we used to process the volumetric data containing the density (from VMD’s Volmap tool). Thus, the -150% issue was solved. Also, we noticed that since Volmap is not aware of the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) of the system, the edges of the box will contain low density values due to fluctuations in the number of lipids in this zone. That leads to average values near 0 which result in an abnormal depletion % at the edges observed in the previous figure. This has been solved by filtering out those values and showing the density only in the regions further inside the simulation box.</p><p>The former Figure 3G (now Figure 3C) now also includes residues up to H300 as suggested. We thank the reviewers for suggesting these improvements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The data of Figure 5A are explained as changes in peak intensities are the smallest for φ4G mutant. This is not true as K4G shows similar changes, and K4E shows even fewer changes.</p><p>Also, the explanation for the increase in intensity with titration to be due to weak binding is also not convincing. Could binding be measured by ITC for example to show indeed that one mutant binds weaker than the other?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this mistake to our attention. In our analyses, we compared both the intensity changes observed for the variant (internal comparison) and with those observed for the wild-type (across variants) and these were mixed up in the final text. We have now corrected the text accordingly and fully agree with the reviewer’s analyses.</p><p>Regarding a more quantitative measure of the affinities, ITC would require an affinity at least in the μM range, and since the complex is stabilized further with the membrane surface as well as by binding JAK2, it would not be straightforward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study would benefit from a clearer distinction of mutation effects on PRLR-PIP2 interaction or PRLR-JAK2 interaction by designing mutants that only affect one and not the other, if possible. The same applies to the JAK5 activation: experimental evidence is currently lacking.</p><p>Also, the connection between simulations and mutant experiments could be more direct:</p><p>– CIF motif identified to be involved in PIP2 interaction using NMR and simulation.</p><p>– KxK motif 1 (residue ~252) identified in simulation to interact with PIP2.</p><p>– KxK motif 2 (residue ~262) not identified in simulation or NMR as PIP2 contact but as a contact point with JAK2 in simulation (Figure 4 figure supplement 1).</p><p>– Parts of φ4G contact point with JAK2 in simulation but L252 is part of KxK motif 1.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point, and we are grateful for the reviewer to point out that we did not sufficiently clearly describe the background for our choices. As highlighted by Reviewer 2, and inserted above, the experimental data have provided a guideline for the selection, however, this was completely omitted from the text. Combined with the confusion on the evaluation on parts of the variant data, mentioned by reviewer 1, this made the conclusion from these data non-transparent. We have explained in much more detail, both on the choices (p. 16,17) and on the data analysis and conclusions (p. 19,20). Furthermore, we have emphasized that the separation of function by mutation may be complicated by the intimate interplay of the structural preferences among the three components of the co-structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the discussion of different conformational states needs to be revisited and refined: which state should be functionally rather switched off, which state switched on, and how is function inferred from the conformations?</p><p>Also, experiments/simulations on PIP3 or at least a discussion on how PIP3 interactions can be inferred from the results on PIP2 would strengthen the study (point 5 above).</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript we already provided a detailed analysis of the different states, highlighting accessible residues and lipid interacting residues and compare these across the states.

In the introduction. While the biological context of this work is well explained, the methodological context is not really detailed. It gives the impression that technically speaking, this work is completely new, which is not the case. There are numerous published studies (both in terms of NMR and modelling) studying PIP2 lipids, IDPs, and membrane receptors. Thus, it may be interesting for the reader to see that other research has already been successfully applied to study equivalent membrane systems showing that the authors' strategy is indeed robust.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a paragraph in the introduction on previous work which have successfully applied the used methodologies to study receptors and their interaction with lipids using integrative structural biology.

From the method section, it is not clear where the PIP2 CG model is coming from. How this model can be compared with the recent parametrization of PIP2 (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00615)? If the two models are different how this can affect the modelling results?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Indeed, we did not clearly mention the origin of our Martini 3 parameters for PIP2. At the time when we performed the simulations the only available version of M3 was m3.b3.2 and there were no PIP2 parameters available yet. So, we adapted the PIP2 parameters from the martini2.2 forcefield. These parameters are available on our github and zeonodo repositories for this project. With respect to the new martini 3 parameters for PIP2 referred by the reviewer, it is difficult to compare with our parameters as the reported improvements revolve around self-interaction of phosphoinositide and their aggregation in the presence of ca<sup>2+</sup>. With respect to protein-PIP2 interactions, the authors only show that the Martini 3 PI(4,5)P2 model is correctly interacting with proteins and replicating experimental findings, but no direct comparison with Martini2 is made.</p><p>On the other hand, it is known that the martini2 PIP2 model was able to correctly predict the location of PIP2 binding sites on Kir channels (https://doi.org/10.1021/bi9013193) among other successful examples (10.1039/C3CS60093A). Thus, we don’t expect that the use of the parameters derived from the Martini 2 model affect our results, however, further studies of this systems should take advantage of the recently published new models. A clarification regarding the precedence of the M3 PIP2 parameters was included in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. My main concern is related to the JAK2-FERM-SH2 CG-MD simulations (Figure 4). Based on the method section these simulations seem to be based on Martini 2.2 forcefield. If it is the case, the results of the orientation of the protein towards the membrane may be affected as there can be some underestimations of the aromatics-choline interactions (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.9b01194). This issue seems to be corrected in the new Martini3 version. Would it be possible to run a few control simulations using Martini3 to compare with Martini2.2 results and see if the protein orientation is affected?
