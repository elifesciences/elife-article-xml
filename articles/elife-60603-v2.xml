channels (TRPC) are involved in receptor-operated and/or store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Inhibition of TRPCs by small molecules was shown to be promising in treating renal diseases. In cells, the channels are regulated by calmodulin (CaM). Molecular details of both CaM and drug binding have remained elusive so far. Here, we report structures of TRPC4 in complex with three pyridazinone-based inhibitors and CaM. The structures reveal that all the inhibitors bind to the same cavity of the voltage-sensing-like domain and allow us to describe how structural changes from the ligand-binding site can be transmitted to the central ion-conducting pore of TRPC4. CaM binds to the rib helix of TRPC4, which results in the ordering of a previously disordered region, fixing the channel in its closed conformation. This represents a novel CaM-induced regulatory mechanism of canonical TRP channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>canonical transient receptor potential channel</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>calmodulin</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd><kwd>modulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raunser</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR240</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagel</surname><given-names>Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM structures reveal how the canonical TRPC4 cation channel is regulated by calmodulin, and how it is modulated by pyridazinone-based inhibitors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels mediate a plethora of vital cellular functions, including nociception, mechanosensation and store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clapham, 2003</xref>). Members belonging to the canonical TRP subfamily (TRPC) are involved in neuronal development and plasticity, as well as in vasorelaxation and kidney dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kochukov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Phelan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Riccio et al., 2009</xref>). As a result, malfunction is often linked to pathologies such as neurological disorders and cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Selvaraj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). This class of non-selective cation channels can be further subdivided into TRPC1/4/5, TRPC2 (which is a pseudogene in humans) and TRPC3/6/7 groups, based on their sequence similarity. Within the TRPC1/4/5 sub-group, TRPC4 and TRPC5 share the highest sequence identity of 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plant and Schaefer, 2003</xref>). Both proteins can form homo-tetrameric channels that allow the passage of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but also Na<sup>+</sup> ions to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Minard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Owsianik et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, TRPC1, which shares approximately 48% identity with TRPC4/5, rather participates in the formation of hetero-tetrameric TRPC1/4/5 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bröker-Lai et al., 2017</xref>). Whether or not functional homo-tetrameric TRPC1 channels exist in vivo and what their potential physiological impact may be, is currently not known.</p><p>TRPC4 is widely expressed in various tissues associated with the nervous-, cardiovascular- and immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freichel et al., 2014</xref>). It has been shown to be necessary for neurite outgrowth, and its expression is upregulated in axonal regeneration after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). Channel activation results in a depolarization of the cell membrane, followed by a surge of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. The regulation of the activity of TRPC channels, however, is multi-faceted and ranges from modulation by endogenous and dietary lipids to surface receptors, redox environment and various types of cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeon et al., 2012</xref>). TRPC4 was shown to be regulated by the ER-resident calcium sensor Stim1, the lipid-binding protein SESTD1 and the G-protein G<sub>αi2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miehe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zeng et al., 2008</xref>). Dependent on the respective cellular environment in combination with the experimental method used for the measurement, TRPC4 was proposed to either act as a receptor-operated channel (ROC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schaefer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaefer et al., 2002</xref>) or as a store-operated channel (SOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Warnat et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In the studies, describing TRPC4 as SOC, two key proteins, calmodulin (CaM) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R), compete for the same binding site on TRPC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mery et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2001</xref>). First, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding of CaM inhibits the channel in the resting state. When intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels decrease, the activating IP<sub>3</sub> receptor directly interacts with TRPC4, displacing CaM, to restore channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanki et al., 2001</xref>). This process, which is also known as conformational coupling, represents a primary regulation mechanism of gating for SOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berridge, 2004</xref>). However, a detailed mechanistic understanding of CaM inhibition or IP<sub>3</sub>R activation remains elusive.</p><p>As ROC, the channel is activated by G<sub>αi2</sub> coupled to the phospholipase C (PLC) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schaefer et al., 2000</xref>). Specifically, the secondary messenger DAG, which is released upon the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by PLC, directly binds to and activates TRPC4 and TRPC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mederos y Schnitzler et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Due to their implication in various diseases, TRPC channels also constitute a prime target for pharmacological intervention by small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Minard et al., 2018</xref>). Activation of channels by the natural compound (-)-Englerin A (EA), which shows high potency and selectivity for TRPC4/5, inhibits tumor growth of renal cancer cells through increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akbulut et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carson et al., 2015</xref>). Other activators include riluzole, BTD and the glucocorticoid methylprednisolone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richter et al., 2014</xref>). However, these compounds are typically either less potent or show varying specificity.</p><p>Inhibitors of TRPC4/5 are mostly used to target renal diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mundel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), but can also have a therapeutic effect on the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Just et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Currently, two compounds are in clinical trials aiming to treat a proteinuric kidney disease and anxiety disorder/depression, conducted by Goldfinch Bio (NCT03970122) and Hydra/Boehringer Ingelheim (NCT03210272), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mundel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wulff et al., 2019</xref>). While xanthine-based inhibitors, such as HC-070 and HC-608 (formerly known as Pico145) have assisted in advancing the field of pharmacological modulation of TRPC1/4/5 due to their exceptional high potency, they suffer from poor physiochemical properties such as low solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Just et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rubaiy et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a novel class of small molecule modulators selective for TRPC4/5 was identified in a high-throughput screen, building up on a piperazinone/pyridazinone scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Among this class of modulators are the inhibitors GFB-9289, GFB-8749 and the GFB-8438. In particular, GFB-8438 showed promise as a potential drug for the treatment of proteinuric kidney disease, exhibiting overall favorable in vitro and in vivo properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). In vitro, mouse podocytes were protected from protamine-induced injury when treated with the inhibitor. Importantly, GFB-8438 also demonstrated robust efficacy in a hypertensive deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt rat model of FSGS, in which both albumin concentration and total protein levels were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). However, information on the TRPC4/5 binding site and the mode-of-action of this novel compound class are still lacking. The structures of TRPC6 in complex with the activator AM-0883 and the inhibitor AM-1473 have been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2020</xref>). Following this study, the structures of TRPC5 in complex with the inhibitors clemizole, HC-070 and Pico145 have been reported by two different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wright et al., 2020</xref>). These structures show that the small molecules bind at the voltage-sensor-like (VSL) domain or at the lipid-binding pocket situated close to the pore region. Although insights gained from different apo structures of TRPC4 have advanced our understanding of this medically important TRPC subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vinayagam et al., 2018</xref>), a molecular understanding of pharmacological modulation by pyridazinone-based small molecules as well as key regulatory proteins such as CaM and IP<sub>3</sub>R remains unknown. Here we report five cryo-EM structures of TRPC4 in its apo form and in complex with the inhibitors GFB-8438, GFB-9289, and GFB-8749, as well as CaM. Based on the analysis of the structures we propose mechanistic pathways by which CaM and small molecules exert their action to modulate the activity of the channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cryo-EM structures of full-length TRPC4 in complex with small-molecule inhibitors</title><p>We previously reported the high-resolution apo structure of zebrafish TRPC4 in its closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vinayagam et al., 2018</xref>). To understand how channel activity is modulated by pharmacological compounds, we examined the complex of TRPC4 with the inhibitors GFB-8438, GFB-9289, and GFB-8749. All three compounds belong to the same novel class of TRPC4/5-selective modulators, which contain a common piperazinone/pyridazinone core.</p><p>To determine the electrophysiological effect of the compounds on TRPC4, we performed two-electrode voltage clamp experiments with TRPC4-expressing <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Expectedly, perfusion of the oocytes with the known activator (-)-Englerin A (0.1 or 1 µM) induced large inward currents at –40 mV. However, perfusing the oocytes with increasing doses of GFB-9289, GFB-8438 or GFB-8749 did not induce any current change, even in inside-out excised patches from oocytes or in TRPC4-expressing HEK293 cells (data not shown). Instead, GFB-9289, GFB-8438 and GFB-8749 inhibited (-)-Englerin A activation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C,E–G and I–K</xref>). Moreover, competition assays clearly showed that (-)-Englerin A and the respective compounds are competitive antagonists, although we cannot determine if they compete for the same binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,H and L</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The effect of three pyridazinone-based small molecules on TRPC4 and on (-)-Englerin A (EA)-induced opening of TRPC4.</title><p>(<bold>A, E and I</bold>) TRPC4-expressing <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were held at −40 mV and perfused with increasing concentrations of GFB-9289 (<bold>A</bold>), GFB-8438 (<bold>E</bold>) or GFB-8749 (<bold>I</bold>) to test the potential activation effect. 0.1 or 1 µM (-)-Englerin A (EA) were given at the end of recording to confirm the functional expression of TRPC4.

The architecture is typical for the canonical TRP channel family with a transmembrane region (TM domain) where the pore region of one protomer domain-swaps with the voltage-sensor-like (VSL) domain of another. The cytosolic domain harboring the ankyrin repeat (AR) embraces the coiled coil helix in the center and the N-terminal ankyrin domain is associated with the TM domain via a helical linker domain.

Its binding to the protein is predominantly mediated by hydrophobic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The nitrogen, the chlorine, and the oxo group of the pyridazinone ring form hydrogen bonds as well as halogen bonds with N442 of helix S3, Y373 of helix S1 and S488 of the S4 helix, respectively. The hydrophobic part of the pyridazinone ring is stabilized by a π-π stacking interaction with F413 of helix S2 on one side and M441 of helix S3 on the opposite side. The middle piperazinone ring forms a hydrophobic interaction with the Y373 while the oxo-group of the ring is engaged in a hydrogen bond with R491 of the S4 helix. The tri-fluoromethyl benzyl group engages in a hydrophobic interaction with L495 of helix S4, and the fluoride group is involved in a hydrogen bond with H369 of S1 and Y646 from the TRP helix.

The key difference between the molecules is the terminal ring, which is a tri-fluoromethyl benzyl group in the case of GFB-8438 and a cyclohexyl ring in GFB-9289. Given the common chemical scaffold structure with the difference limited to one part of the molecule, it is not surprising that they bind to the same region. This suggests that the VSL domain is a highly sensitive regulatory domain that responds to subtle stimuli in its small ligand-binding pocket in order to govern the function of this large tetrameric macromolecular complex.</p><p>Most interactions of GFB-9289 with the S1-S4 helices are the same as they are for GFB-8438 with small residue movements to accommodate the slightly different structure of GFB-9289 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). In the case of GFB-9289, Y373 forms hydrophobic interactions with the cyclohexyl and piperazinone rings. A reconfiguration of the binding interactions to the pyridazinone ring now includes hydrogen bonds to S488 side chain via its oxygen atom, unlike the halogen bond with Y373 observed in the inhibitor complex described above. The reduced size of the cyclohexyl group results in the reorientation of interacting residues. Importantly, Y646 of the TRP helix and H369 of the S2 helix do not interact with the compound and are rotating away from the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B C</xref>).

Comparison of the TRPC4/5 binding pocket with TRPC6 reveals a critical difference in ligand binding residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The cognate N442 residue in TRPC4/5 is replaced by L534 in TRPC6, which abrogates hydrogen bond formation with the nitrogen atom of pyridazinone. F413, which in TRPC4 forms a π-π interaction with the pyridazinone ring, is replaced by the weakly interacting hydrophobic residue M505 in TRPC6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E F</xref>). These crucial substitutions in the ligand binding pocket explain the much lower binding affinity of TRPC6 for GFB-8438 (&gt;30 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we have observed that the inhibitors GFB-8438 and GFB-8749, which have lower IC<sub>50</sub> values than GFB-9289, interact with both the TRP helix and the VSL domain, whereas GFB-9289 exclusively interacts with the VSL domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3G</xref>). This suggests that interaction of the compounds with the peripheral VSL domain is mainly responsible for the allosteric inhibition of the channel, and additional interaction of the inhibitor with the TRP helix amplifies this effect. We hypothesize that the direct stabilizing interaction with the TRP helix constrains it and the adjacent S6 helix thereby arresting the channel in a closed state. In this manner, the allosteric interactions within a peripheral binding site propagate to the ion pore in the center of the protein.</p><p>Inhibitors were also shown to bind to the VSL domain in other TRP family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diver et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh et al., 2018b</xref>), indicating that this domain acts in general as a regulatory region in TRP channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

Since we did not add lipids during our purification, this annular lipid likely co-purified with the protein. Each of the two lipid tails is placed like an anchor between neighboring S5 and S6 helices by forming several hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We hypothesize that this lipid site could be crucial for the gating of the channel, since small molecules can bind in this region, and modulate the channel as observed in activator-bound TRPC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We identified density for a putative cation in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site of the VSL domain in the ligand-bound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), also present in the apo structure of TRPC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vinayagam et al., 2018</xref>).

At high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the cytosol, CaM binds in its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound state to TRPC4 and inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. At low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, CaM changes its conformation and dissociates from the channel. The store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry pathway hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2001</xref>) further proposes that CaM binding to the channel at resting state prevents TRPC4 from being spontaneously activated by IP<sub>3</sub> receptors. When Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - but not in the cytosol - drop, the affinity of the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor to TRPC4 increases and CaM is displaced through a conformational coupling mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rosado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2001</xref>). This activates the TRP channel. To further understand the mechanistic process of CaM inhibition, we set out to determine the structure of the TRPC4-CaM complex.</p><p>We first performed a pull-down experiment using a CaM Sepharose column at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations with CaM acting as bait to capture TRPC4. As expected, TRPC4 was trapped in the CaM column in presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and released by chelating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> with EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is in line with previous studies which used smaller peptides of TRPC4 instead of the full-length protein used in our experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2001</xref>). Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> is necessary for the binding of CaM to TRPC4, we prepared the protein sample in the detergent LMNG (lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol) instead of following the amphipol exchange methodology that we used previously. Amphipols are known to interact with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and could thus disrupt CaM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Bon et al., 2018</xref>). We then determined the structure of TRPC4 in LMNG in complex with CaM. For the TRPC4-CaM complex, we added a 10-fold molar excess of CaM to tetrameric TRPC4 in the presence of 10 mM calcium chloride throughout the purification process after detergent extraction.</p><p>The CaM complex sample yielded a 3.3 Å map with applied C4 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed additional density surrounding the rib-helix termini protruding from the protein core, although the resolution in this region was lower than at the core of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Besides its localization at the periphery we suspected that an incomplete saturation of TRPC4 by CaM could be the reason for the lower local resolution. Hence, we performed 3D sorting without applied symmetry to resolve the subpopulations with different binding stoichiometries. 13% of the TRPC4 channels had one CaM-bound, 35% and 31% had two or three bound, respectively and only 20% were fully saturated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, some of the densities corresponding to CaM were less defined than others. The classes with clear CaM densities were then rotated and properly aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The apo structure of TRPC4 in LMNG reached a resolution of 2.85 Å, allowing us to build an atomic model with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>). The overall structure is similar to the previously reported amphipol-exchanged apo structure of TRPC4 in the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vinayagam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, in both the apo and CaM-bound structure, we observed for the first time an additional density corresponding to a horizontal helix located at the transmembrane-cytoplasmic interface outside the transmembrane core (residues 666–676) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). The hydrophobic residues of this helix face the transmembrane helix and the inner lipid leaflet while the hydrophilic residues project into the cytoplasm, giving the helix an amphipathic nature.</p><p>Comparing the TRPC4 apo structure with that of TRPC4-CaM, we could identify only small differences in the center of the channel. Both, the apo and CaM-bound TRPC4 structures showed the same constriction of 0.7 Å defined by N621 at the lower gate indicating the closed state of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Interestingly, when CaM binds to TRPC4 the selectivity filter is slightly widened and contains a density that likely corresponds to Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> as in the case of the inhibitor-bound channel. We observed a much stronger density at the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site in the VSL domain for the CaM-bound structure compared to apo TRPC4, presumably due to the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration we used for preparing the CaM-TRPC4 complex.</p><p>The differences between TRPC4-CaM and the TRPC4 apo structure are more pronounced at the periphery of the channel. There, CaM binding stabilizes a longer stretch (residues 677–692) of TRPC4 that is highly flexible in the apo state of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B C</xref>). Therefore, binding of CaM to this region of TRPC4 likely reduces the overall flexibility of the channel, fixing it in its closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Since one TRPC4 tetramer can bind up to four CaMs, this suggests that the number of CaMs simultaneously bound to TRPC4 could fine tune the level of channel activity.</p><p>Importantly, this mechanism of CaM-mediated regulation completely differs from that described for other TRP channels, such as TRPV5 and TRPV6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2018a</xref>). There, CaM binds in a 1:4 stoichiometry, with one CaM binding to the center of the tetrameric channels via the open cytoplasmic part, plugging it with its protruding lysine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2018a</xref>). In the TRPC4-CaM complex structure, the central core of the cytoplasmic region is occupied by a coiled coil helix. Thus, CaM cannot access the core of the cytoplasmic region in TRPC4. Other channels of the TRPC subfamily also contain this coiled coil helix and the rib helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the novel mechanism of CaM inhibition via binding to the rib helix is paradigmatic for all TRPCs.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Comparison of CaM binding in TRPC and TRPV channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Calmodulin (CaM) interacts with the rib helix of TRPC4.

The two-lobed CaM binds into the central cytoplasmic cavity of TRPV5. While four potential binding sites are available in TRPV5, only a single CaM molecule can bind due to steric hindrance.

(<bold>C</bold>) Same as in (<bold>A</bold>) for TRPV6. Similar to TRPV5, only a single CaM molecule binds to a region within the cytoplasmic cavity of TRPV6, indicating that this binding mode is conserved among TRPV channels.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60603-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Model for TRPC4 modulation</title><p>In this study we determined the structure of TRPC4 in complex with the pyridazinone-based inhibitors GFB-8438, GFB-9289, and GFB-8749 as well as with its endogenous regulator CaM. Analysis of these structures allows us to propose a model describing the molecular mechanism of modulation and regulation of TRPC4 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In our model, the channel switches between its closed and open conformation as was proposed for many other channels. Upon binding of an activator, the channel opens transiently and allows the passage of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Binding of inhibitors locks the channel in its closed conformation and possibly results in a dissociation of the activator. In our case, all of the three inhibitors bind to the same position, namely the VSL domain which is connected to the gate by the TRP helix. Thus, subtle conformational changes in this sensitive regulatory domain appear to be sufficient to transfer the signal from the periphery to the center of the channel to modulate its activity. High concentrations of the activator can reverse this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for TRPC4 modulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Canonical TRP channels can transiently open to allow the passage of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the interior compartment (left panel). Several mechanisms modulate the activity of the channel: binding of small molecule activators to one of the ligand binding pockets favors the opening event and thereby increases the overall channel activity. In the gating process, the TRP helix (orange) plays a central role as it has a direct connection to the pore-forming helices (blue), constituting the ion-conducting pore. Binding of small molecule inhibitors and the inhibitory protein CaM can restrict the mobility of the TRP helix, thus locking the channel in the closed state (bottom and top panels on the right, respectively). In the latter case, high intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations cause the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing protein CaM to bind to the CIRB region of the protruding rib-helix (red). This binding event stabilizes a previously disordered region that directly connects to the TRP helix. (<bold>B</bold>) Individual or simultaneous binding of activators and/or inhibitors modulate the channel gating. Interestingly, modulation sites, i.e. ligand pockets or structural features to which certain compounds or regulatory proteins bind, can accommodate both activators and inhibitors. Thus, these regions can be considered as activity switches. Binding of activators results in an ‘ON’ position, whereas inhibitor binding causes an ‘OFF’ state. In the case that multiple modulators bind simultaneously, all signals are integrated to determine whether the channel opens or remains closed.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60603-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>CaM does not bind to the VSL domain, which resides in the membrane and is therefore not directly accessible. However, it stabilizes other parts of the protein that are connected to the VSL domain. In particular, it binds to the tip of the rib helix, which results in the stabilization of the loop and the helix that connects it to the VSL domain. Thus, the binding of CaM to the rib helix has the same consequence as the binding of an inhibitor to the VSL domain, locking the channel in its closed conformation. Interestingly, the rib helix has also been shown to be the binding site for the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor which acts as an activator of TRPC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2001</xref>). Although we do not yet know the structural details of this interaction, it is likely that inhibition by CaM and activation by IP<sub>3</sub> receptor require the use the same binding site, while resulting in opposing effects. Activation by DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Storch et al., 2017</xref>) likely happens by binding of the secondary messenger to the previously identified lipid binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vinayagam et al., 2018</xref>) close to the channel pore. Thus, DAG activation would act directly on the pore region to open the channel. A structure of TRPC4 in complex with DAG will hopefully elucidate the exact mechanism in the near future.</p><p>Thus, TRPC4 contains several molecular switch regions that can be modulated by the binding of small molecules or regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consequently, the signals of different switches are integrated and together determine the final state and the degree of activation of the channel. Our model not only explains how TRPC4 activity is regulated by CaM in the cellular context, but also opens new possibilities for knowledge-driven pharmacological manipulation of this therapeutic target.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (HEK293 GnTI-)</td><td>HEK293 GnTI-</td><td>ATCC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_A785">CVCL_A785</ext-link></td><td>CRL-3022</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (HEK293T)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_LF41">CVCL_LF41</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (Sf9)</td><td>Sf9</td><td>Oxford Expression <break/>Technologies Ltd (UK)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0549">CVCL_0549</ext-link></td><td>Cat.No.600100</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>TRPC4<sub>DR</sub></td><td>GenScript <break/>NCBI Reference <break/>sequence: NM_001289881</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCDNA3.1+TRPC4<sub>ZF</sub></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vinayagam et al., 2018</xref> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29717981">29717981</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pEG BacMam</td><td>Eric Gouaux Lab <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25299155">25299155</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pEG BacMam +TRPC4 <sub>ZF</sub> <break/>(See methods section <break/>for details)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vinayagam et al., 2018</xref> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29717981">29717981</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pGEMHE 22</td><td>Promega</td><td>P2151</td><td>pGEMHE 22 is a derivative of pGEM3z</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>(-)-Englerin A</td><td>Carl Roth</td><td>Cat.No.6492.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SPHIRE software package</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moriya et al., 2017</xref> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28570515">28570515</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>crYOLO</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wagner et al., 2019</xref> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31240256">31240256</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Origin 2020 pro</td><td>OriginLab Corporation</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>TranSPHIRE</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stabrin et al., 2020</xref> <break/>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.155275">https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.155275</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Chimera</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15264254">15264254</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein purification and expression</title><p>Zebrafish TRPC4<sub>DR</sub> was prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vinayagam et al., 2018</xref>).

Equally dosed frames were collected using a K2 Summit (Gatan) or K3 (Gatan) direct electron detectors in super-resolution mode in combination with a GIF quantum-energy filter set to a filter width of 20 eV. The details of all four data sets including pixel size, electron dose, exposure time, number of frames and defocus range are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

Reference-free 2-D classification and cleaning of the data set was performed with the iterative stable alignment and clustering approach ISAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) in SPHIRE. ISAC was performed at a pixel size of 3.52 Å/pixel for apo-TRPC4 and TRPC4 bound to CaM. For inhibitors bound TRPC4 ISAC run was performed with either 3.52 Å/pixel or 3.8 Å/pixel. The ‘Beautify’ tool of SPHIRE was then applied to obtain refined and sharpened 2-D class averages at the original pixel size, showing high-resolution features. A subset of particles producing 2-D class averages and reconstructions with high-resolution features were then selected for further structure refinement.

Thus, the resulting 910,772 particles were used for Sort3d with a focused mask comprising the four CaM regions without imposing symmetry. Ten different classes obtained with Sort3d showed different stoichiometries (TRPC4 monomer:CaM) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. Four classes showing well resolved helices for CaM were selected and oriented in the same direction in order to boost the density at single CaM site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This rotation was achieved by applying a rotation of (±90°, 180°, 270°) to the projection parameters of the classes using a customized script. After rotation, duplicates were removed, reducing the number of particles to 160,829. These particles were further polished and CTF-refined in RELION.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and (Reviewer #1), and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Vera Y Moiseenkova-Bell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Vinayagam et al. reports several cryo-EM derived structures of the closed TRPC4 channel in complex with small inhibitor GFB-9289, activator GFB-8438 and calmodulin. The authors analyzed these structures to propose specific amino acid residues forming a ligand-binding site in TRPC4. In addition, the authors suggest a new mechanism underlying the association of TRPC4 and calmodulin. Finally, Vinayagam et al. create a mechanistic model for positive and negative modulation of the TRPC4 channel. The study has the potential to have a strong impact on the field and provides new mechanistic insights into TRPC4 function. The reviewers found the manuscript to be well written and the data clearly presented; in general, reviewers are very enthusiastic about the structural data. However, the authors need to address a few critical points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main comment voiced by all three reviewers refers to the actual channel activation by the compound GFB-9289. From the calcium imaging data, it seems to be a weak activator. Given the fact that the structure in the presence of this activator is very similar to the closed, apo structures, the reviewers ask that functional studies be performed. The actual single-channel open probability attained in the presence of GFB-9289 should be presented. If single-channel recordings cannot be attained, macroscopic current recordings comparing the fraction of current activated in comparison with a full agonist like Englerin-A should be presented. These experiments are particularly important since these compounds (the GFB activator and the inhibitor) are relatively new and have not been fully characterized functionally. Similar electrophysiological experiments regarding the action of the inhibitor should be presented.</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, TRPC4 is discussed as a store-operated channel. This notion, however, is a highly controversial issue. There is a general consensus in the field that the well-known STIM/Orai interaction is responsible for most forms of store-operated calcium entry. The initial conformational coupling hypothesis stipulating a direct interaction of the IP3 receptor and the C-terminus of TRPC proteins has never been convincingly shown in living cells and has by and large been abandoned. A more critical and balanced discussion, in particular with regard to store-operated calcium entry, is absolutely required.</p><p>3) Also relating to the discussion of the data, the analysis and discussion of cryo-EM data and the gating model proposed, completely neglected to discuss the commonly accepted view that the physiologically relevant activation mechanisms of TRPC channels may rely on PLC-mediated production of DAG. The Introduction and Discussion sections should be edited accordingly.

From the calcium imaging data, it seems to be a weak activator. Given the fact that the structure in the presence of this activator is very similar to the closed, apo structures, the reviewers ask that functional studies be performed. The actual single-channel open probability attained in the presence of GFB-9289 should be presented. If single-channel recordings cannot be attained, macroscopic current recordings comparing the fraction of current activated in comparison with a full agonist like Englerin-A should be presented. These experiments are particularly important since these compounds (the GFB activator and the inhibitor) are relatively new and have not been fully characterized functionally. Similar electrophysiological experiments regarding the action of the inhibitor should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this very constructive suggestion. We performed two-electrodes measurements with <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> expressing TRPC4 from zebrafish. To our surprise, these patch clamp experiments demonstrated that both compounds, GFB-8438 and GFB-9289, did not act as activator but inhibited the activating effect of Englerin A (see Figure 1). As electrophysiological experiments are direct measurements of channel currents and thus activity, we believe that they are more conclusive compared to our previous fluorescence-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data, which are more vulnerable to external influences. To further confirm that pyridazinone-based compounds can be categorized as TRPC4 inhibitors, we performed the same electrophysiological measurements with a third representative of this compound class, named GFB-8749. Indeed, an inhibitory effect was observed, showing a clear reduction of the activating effect of (-)-Englerin A. To ensure that GFB-8749 binds to the same binding pocket as the other two inhibitors, i.e. formed by helices S1-S4 within the VSLD, we determined the cryo-EM structure of TRPC4 in complex with GFB-8749 to a resolution of 3.8 Å. As anticipated, the structure confirmed that GFB-8749 resides in the same binding pocket. Thus, all three pyridazinone-based compounds act as inhibitors rather than activators. We have modified and rephrased our manuscript, and changed the figures, accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, TRPC4 is discussed as a store-operated channel. This notion, however, is a highly controversial issue. There is a general consensus in the field that the well-known STIM/Orai interaction is responsible for most forms of store-operated calcium entry. The initial conformational coupling hypothesis stipulating a direct interaction of the IP3 receptor and the C-terminus of TRPC proteins has never been convincingly shown in living cells and has by and large been abandoned. A more critical and balanced discussion, in particular with regard to store-operated calcium entry, is absolutely required.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have added the descriptions of TRPC4 as a store/receptor-operated channel to the Introduction citing the relevant literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Also relating to the discussion of the data, the analysis and discussion of cryo-EM data and the gating model proposed, completely neglected to discuss the commonly accepted view that the physiologically relevant activation mechanisms of TRPC channels may rely on PLC-mediated production of DAG. The Introduction and Discussion sections should be edited accordingly. More importantly, the impact of the manuscript will be much stronger if the authors discussed how the DAG-induced opening of TRPC4 could potentially be integrated into the suggested 3D model of TRPC4.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the Introduction and Discussion part accordingly and added DAG-induced opening of the channel as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) TRPC4-CaM structure has a very weak density for CaM at 5A resolution. It is not clear how the authors are even able to assign a specific lobe of the CaM to these very poorly resolved densities. Moreover, it is also not clear how authors can provide atomic details for these interactions in Figure 5C if the resolution is at 5A.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that this region of the structure, located at the periphery of the reconstruction, is less well resolved compared to the core region of TRPC4. Nevertheless, secondary structure elements in this region were clearly resolved, allowing us to unambiguously place one of the two lobes of CaM into the corresponding density using flexible fitting.</p><p>As both lobes, N- and C-terminal, are structurally almost identical on the backbone level (RMSD=1.27Å, Figure 5—figure supplements 6C) they can be equally well placed into the density. However, the C-terminal lobe gave us a slightly higher cross correlation (0.8102 vs. 0.8080 for the N-terminal lobe) and hence we proceeded with this one for the subsequent flexible fitting step into the density. Our placement was further validated by the local complementary interactions between side chains of TRPC4 and CaM, which are conserved between the N- and C-terminal lobe (Figure 5—figure supplements 6B and C).</p><p>To test the binding of the CaM lobes biochemically, we performed pull down experiments using the individual lobes of CaM as a bait to pull down purified zebrafish TRPC4. Expectedly, both lobes were able to pull down TRPC4 in a similar way (Figure 5—figure supplements 6A).</p><p>Since we used bi-lobed CaM for our structural analysis, it is therefore likely that our structure represents a mixture of N- and C- lobes.</p><p>We updated this part of the manuscript and revised the corresponding figure legends (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplements 6).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>We appreciate all the additional work done to answer reviewers' concerns, specially the two-electrode and patch-clamp recordings of the effects of the GFB compounds, which have revealed that all behave as inhibitors, highlighting the importance of detailed electrophysiological studies.
