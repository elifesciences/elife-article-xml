PCs are inhibitory neurons that spontaneously fire at high rates, and many PC inputs are thought to converge onto each CbN neuron to suppress its firing. It has been proposed that PCs convey information using a rate code, a synchrony and timing code, or both. The influence of PCs on CbN neuron firing was primarily examined for the combined effects of many PC inputs with comparable strengths, and the influence of individual PC inputs has not been extensively studied. Here, we find that single PC to CbN synapses are highly variable in size, and using dynamic clamp and modeling we reveal that this has important implications for PC-CbN transmission. Individual PC inputs regulate both the rate and timing of CbN firing. Large PC inputs strongly influence CbN firing rates and transiently eliminate CbN firing for several milliseconds. Remarkably, the refractory period of PCs leads to a brief elevation of CbN firing prior to suppression. Thus, individual PC-CbN synapses are suited to concurrently convey rate codes and generate precisely timed responses in CbN neurons. Either synchronous firing or synchronous pauses of PCs promote CbN neuron firing on rapid time scales for nonuniform inputs, but less effectively than for uniform inputs. This is a secondary consequence of variable input sizes elevating the baseline firing rates of CbN neurons by increasing the variability of the inhibitory conductance. These findings may generalize to other brain regions with highly variable inhibitory synapse sizes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>rate code</kwd><kwd>time code</kwd><kwd>disinhibition</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>deep cerebellar nuclei</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regehr</surname><given-names>Wade G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS032405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regehr</surname><given-names>Wade G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99NS110978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Christopher H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Lefler Center at Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Shuting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Purkinje cell inputs onto cerebellar nuclei (CbN) neurons have highly variable strengths, which allow them to influence CbN firing in a graded manner, with the largest individual inputs effectively regulating both the rate and spike timing of CbN neuron firing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cerebellum is involved in behaviors ranging from balance, motor control, and motor learning, to social and emotional behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hull and Regehr, 2022</xref>). Cerebellar dysfunction has been linked to severe motor impairment and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Argyropoulos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998</xref>). Within the cerebellar cortex, mossy fiber inputs from many brain regions excite granule cells that in turn activate Purkinje cells (PCs), which are the sole outputs. PCs project primarily to the cerebellar nuclei (CbN, also known as deep cerebellar nuclei [DCN]), which then project to other brain regions. Clarifying how PCs control the firing of CbN neurons is a vital step in understanding cerebellar processing.</p><p>PCs are GABAergic and fire spontaneously at frequencies ranging from 10 spikes/s to over 100 spikes/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thach, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). It was estimated that 40 PCs converge onto each CbN glutamatergic projection neuron to strongly suppress their firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>). This is offset by the tendency of CbN neurons to fire spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raman et al., 2000</xref>) and by numerous excitatory inputs from climbing fiber (CF) and mossy fiber collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Najac and Raman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu and Raman, 2017</xref>). Excitatory inputs to CbN neurons are small and slow, and their number and firing rates are poorly constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Najac and Raman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu and Raman, 2017</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we mainly focus on the control of CbN neuron firing by inhibitory inputs from PCs.</p><p>It has been proposed that PCs convey information with a rate code, a temporal code, or a combination of both, but there has been considerable debate regarding whether PC outputs are primarily encoded by firing rate or by a combination of rate and timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbasi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown and Raman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herzfeld et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoehne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Medina and Khodakhah, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Payne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Person and Raman, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sedaghat-Nejad et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stahl et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sudhakar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walter and Khodakhah, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu and Raman, 2017</xref>). There is compelling evidence that a rate code is used for some behaviors where the firing rates of PCs and CbN neurons are inversely correlated, and the behavior outputs can be readily explained by the changes in the firing rate of PCs and CbN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbasi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herzfeld et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Medina and Khodakhah, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Payne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sudhakar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walter and Khodakhah, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, synchronous firing or pauses of PCs allow precise temporal control of CbN neuron firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Schutter and Steuber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Özcan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sedaghat-Nejad et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steuber et al., 2007</xref>). Dynamic clamp studies of CbN neurons with uniform-size PC inputs demonstrated the ability of PC synchrony to promote CbN neuron firing and precisely entrain spike timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>), but whether PC synchrony is prominent in vivo has been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herzfeld et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sedaghat-Nejad et al., 2022</xref>). Synchronous pauses of PC firing have also been shown to be highly effective at transiently elevating CbN neuron firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2020</xref>). A recent study found that an electrically coupled subtype of molecular layer interneuron (MLI) synchronously fire and inhibit PCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lackey et al., 2023</xref>), thereby suggesting the presence and potential importance of synchronous pauses in vivo.</p><p>Here we reexamine how PCs control the firing of CbN neurons. We find that unitary PC-CbN inputs have highly variable amplitudes, and some are very large. We used dynamic clamp and simulations to explore the implications of nonuniform input sizes. We find that for a given total inhibitory conductance, nonuniform input sizes led to highly variable inhibitory conductances and high basal CbN firing rates. Inputs of all sizes regulated the rate and timing of CbN neuron firing, but larger inputs had a bigger influence. Although PC synchrony had less influence on the firing rates of CbN neurons for nonuniform-size inputs because of higher basal firing rates, synchronizing the firing of several large inputs effectively regulated the CbN neuron firing. Thus, the nonuniform distribution of PC input sizes allows the information of firing rates, timing, and synchrony to be conveyed from the cerebellar cortex to the CbN in a simultaneous, graded manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PC to CbN input sizes are highly variable in juvenile mice</title><p>To understand how PCs control the firing of CbN neurons, it is necessary to determine the distribution of the sizes of PC inputs. Previously, PC to CbN inputs were approximated by uniform inputs based on the average of all inputs recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu and Raman, 2017</xref>). We reexamined the issue of input sizes by determining the sizes of many individual inputs in young (P10-20, n = 74) and juvenile (P23-32, n = 83) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We cut brain slices, stimulated PC axons with an extracellular electrode placed far from the CbN, and recorded the evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in CbN glutamatergic projection neurons with whole-cell recordings. We used a high Cl<sup>-</sup> internal solution to determine the distribution of input sizes because it provided superior stability, low-access resistance, and high sensitivity compared to a low Cl<sup>-</sup> internal. We adjusted the stimulus intensity to stochastically activate an individual PC axon and isolate a unitary input. This approach is shown for three inputs onto the same CbN neuron for a juvenile mouse (P27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>). As shown in the individual trials for a small (weak) input, stimulation evoked short-latency IPSCs (720 pA) in some trials but not others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, upper, gray). The average of successes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, upper, black) and failures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, upper, blue) is shown. This is also apparent in a plot of the IPSC amplitudes for each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, lower) showing that the IPSCs were evoked in a fraction of the trials. Similar experiments are shown for a medium-size input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, 1690 pA) and a large-size (strong) input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, 6280 pA). To better evaluate the variability in the input sizes, we plotted the distributions of unitary PC to CbN input conductances for young (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, P10–20) and juvenile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, P23–32) mice. Input sizes were somewhat variable in young mice (coefficient of variation [CV] = 0.7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), which is qualitatively similar to previous findings (P13–29, n = 30) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>). In juvenile mice, there was considerably more variability, primarily because of the presence of many medium and large inputs (mean 52.9 ± 6 nS, CV = 1.0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). This is evident in a comparison of the cumulative histograms of IPSC conductances for young and juvenile animals, which showed significantly different distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>; p&lt;0.0001, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). These results show that PC to CbN input strength is highly variable in juvenile mice.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The amplitudes of Individual Purkinje cell (PC) to cerebellar nuclei (CbN) inputs are highly variable.</title><p>Unitary PC-CbN IPSCs were recorded in brain slices.

We then designed dynamic clamp studies using highly variable PC-CbN input sizes. The PC-CbN unitary conductances we used in dynamic clamp studies were based on our measured input sizes with two corrections (‘Methods’). First, we corrected for the effects of a high-chloride internal solution by scaling down the amplitudes by a factor of 2.3, based on the estimates of conductance values determined with high and physiological Cl<sup>-</sup> internal solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bormann et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gjoni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakmann et al., 1983</xref>). Second, we corrected the input sizes for the depression (reduced to 40% of initial amplitude) that occurs during physiological activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pedroarena and Schwarz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Telgkamp and Raman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turecek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>), as has been done in previous dynamic clamp studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Person and Raman, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu and Raman, 2017</xref>).

For simplicity, instead of having a continuous range of input sizes, we approximated the distribution of PC input sizes in juvenile animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, ‘Methods’) with 16 small (3 nS), 10 medium (10 nS), and 2 large (30 nS) inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, gray; total 200 nS, similar to the total conductances used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>). The timing and frequency of the inputs were based on PC firing recorded in awake-behaving mice, with each input firing at 83 spikes/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, ‘Methods’). The resulting spike times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) were convolved with the corresponding unitary conductance size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) to generate the small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, green), medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, blue), and large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, red) conductances, which were then summed to generate the total inhibitory conductance arising from all inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, black).

As shown in the cross-correlograms of input timing and CbN neuron spiking, small inputs produced a small transient decrease in CbN neuron spiking (32% decrease; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, left), while medium-size inputs strongly reduced CbN neuron spiking (80% decrease; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, middle), and large inputs transiently shut down CbN neurons for approximately 2 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, right). Intriguingly, the inhibition generated by inhibitory inputs was preceded by an increase in spikes that was particularly prominent for large inputs (61% increase for large, 29% increase for medium, and 8% increase for small; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The magnitude of excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, top) and inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, middle), as well as the duration of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, bottom), were all positively correlated with the size of the PC input. These findings highlight the ability of large PC inputs to control the timing of CbN neuron spiking.</p><p>We then performed simulations to extend these findings to a more realistic distribution of PC input sizes (‘Methods’). We determined the sizes of PC input by assigning them values randomly drawn from the distribution of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> (red) until the total inhibitory conductance reached 200 nS. An example distribution of PC input sizes used in a simulation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>. The cross-correlograms of input timing and CbN neuron spiking for each of the PC inputs were determined, and they all showed a similar pattern, with an elevation followed by a suppression of CbN firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). The magnitudes of the excitation and inhibition of CbN firing had a similar dependence on the size of the PC inputs as shown for the example neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, black) and for nine other simulated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, gray). In light of the many types of voltage-gated ion channels present in CbN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afshari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aizenman and Linden, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alviña and Khodakhah, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raman and Bean, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santoro et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steuber et al., 2011</xref>), we were somewhat surprised that the simple integrate-and-fire model we used was able to recapitulate our dynamic clamp studies, which indicates that our conclusions are not specific to the properties of the CbN neurons. We also performed simulations with different scaling factors of the distribution of input sizes, while keeping the same total conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Applying a scaling factor of 0.5 or 1.5 changed the number and size of PC inputs, but the results were qualitatively similar, and in all cases larger inputs had a greater influence on the firing of CbN neurons. These simulations complemented our dynamic clamp studies and showed that the properties of cross-correlograms and their dependence on the size of the PC input can be extended to realistic distributions of input sizes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The autocorrelation of PC firing leads to disinhibition prior to inhibition of CbN neurons</title><p>The elevated spiking observed prior to the inhibition by a PC input is intriguing. If such a cross-correlogram was observed in vivo, it might be attributed to excitation of the CbN neuron by other inputs that preceded PC inhibition, but that cannot be the case for our experimental conditions. Another possibility is that the refractory period of PC firing results in reduced inhibition and effective excitation. In that case, the properties of this disinhibition period will be shaped by the firing statistics of PCs. We tested this hypothesis by performing dynamic clamp experiments with the timing based on three different PCs recorded in vivo and on an artificial Poisson distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). As shown in the interspike interval (ISI) histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), auto-correlograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), and in raster plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>), the three recorded PCs had refractory periods that were correlated with their firing frequency (~3.5 ms for 49 Hz, ~2 ms for 83 Hz, and ~1.5 ms for 122 Hz firing), while the Poisson input did not have a refractory period. We then generated inhibitory conductances by convolving spike times with a 20 nS single-input conductance. To compensate for the differences in input firing frequency, we adjusted the number of the inputs so that the total inhibitory conductances were approximately the same for all cases (12 × 20 nS at 49 Hz, 9 × 20 nS at 83 Hz, 6 × 20 nS at 122 Hz, and 9 × 20 nS for Poisson inputs). When input spike timing was based on in vivo recordings of PC firing, the average inhibitory conductances decreased prior to the PC spike as a result of the refractory period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Consequently, the cross-correlograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) and raster plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>) showed elevated spiking in the CbN neuron prior to suppression by the PC spike. This is because a PC that spikes at <italic>t</italic> = 0 does not spike for several milliseconds before or after that spike. Consistent with our hypothesis, the speed and amplitude of this decrease in inhibitory conductance and the associated elevation in spiking depended on the PC firing statistics, with the faster firing inputs associated with larger, shorter-lived effects (49 Hz: 27% increase, halfwidth 5.3 ms; 83 Hz: 39% increase, halfwidth 3.4 ms; 122 Hz: 65% increase, halfwidth 1.7 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The cross-correlograms of PC inputs and CbN firing transiently showed transient suppression of firing that was followed by briefly elevated firing that was most prominent for rapidly firing PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, PCs that fire at 122 spikes/s). This elevated firing was also readily explained by the properties of PC firing and the refractory period of PCs. The Poisson input that lacked a refractory period did not have a decrease in the inhibitory conductance, and therefore CbN firing was not elevated prior to or following inhibition in the cross-correlogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>, far right). Thus, the autocorrelations of PC firing led to different extents of elevated CbN firing prior to suppression, and this affects how they control the spike timing of CbN neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Autocorrelation of Purkinje cell (PC) firing leads to excitation prior to inhibition of cerebellar nuclei (CbN) neurons.</title><p>Dynamic clamp experiments were conducted using PCs with different firing statistics.

PCs also control the average firing rate of CbN neurons in addition to spike timing. We used dynamic clamp to determine how the amplitude and the CV of the inhibitory conductance influence CbN firing. We began by examining how changing the amplitude of a constant inhibitory conductance altered the firing of CbN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The firing rate of CbN neurons was approximately 200 spikes/s for an inhibitory conductance of 30 nS, but as the magnitude of the inhibitory conductance increased the spike rate decreased, and an inhibitory conductance of 65 nS silenced CbN firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). As expected, the CbN firing rate was inversely related to the amplitude of inhibitory conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). We then examined how the variability in the inhibitory conductance influenced CbN spiking. We kept the total inhibitory conductance constant while varying the sizes and numbers of PC inputs that contribute to the total inhibitory conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). We generated the total inhibitory conductance for the indicated numbers and sizes of PC synaptic inputs with the timing based on PC firing recorded in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; ‘Methods’). While the average of the conductance wave was the same for all combinations of input sizes and numbers, as the size of the inputs increased, the conductance became increasingly variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) and the CV became larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Evoked firing rates in CbN neurons were low for many small inputs, but as the number of inputs decreased and the size increased, the firing rate increased markedly (from 12 spikes/s to 107 spikes/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and f</xref>). The firing rate was strongly dependent on the CV of the inhibitory conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>).

We first addressed this issue using simulations, in which we varied the firing rates of each PC input individually to determine how faithfully they convey a rate code. Simulations were similar to those of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref>, but with the firing rates for each input varied between 0 and 160 spikes/s while maintaining the average firing rates of other inputs at 80 Hz (‘Methods’). Varying the firing rate of individual PC inputs led to an approximately linear, negatively correlated change in CbN firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Single large inputs were surprisingly effective at regulating the firing rates of CbN neurons. In this example, varying a single 37 nS input from 0 to 160 spikes/s decreased the output firing frequency from 126 spikes/s to 35 spikes/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, red). There was a remarkably consistent relationship between the firing rates of CbN neurons and the total inhibitory conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

The firing rates for 50% synchrony with nonuniform and uniform inputs were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6aiv and biv</xref>), but because baseline firing rates were higher for nonuniform inputs, their relative increase in CbN firing was much lower (2.1-fold for nonuniform inputs compared to 3.5-fold for uniform inputs, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6av and bv</xref>). We also examined the effect of synchronizing 25 or 50% of small or medium inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6bi</xref><bold>,</bold> right). Synchronizing 25 or 50% of either small or medium inputs barely increased the variability and CV of the conductance and led to minimal increases in the firing of CbN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6bii–v</xref><bold>,</bold> right). These observations suggest that the effects of PC synchrony primarily depend on the total amplitude of synchronized inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and e</xref>). The firing rates of nonsynchronized and synchronized inputs for either uniform or nonuniform input sizes are readily explained by the influence of the CV of the inhibitory conductance on the CbN firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>).</p><p>Simulations allowed us to explore the effects of a full range of synchrony levels, which would be impractical to test experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–j</xref>). We examined uniform inputs (40 × 5 nS) and determined the effect of synchronizing 1, 2, … 20 inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–j</xref>, black open circles). We also examined nonuniform-size inputs drawn from the full distribution of sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, red), with a total conductance of 200 nS, and determined the firing rates evoked when we synchronized different combinations of inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–j</xref>, dark purple<italic>:</italic> for one distribution of input sizes<italic>;</italic> light purple<italic>:</italic> for nine other distributions of input sizes). The effects of synchrony on firing rates and the dependence on the CV of the conductance were qualitatively similar for simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–j</xref>) and dynamic clamp experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c–f</xref>). There was a great deal of scatter in the firing rates plotted as a function of the percentage of synchronized inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>, dark purple), but much less scatter when the firing rates were plotted as a function of the total amplitude of the synchronized inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>, dark purple). This is consistent with our observation that synchronizing many small- or medium-size inputs does not have much effect on the firing frequency of CbN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6bi–v</xref><italic>,</italic> right<italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c and d</xref>). For nonuniform inputs, synchrony has less influence on firing rates because the baseline firing rates are higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e and i</xref>). Nonetheless, synchrony of even a small number of large inputs can robustly elevate firing rates. As shown in simulations, synchronizing the two largest inputs can elevate CbN firing rate by approximately 20%, while synchronizing the two smallest inputs barely changed CbN firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k and l</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the influence of PC synchrony on the spike timing of CbN neurons in dynamic clamp experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Synchrony strongly altered the cross-correlograms of PC inputs and CbN firing, especially for the uniform-size inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>). For uniform inputs (5 nS), single unsynchronized inputs weakly influenced the spike timing of CbN neurons (19% increase; 62% decrease; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, left). Also, 50% synchrony of uniform inputs silenced CbN neurons for several milliseconds, and this was proceeded by a prominent increase in CbN spiking (89% increase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, right). This preceding increase in CbN spiking is similar to what was observed for medium and large inputs due to the autocorrelation function of PC firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2 and 3</xref>) and reflects a disinhibitory period due to the synchronous pauses in PC spikes. This indicates that many small, perfectly synchronized uniform inputs function equivalently as a single large input in controlling the spike time of CbN neurons. For asynchronous nonuniform inputs, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the influence of individual inputs on the timing of CbN firing depended on the size of the input, and single large inputs could have a very large influence on the timing of CbN spiking (47% increase; 100% decrease; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, left, red). Synchronizing 50% of all nonuniform inputs generated a cross-correlogram similar to that of synchronizing 50% uniform inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>, right). The strength of excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, top), amplitude of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, bottom), and duration of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>) were dependent on the synchrony amplitude, as was the case for simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e and f</xref>). For both dynamic clamp experiments and simulations, synchronizing the same amplitude of inputs led to larger timing effects for uniform inputs than for nonuniform inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c–f</xref>), likely because the CbN firing rates with PC synchrony are lower for uniform inputs. These findings establish that PC synchrony and single large inputs are functionally equivalent in controlling the spike timing of CbN neurons, and for nonuniform inputs, the effects of synchrony on CbN spike timing depend on the total size of synchronized inputs.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The influence of Purkinje cell (PC) synchrony on the spike timing of cerebellar nuclei (CbN) neurons for uniform- and variable-size PC inputs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top: the cross-correlograms of PC input and CbN neuron spiking for nonsynchronous inputs (left) and 50% synchronous inputs (right) with uniform-size inputs.

Such pauses in PC firing can arise from inhibition by the synchronous firing of electrically coupled MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lackey et al., 2023</xref>), CF synaptic activation of MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coddington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Szapiro and Barbour, 2007</xref>), and synchronous CF suppression of PC firing through ephaptic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2020</xref>). Dynamic clamp studies with uniform-size inputs have shown that pausing a fraction of PC inputs reliably activates CbN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2020</xref>). Here we used dynamic clamp studies and simulations to explore the effects of PC pauses on CbN neuron firing with uniform or nonuniform input sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). We first performed dynamic clamp experiments in which we paused the firing of 25, 50, and 100% of the PC inputs for 2 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). This is illustrated by raster plot showing that inputs from 50% of the PCs were briefly eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, gray box). Pauses in PC firing led to large, short-latency increases in CbN neuron firing for both uniform inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2020</xref>) and nonuniform inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c and d</xref>). For nonuniform inputs, we compared the effects of pausing the firing of different-size ranges of PC inputs by pausing the smallest, largest, and middle range of inputs. The larger the size of the paused inputs, the larger the resulting increases in CbN neuron firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c and d</xref>), and the magnitude of firing rate increases were determined by the total amplitude of the paused inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). Pausing produced larger relative increases in CbN neuron firing for uniform-size PC inputs than that for nonuniform PC inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c–e</xref>), which is likely a secondary consequence of the higher baseline firing frequencies for nonuniform inputs. Simulations where the firing of random combinations of PC inputs was paused for 2 ms produced similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>). Therefore, brief pauses in PC firing evoke transient increases in CbN neuron firing, and the effects are determined by the total amplitude of paused PC inputs. We also found that CbN firing quickly returned to baseline levels after the transient increase following brief PC pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Consequently, PC pauses only moderately increased the average firing rates of CbN neurons, as shown for a pause interval of 50 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g</xref>). The pause interval did not influence the properties of the transient increases in CbN firing evoked by pauses, but did affect the magnitude of the changes in average firing frequency. For 20 ms, 50 ms, and 100 ms intervals between the 2 ms pauses where all PC spikes were eliminated, the average CbN firing frequency increase was 3.2-, 1.9-, and 1.5-fold for uniform inputs, and 2.1-, 1.5-, and 1.2-fold for nonuniform inputs, respectively. In summary, while the transient increase in CbN firing by PC pauses primarily depends on the total amplitude of paused PC inputs, the overall changes of CbN firing rate at longer time scales depend on both the total amplitude of paused PCs inputs and the pause intervals.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The influence of Purkinje cell (PC) pauses on the firing of cerebellar nuclei (CbN) neurons for uniform- and variable-size PC inputs.</title><p>Dynamic clamp experiments and simulations were conducted with either uniform or variable inputs in which different percentages of PC inputs were paused for 2 ms.

As in earlier studies, we determined the properties of individual PC inputs and confirmed that they had very rapid kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>). We provide a much more extensive characterization of input sizes (n = 157) than previous studies and show that the distribution of input sizes is skewed, with the largest inputs almost 100 times larger than the smallest inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The high Cl- concentration internal we used in our recordings provides superior stability and sensitivity to detect such variability in input size. We then used dynamic clamp to study how PCs control the firing of CbN neurons as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>, but instead of assuming uniform PC input sizes, we based the PC input sizes on the measured PC-CbN conductances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We first confirmed that many small desynchronized PC inputs are highly effective at suppressing CbN firing, and that synchrony effectively controls the timing and rate of PC firing for small uniform-size PC inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>). We then revealed that the variable PC input sizes have important implications for PC-CbN transmission. A single large input is functionally equivalent to many small, perfectly synchronized inputs. This allows PC inputs to influence the rate and timing of CbN firing as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>), but without requiring a high degree of PC synchrony. We also extended previous studies by using realistic PC firing patterns in our dynamic clamp experiments. This allowed us to determine cross-correlograms for individual inputs and led to the finding that individual inputs have a surprisingly large effect on CbN firing.

This developmental transition indicates that PC-CbN synapses are refined during maturation, potentially because of plasticity mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aizenman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broersen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morishita and Sastry, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ouardouz and Sastry, 2000</xref>). The implications of such variability in the strength of PC-CbN synapses in cerebellar computation can be shown by a recent study describing how the cerebellum encodes vestibular and neck proprioceptive information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zobeiri and Cullen, 2022</xref>). Each PC encodes both vestibular and proprioceptive information, but some CbN neurons exclusively encode body motion and others encode vestibular information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brooks and Cullen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zobeiri and Cullen, 2022</xref>). It was proposed that this arises from the linear summation of converging PCs with different weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zobeiri and Cullen, 2022</xref>). Our observation of the variable distribution of PC-CbN inputs provides evidence for the requisite different weights of PC inputs.</p><p>The developmental changes in synaptic strengths we observe are reminiscent of other synapses. For retinal ganglion cell inputs to lateral geniculate nucleus, in young mice, numerous weak inputs innervate each LGN neuron, but in mature mice, this gives way to highly skewed input sizes that include some very strong inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hooks and Chen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang and Chen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Litvina and Chen, 2017</xref>). Excitatory inputs in the superior colliculus are refined in a comparable manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu and Constantine-Paton, 2004</xref>). For inhibitory inputs to LSO neurons, in P1–5 mice there are many small and no large inputs, but by P9–14 the input sizes are highly skewed, and some inputs are very large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gjoni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Kandler, 2003</xref>). In the cortex, input sizes are highly variable and are often approximated by a lognormal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Melander et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the distribution of PC to CbN input sizes we observe in P23–32 mice is similar in many ways to the distribution of input sizes of other types of synapses. Moreover, network simulations of balanced excitatory and inhibitory circuits have shown that adding variability to the distribution of input sizes disrupts the classical asynchronous irregular state of network activity and leads to rich, nonlinear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brunel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wardak and Gong, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Nonuniform PC input sizes elevate the basal firing rate of CbN neurons</title><p>An important consequence of having highly variable PC-CbN inputs is that it elevates the basal firing rates of CbN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9d and e</xref>). With the same total inhibition, uniform small PC inputs are particularly effective at suppressing the firing of CbN neurons. Nonuniform-size PC inputs elevate the CV of inhibition, increasing the fluctuations of membrane potential and elevating the firing of CbN neurons. Simulations based on an integrate-and-fire model with a passive cell and a well-defined firing threshold were able to replicate the findings of dynamic clamp experiments. This suggests that CbN neuron firing is effectively driven by the membrane potential fluctuations generated by PC inputs, despite the presence of many excitatory inputs and intrinsic conductances. The high basal firing rate of CbN neurons generated by nonuniform-size inputs helps explain the relatively high firing rates of CbN neurons in vivo amid strong PC inhibition (10–50 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eccles et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LeDoux et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McDevitt et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rowland and Jaeger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rowland and Jaeger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thach, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thach, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thach, 1968</xref>).

The extent to which the firing rate of an individual PC input regulates the firing rate of a CbN neuron simply depends on the size of the input, and our simulations suggest that single PCs are capable of regulating the firing of a CbN neuron from 35 to 125 spikes/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>; for a 37 nS input varied from 0 to 160 spikes/s). Regardless of the sizes of the input that are varied, the changes in the firing rate of CbN neurons can be readily explained by the alterations in the total inhibitory conductance. It was not obvious prior to these experiments that there would be such a simple relationship between input size, input firing rate, and output firing rate, given that CbN firing rates depend on both the amplitude and CV of inhibition. In practice, fluctuations in the inhibitory conductance are quite large for variable-size inputs, and changing the rate of one input has a relatively small influence on the CV of the inhibition, so the magnitude of the inhibitory conductance dominates the effect. This model allows all different-size PC inputs to reliably convey a simple rate code, with the large PC inputs being particularly effective.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications of nonuniform inputs on temporal codes</title><p>Previously it was also thought that an individual PC input has a small influence on the spike timing of a CbN neuron, and that it is necessary to synchronize the firing of many PCs to precisely entrain CbN firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>). Our cross-correlation analysis shows that this is not the case: large inputs (30 nS) eliminated CbN neuron firing for several milliseconds, and even small inputs (3 nS) transiently reduced CbN neuron firing by almost 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The sizes of PC inputs, the rapid kinetics of PC-CbN IPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Person and Raman, 2012a</xref>), the high firing rate of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thach, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), and the strong tendency of CbN neurons to depolarize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raman et al., 2000</xref>) together shape the pattern of cross-correlograms and contribute to precise control of CbN neuron spike timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Najac and Raman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Özcan et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, PC-CbN synapses are well suited to regulating both the rate and precise timing of CbN firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b and c</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, there was an excitatory response in CbN neuron firing preceding the suppression by PCs in the cross-correlogram of PC inputs and CbN neuron firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This excitation is a consequence of the autocorrelation function in PC firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ostojic et al., 2009</xref>), and it will be most prominent for rapidly firing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). When PCs fire at frequencies lower than 50 spikes/s, the excitatory component is small and lasts for several milliseconds, but when PCs fire at over 100 spikes/s, the excitatory component increases in amplitude and decreases in duration. This indicates the firing rates of PCs will affect the way they control the timing of CbN neuron firing. The observation that PCs in zebrin– regions of the cerebellum tend to fire faster than PCs in zebrin+ regions suggests different timing control of CbN neurons by zebrin+ and zebrin– PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). The effective excitation might also be present for other inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arlt and Häusser, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blot et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The observed distribution of PC to CbN synapse amplitudes, combined with the firing properties of PCs in vivo, allow us to make several predictions about PC-CbN neuron cross-correlograms in vivo. It is expected that PCs to CbN synapses are sufficiently large that prominent suppression should be apparent in cross-correlograms in vivo. The variability of PC-CbN synapses amplitudes suggests that there will be considerable variability in the extent and duration of spike suppression that is comparable to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Single large inputs are expected to eliminate CbN neuron firing for several milliseconds, but smaller, weaker connections are expected to be more prevalent. Our findings also predict a disinhibitory component preceding the suppression that will be particularly large for rapidly firing PCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Implications for the influence of synchronous firing and synchronous pauses of PCs</title><p>Variable PC input sizes have important implications for how PC synchronous firing and pauses regulate the firing of CbN neurons. First, the relative influence of PC synchrony on the firing rate of CbN neurons is reduced because variable input sizes elevate the basal firing rates of CbN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9d and e</xref>). Second, the effect of PC synchrony depends upon which inputs are synchronized. Synchronizing 50% of the small inputs (corresponding to 31% of the total inputs) increased CbN firing by just 13%, whereas synchronizing the two largest PC inputs to a CbN neuron increased the CbN firing rate by 21% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k and l</xref>). These findings suggest that a high degree of synchrony is not prerequisite for an appreciable influence. Therefore, studies that fail to detect a high degree of synchrony in PC simple spike firing in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herzfeld et al., 2023b</xref>) do not exclude the physiological relevance of PC synchrony in regulating CbN neurons. Similarly, we show that the relative influence of PC pauses is also reduced with variable-size inputs as a secondary effect of the high baseline firing rate, and is also determined by the total amplitude of paused inputs. Thus, the influence of PC inputs on their CbN targets depends upon the amplitudes of the different inputs, the firing patterns of the PCs, and the degree to which they are synchronized or paused.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Overall summary</title><p>Our initial findings that PC to CbN synapses are highly variable in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>), and that some are extremely large, have important implications for how PCs regulated the firing of CbN neurons and the output of the cerebellum. We found that individual large PC inputs strongly suppress the average firing rates of CbN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>) and also transiently silence them for several milliseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>), thereby allowing them to convey both rate information and precise temporal information. An important characteristic of the strong temporal control of CbN neuron firing by individual PC inputs and the statistics of PC firing is that in PC-CbN cross-correlograms, inhibition is preceded by an apparent increase in CbN firing that looks like excitation. We also found that nonuniform input sizes elevate baseline firing rates by increasing the variability of the inhibitory conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d and e</xref>). This has the secondary effect of reducing the efficacy of synchronous firing and synchronous pauses in elevating CbN firing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NBQX disodium salt</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> Ab120046</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(R,S)-CPP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> Ab120160</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strychnine hydrochloride</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> Ab120416</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SR95531 (gabazine)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> Ab120042</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGP 55845 hydrochloride</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> Ab120337</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">QX-314 chloride</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> Ab120118</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Igor Pro</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WaveMetrics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.wavemetrics.com/order/order_igordownloads6.htm">https://www.wavemetrics.com/order/order_igordownloads6.htm</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> Version 6.37</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 wild-type mice (Charles River Laboratories) of both sexes aged P10–P32 were used for acute slice experiments (for dynamic clamp experiments, P26–P32).

Therefore, synchronizing 10 5 nS inputs is equivalent to having one big input with a size of 50 nS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis</title><p>Recordings were obtained using Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices), sampled at 50 kHz and filtered at 4 kHz, and collected in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). Dynamic clamp recordings were performed with an ITC-18 computer interface controlled by mafPC in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). Data were analyzed using custom-written scripts in MATLAB (MathWorks) and Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). Autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses were performed by generating accumulative histograms of spikes distribution within a 20 ms time window centering all spikes from the reference file (self-reference for autocorrelation, and PCs spike times for cross-correlation), and normalized by the total spikes number of the reference file and the bin size of the histograms (i.e., the Δ<italic>t</italic>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sacha Nelson as the Reviewing and Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see from the comments below, most of the concerns raised by reviewers can be addressed through textual changes. Both reviewers felt that the scholarship of the manuscript could be improved and that additional quantitative summary and statistical testing was warranted (for example the degree of increase of skewness).</p><p>There was less clear cut agreement over the conductance measurements. The concern was raised that the high chloride used distorts this measurement in ways that were not very convincingly controlled or justified. Possible solutions to this issue raised included:</p><p>1) Redoing a subset of the measurements with more physiological chloride</p><p>2) Providing a more rigorous analysis of the overestimate of the conductance (i.e. a more detailed justification of the correction factor used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I detail some of the main problems with this study below. Most of these issues are fixable.</p><p>1. Scholarship issues. Many of the claims about background knowledge in the paper lack citations, and many of these &quot;claims&quot; are strawmen. A few, but not exhaustive examples:</p><p>a. &quot;Previously it was thought that PC-CbN synapses are uniformly small and that single PC inputs have little influence on the firing of CbN neurons.&quot; This statement is made repeatedly in the abstract, introduction, and results, yet no citation is provided but is essential. Undermining the point of the authors, the Person and Raman 2012 study shows a skewed distribution of unitary synaptic strengths of PCs. It also shows that a 10 nS input, equivalent to one input, is sufficient to suppress firing of a nuclear cell consistently (Figure S2 in that study). Person and Raman 2012 b discuss the potential anatomical underpinnings of skewed synaptic strengths. Here is the relevant text in 2012b: &quot;Perhaps more importantly, as the authors state explicitly, their &quot;apparently excessive&quot; numerical estimate for average convergence is based on the simplifying assumption that each Purkinje cell ramifies to the same extent on all nuclear cells. They point out, however, that Purkinje neurons consistently make non-uniform contacts onto nuclear cells, occasionally &quot;erupting&quot; into &quot;numerous (~50) boutons all in contact with the same cell body.&quot; Ramón y Cajal similarly observed that each Purkinje neuron axon formed six to eight &quot;nests&quot; onto as many cells (Chan-Palay, 1977). Such dense terminal perisomatic plexes are also mentioned in other descriptions of Purkinje axonal arbors (Chan-Palay, 1977; Bishop et al., 1979; De Zeeuw et al., 1994; Wylie et al., 1994; Teune et al., 1998; Sugihara et al., 2009), suggesting that they are a common specialization of Purkinje neuron terminals. Palkovits et al. (1977) propose that each Purkinje neuron may have 3-6 primary targets, while providing weak input to many more, and conversely that nuclear cells may only receive strong somatic input from &quot;several&quot;-that is, a relatively small number of- Purkinje cells (see also Sugihara et al., 2009).&quot;</p><p>b. The either-or nature of the synchrony vs rate coding hypotheses is not backed up by a citation &quot;Leading theories&quot; which ones?</p><p>c. &quot;Individual PCs are thought to have limited influence on CbN firing&quot; this is another statement that is not backed up by any literature I am familiar with. Indeed Person and Raman show in a supplemental figure that the equivalent of single inputs effectively inhibit CbN cells.</p><p>d. Paragraph 2 Introduction: &quot;a rate code does not apply&quot; – this is sloppy language that does not appropriately frame the state of the field. There are many possible explanations for deviations from inverse firing rate relationships, one of which is synchrony, but others include diverse excitatory afferents to the nuclei and cortex, neuromodulatory influence or other mechanisms.</p><p>2. Some of the main experimental claims are either not novel, mischaracterize previous literature, or lack rigor themselves:</p><p>A. &quot;The distribution of input sizes we observed in P10-20 animals was similar to previous studies (P13-29, n=30) (Person and Raman, 2012a), and the skewed distribution of input sizes was only apparent when many individual inputs were characterized in P23-32 mice.&quot; This conclusion is unconvincing. There is skew in both the young and the old populations, and if it's more skewed in the old is it more skewed than the overlapping age population shown before. I find this language borderline disingenuous. Moreover the cited study shows a skewed distribution of synaptic strengths.</p><p>B. The estimate of the synaptic conductances is problematic. The use of high Cl<sup>-</sup> interferes with the measurement, then they engage in some hand-waving arguments to come to an unconstrained estimate of 3-30 nS. This is not well constrained and will introduce unnecessary confusion into the literature.</p><p>C. There is too little statistical and quantitative information in the main text. For example, the first full paragraph of page 4 states: &quot;All inputs had effects on the timing of CbN neuron firing, but larger inputs had much bigger effects. As shown in the cross-correlograms of input timing and CbN neuron spiking, small inputs produced a small transient decrease in CbN neuron spiking, while medium sized inputs strongly reduced CbN neuron spiking, and large inputs transiently shut down CbN neurons for approximately 2 ms. No average or statistics are provided in the subsequent text either. This style makes it difficult to grasp the magnitude of any of these differences, and in any event, it seems obvious that graded inhibition would produce graded effect sizes.</p><p>D. The text states that the refractory period is correlated with the amount of CbN firing and refers to Figure 3. I see no evidence that a correlation was computed from this figure, nor are the statistics of any correlation reported in the text. That said, the potential relationship between CbN firing and PC refractoriness is interesting, but poorly explained in the text. A clearer mechanistic insight would be valuable, beyond &quot;This excitation is a consequence of the autocorrelation function in PC firing&quot;, which does not shed much light on the matter. It might be helpful to show the raster plots of spike-triggered inputs to better decipher relationships here. (Rasters for Figure 2D would also be valuable).</p><p>E. For the data in Figure 5, what accounts for the very high firing rates of CbN neurons (200 spikes/s)? The plots in Figure 5 could be more intuitive with some work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors - second review):</italic></p><p>The authors have thoroughly addressed my concerns. The revision beter frames the findings, both in terms of novelty and significance than the original submission. It will be of value to the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Main concerns for the authors:</p><p>The manuscript is very dense and constitute an important dataset for the field. The use of dynamic clamp is very interesting and enhances experimental options. I have however important concerns that I think could help clarify the manuscript:</p><p>– My first concern is the choice of the distribution with a different number of small, medium and large input size. I understand that it is necessary to keep the total conductance constant, but it raises a doubt on the relevance of the data in Figures 2 and 4c for example. Indeed, a few large inputs could be considered as many small inputs synchronized. Similarly, few large inputs obviously lead to a high CV by construction, while many small inputs reduce the CV. What is really tested in all these different protocols is a bit confusing.</p><p>– How is played this distribution on PC inputs? In episodes or continuously?</p><p>– A set of in vivo PC discharge is used, but where is it coming from?</p><p>– The correction made to approximate conductance is somehow arbitrary. I would tone down the assumption that this is the first demonstration that PC-DCN inputs are large and variable. Indeed, in preceding studies, authors already suggested that PC-DCN inputs are quite large in the recordings, albeit with different recording conditions.</p><p>In Person and Raman, Nature 2012 &quot;The high unitary amplitude suggests that individual Purkinje-to-nuclear contacts are quite strong&quot;, referring to an article that should be cited here as well:</p><p>Pedroarena, C. M. and Schwarz, C. Efficacy and short-term plasticity at GABAergic synapses between Purkinje and cerebellar nuclei neurons. J. Neurophysiol. 89, 704-715 (2003).</p><p>Actually the interplay between rate coding and temporal coding has been also addressed in:</p><p>Özcan, O. O., Wang, X., Binda, F., Dorgans, K., De Zeeuw, C. I., Gao, Z., Aertsen, A., Kumar, A., and Isope, P. (2020). Differential Coding Strategies in Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons in the Medial Cerebellar Nucleus. The Journal of Neuroscience, 40(1), 159-170.</p><p>– I am not a specialist in modeling, but I would imagine that since CbN neurons have active conductances (Ih, Cav3 channels), it is surprising that a simple integrate and fire reproduce fully CbN spiking behavior. The choice of model could be more discussed. In the MS, the discussion around rebound firing is also very limited.</p><p>– The concept of the refractory period accounting for the excitatory effect preceding PC inputs is not well explained, and the simple hypothesis that spikes were elicited at the time of the lowest inhibitory conductance might be enough.</p><p>– Figure 4 The frequency observed in CbN neurons seems much higher than in any other study. Similarly, what is the actual firing rate of neurons recorded in Figure 5 without inhibitory inputs?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Implications of variable synaptic weights for rate and temporal coding of cerebellar outputs&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Sacha Nelson (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Some additional modification of the text is warranted to address the remaining concern of Reviewer #2. In addition, a third reviewer was consulted who raised some of the same concerns raised earlier about statistical analyses of the underlying distribution and the validity of the extrapolation to measurements made in symmetrical chloride. Perhaps some of the points raised to address these issues in the previous reply to reviewers could be included in the manuscript to shore up these points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have definitely improved their manuscript, results are better explained and discussed. Based on my previous review, I would have two remaining requests:</p><p>– Related to Fig2g and my question about rebound firing, the authors answered</p><p>&quot;With regard to the issue of rebound firing, under our experimental conditions, we see no indication of rebound firing&quot;. In Fig2g, it seems that a rebound firing occurs for large inputs. It could be important to mention it as synchronization (e.g. by climbing fiber inputs) would also give the same outcome.</p><p>– Related to the discussion about input size vs synchrony, uniform vs nonuniform inputs, I think that a summary figure would help catch the take-home message.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In Wu et al., the authors describe how inputs of variable synaptic weights influence rate and temporal output coding in neurons of the cerebellar nuclei. This is valuable research that advances our understanding of this important question within the field of cerebellar encoding, with experiments that give solid (or mostly solid) evidence for their claims.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors focus on an important question in the cerebellar field: how do high-firing inhibitory Purkinje cells influence the output of neurons in the cerebellar nuclei (CbN) which are themselves spontaneously active? They use classical techniques: whole-cell electrophysiology combined with extracellular stimulation and dynamic-clamp experiments. They identify that there is a wide range of input strengths made onto CbN neurons from Purkinje cells and explore what this diversity of input strength might mean for CbN neuron output. Using dynamic clamp, they parametrically alter input synchrony, comparing how CbN output is altered when they alter inputs of different sizes. Some of their findings are counterintuitive, as they show that right before a strong inhibition of CbN firing caused by Purkinje cell activation, there is a transient enhancement of firing which is due to Purkinje cell refractory period. Other findings are more straight-forward – for e.g. they show that large inputs can strongly modulate firing and thus there is an inverse rate code. They look at synchrony and show that the impact on CbN firing depends on input variability, something that has not previously been addressed in detail. These findings are interesting and add to our understanding of how Purkinje cell synapses may influence CbN output.</p><p>1. One of the main claims of the paper is that they uncover that there is variable Purkinje cell input to CbN neurons. However, this finding is based on recordings with symmetrical Cl<sup>-</sup> internal that is not physiological. They use a calculation based on the literature (based on other synapses that may have different channel properties) to adjust their measurements to physiological values, but the appropriateness of this adjustment is not evident. This makes me question how solid this finding is, as there is no experimental validation. In fact, it is not entirely clear how much their finding differs from previous findings – they say that they show a different distribution, but they do not verify it is different statistically. I think they need to either strengthen their experimental evidence for this finding (which I acknowledge would be a challenging thing to do) or weaken their claims.</p><p>2. The authors talk about Purkinje cell autocorrelation as being the cause of the modulation of firing before the Purkinje cell spike reduces firing in CbN neurons. I find this section hard to follow, and given the general readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, I think the authors could do a better job explaining this in a more accessible way.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89095.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I detail some of the main problems with this study below. Most of these issues are fixable.</p><p>1. Scholarship issues. Many of the claims about background knowledge in the paper lack citations, and many of these &quot;claims&quot; are strawmen. A few, but not exhaustive examples:</p><p>a. &quot;Previously it was thought that PC-CbN synapses are uniformly small and that single PC inputs have little influence on the firing of CbN neurons.&quot; This statement is made repeatedly in the abstract, introduction, and results, yet no citation is provided but is essential. Undermining the point of the authors, the Person and Raman 2012 study shows a skewed distribution of unitary synaptic strengths of PCs. It also shows that a 10 nS input, equivalent to one input, is sufficient to suppress firing of a nuclear cell consistently (Figure S2 in that study). Person and Raman 2012 b discuss the potential anatomical underpinnings of skewed synaptic strengths. Here is the relevant text in 2012b: &quot;Perhaps more importantly, as the authors state explicitly, their &quot;apparently excessive&quot; numerical estimate for average convergence is based on the simplifying assumption that each Purkinje cell ramifies to the same extent on all nuclear cells. They point out, however, that Purkinje neurons consistently make non-uniform contacts onto nuclear cells, occasionally &quot;erupting&quot; into &quot;numerous (~50) boutons all in contact with the same cell body.&quot; Ramón y Cajal similarly observed that each Purkinje neuron axon formed six to eight &quot;nests&quot; onto as many cells (Chan-Palay, 1977). Such dense terminal perisomatic plexes are also mentioned in other descriptions of Purkinje axonal arbors (Chan-Palay, 1977; Bishop et al., 1979; De Zeeuw et al., 1994; Wylie et al., 1994; Teune et al., 1998; Sugihara et al., 2009), suggesting that they are a common specialization of Purkinje neuron terminals. Palkovits et al. (1977) propose that each Purkinje neuron may have 3-6 primary targets, while providing weak input to many more, and conversely that nuclear cells may only receive strong somatic input from &quot;several&quot;-that is, a relatively small number of- Purkinje cells (see also Sugihara et al., 2009).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and have rephrased our statements to be more precise. Person and Raman made a simplifying assumption when they used 40 uniform size PC inputs in their dynamic clamp studies (Person and Raman 2012a). This was a reasonable strategy, based on the distribution of input sizes they observed (Person and Raman 2012a), which is less skewed compared to what we observed when studying a larger number of inputs at different developmental stages (see response to Review #1, point 2 below). In Person and Raman 2012b, there was a nice discussion of the anatomical studies suggesting heterogenous PC boutons on CbN neurons, but it was difficult to relate such anatomical studies to PC input strength. Here we want to point out that the heterogeneity of PC-CbN connections and its implications on PC-CbN transmission have not been addressed experimentally, and previous studies using dynamic clamp were based on 40 uniform size inputs (Han et al., 2020; Person and Raman, 2012; Wu and Raman, 2017). All of these studies (including our own) made the same simplifying assumption and ignored the issue of different size inputs.</p><p>McDevitt et al., 1987 is often cited to address whether individual PC can regulate CbN neuron firing, as by Person and Raman 2012b: “In decerebrate cats, for example, spontaneous activity of such Purkinje-nuclear pairs is not correlated, and firing rate modulation in response to periodic sensory stimuli is not consistently reciprocal, leading to the conclusion that single Purkinje afferents are insufficient to regulate the spiking behavior of nuclear cell targets (McDevitt et al., 1987).” In our study, we find that this conclusion is not necessarily true since large PC inputs powerfully influence the firing of CbN neurons, which supports the importance of studying the consequences of different input sizes. We predicted similar observations to be made in PC-CbN neuron cross-correlograms in vivo.</p><p>The reviewer also referred to Figure S2 of Person and Raman 2012a, in which they studied how the time-course of single IPSC inputs influences the firing activity of CbN neurons, in the absence of other inhibitory or excitatory inputs. That experiment was not designed to show the strength of single PC input, and more appropriate experiments (e.g. testing the inhibition by single PC input in the presence of many other inhibitory and excitatory inputs) were not performed. Furthermore, although there were dynamic clamp experiments in which 40 asynchronous PC inputs drove CbN neuron firing, the effects of individual inputs were not analyzed (Person and Raman 2012a). Instead, the paper emphasized the effects of synchrony: “With partial synchrony, nuclear neurons time-lock their spikes to the synchronous subpopulation of inputs, even when only 2 out of 40 afferents synchronize” (Person and Raman 2012a). Therefore, we do not think the effects of individual PC inputs have been characterized in previous studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The either-or nature of the synchrony vs rate coding hypotheses is not backed up by a citation &quot;Leading theories&quot; which ones?</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that rate and time codes are not mutually exclusive. We have modified the manuscript to clarify this point. However, there is controversy in the field, and we think it is appropriate to point this out. Below are a few examples:</p><p>“After all, years of research have shown that much of the information sent to motor areas from the cerebellum is conveyed by a rate code — a modulation in the firing frequency of neurons in which the precise timing of the spikes is irrelevant because the rate is averaged over tens to hundreds of milliseconds… So, at least in theory, this would allow inputs from different groups of Purkinje cells to become synchronized for brief periods of time, and, when a high degree of temporal precision is required (for instance, at the beginning or end of a movement), to control the exact timing of spikes in nuclear neurons. To control other aspects of movement, such as amplitude or speed, the cerebellum might switch Purkinje cells back to the asynchronous mode and modulate their firing frequency up or down, thus regulating the firing rate of nuclear neurons.” (Medina and Khodakhah, 2012).</p><p>“Through an ingenious set of experiments, Person and Raman describe one such computational principle: how a (nuclear) neuron decodes the temporal structure of its synchronous (Purkinje cell) inhibitory inputs while ignoring the asynchronous ones… But a confounding limitation of such temporal decoding is that the probability of firing entrained spikes is reduced so much that nuclear neurons cannot ratecode — that is, the persistent activity of the asynchronous inputs reduces the probability of a nuclear neuron firing entrained spikes to such an extent that it can no longer encode the firing rate of its synchronous inputs in its own firing rate. This is problematic, because it has been known for more than 40 years that the activity rates of individual nuclear and Purkinje neurons correlate with movement and thereby with each other.” (Medina and Khodakhah, 2012).</p><p>“Information transmission in the brain can occur via changes in firing rate or via the precise timing of spikes. Simultaneous recordings from pairs of Purkinje cells in the floccular complex reveals that information transmission out of the cerebellar cortex relies almost exclusively on changes in firing rates rather than millisecond-scale coordination of spike timing across the Purkinje cell population.” (Herzfeld et al., 2023)</p><p>Such controversy can also be found in many other studies, as concluded in the introduction (Abbasi et al., 2017; Brown and Raman, 2018; Cao et al., 2012; Gauck and Jaeger, 2000; Heck et al., 2013; Herzfeld et al., 2023a; Hoehne et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2016; Medina and Khodakhah, 2012; Payne et al., 2019; Person and Raman, 2012a, 2012b; Sedaghat-Nejad et al., 2022; Stahl et al., 2022; Sudhakar et al., 2015; Walter and Khodakhah, 2009; Wu and Raman, 2017).</p><p>Alternatively, Person and Raman 2012a have promoted a view that is compatible with a combination of a rate code and a synchrony code, or more generally that timing and rate can both matter.</p><p>We have tried to provide a more nuanced discussion of the issues of synchrony, timing and rate to address the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. &quot;Individual PCs are thought to have limited influence on CbN firing&quot; this is another statement that is not backed up by any literature I am familiar with. Indeed Person and Raman show in a supplemental figure that the equivalent of single inputs effectively inhibit CbN cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to point a above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Paragraph 2 Introduction: &quot;a rate code does not apply&quot; – this is sloppy language that does not appropriately frame the state of the field. There are many possible explanations for deviations from inverse firing rate relationships, one of which is synchrony, but others include diverse excitatory afferents to the nuclei and cortex, neuromodulatory influence or other mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Some of the main experimental claims are either not novel, mischaracterize previous literature, or lack rigor themselves:</p></disp-quote><p>We do not agree with this general statement. We have responded to the specific issues raised by the reviewer below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A. &quot;The distribution of input sizes we observed in P10-20 animals was similar to previous studies (P13-29, n=30) (Person and Raman, 2012a), and the skewed distribution of input sizes was only apparent when many individual inputs were characterized in P23-32 mice.&quot; This conclusion is unconvincing. There is skew in both the young and the old populations, and if it's more skewed in the old is it more skewed than the overlapping age population shown before. I find this language borderline disingenuous. Moreover the cited study shows a skewed distribution of synaptic strengths.</p></disp-quote><p>The distribution we observed in P23-32 mice is very different from that shown in a previous study (Person and Raman, 2012a). We therefore feel that our description of the results was fair and reasonable, and it was not “disingenuous.”</p><p>Although we have not changed the text regarding this issue, we are open to specific suggestions, provided it is consistent with the differences in the skewness of the distributions in Response Figure 1. The authors also provided a figure (Response Figure 1, that is not reproduced here) in which distributions of input sizes were directly compared for (a) 30 inputs from p13-29 mice (Person and Raman, 2012a, Fig. 1b lower), and (b) 83 inputs from p23-32 mice from this paper (Fig. 1e, corrected for high chloride internal). This direct comparison made the differences in the skew of the distributions obvious.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B. The estimate of the synaptic conductances is problematic. The use of high Cl<sup>-</sup> interferes with the measurement, then they engage in some hand-waving arguments to come to an unconstrained estimate of 3-30 nS. This is not well constrained and will introduce unnecessary confusion into the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s concern provides us with another chance to address how we constrain the input sizes based on several factors. We used a high Cl<sup>-</sup> internal to determine the distribution of input sizes because it provided superior stability, better access resistance and higher sensitivity compared to using a low Cl<sup>-</sup> internal. We scaled down the conductance amplitudes by 2.3, guided by previous findings that the measured chloride conductances were 2-3 times larger for high chloride vs. physiological chloride internals (Bormann et al., 1987; Gjoni et al., 2018; Sakmann et al., 1983). Modest errors in the correction from high to physiological chloride concentrations will not affect our major conclusions but might have small quantitative effects on the influence of single inputs. We performed additional simulations to address this issue (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3; Figure 5 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>We also took into account the depression that occurs during high frequency activation of PC inputs (Turecek et al., 2017, 2016; Telgkamp and Raman, 2002; Pedroarena and Schwarz, 2003, reduced to 40% of the initial response), as in previous dynamic clamp studies (Han et al., 2020; Person and Raman, 2012; Wu and Raman, 2017). Based on the corrected distribution of input sizes, we took two major approaches: (1) For dynamic clamp studies we used a simplified distribution based on the experimentally determined distribution of input sizes (16 X 3 nS, 10 X 10 nS, and 2 X 30 nS). We have provided additional clarification in the revised paper, which we hope has addressed the issue. (2) We performed simulations in which we used different size inputs drawn from the experimentally determined distribution. Overall, these approaches were based on experimental data and reasonable assumptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C. There is too little statistical and quantitative information in the main text. For example, the first full paragraph of page 4 states: &quot;All inputs had effects on the timing of CbN neuron firing, but larger inputs had much bigger effects. As shown in the cross-correlograms of input timing and CbN neuron spiking, small inputs produced a small transient decrease in CbN neuron spiking, while medium sized inputs strongly reduced CbN neuron spiking, and large inputs transiently shut down CbN neurons for approximately 2 ms. No average or statistics are provided in the subsequent text either. This style makes it difficult to grasp the magnitude of any of these differences, and in any event, it seems obvious that graded inhibition would produce graded effect sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and have added more quantification. If there are any additional quantification or statistical tests you would like us to perform, please point them out and we will update the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D. The text states that the refractory period is correlated with the amount of CbN firing and refers to Figure 3. I see no evidence that a correlation was computed from this figure, nor are the statistics of any correlation reported in the text. That said, the potential relationship between CbN firing and PC refractoriness is interesting, but poorly explained in the text. A clearer mechanistic insight would be valuable, beyond &quot;This excitation is a consequence of the autocorrelation function in PC firing&quot;, which does not shed much light on the matter. It might be helpful to show the raster plots of spike-triggered inputs to better decipher relationships here. (Rasters for Figure 2D would also be valuable).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and we have provided additional quantification. We appreciate the reviewer’s interest on the issue and suggestions to improve the clarity of the manuscript. In short, the firing statistics of PCs determine their refractory period, which in turn result in different extents of excitation (e.g., amplitude, duration) prior to the inhibition. We have added more explanations in our text. We also think having the raster plots is a good idea and we have added this to the figure (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). I hope the additional explanation and figures have clarified this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E. For the data in Figure 5, what accounts for the very high firing rates of CbN neurons (200 spikes/s)? The plots in Figure 5 could be more intuitive with some work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the previous Figure 5 was not very intuitive. We moved most of Figure 5 to a supplemental Figure, provided additional explanation, and retained the parts that were more intuitive. We hope this addresses the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors - second review): The authors have thoroughly addressed my concerns. The revision beter frames the findings, both in terms of novelty and significance than the original submission. It will be of value to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that we were able to address all of the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Main concerns for the authors:</p><p>The manuscript is very dense and constitute an important dataset for the field. The use of dynamic clamp is very interesting and enhances experimental options. I have however important concerns that I think could help clarify the manuscript:</p><p>– My first concern is the choice of the distribution with a different number of small, medium and large input size. I understand that it is necessary to keep the total conductance constant, but it raises a doubt on the relevance of the data in Figures 2 and 4c for example. Indeed, a few large inputs could be considered as many small inputs synchronized. Similarly, few large inputs obviously lead to a high CV by construction, while many small inputs reduce the CV. What is really tested in all these different protocols is a bit confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern about our experimental design of the input sizes. Our priority purposes are to reproduce the physiological relevant sizes, ratio, and total inhibitory conductance. As we addressed above in our response to reviewer 1, we based our estimation on the corrected distribution and compute the ratio and weighted averages for different ranges of input sizes. The number of small, medium, and large inputs were chosen to represent their ratio from our recordings. The total inhibitory conductance (200 nS) was chosen based on previous measurement of the maximal evoked inhibitory conductance of CbN neuron in slices (Telgkamp and Raman, 2002; Person and Raman, 2012). We agree that different size inputs inevitably alter the CV, and we systematically showed how the CV of the inhibitory conductance affects CbN neuron firing (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How is played this distribution on PC inputs? In episodes or continuously?</p></disp-quote><p>The different conductance waves were played in episodes, separated with intervals and alternated in sequence between different trials to minimize the effects of adaptation of CbN neuron firing. We have expanded the Methods section to provide additional details about the experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A set of in vivo PC discharge is used, but where is it coming from?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for point this out.</p><p>The firing pattern of 10 PCs recorded in vivo used in this study were from our previous studies (Han et al., 2020). In Figure 2 —figure supplement 1, we showed that the ISI distribution of these 10 PCs can be nicely described with lognormal distributions, and we used these artificial PC ISI distributions in most experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The correction made to approximate conductance is somehow arbitrary. I would tone down the assumption that this is the first demonstration that PC-DCN inputs are large and variable. Indeed, in preceding studies, authors already suggested that PC-DCN inputs are quite large in the recordings, albeit with different recording conditions.</p><p>In Person and Raman, Nature 2012 &quot;The high unitary amplitude suggests that individual Purkinje-to-nuclear contacts are quite strong&quot;, referring to an article that should be cited here as well:</p><p>Pedroarena, C.

We explained our correction in the response to reviewer 1 (see 2-B).</p><p>Please note that previous papers suggest that PC inputs were quite large, but they were still much smaller that the large inputs we observed (over 80 nS). With regard to input sizes, Pedroarena and Schwarz found an average input size of 11.7 nS prior to depression (P12-21 rats at 25-29°C; with high Cl<sup>-</sup> internal; after correction for high Cl<sup>-</sup> internal corresponds to an average input size of 3.8 nS prior to depression). Person and Raman found an average input size of 9.4 nS (P13-29 mice at 36°C, with physiological Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration internal), which is much smaller than the very large inputs we see (see Figure 1 and the response to reviewer 1). Özcan at al. is an interesting and relevant paper and we have cited it in the revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I am not a specialist in modeling, but I would imagine that since CbN neurons have active conductances (Ih, Cav3 channels), it is surprising that a simple integrate and fire reproduce fully CbN spiking behavior. The choice of model could be more discussed. In the MS, the discussion around rebound firing is also very limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is surprising that our simple model is in such good agreement with our dynamic clamp experiments. We would have explored more complex and realistic models had the integrate and fire model failed to recapitulate our experimental findings (p. 4). We think this indicates that our conclusions are not specific to the properties of the CbN neurons and have added to the discussion of this point. With regard to the issue of rebound firing, under our experimental conditions we see no indication of rebound firing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The concept of the refractory period accounting for the excitatory effect preceding PC inputs is not well explained, and the simple hypothesis that spikes were elicited at the time of the lowest inhibitory conductance might be enough.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important finding, and we agree with this concern by both reviewers that this part of the manuscript needs clarification. We have revised the figure and provided addition discussion of this point. We hope this issue has been addressed, but we welcome suggestions for ways to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4 The frequency observed in CbN neurons seems much higher than in any other study. Similarly, what is the actual firing rate of neurons recorded in Figure 5 without inhibitory inputs?</p></disp-quote><p>The high firing frequency of CbN neurons in these experiments likely resulted from the drastic changes in the inhibitory conductance, since we matched the excitatory conductances in the beginning of these experiments to reach a basal CbN firing rate of 30-50 spikes/s. Some of the scenarios we tested in these experiments are extreme cases (e.g., half of the PC inputs pause their firing) and therefore showed very high firing rate of CbN neurons (e.g., 200 spikes/s). The range of the firing rate of CbN neurons have also been observed in other dynamic clamp studies (Wu and Raman, 2017). The firing rate of CbN neurons in our other experiments mostly fall in physiological ranges (less than 100 spikes/s).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Some additional modification of the text is warranted to address the remaining concern of Reviewer #2. In addition, a third reviewer was consulted who raised some of the same concerns raised earlier about statistical analyses of the underlying distribution and the validity of the extrapolation to measurements made in symmetrical chloride. Perhaps some of the points raised to address these issues in the previous reply to reviewers could be included in the manuscript to shore up these points.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have definitely improved their manuscript, results are better explained and discussed. Based on my previous review, I would have two remaining requests:</p><p>– Related to Fig2g and my question about rebound firing, the authors answered</p><p>&quot;With regard to the issue of rebound firing, under our experimental conditions, we see no indication of rebound firing&quot;. In Fig2g, it seems that a rebound firing occurs for large inputs. It could be important to mention it as synchronization (e.g. by climbing fiber inputs) would also give the same outcome.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer refers to an apparent rebound component in CbN firing for large PC inputs (Figure 2g). This might also arise from the autocorrelation function of the PC firing: if there is a PC spike at me t=0, then that PC will not fire for several milliseconds before or after that spike as a result of the refractory period, which then lead to disinhibition and transiently promote firing. This is clear in Figure 3d where the cross-correlogram generated by a Poisson input does not show the disinhibition either before and after the inhibition. We have provided an additional explanation to clarify this point (p. 5).</p><p>The issue of climbing fibers and different size inputs is interesting. We focused on simple spikes, and we have not examined the issue of climbing fibers and different size inputs either experimentally or with simulations. Hopefully we will be able to address this issue in great depth in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Related to the discussion about input size vs synchrony, uniform vs nonuniform inputs, I think that a summary figure would help catch the take-home message.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. We have added a new figure to summarize the main take home messages (Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In Wu et al., the authors describe how inputs of variable synaptic weights influence rate and temporal output coding in neurons of the cerebellar nuclei. This is valuable research that advances our understanding of this important question within the field of cerebellar encoding, with experiments that give solid (or mostly solid) evidence for their claims.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors focus on an important question in the cerebellar field: how do high-firing inhibitory Purkinje cells influence the output of neurons in the cerebellar nuclei (CbN) which are themselves spontaneously active? They use classical techniques: whole-cell electrophysiology combined with extracellular stimulation and dynamic-clamp experiments. They identify that there is a wide range of input strengths made onto CbN neurons from Purkinje cells and explore what this diversity of input strength might mean for CbN neuron output. Using dynamic clamp, they parametrically alter input synchrony, comparing how CbN output is altered when they alter inputs of different sizes. Some of their findings are counterintuitive, as they show that right before a strong inhibition of CbN firing caused by Purkinje cell activation, there is a transient enhancement of firing which is due to Purkinje cell refractory period. Other findings are more straight-forward – for e.g. they show that large inputs can strongly modulate firing and thus there is an inverse rate code. They look at synchrony and show that the impact on CbN firing depends on input variability, something that has not previously been addressed in detail. These findings are interesting and add to our understanding of how Purkinje cell synapses may influence CbN output.</p><p>1. One of the main claims of the paper is that they uncover that there is variable Purkinje cell input to CbN neurons. However, this finding is based on recordings with symmetrical Cl<sup>-</sup> internal that is not physiological. They use a calculation based on the literature (based on other synapses that may have different channel properties) to adjust their measurements to physiological values, but the appropriateness of this adjustment is not evident. This makes me question how solid this finding is, as there is no experimental validation. In fact, it is not entirely clear how much their finding differs from previous findings – they say that they show a different distribution, but they do not verify it is different statistically.
