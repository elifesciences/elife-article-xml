The resulting persistent, low-level infection results in cumulative tissue damage with the greatest impact generally in the heart in the form of chagasic cardiomyopathy. The relative success in immune control of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection usually averts acute phase death but has the negative consequence that the low-level presence of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in hosts is challenging to detect unequivocally. Thus, it is difficult to identify those who are actively infected and, as well, problematic to gauge the impact of treatment, particularly in the evaluation of the relative efficacy of new drugs. In this study, we employ DNA fragmentation and high numbers of replicate PCR reaction (‘deep-sampling’) and to extend the quantitative range of detecting <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in blood by at least three orders of magnitude relative to current protocols. When combined with sampling blood at multiple time points, deep sampling of fragmented DNA allowed for detection of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in all infected hosts in multiple host species, including humans, macaques, and dogs. In addition, we provide evidence for a number of characteristics not previously rigorously quantified in the population of hosts with naturally acquired <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection, including, a &gt;6 log variation between chronically infected individuals in the stable parasite levels, a continuing decline in parasite load during the second and third years of infection in some hosts, and the potential for parasite load to change dramatically when health conditions change. Although requiring strict adherence to contamination–prevention protocols and significant resources, deep-sampling PCR provides an important new tool for assessing therapies and for addressing long-standing questions in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection and Chagas disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Chagas disease is a dangerous tropical illness caused by single-cell parasites known as <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>. In most cases, if not treated immediately, the infection becomes chronic: the immune system of the host greatly reduces the number of parasites present in the body yet fails to fully eradicate them. Current diagnostic approaches often fail to detect these low numbers of parasites. More broadly, without a reliable way to measure <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> levels, researchers and clinicians struggle to test new treatments as well as determine whether patients carrying more parasites tend to develop more severe disease.</p><p>In response, White et al. aimed to develop a new way of measuring parasitic loads. They based their approach on standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction), an experimental method that amplifies specific DNA sequences in proportion to their initial levels in a sample. This allows researchers to not only pinpoint the presence of the parasites, but also to assess their relative number However, the approach has limited sensitivity: if the amount of target DNA initially collected is too low, it may not be detected.</p><p>To bypass this limitation, White et al. adopted a ‘deep-sampling PCR’ approach and made several crucial changes. First, they collected several samples from the same patient, therefore increasing the overall sampling volume. Second, they fragmented the sample DNA before the amplification step in order to disperse the target DNA, thus increasing the chances of its detection in each PCR reaction. Third, they performed as many as 400 PCRs per sample. These modifications greatly improved sensitivity compared to usual approaches.</p><p>White et al. used their newly improved method to examine <italic>Trypanosomas cruzi</italic> levels in infected macaques over long periods. The results show that parasitic burden can be stable over a year, but vastly differs between individuals (with some having a million times more parasites than others). Similar findings were also observed in humans and dogs.</p><p>The method developed by White et al. is likely to be too labour intensive to be routinely used in diagnostic laboratories; however, it represents an important and immediate advance for researchers testing new compounds to treat Chagas disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic></kwd><kwd>Chagas disease</kwd><kwd>test of cure</kwd><kwd>PCR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03 AI166504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tarleton</surname><given-names>Rick L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1UL1TR003163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamer</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><name><surname>Saunders</surname><given-names>Ashley B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A vastly improved PCR-based approach provides a long-sought test of cure and parasite load monitoring tool for Chagas disease.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chagas disease, the result of infection with the protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, is endemic to the Americas, where it is among the highest impact infectious diseases, and is also a major source of infection-related heart disease globally. Chagas disease is a result of the long-term persistence of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> primarily in muscle tissues, despite highly effective immune responses that generally control but fail to completely clear the infection in the majority of individuals. Although <italic>T. cruzi</italic> continuously alternates between replicating forms inside host cells and non-replicating forms in extracellular spaces, including the bloodstream where it can be acquired by blood-feeding triatomine insects, detection of parasites or parasite products in the blood is generally undependable, using even the most sensitive methods. Consequently, diagnosis of infection generally rests mainly on serological tests, which are often not fully reliable.</p><p>Positive serological tests reflect prior exposure but not necessarily active infection. Thus, determining the effectiveness of current treatments to clear the infection or whether some subjects have spontaneously resolved the infection (apparently rare, but anecdotally reported) and thus should not be treated, remains out of reach. The inability to routinely and sensitively detect active infection coupled with the undependable curative capabilities of current therapeutics and their substantial side effects, accounts for the estimates that less than 1% of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-infected individuals receive anti-parasitic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cucunubá et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the lack of sensitive methods to definitively establish cure hinders the identification and validation of improved therapies.</p><p>Amplification techniques such as PCR can specifically enrich very low quantities of pathogen DNA and have been extensively used to enhance the detection of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> DNA in the blood of infected hosts. Multiple, high copy number (&gt;10<sup>5</sup> copies per organism) targets for amplification have been identified and rigorous, highly specific amplification protocols have been developed and evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schijman et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that these protocols, as currently employed, frequently fail to detect <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in infected hosts and thus are not reliable tests of the absence of infection. Multiple studies have attempted to address the sensitivity and specificity of the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> PCR methodology, for example, varying the target (there are two primary ones used, a kDNA and a genomic satellite sequence), primer and probe sequences, DNA storage and purification techniques (automated or not), and volume of blood drawn for DNA isolation (1–10 ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sulleiro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Silgado et al., 2020</xref>). In general, none of these variations significantly alter test outcomes. What does alter the ability of PCR to detect <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection is the number of independent blood collections done and the number of PCR determinations conducted for each sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Parrado et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>These results highlight that detection of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> DNA in infected hosts is frequently a problem of sampling. Specifically, when pathogen numbers are low, collection of a high number of test samples that are extensively subsampled may be required in order to have an opportunity to detect a pathogen. For <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, this sampling problem is strongly supported by the remarkable study done in the 1970s by Cerisola in Argentina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cerisola, 1977</xref>) in which 30 untreated subjects submitted to approximately monthly xenodiagnosis with 80 triatomines each month for &gt;2 years. This study showed that some individuals had multiple bugs positive at every sample point (thus, presumably a high parasite load) while others were more variable (strongly positive some months but not others), and a few were only very occasionally positive (in the most extreme case, as few as 2 positive bugs out of &gt;1000 fed over 24 months).</p><p>In the current study, we have used humans, non-human primates (NHPs), and dogs, all with naturally acquired <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infections, to demonstrate that serial sampling of blood and exhaustive PCR of optimally prepared DNA from that blood, can confirm even the most difficult to detect infections with <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. The ability to obtain relative quantification of parasite load in these naturally infected hosts reveals the wide range of parasite load among infected subjects in a population (&gt;6 log<sub>10</sub>) and the conditions under which parasite control can change, both slowly in the early years of infection and dramatically when overall health changes. Deep-sampling PCR, while laborious, offers the first true test of cure for Chagas disease and should also assist in the determination of associations between parasite load, immune response parameters, and the risk for disease development in chronically infected hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Performing large numbers of replicate PCR reactions (‘deep-sampling’) extends the range to detection of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection in naturally infected hosts</title><p>In order to determine the potential of deep-sampling for more sensitive detection of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in blood samples, we spiked macaque blood with DNA equivalent to known numbers of parasites and conducted 40 replicate PCR reactions per DNA sample.

The three macaques in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> had among the highest fraction of positive PCR reactions (70, 81, and 68 %) in the study, but also displayed an increase in mean Cq values over the 1-year study period. Because of the consistent detection of positive PCR reactions (minimum 1 positive reaction in a maximum of 20 replicates every month) in 9 of the 18 initially sampled seropositive macaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), these macaques were only sampled for the first 6 months of the study period. However, for these macaques in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> with a pattern of increasing Cq values over 6 months, an additional set of samples was collected at month 12. In all three cases, a highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) trend of increasing Cq values over time was evident, indicating a decreasing parasite load over the 1-year period. Not surprisingly, these three macaques were also among the most recently infected macaques studied (minimum 2–4 years post-infection) and likewise, the macaques in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> with a low frequency of PCR positive reactions were among the longest infected of the macaques under study (6–8 years). However, several macaques did not match this trend of lower parasite load with increasing length of infection (e.g. P11, infected for 2 years, had a low parasite load and P5 and P1, infected, respectively, for 8 and 10 years, had among the highest frequency of PCR positive reactions). There was no statistically significant correlation between the length of infection and the frequency of PCR positive reactions (p = 0.081) or the mean Cq value of positive PCR reactions (p = 0.11) among all macaques in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This monthly monitoring of blood parasite DNA thus reveals a relatively stable parasite load over 12 months but huge differences when compared to the spiked samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in the load between individual naturally infected macaques, irrespective of the length of infection.</p><p>The other exception to a relatively stable level of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> DNA in blood of infected macaques is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.

This animal developed uncontrolled diarrhea late in the third trimester of pregnancy and had to be euthanized shortly after collection of the August sample.

Additionally, without the ability to routinely quantify parasite load in humans and other naturally infected hosts, there are multiple, sometimes contentious issues in Chagas disease that will remain unresolved, among these, the relative role of parasite and host genetics in establishing the parasite burden in this persistent infection, the stability of parasite load over time, and particularly important, the relationship between parasite burden and the presence and severity of clinical disease.</p><p>Quantifying <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in blood and other tissues in hosts after the early peak of infection is challenging because the immune response to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection is normally extremely effective in tightly limiting parasite numbers within a few months of the initial infection. The bulk of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in vertebrate hosts at any point in time are intracellular, mostly in various muscle types throughout the body. However, to maintain and to transmit the infection, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> must also exit host cells (following a 4- to 5-day period of parasite multiplication) and infect new host cells or on occasion, be ingested by blood-feeding triatomines. In addition to intact parasites, the blood is likely to contain DNA released by parasites that are killed by immune effector mechanisms and thus may be available for detection, either free in plasma or bound to blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thompson et al., 2024</xref>). In short, even in hosts with very low-level/well-controlled infections, the potential always exists for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> DNA to be present in the blood, albeit often at extremely low amounts. And when present in such low quantities, the chances of detection, even with highly optimized PCR protocols, is random and highly prone to sampling error. This is not a situation unique to <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection. For example, detection of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Waked et al., 2020</xref>) and HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rutsaert et al., 2018</xref>) using PCR is also prone to failure when employing single amplification reactions. The ability of replicate PCR reactions to overcome this limitation has been discussed in depth in PCR optimization reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>) and one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stowers et al., 2010</xref>) reported that by averaging hundreds of replicate reactions one can vastly extend the concentration range over which PCR can provide reliable detection of DNA that is in low abundance. However, the use of hundreds of replicate PCR reactions as conducted here has been rarely, if ever, used to routinely validate the presence of any infectious agent in blood.</p><p>It is well documented that <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-positive hosts give variable results in PCR tests, and this variability increases with decreasing parasites or parasite DNA in a sample. This is primarily due to subsampling error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>) and this error functions at two levels when screening blood for the presence of pathogen DNA. First, a blood sample is a subsample of the entire blood volume of a potential host; e.g. a 10-ml blood sample is ~0.2% of the total volume of blood in an average adult human. The existence of this subsampling error in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection is well illustrated by the fact that two replicate blood samples from macaques collected using the same needle stick can yield a substantial number of positive PCR reactions in one sample, and zero positive reactions in the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Simply collecting samples at different times, whether a few days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or a few months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) apart, does not necessarily solve this problem. When parasite numbers are very low, the chance that a small subsample of the total blood will contain parasite DNA is random irrespective of when it is collected. The only solution is to obtain more or larger blood samples so as to increase the chances of collecting a fragment of the parasite DNA that is in the circulation. This same subsampling error acting at the level of whole parasites was evident in the xenodiagnosis studies of Cerisola, wherein it was rare to obtain parasite-positive bugs when they fed on certain subjects who apparently had very low levels of parasites circulating in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cerisola, 1977</xref>).</p><p>A second opportunity for subsampling error under low target conditions occurs when an aliquot of the total blood DNA obtained in a blood draw is used for PCR amplification. In the case of the ~5-ml macaque blood samples used in the bulk of the assays in this study, from 1/100th to 1/250th of the total recovered DNA was used for each replicate PCR reaction. In a number of animals, the entire blood DNA sample was exhausted doing replication PCR reactions without a positive reaction while in most animals, some DNA remained after nearly 200, sometimes all negative, amplification reactions/sample. We show that fragmentation of DNA significantly decreases the subsampling error at this level, presumably by breaking the DNA containing one or more target satellite DNA regions into smaller fragments that are then more widely dispersed in the total blood DNA. DNA fragmentation led to an increased frequency of positive replicate PCR reactions and generally more consistent Cq values between these aliquots. Fragmentation increased amplification consistency and the sensitivity of the PCR protocol by one order of magnitude and should be incorporated as a standard step for amplification of satellite DNA target in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> even when deep-sampling is not used. However ultimately, the limiting factor in the consistent detection of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in blood is the total amount of blood collected and processed for fragmentation and amplification. If there is no parasite DNA in a particular sample, no amount of fragmentation or number of amplification reactions will detect it. Also, in addition to sampling errors, the inefficiency of PCR to amplify very low abundance targets, particularly among a complex DNA mixture as exists in blood (termed the Monte Carlo effect; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Karrer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bustin and Nolan, 2004</xref>) may also contribute to the failure to detect target <italic>T. cruzi</italic> DNA in some samples despite its presence.</p><p>In addition to providing much greater sensitivity for detecting active infection relative to conventional single or low replicate (2–3/sample) PCR analysis, conducting 100s of replicate PCR reactions on fragmented blood DNA also provides information on the relative abundance of parasites in the blood of infected hosts. Most implementations of PCR for <italic>T. cruzi</italic> have a limit of consistent detection of ~10<sup>–3</sup> PE/assay, which equates to ~0.5 parasites/ml of blood in our assays. Combining sample DNA fragmentation and deep-sampling extends the range of quantification to at least 10<sup>–6</sup> PE per aliquot, or ~0.00025 parasites/ml (1 parasite per 4 l) of blood.</p><p>This considerably increased sensitivity of infection detection and relative quantitation made possible through the use of deep sampling PCR reveals the previously undocumented range of parasite burden between individuals with chronic <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infections. Although best demonstrated in the frequently sampled macaques in this work, both humans and dogs also exhibit a range of parasite burdens exceeding five orders of magnitude when compared to a standard curve (e.g. from Cq values of ~25 in the highest macaque and dog fragmented samples to &lt;1% frequency of positive PCR reactions in some members of all three species). The similarity in the ranges of parasite load in the three species examined in this study again reinforces the similarities between <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection in these species and the appropriateness of dogs and NHPs as models of the human infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tarleton et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the sampling error discussed above, the variation in the number of satellite DNA repeats per genome among <italic>T. cruzi</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schijman et al., 2011</xref>) makes absolute quantitation of parasite load virtually impossible. However, such quantitation is not necessary in order to conclude that individuals with long-established <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infections control these infections to vastly different degrees. This ability to more precisely quantify parasite load should now allow investigations into the potential immune mechanisms that might be responsible for this variable control and assessment of the potential correlation between relatively stable parasite load and the chances of having or developing clinical disease – which is detected in &lt;50% of long-term infected subjects.</p><p>This study also confirms across a broader range of individuals, the relative stability of parasite load over time, an expected phenomenon that was also apparent in the xenodiagnosis studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cerisola, 1977</xref>. A surprising finding was that a subset of macaques infected for 2–3 years and presenting a relatively higher parasite burden exhibited a significant decline in parasite load over the 1-year survey period. This result suggests that immune control mechanisms not only continue to confine parasite load but can in some cases also drive that load lower over time during the chronic phase of infection. However, this is not the pattern in all individuals, as some macaques with equally short-term infections have already restricted parasite numbers to nearly undetectable levels while some with longer-term infections maintain relatively higher parasite burden. It is also noteworthy that parasite control can be quickly lost when the health status (and presumably immune status) changes, as in the case of macaque P4, similar to what is observed in humans with suppressed immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lattes and Lasala, 2014</xref>). These findings emphasize that even subjects controlling <italic>T. cruzi</italic> burden to very low levels should be considered for anti-parasite treatment as the immune control of the infection can be quickly lost.</p><p>The original goal of this study was to develop a ‘test of cure’ for use in the evaluation of clinical trials of anti-<italic>T. cruzi</italic> compounds. Previous candidate compounds used in clinical trials have failed to provide sterile cure and these failures were relatively easy to detect without a highly sensitive PCR protocol as described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tarleton, 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tarleton, 2023b</xref>). With the progression of highly promising new compounds, including one that provided 100% sterile cure in NHPs with naturally acquired <italic>T. cruzi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Padilla et al., 2022</xref>), an assay that detects success rather than only failure is needed. The combination of DNA fragmentation and deep-sampling of replicate blood samples should fulfill that need. Operationally, this would not require any special equipment but does necessitate extreme care in sample preparation and assay execution. Also, conducting hundreds of PCR reactions on the DNA from 10 or more high volume (e.g. 10 ml or greater) blood samples from each subject will be expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive. It is also worthy of note that in cases of treatment failure, the apparent abundance of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> DNA in the blood often return to pre-treatment levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Parrado et al., 2019</xref>), so selection of subjects with more readily detectable pre-treatment parasite loads for such trials would make it relatively easy to detect treatment failures and provide greater confidence that those that remain negative following deep-sampling are indeed cured.</p><p>There may also be opportunities for additional improvements in PCR-based detection of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. One of the limitations of this study is that we have so far only examined samples from a small number of human subjects. However, those samples fall into the same pattern of wide-ranging parasite loads as the macaque and dog samples so there is little reason to think that more extensive testing of human samples will reveal any surprises. Additional targets for PCR amplification have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kann et al., 2023</xref>) and could be multiplexed in a single reaction to perhaps achieve greater sensitivity. We also may not have exhausted the limits of DNA fragmentation for dispersing target DNA in a blood sample in order to further reduce subsampling errors or explored the tolerance for increased loading of fragmented DNA for each PCR reaction. Improvements in any of these areas could reduce the number of replicate PCR reactions without compromising sensitivity. Finally, new technologies such as UltraPCR, which allows for higher DNA loading, extensive multiplexing, and the generation of &gt;30 million individual PCR reaction per tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shum et al., 2022</xref>) could greatly reduce the number of replicate PCR assays that are needed for high sensitivity detection. Such developments could make the PCR-based detection of all <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-infected subjects possible, if not routine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Macaques</title><p>All NHP utilized for these studies were part of the approximately 1000-animal, Rhesus Macaque (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) Breeding and Research Resource housed at the AAALAC accredited, Michale E.

The authors aim to overcome the limitations of current qPCR methods by increasing the sensitivity of detection, which is fundamental for evaluating treatment responses in chronic Chagas disease patients. The work also evaluates the approach in multiple host species (macaques, humans, and dogs), at different times and across different sample types, including whole blood, blood cell pellets, plasma, and tissues.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The primary strength of this study lies in its methodological novelty, particularly the combination of multiple parallel PCR reactions and DNA fragmentation to enhance sensitivity. It is a sort of brute-force method for detecting the parasite. This approach promises the detection of parasitic DNA at levels significantly lower than those achievable with standard qPCR methods. Additionally, the authors demonstrate the utility of this method in tracking parasitemia dynamics and post-treatment responses in macaques and dogs, providing valuable insights for both research and clinical applications.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Methodological Concerns on detection and quantification limits</p><p>Some methodological inconsistencies and limitations were observed that merit consideration. In Figure 1, there is a clear lack of consistency with theoretical expectations and with the trends observed in Figure 4A. Based on approximate calculations, having 10^-7 parasite equivalents with 100,000 target copies per parasite implies an average of 0.01 target copies per reaction. This would suggest an amplification rate of approximately 1 in 100 reactions, yet the observed 30% amplification appears disproportionately high. In addition, Figure 4A (not fragmented) shows lower values of positivity than Figure 1 for 10^-5 and 10^-6 dilutions showing this inconsistency among experiments. Some possible explanations could account for this inconsistency: (1) an inaccurate quantification of the starting number of parasites used for serial dilutions, or (2) random contamination not detected by negative controls, potentially due to a low number of template molecules.</p><p>Similarly, Figure 5B presents another inconsistency in theoretical expectations for amplification. The authors report detecting amplification in reactions containing 10^-9 parasites after DNA fragmentation. Based on the figure, at least 3 positives (as I can see because raw data is not available) out of 388 PCRs are observed at this dilution. Assuming 100,000 copies of satellite DNA per parasite, the probability of a single copy being present in a 10^-9 dilution is approximately 1/10,000. If we assume this as the probability of amplification of a PCR (an approximation), by using a simple binomial calculation, the probability of at least 3 positive reactions out of 388 is approximately 9.39 x 10^-6 (in ideal conditions, likely lower in real-world scenarios). This translates to a probability of about 1 in 100,000 to observe such frequency of positives, which is highly improbable and suggests either inaccuracies in the initial parasite quantification or issues with contamination. In addition, at 10^-6 PE/reactions (the proposed limit of quantification) it is observed that 40% of repetitions are amplified. The number of repetitions is not specified but probably more than 50 according to the graph. Such dilution implies 0.1 targets per reaction (assuming 100.000 copies divided by 10^6), which means a total of 5 target molecules to distribute among the reactions (0.1 targets multiplied by 50 reactions). It seems highly improbable that 40% of the reactions (20/50) would amplify under the described conditions. Even considering 200.000 target copies per parasite implies 0.2 targets per reaction and an average of 10 molecules to distribute among 50 reactions. The approximate probability of the observation of at least 20/50 positives can be calculated by determining the probability of a reaction to receive targets by assuming a random distribution of the targets among the tubes, p = 1 - (1 - 1/50)^10, and then by using a binomial distribution to determine the probability that at least 20 reactions receive at least one target copy. The probability of at least 20/50 positive reactions in a dilution of 10^-6 parasites (200.000 target copies per parasite) is 0.00028. Consequently, the observed result is highly unlikely.</p><p>1. Lack of details on contamination detection</p><p>Additionally, the manuscript does not provide enough details on how cross-contamination was detected or managed. It is unclear how the negative controls (NTCs) and no-template controls were distributed across plates, in terms of both quantity and placement. This omission is critical, as the low detection thresholds targeted in this study increase the risk of false positives by contamination. To ensure reliability and reproducibility, future uses of the technique would benefit from more standardized and clearly documented protocols for control placement and handling.</p><p>1. Unclear relevance for treatment monitoring in Humans</p><p>In Figure 7A, the results suggest that the deep-sampling PCR method does not provide a clearly significant improvement over conventional qPCR in humans. Of the 9 samples tested, 6 (56%) were consistently amplified in all or nearly all reactions, indicating these samples could also be reliably detected with standard PCR protocols. Two additional samples were detected only with the deep-sampling approach, increasing sensitivity to 78%; however, these detections might be attributable to random chance given the limited sample size. While the authors acknowledge the small sample size in the discussion, they do not address the fact that a similar increase in sensitivity was reported in citation 5, where only 3 samples were tested with 3 replicates each. This raises an important question: how many PCR reactions are needed in human samples to reach a plateau in detection rates? This issue should be further discussed to contextualize the results and their implications.</p><p>Despite these limitations, this work represents a promising step forward in the development of highly sensitive diagnostic tools for T. cruzi. It offers a novel foundation for advancing the detection and monitoring of parasitemia, which could significantly benefit Chagas disease research community and clinicians focused on neglected tropical diseases. While addressing the methodological inconsistencies and improving robustness will be critical, this study provides valuable insights and data that could lead to future innovations in parasitological research and diagnostics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104547.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Brooke E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Georgia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Athens</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hodo</surname><given-names>Carolyn L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bastrop</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hamer</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Texas A&amp;M University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">College Station</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Saunders</surname><given-names>Ashley B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Texas A&amp;M University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">College Station</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Laucella</surname><given-names>Susana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hospital Interzonal General de Agudos Eva Perón</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Buenos Aires</named-content></addr-line><country>Argentina</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Daniel B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Georgia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Athens</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tarleton</surname><given-names>Rick L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Georgia</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Athens</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>[…] Strengths:</p><p>The strategies used for increasing PCR sensitivity offer the potential for enhancing treatment monitoring and understanding the dynamics of parasite-host interactions in chronic Chagas disease.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the study offers valuable insights for research in T.cruzi infection dynamics and monitoring of trypanocidal drugs efficacy, its broader adoption depends on the development of cost-effective and scalable alternatives to labor-intensive techniques such as sonication, currently required for DNA fragmentation.

Cq values of the 10-3 PE unfragmented dataset in Figure 1 (40 replicates) and Figure 4a (88 replicates) are nearly identical at 30.02 (0.5813) and 30.21 (1.071), respectively, demonstrating a highly accurate initial quantification of parasites to make these 2 separate dilution series (reviewer’s point 1.1). At this concentration of parasites in blood, and with unfragmented DNA, each aliquot for PCR has an equal chance of receiving some parasite DNA (hence all reactions are positive) and a reasonably good chance of receiving similar amounts of parasite DNA (the Cq values cluster with relatively low S.D.). However further dilutions from this parasite input result in some aliquots that receive no parasite DNA and a much wider variation in the amount of parasite DNA/aliquot in samples that are positive (Cq mean (SD) of 34.47 (2.732) for 10-4 in Figure 1). This result demonstrates that these dilution series do not follow binomial distribution as suggested by the reviewer. This is likely because each template for amplification is not independently distributed. Instead, they are known to be clustered (on individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments) in the DNA. Indeed, this observation of widely varying Cq values in dilutions below 10-3 strongly suggested this clustering and was the impetus for fragmenting the DNA (see manuscript line 209). The impact of declustering achieved by DNA fragmentation supports this conclusion when the DNA is fragmented, 100% of aliquots are positive at 10-4 PE, 10X less than in unfragmented samples, and the Cq values are tightly grouped (mean 33.47, S.D. 0.3358), indicating the unequal distribution of targets upon dilution, rather than counting, pipetting errors or contamination as responsible for the lack of a binomial distribution of targets with increasing dilution. Thus, when entities are clustered and can’t be fully declustered, a simple binomial (or Poisson) distribution of counts cannot be assumed in the serial dilutions. Clustering results in more complicated distribution patterns, and it becomes difficult to predict precisely how these clusters will distribute from one dilution to the next (and thus differences in proportions of positives in different dilution series, as observed herein).</p><p>This clustering and unequal distribution of amplification targets also addresses the reviewer’s second comment with respect to the unlikelihood of detecting at least one positive at a high dilution. If we accept the reviewer’s estimate of 100,000 copies of target per parasite, then at 10-4 PE/aliquot - a dilution at which all aliquots are PCR positive in the fragmented samples (Figures 4a and 5b) – each aliquot would be expected to have on average 10 target sequences and the chances of detecting at least one positive reaction from 400 aliquots would be respectively 98% for the 10-7 dilution, 33% for 10-8 and 4% for 10-9 PE per aliquot. These percentages would change (increase) with a higher copy number of targets per genome, and if the targets are still clustered to some degree (which we would expect they would be even in the fragmented DNA). Thus, the chances of detecting positive PCRs at 10-9 PE is low, but it is not “highly improbable”.</p><p>Taking the reviewer’s second example of the frequency of positive reactions at 10-6 PE and the assumption of 200,000 target copies per genome (referring to Fig 5B, we believe), the mean template copies per aliquot would be 0.2 at this dilution. Assuming a negative binomial distribution of the still clustered templates (although mechanically fragmented, it would be highly unlikely that they would be completely declustered), then the probability of an aliquot being positive at the 10-6 PE dilution would be 16.7%. Our results in Figure 4A (26%) and Figure 5B (37.5%) are slightly higher but not “highly unlikely” as suggested.</p><p>We do not know the target copy number in the parasites used to make these serial dilution profiles herein but that is certainly different from the copy number in the parasites infecting each of the hosts from which we have analyzed blood. Thus, we do not propose that this assay can quantify the absolute parasite burden in a host nor do we see a benefit in trying to do so (see paragraph beginning line 384). Such quantification requires assumptions about not only the target copy number in the parasites in a host, but also that fragmentation is 100% efficient, and particularly, that a single or multiple blood samples accurately reflects the whole host parasite burden (clearly shown not to be the case with the data from serial bleeds presented in Figures 3 and 5). But we standby the conclusion that deep-sampling PCR when employed as presented herein, gives an accurate assessment of the presence of infection and relative parasite burden differences between hosts, and in the same hosts over time or under treatment and that the results presented are not compromised by inaccuracies in quantifying parasites for spiked samples or by sample contamination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lack of details on contamination detection</p><p>Additionally, the manuscript does not provide enough details on how cross-contamination was detected or managed. It is unclear how the negative controls (NTCs) and no-template controls were distributed across plates, in terms of both quantity and placement. This omission is critical, as the low detection thresholds targeted in this study increase the risk of false positives by contamination. To ensure reliability and reproducibility, future uses of the technique would benefit from more standardized and clearly documented protocols for control placement and handling.</p></disp-quote><p>We present a section in the Materials and Methods on preventing contamination and a case example when these precautions failed when preparing the dilution standards containing very high numbers of parasites. Directly responding to the reviewer, sixteen no template controls were included in every 384 well assay plate and we never obtained amplification products from those reactions. Additionally, as noted in the manuscript, uninfected macaques were negative on a collective &gt;15,000 PCR reactions.</p><p>We understand the concern about contamination but we believe that we have taken the appropriate precautions and our data fully support that the positives we detect are real positives, not contaminations. It would be reckless to depend on a single positive PCR reaction out of hundreds to conclude that a host is infected; multiple samples must be obtained and analyzed to be certain in such cases, as we show exhaustively with the NHP samples here.</p><p>Rather than adding additional technical protocols such as plate layouts to this manuscript, we believe publishing a STAR Protocol or a similar detailed, step-by-step method paper would be more useful and that is our plan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Unclear relevance for treatment monitoring in Humans</p><p>In Figure 7A, the results suggest that the deep-sampling PCR method does not provide a clearly significant improvement over conventional qPCR in humans. Of the 9 samples tested, 6 (56%) were consistently amplified in all or nearly all reactions, indicating these samples could also be reliably detected with standard PCR protocols. Two additional samples were detected only with the deep-sampling approach, increasing sensitivity to 78%; however, these detections might be attributable to random chance given the limited sample size. While the authors acknowledge the small sample size in the discussion, they do not address the fact that a similar increase in sensitivity was reported in citation 5, where only 3 samples were tested with 3 replicates each. This raises an important question: how many PCR reactions are needed in human samples to reach a plateau in detection rates? This issue should be further discussed to contextualize the results and their implications.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer’s conclusion here. First, it is not known how the “conventional” PCR would have performed in the human samples used herein as this was not done. However, it is very likely that it would have performed significantly worse for the following reasons. “Conventional” PCR for T. cruzi has a number of variations, but the most common approach is to mix whole blood 1:1 with a guanidine:EDTA solution, and then extract DNA for PCR from 100-300 ul of this mix. Thus, at best, one has the equivalent of 150 ul of blood that is being analyzed for the presence of T. cruzi DNA. In contrast, in the protocol described herein, we extract DNA from ~5 ml of blood and use aliquots from that DNA for PCR. Thus, even before fragmenting or deep-sampling, the approach described herein is sampling 33X more blood that the conventional protocol, thus likely increasing by over 30-fold the chances of detecting parasite DNA in blood from an infected subject. The smaller the volume of blood sampled as well as the number of samples obtained greatly impact the ability to detect T. cruzi infection in some hosts. This is clearly demonstrated in the extensive screening done in NHPs in this study and there is no reason to believe that the situation will be different in humans and dogs. So the relevance of these enhancements are clear for any host with T. cruzi infection; humans are not unique in this regard.</p><p>We don’t believe there will be a “plateau in detection rates”; individuals are either infected or not and the ability to detect that infection (whether with T. cruzi or any other pathogen) depends on the sensitivity of the test and the quantity of the sample available to be screened. Perhaps what is being asked is ‘how many PCR reactions have to be performed to be sure that someone is NOT infected?’. There is not a discrete answer to this and related questions, but by making some assumptions, one can make some estimates. The approach described herein is approaching single copy target detection and if this is true then one would need to PCR amplify ALL of the DNA from a blood sample to assure detection of that single template copy (so for a 200ug of DNA one might obtain from 5-10 ml of blood, 1600 PCR reactions of 125 ng each; 95% and 99% confidence could be obtained with 1520 and 1584 PCRs, respectively). But any conclusion from this testing applies only to that individual blood sample and we show clearly in the NHP studies that multiple samples have to be analyzed to detect parasite DNA in hosts with very low parasite burden – some samples contain parasite DNA and others do not. Thus hundreds of negative PCRs from a single or even multiple samples is unfortunately not definitive.</p><p>Such limitations exist for detection of any pathogen. A more important question for the future may be ‘is there a level of infection below which the risk of disease development is sufficiently low as to not be of concern clinically?’. Such is the standard in drug-controlled HIV infections, for example. The improvements we document in this work provides the means to answer such questions and additional improvements may be possible as well. But to be absolutely certain that a host is not infected by <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, one would have to sample some subjects (likely a small minority of the entire pool) multiple times and perform 1000’s of PCR reactions – as we done for the most difficult to detect macaques in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite these limitations, this work represents a promising step forward in the development of highly sensitive diagnostic tools for <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. It offers a novel foundation for advancing the detection and monitoring of parasitemia, which could significantly benefit Chagas disease research community and clinicians focused on neglected tropical diseases. While addressing the methodological inconsistencies and improving robustness will be critical, this study provides valuable insights and data that could lead to future innovations in parasitological research and diagnostics.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in detail above, we do not agree that this study has any methodological inconsistencies nor that it lacks robustness.</p></body></sub-article></article>
