Inflammasome-mediated inflammatory cytokines are crucial for host defense against bacterial infections. We found that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection activates the non-canonical inflammasome in macrophages, yet it inhibits the downstream activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The VgrG2b of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is recognized and cleaved by caspase-11, generating a free C-terminal fragment. The VgrG2b C-terminus can bind to NLRP3, inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by rejecting NEK7 binding to NLRP3. Administration of a specific peptide that inhibits caspase-11 cleavage of VgrG2b significantly improves mouse survival during infection. Our discovery elucidates a mechanism by which <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> inhibits host immune response, providing a new approach for the future clinical treatment of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The non-canonical inflammasomes, consisting of murine caspase-11 or human caspase-4/5, recognize bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hagar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayagaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). Once activated, non-canonical inflammasomes induce the maturation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) to form pores on cell and mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). It also activates the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rathinam et al., 2019</xref>). NLRP3 is a key intracellular receptor that responds to a range of endogenous and exogenous stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnett et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christgen et al., 2020</xref>). NLRP3 recruits NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) and undergoes polymerization, inducing the activation of caspase-1 and maturation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnett et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2016</xref>). Non-canonical inflammasomes promote the assembly and final activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through activating the nuclear orphan receptor NUR77 with the help of LPS and mitochondrial dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium widely distributed in the environment, which can cause acute and chronic infections in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cendra and Torrents, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> employs multiple secretion systems to release virulence factors into the extracellular environment or host cells, facilitating its survival and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>). Among them, the type III secretion system (T3SS) and the type VI secretion system (T6SS) are two important secretion systems that play important roles in acute and chronic infections of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Faure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goodman et al., 2004</xref>). T3SS can directly inject effector proteins into target cells to alter their function or cause target cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hauser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qin et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> encodes three different T6SSs, namely Hcp secretion island-I (H1)-T6SS, H2-T6SS, and H3-T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hachani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mougous et al., 2006</xref>). These T6SSs play a crucial role in biofilm formation, competition between bacteria, and toxicity to host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2014</xref>). H1-T6SS only targets bacteria and is used for competition between bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hood et al., 2010</xref>). H2-T6SS and H3-T6SS are involved in interactions between bacteria and host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Russell et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The effector proteins of H2-T6SS can target both bacteria and eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). T6SS is composed of structural proteins and virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2014</xref>). Structural proteins such as hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp), valine–glycine repeat protein G (VgrG), and proline–alanine–alanine–arginine repeats (PAAR) form a stable spike-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leiman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shneider et al., 2013</xref>). Toxic factors are transported to the extracellular space through T6SS, thereby exerting toxic effects on other bacteria or host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qin et al., 2022</xref>). VgrG2b is an important component of T6SS, which usually binds tightly to other components of T6SS such as the Hcp protein, together forming the core component of the secretion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sana et al., 2015</xref>). The VgrG2b protein has a special structure for recognizing and binding effector proteins, which are transported to the tip of the secretion system and injected into the target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durand et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sana et al., 2015</xref>). VgrG2b, upon entering eukaryotic cells, can also modulate host cell biology by interacting with cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sana et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wood et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we found that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection activates caspase-11 but inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in macrophages. The VgrG2b entering the host cell is recognized and cleaved by caspase-11 to generate a free C-terminal fragment. This fragment can bind to NLRP3 and inhibit its binding to NEK7, thereby preventing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This inhibitory effect by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> effectively prevents further host immune activation and plays a crucial role in establishing bacterial infection. Our findings may provide a new perspective for the treatment of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infections in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> causes abnormal signaling of non-canonical inflammasome</title><p>Non-canonical inflammasomes are activated during the infection of Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balakrishnan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kayagaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rathinam et al., 2019</xref>). Obstruction of the inflammasome pathway can lead to chronic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Phuong et al., 2021</xref>). To investigate whether T6SS of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> modulated the non-canonical inflammasome pathway to establish chronic infections, we used an <italic>RetS</italic> mutant strain that specifically expresses T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allsopp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goodman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2019</xref>). As an extracellular bacterial, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> synthesizes outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to induce non-canonical inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deo et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore added <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and OMVs to macrophages in vitro to simulate the real situation of infection in vivo as much as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esoda and Kuehn, 2019</xref>). We found that activation of caspase-11 and cleavage of GSDMD in bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cells were not affected after incubation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and OMVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). However, activation of caspase-1 was significantly inhibited in cells infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

One was that the NLRP3 inflammasome lacked necessary stimuli for activation, and the other was that the NLRP3 inflammasome was inhibited by a bacterial substance. After the activation of caspase-11, GSDMD pores can be detected in mitochondrial membranes, causing the release of mtDNA and ROS which amplify NLRP3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xian et al., 2022</xref>). We first detected the localization of GSDMD N-terminus on the mitochondrial membrane during <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection. The results indicate that GSDMD-N can be normally localized on the mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In addition, the release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm was not affected by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The binding of NUR77 and NLRP3 was not affected during the infection of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, the binding of NLRP3 to NEK7 was significantly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). These data suggest that the inhibition of NLRP3 is potentially influenced by a certain inhibitory factor from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>To verify this, we introduced LPS and mitochondrial DNA into macrophages to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation, bypassing the caspase-11-GSDMD prerequisite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). To avoid the activation of the AIM2 inflammasome by mitochondrial DNA, we conducted the following experiments under an <italic>Aim2</italic> knockout background. We found that after introducing LPS and mitochondrial DNA, NLRP3 inflammasomes were activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, NLRP3 activation was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and the secretion of IL-1β was tremendously inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) after incubation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The percentage of cells undergoing pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and the cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) did not change due to infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. This was consistent with previous reports suggesting that GSDMD cleavage by caspase-11, rather than subsequent GSDMD cleavage by NLRP3, is the main factor causing cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kayagaki et al., 2011</xref>). Next, we used <italic>Gsdmd</italic> and <italic>Aim2</italic> double knockout cells to detect the effect of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We found that after <italic>Gsdmd</italic> knockout, the NLRP3 inflammasome became active when LPS and mitochondrial DNA were introduced into macrophages. However, NLRP3 was still inhibited after incubation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). The secretion of IL-1β was also inhibited due to <italic>Gsdmd</italic> deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). The cell death rate was low due to the absence of GSDMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>), while the percentage of viable cells was relatively high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L</xref>). These results suggest that potent inhibitory factors of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> may act upstream of GSDMD. Therefore, we conducted infection experiments using <italic>Casp11</italic> and <italic>Aim2</italic> double knockout cells. After incubation with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). The secretion of IL-1β was no longer inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). And the cell death rate was high due to the processing of GSDMD by activated caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>), while the survival rate was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). These data indicate that the inhibitory factors of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> requires caspase-11 to take effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Caspase-11 cleaves VgrG2b of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic></title><p>In order to search for potential substrates of caspase-11 in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we designed a systematic screening system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Subsequently, the plasmid encoding caspase-11 was transfected into cells, and cells with disappearance of green signal on mitochondria were selected.

Co-immunoprecipitation results showed that VgrG2b bound to the p22/p10 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). VgrG2b also bound to the p22/p10 complex of mutant human caspase-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results suggest that VgrG2b can indeed be recognized by caspase-11/4. Based on the size of the cleaved VgrG2b fragment, we speculated that the cleavage site should be at its C-terminus. We constructed mutant plasmids carrying aspartic acid substitutions for VgrG2b and found that only the D883A mutant was no longer cleaved by caspase-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also verified that this VgrG2b mutant could not be cleaved by human caspase-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Meanwhile, we constructed a chimeric protein containing VgrG2a N-terminus, a linker sequence around D883 and VgrG2b C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This chimeric protein could be cleaved by caspase-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Another chimeric protein containing VgrG2b N-terminus, a linker sequence around D883 and GFP cannot be cleaved by caspase-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Based on the substrate cleavage characteristic of caspase-11 that it needs to bind the target first to mediate cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), we speculated that the VgrG2b C-terminus was the site where VgrG2b bound to caspase-11.

Here, we have found that VgrG2b is not only responsible for the delivery of bacterial virulence proteins, but it can also serve as a virulence factor on its own.

The process of substrate cleavage by inflammatory caspases can be divided into two parts. Firstly, inflammatory caspases bind to a part of the substrate, which is often not their cleavage site, and the other is the recognition of the true site of their cleavage. This mechanism ensures that limited proteins are cleaved by host cells when inflammasomes are activated, thereby confining the severity of the inflammatory response. Here, we found that caspase-11/4 specifically cleaves the structural proteins of the secretion system of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and the generated new fragments can play an inhibitory role. This is a new way for pathogenic microorganisms to hijack the host’s immune system. Because traditional hijacking usually directly affects the host immune system without cutting. It is very effective for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> using VgrG2b fragment to inhibit NLRP3.

In realizing that the suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome is Caspase-11 dependent, the authors performed a screening among P. aeruginosa proteins and identified VgrG2b being a major substrate of Caspase-11 (Figure 2). Next, the authors mapped the cleavage site on VgrG2b to D883, and demonstrated that cleavage of VgrG2b by Caspase-11 is essential for the suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Figure 3). Furthermore, they found that a binding between the C-terminal fragment of the cleaved VgrG2b and NLRP3 existed (Figure 4), which was then proved to block the association of NLRP3 with NEK7 (Figure 5). Finally, the authors demonstrated that blocking of VgrG2b cleavage, by either mutation of the D883 or administration of a designed peptide, effectively improved the survival rate of the P. aeruginosa-infected mice (Figure 6). This is a well-designed and executed study, with the results clearly presented and stated.</p></disp-quote><p>We are deeply grateful for your recognition and positive comments on our article.

The detailed responses are listed point-by-point below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I really enjoyed reading your manuscript and believe this is an important conceptual advance for the innate immunity field. Your conclusions are in general well-supported, you used a range of methodologies and the quality of the presentation of the results is excellent. I have a few comments here that I hope will contribute to improving an already great piece of work:</p><p>Elements to be improved:</p><p>Line 109-110: the author claims that the release of mito DNA is required for NLRP3 activation. ' I would support this with a reference. I believe this may not be fully agreed on in the field. Cleavage of GSDMD by caspase4/11 is required, however. A few groups showed the required for K+ efflux in this context (Broz, Brough, Schroder labs).</p></disp-quote><p>It is a very good suggestion. Indeed, there is still controversy over this issue, and we have revised our text to make our manuscript more neutral. We have also cited these important references to help readers understand where the controversy lies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I disagree that OMV _+ Pseudomonas is a natural way to simulate natural infection. I would argue it is even quite artificial. Pseudomonas alone should be sufficient to generate OMV without the addition of extra OMVs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. Before we infected BMDM cells with PAO1 stains, we had washed with PBS for at least three times to exclude the interference of contents in the LB medium. Moreover, in our experimental system, the time for co-incubation between bacteria and host cells is very limited. During this time, the amount of OMV secreted by bacteria may not reach the level of activating inflammasomes, and this concentration is also relatively low compared to the OMV concentration secreted by bacteria under physiological conditions. Therefore, we added extra OMVs to simulate the chronic infection condition in a short time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The co-expression of caspase with VrG2b and assume the cleavage is direct. However, the work is lacking work with recombinant proteases (commercially available), which would strengthen their conclusions regarding the ability of caspase-4/11 to directly cleave the protein. Based on the recognised sequence (DXXD), I believe caspase-4/11 is not directly responsible for this. These caspases were shown to cleave caspase-3/7, which can cleave such sequence (DXXX). As caspase-4 can cleave caspase-3/7 in their lysates, I would recommend testing this hypothesis to further strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>These are very good points. As data shown on Fig. 3F, we used recombinant VgrG2b and caspase-11 p22/p10 to prove the direct cleavage of caspase-11. To exclude the effect of caspase-3/7, we treated cells with inhibitors of caspase-3/7 and found that caspase-3/7 are not the executor for VgrG2b cleavage (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The affinity between caspase-11 and VgrG2b-C is puzzling as one would normally expect the caspase and its substrates to quickly dissociate. Does VgrG2b-C impact the activity of caspase-4/11 upon cleavage? Can VrgG2b-C also interact with p20/p10 caspase-1? I believe the authors only tried the full-length version of caspase-1 in supplemental.</p></disp-quote><p>These are very good questions. We agree enzymes and substrates only have temporary interactions normally, which are not easy to catch. However, we used mutant caspase-11(C254A) inhibiting its cleavage of substrates, so that the combination of VgrG2b or VgrG2b-C with caspase-11(C254A) could be detected. This mutation is frequently used in immunoprecipitation (Wang K, Cell, 2020). We had tested the impact of VgrG2b-C on the enzyme activity of caspase-4/11, and showed that VgrG2b-C did not affect the cleavage of GSDMD by caspase-11 (Figure 5C). We also tried the caspase-1 p20/p10, also found that they had no interaction with VgrG2b-C (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can more details be provided about the generation of recombinant caspase-11, VgrG2b-C, and other recombinant proteins tested?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion, we have revised our description in the new version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors assumed that VgrG2C-b does not impact other inflammasome (such as NLRC4) based on their X-gal assay. I would also confirm this with a functional assay (e.g., transfection of flagellin in macrophages).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. We have tested the impact of VgrG2b-C on NLRC4 inflammasome and found that VgrG2b-C does not affect NLRC4 activation with the transfection of flagellin (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Often, representative experiments are shown. For Elisa, cell death assays and quantitative experiments, pooling the data would be appropriate. Appropriate statistical analysis should be conducted based on this as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. In the revised manuscript, we pooled the data of three independent experiments for our analysis of ELISA and cell death assays. We also added descriptions of statistical analysis in our revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>VgrG2b has been suggested to be a metalloprotease (PMID: 31577948). Is its protease activity required for the phenomenon observed?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good question. The active region of metalloprotease VgrG2b-C is aa932-941, especially the core sequence of HEXXH. Structure data also confirms that H935, E936, H939, E983 play key roles in the coordination with Zn ions (Sana TG, mBio, 2015; Wood TE, Cell reports, 2019). In our study, the cleavage of VgrG2b by caspase-4/11 depends on the recognition of tetrapeptide sequence in aa880-883. We added data showing that the cleavage of VgrG2b and the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome were not affected by VgrG2b enzymatic activity (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1I-K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the affinity of VgrG2b-C for NLRP3? Is it higher than NEK7? A quantitative experiment would be required to claim this.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point of view. We added the quantitative data certifying that VgrG2b-C has higher affinity with NLRP3 compared with NEK7 in the revised manuscript (326 nM VS 681 nM).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Material and Method section is a bit light and would benefit from adding more information (e.g. cell density, microscopy details, number of cells imaged, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We have added more details in the Material and Method section in revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
