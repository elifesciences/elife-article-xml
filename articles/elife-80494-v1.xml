(AS) has been attributed to estrogen deficiency. However, the beneficial effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is lost in late postmenopausal women with atherogenesis. We asked whether aging-related iron accumulation affects estrogen receptor α (ERα) expression, thus explaining HRT inefficacy. A negative correlation has been observed between aging-related systemic iron deposition and ERα expression in postmenopausal AS patients. In an ovariectomized <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model, estradiol treatment had contrasting effects on ERα expression in early versus late postmenopausal mice. ERα expression was inhibited by iron treatment in cell culture and iron-overloaded mice. Combined treatment with estradiol and iron further decreased ERα expression, and the latter effect was mediated by iron-regulated E3 ligase Mdm2. In line with these observations, cellular cholesterol efflux was reduced, and endothelial homeostasis was disrupted. Consequently, AS was aggravated. Accordingly, systemic iron chelation attenuated estradiol-triggered progressive AS in late postmenopausal mice. Thus, iron and estradiol together downregulate ERα through Mdm2-mediated proteolysis, providing a potential explanation for failures of HRT in late postmenopausal subjects with aging-related iron accumulation. This study suggests that immediate HRT after menopause, along with appropriate iron chelation, might provide benefits from AS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Atherosclerosis</kwd><kwd>iron metabolism</kwd><kwd>post menopause</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor α</kwd><kwd>hormone replacement therapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32271221</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Kuanyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81870348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiao</surname><given-names>Tong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Post-menopausal women with atherosclerosis need to take the correct timing for hormone replacement therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease-associated deaths worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moss et al., 2019</xref>). It has been well recognized that postmenopausal women confront an increasing risk of AS owing to estrogen deficiency and disturbance of the estrogen receptor (ER) regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moss et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the therapeutic effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) remains controversial. The Women’s Health Initiative and the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study reported that the atheroprotective effect of HRT in late postmenopausal women (commonly ages over 65) is lost or even worsened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hlatky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rocca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rossouw et al., 2002</xref>). The underlying mechanism may be triggered by aging, which reduces the protection afforded by estrogen, particularly estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>In general, the atheroprotective effect of estrogen is attributed to its interaction with estrogen receptor α (ERα), which participates in foam cell formation and vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy, 2011</xref>). ERα deletion is reported to induce adiposity and increase atherosclerotic lesion size since the promoters of lipid metabolism-related genes, such as <italic>Tgm2</italic>, <italic>Apoe,</italic> and <italic>Abca1</italic>, contain ERα-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ribas et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, estrogen binds to ERα tethered to the plasma membrane, which can stimulate vasodilatation via an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gavin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Teoh et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, VEGF promotes angiogenesis and is transcriptionally regulated by the E<sub>2</sub>-ERα complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2018</xref>). ERα expression decreases after menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gavin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting the critical role of ERα in blood vessel function in healthy pre- and postmenopausal women. Despite the above, few studies have focused on the regulation of ERα in postmenopausal women on HRT.</p><p>Upon binding, estrogen functions as an ERα activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lung et al., 2020</xref>) and initiates ERα dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. Estrogen treatment in vitro leads to a marked increase in <italic>Esr1</italic> (gene that encodes ERα) mRNA through the binding of the E<sub>2</sub>-ERα complex to estrogen-responsive elements (EREs) in the promoter region of <italic>Esr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinzone et al., 2004</xref>). Estrogen binding to ERα also rapidly stimulates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinzone et al., 2004</xref>). Ubiquitination-dependent ERα cycling on and off the ERE promoter sites to activate or prevent target gene transcription depends on the presence of estrogen at an adequate concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou and Slingerland, 2014</xref>). Ubiquitin ligases that have been implicated in ERα regulation include BRCA1, MDM2, SKP1–CUL1–F-box S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SCF<sup>SKP2</sup>), and E6-associated protein (E6AP), all of which promote estrogen-induced transcriptional activity with cell-type selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou and Slingerland, 2014</xref>). Of these, MDM2 is a single-subunit RING finger E3 protein, which does not always inversely correlate with ERα levels in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duong et al., 2007</xref>). The relationship between MDM2 and ERα in other contexts and cell types remains elusive.</p><p>Estrogen also regulates systemic iron homeostasis through hepcidin, an antimicrobial peptide of 25 amino acids that mediates endocytosis and degradation of the ferrous iron exporter ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nemeth et al., 2004</xref>). The dimeric E<sub>2</sub>-ERα complex binds to an ERE site within the promoter of the hepcidin gene (<italic>Hamp</italic>) to inhibit its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, E<sub>2</sub> elevates circulating iron to compensate for blood loss during menstruation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badenhorst et al., 2021</xref>). However, E<sub>2</sub> declines by &gt;90% after menopause, while systemic iron content increases slowly by steady iron uptake over the years. Serum ferritin in postmenopausal women increased by 2–3 times compared with premenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). We and others have previously reported that iron overload is a risk factor for atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vinchi et al., 2020</xref>). Our study relied on the proatherogenic <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model, which can be manipulated genetically to cause iron overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai et al., 2020</xref>). We aimed to investigate the impact of aging-related iron accumulation on the therapeutic effect of HRT on AS and explore the underlying mechanisms. First, we corroborated on a new cohort of postmenopausal AS patients that a negative correlation exists between high concentrations of serum-iron and -ferritin and low expression of lesion ERα. We hypothesized that gradual iron accumulation in postmenopausal women could explain poor HRT efficacy when applied late. We used <italic>Apoe</italic> aging female mice or ovariectomized (OVX) young mice as estrogen-deficient AS models to examine ERα expression following HRT therapy and the genetic iron-overload in <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background (<italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Fpn1<sup>Lyz2/Lyz2</sup></italic>) to address the relation of iron metabolism and HRT efficacy. We found that ERα expression responded positively to E2 administration under low or normal iron conditions but negatively under high iron conditions. Our results offer a potential solution to the riddle of HRT outcomes in early and late postmenopausal women since only the latter group shows accelerated ERα proteolysis through iron-mediated upregulation of <italic>Mdm2</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ERα protein abundance correlates inversely with systemic and local plaque iron content in the tested aging postmenopausal women with AS</title><p>To build the link between iron content and ERα levels in different postmenopausal stages, we collected 8 plaques and 20 blood samples from postmenopausal AS patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), divided a half into early (55–65 years old, n = 4/10, plaque/blood samples) and another half into late (&gt;66 years old, n = 4/10) postmenopausal groups (EPM and LPM), respectively.

Although E<sub>2</sub> administration in the EPM significantly reduced plaque formation and mouse weight, it remarkably promoted atherosclerotic development and weight gain in late application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), exactly as observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hlatky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rossouw et al., 2002</xref>). We then detected aortic ERα expression to evaluate whether ERα was responsive to E<sub>2</sub> treatment. The results showed markedly lower ERα protein levels in the LPM mice than in the EPM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). More strikingly, ERα expression was further reduced in LPM mice after E<sub>2</sub> treatment but remained constantly high in EPM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It has been reported that ERα protects against atherosclerosis by promoting lipid efflux and endothelial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, we assessed three ERα downstream proteins, ABCA1, a lipid exporter whose gene promoter is predicted to have ERE, VEGF, an activator of angiogenesis, and eNOS, a modulator of vasoconstriction and vascular repair. They were all positively correlated with ERα expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Macrophage-derived foam cell formation is crucial in the development of atherogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). We, therefore, isolated peritoneal macrophages from early and late OVX mice after E2 treatment and found that ABCA1 expression responded to E<sub>2</sub> treatment similarly as observed in aortic tissue, with no change in ERα and VEGF, but keeping at high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

However, epidemiological studies of the Women’s Health Initiative questioned the beneficial effects of late postmenopausal HRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hlatky et al., 2002</xref>). One hypothesis to explain the lack of beneficial effects of late postmenopausal HRT is that iron potentiates the adverse effects of estrogen in AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sullivan, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sullivan, 2003</xref>); however, a comprehensive in vivo study to test this hypothesis was missing.

The present study provides the first experimental evidence that iron overload facilitates ERα proteolysis, which is potentiated in the presence of E<sub>2</sub> and reverses the anti-atherogenic effect of E<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our results support the benefit of early application of estrogen postmenopause. We propose that the combination of HRT and iron restriction therapy might be a long-term strategy for the preventive effects of E<sub>2</sub> from the development of AS in postmenopausal women.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic model for the effects of postmenopausal iron accumulation with or without hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on atherosclerosis (AS) severity through modulating estrogen receptor α (ERα) expression.</title><p>Iron accumulation occurs naturally and gradually after menopause. In early postmenopausal (EPM), iron retention was mild, and ERα was responsive to HRT application to achieve protective effects. However, when iron overload is significant in late postmenopausal (LPM), Mdm2 is upregulated along with ERα downregulation. This negative correlation is potentiated by the application of HRT and iron accumulation with aging. Therefore, HRT use avails to aggravate the progression of AS in the LPM period. Iron chelation, however, reverses the adverse effect of HRT and attenuates the accelerated development of AS, suggesting a protective role of appropriate iron restriction in the LPM stage.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80494-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The controversy of whether or not to proceed with HRT in postmenopausal women is fueled by an increased, although small, risk of breast cancer and the potentially harmful effect on cardiovascular outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lobo, 2017</xref>). Previous randomized trials did not consider the ages sorting out EPM from LPM and have not excluded subjects with iron depletion or loss in the recruited postmenopausal subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sullivan, 2003</xref>). We sorted the recruited female AS volunteers from the Department of Vascular Surgery of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital as EPM and LPM groups to reveal whether aging-associated iron deposition correlates with ERα expression. The negative correlation between age-related systemic iron status and intraplaque ERα expression was proposed, which prompted us to address the role of iron in ERα expression. However, the inverse relationship between iron and ERα levels needs to be further studied.</p><p>Previous efforts focused more on the role of estrogen in iron metabolism (primarily the hepcidin/Fpn axis) rather than vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ikeda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Both genes encoding hepcidin and Fpn are inhibited by E<sub>2</sub> treatment through an ERE binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). However, it was also reported that hepcidin expression decreased in the livers of OVX mice through a GPR30-BMP6-dependent mechanism, independent of the ERE-mediated E<sub>2</sub>-ERα pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ikeda et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the difference in hepcidin expression in OVX mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gavin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ikeda et al., 2012</xref>), the rest of the observations consistent with the present study are that aging, OVX, and genetic manipulation of Fpn induced progressive iron retention in tissues, accompanied by reduced ERα expression. E<sub>2</sub> administration further enhanced this reduction in ERα levels under the conditions mentioned above. Overall, high ERα levels are found in reproductive women, despite fluctuations caused by the periodic estrogen wave and blood loss in reproductive women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gavin et al., 2009</xref>). The aging process, particularly in late postmenopausal women, progressively elevates iron levels and downregulates ERα, resulting in insufficient ERα to respond to E<sub>2</sub> treatment. E<sub>2</sub> treatment makes LPM mice gain weight with increased serum total cholesterol and triglyceride. Therefore, HRT is unlikely to result in an effective outcome in LPM women as in EPM women unless coupled with an iron-chelating scheme. This failure is because aggravated AS in LPM women is, at least partially, the result of age-related iron accumulation. We demonstrated the effectiveness of iron chelation in improving HRT outcomes in the mouse model, but further work is required to translate this finding for clinical practice.</p><p>ERα is the main effector of estrogen on cardiovascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aryan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meng et al., 2021</xref>). Though the negative correlation between ERα and iron levels needs to be substantiated in a larger cohort, we wondered how iron downregulated ERα. Since several E3 ubiquitin ligases (i.e., CHIP, E6AP, BRCA1, BARD1, SKP2, and Mdm2) have been found to catalyze the covalent binding of ubiquitin to lysine residues of ERα (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tecalco-Cruz and Ramírez-Jarquín, 2017</xref>), we tested and found that Mdm2 is responsive to iron treatment in cells and mice and negatively correlated with ERα, particularly under high iron conditions. Furthermore, we showed that Mdm2 is a negative regulator of ERα.</p><p>Our findings may be context specific, as some differences are noted in other cancer cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dongiovanni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Mdm2 acts as a ubiquitin ligase E3 to p53 in SV40 hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Honda et al., 1997</xref>) and has been shown to act as a direct coactivator of ERα function in ERα-positive breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saji et al., 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, iron-dependent downregulation was revealed in leukemia cell lines and primary human cells derived from acute myeloid leukemia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calabrese et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting a cell-type-specific regulation of Mdm2 by iron. In our study, the upregulation of Mdm2 by E<sub>2</sub> occurred in the context of iron overload both in vivo and in vitro, concluding that Mdm2 is the critical mediator that participates in iron overload triggered ERα loss. One limitation in this study is that we have not figured out the mechanism by which aging and the combination of iron and E<sub>2</sub> favor Mdm2 expression.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates the impact of iron overload in E<sub>2</sub>-mediated ERα proteolysis and its critical consequence on the outcome of HRT in the mouse model. With the efficacy of HRT challenged by ‘the window of opportunity’ theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yesufu et al., 2007</xref>), it would be vital to explore therapies that maintain ERα expression mediating the protective effects of estrogen. This study suggests that immediate HRT after menopause along with appropriate iron chelation might provide benefits from atherosclerosis. Our findings might also be applicable to other age and ERα-related postmenopausal diseases, such as osteoporosis. Additional studies are needed to validate these findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants in this study included 20 postmenopausal (at least 1 y since menopause, without HRT) AS patients aged 54–84 y, recruited from the Vascular Surgery Department, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University Medical School (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The statement of higher serum iron in LPM versus EMP needs to be substantiated and the differences between serum iron, ferritin, and tissue iron need to be made more clear. Hepcidin levels would be of interest as well.</p><p>2) How do the authors explain the iron-dependent effect of E2 on increasing atherosclerosis in the macrophage FPN KO ApoE KO mice since E2 appears to restore tissue iron and serum iron back towards more normal levels.</p><p>3) Please check all statistical tests performed especially as they relate to reviewer #1 question 9.</p><p>4) Please check the comments of review 1 regarding Figure 6--DFP-only group (ie, without the E2)? Does DFP treatment of ApoE mice post OVX prevent the reduced ERalpha expression associated with LMP?</p><p>5) Clarification of human data shown in Figure 1 is needed and thorough check of confounders is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In Figure 1B, can the authors explain why the LPM group has both higher serum iron and tissue iron? Can the authors point to a reference showing higher serum iron in LPM vs EPM? Measure of hepcidin levels would be of interest here as, higher hepcidin levels in the LPM group would explain the high tissue iron/ferritin, but would be expected to lead to lower serum iron levels.</p><p>2) In Figure 1E, Ferritin (Ft-L) levels are highly variable among the LPM group. The authors mentioned that the western blot samples in Figure 1E are the same as in figure 1A. However, Ft-L levels measured by IHC in sample P6 and P7 are similar but there are large differences in the Ft-L levels in sample P6 and P7 shown by western blot. Could the authors please explain the reason for this variability across the two techniques.</p><p>3) Line 288- Plaque ER expression was lower in LPM as compared to EPM. Please correct the words.</p><p>4) The correlation in Figure 1F is limited by sample size as well as batch effect (ie, the correlation does not exist within the LPM group or within the EPM group?) and should be removed.</p><p>5) In Figure 2E in the macrophages, a Western Blot of FPN1 should be included.</p><p>6) This sentence needs further clarification: &quot;Ferritin was reduced in response to E2 treatment in the EPM stage (this appears to be only true in macrophages). In contrast, ferritin remained high in the late stage after E2 treatment in both aortae and isolated macrophages (Figure 2D and 2E), which could be explained by the response of Fpn1 expression (clarify this statement) that was decreased in the EPM stage but not in the LPM stage.&quot;</p><p>7) In Figure 3, how do the authors explain the iron-dependent effect of E2 on increasing atherosclerosis in the macrophage FPN KO ApoE KO mice since E2 appears to restore tissue iron and serum iron back towards more normal levels (ie, closer to the ApoE KO mice)? An ApoE + E2 control would also have been helpful here.</p><p>8) In Figure 3, the authors should provide a Western Blot for FPN showing the efficacy of the Cre-Lox model, particularly at the two ages.</p><p>9) The graphs depicted in Figures 4A and 4B have large error bars that intersect, making the conclusion that E2 and iron intersect to regulate ERalpha expression less convincing. Did the authors perform a 2-way ANOVA? What was the p-value for E2? What was the interaction p-value? Clearly, FAC alone decreases ERalpha expression substantially, so why do the authors think it is E2-dependent?</p><p>10) In Figure 5C, can the authors explain the relative levels compared to the sham group?</p><p>11) In Figure 5E, it is unclear why nutlin-3 does not prevent the E2+FAC-mediated reduction of ERalpha?</p><p>12) For the ApoE experiments, can the authors please provide trends in weight and the food consumptions for each of the mouse groups (for Figures 2, 3, and 6).</p><p>13) In Figure 6, do the authors have a DFP-only group (ie, without the E2)? Does DFP treatment of ApoE mice post OVX prevent the reduced ERalpha expression associated with LMP?</p><p>14) In Figure 2, treatment with E2 reduces atherosclerosis in ApoE mice in EPM. In Figure 6, the DFP is administered at the same time as E2. Would pre-treatment with DFP prolong an &quot;EPM state&quot; thus resulting in E2 causing a reduction in atherosclerotic lesions?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The human data as presented in Figure 1 is not convincing given multiple confounders may exist which might affect the data. List patient demographics and compare them directly (age, risk factors, symptomatic, chol lowering meds). What types of plaque were collected? I assume the rationale between late and early is that iron accumulates in late but not early? Make this rationale clear--it is important for the ENTIRE manuscript. Prussian blue is usually blue but I don't see any blue? Higher power please with more details.</p><p>2)Mice experiments. Needs to make clear why you looked at early versus late OVX? How was dose of E2 chosen and why. The micrographs of lipid staining are not particularly convincing. It looks as if there is no difference in the late group between saline and E2? Would be useful to show estrogen levels. Why does Fe drop in the late E2 and in Eary E2? Total body iron stores should increase in both groups according to me? Why not show ferritin levels in all mice?</p><p>3) In Figure 3 explain more clearly why these timepoints were chosen. You change timepoints from the previous figure why? What is the hypothesis being exposed? All of this is hard to follow.</p><p>4) IN Figure 4 why are endothelial cells introduced into the experiments?</p><p>5) In Figure 6 what does Dep do in the absence of OVX? This is a needed control. In addition the amount of Era increase with Dep is very small. Can this really explain the effects of Dep on atherosclerosis? Some verification via other methods is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The clinical study involving 20 postmenopausal women is small. It would be important to state somewhere this observation of age-related inverse relationships between iron and ERa levels needs to be replicated in a larger cohort.</p><p>2. It is noted that the study subjects had known atherosclerosis. Do these findings bear out in postmenopausal in general? A comment on this matter seems appropriate.</p><p>3. Line 44-46 in Abstract: &quot;HRT is recommended immediately after menopause along with appropriate iron chelation to protect from atherosclerosis&quot; is too strong based on such small clinical sample and on single study. Please remove or restate.</p><p>4. Line 287-288 (page 10): &quot;By contrast, plaque ERa expression was lower in the EPM than in LPM (Figure 1E)&quot; is wrong. It should be opposite.</p><p>5. Line 355-358 (page 13): I do not understand what the authors mean by this.</p><p>6. Lines 396 (page 14): &quot;massively correlated.&quot; Odd word usage. Suggest &quot;strongly correlated&quot;?</p><p>7. Line 421 (page 15): &quot;Amazingly&quot; implies the authors were surprised by the result. Suggest &quot;Importantly…&quot;.</p><p>8. Scale back on clinical recommendations. Suggest &quot;this study suggest XYZ.&quot; &quot;Additional studies are need to validate these findings…&quot;, etc.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal atherosclerosis is offset by late age iron deposition&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Carlos Isales (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done a good job of responding to my comments and the manuscript is improved and more easy to follow and read.</p><p>I few remaining comments:</p><p>Please tone down the abstract: &quot;Thus, iron and estradiol together downregulate ERα through Mdm2-mediated proteolysis, explaining failures of HRT in late postmenopausal subjects with aging-related iron accumulation&quot;. The study provides one mechanism that may be important but does not explain the failure of HRT in late post postmenopausal subjects. This is a mouse study.</p><p>Similarly in the conclusions &quot;This study suggests that immediate HRT after</p><p>379 menopause along with appropriate iron chelation would provide benefits from</p><p>380 atherosclerosis.&quot; Would implies confirmation--might is a better word.</p><p>The study demonstrates the role of iron overload in diminishing HRT benefits but it doesn't specifically show a certain mechanism. There certainly need to be some limitations mentioned in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80494.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The statement of higher serum iron in LPM versus EMP needs to be substantiated and the differences between serum iron, ferritin, and tissue iron need to be made more clear.

The results showed that ferritin and iron levels were significantly increased in plaques and serum of the LPM, compared to that in the EPM (Figure 1A-D)”. The serum hepcidin level was measured by ELISA, presented in Figure 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How do the authors explain the iron-dependent effect of E2 on increasing atherosclerosis in the macrophage FPN KO ApoE KO mice since E2 appears to restore tissue iron and serum iron back towards more normal levels.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. Our thoughts are as follows. Physiologically, E2 decreases tissue iron and increases serum iron and also increases iron uptake to compensate the periodic loss of iron in blood. Then, body iron gradually reach balance and estrogen level goes back to the bottom line. Cellular physiological response to estrogen starts with estrogen binding to either ERa or ERb. ERa is reduced in the macrophage FPN KO Apoe KO mice and administration of E2 may not reach the protective effects through estrogen receptors. However, it has been demonstrated that no protein-bound estrogen has the property to diffuse into cells freely with no regulation and estrogen may have pro- and anti-inflammatory properties depending on the circumstances including different tissues or diseases (PMID: 17640948). Plaques in macrophage FPN KO Apoe KO mice are supposed to challenge more inflammatory situation than the plaques in Apoe KO mice. Therefore, E2 exhibits possible paradox consequences due to timing of E2 administration and iron status.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please check all statistical tests performed especially as they relate to reviewer #1 question 9.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully checked the statistics.

We cited the missing references in Revision. Likely, due to being invasive to get the tissues other than only serum, we did not find the tissue data from literatures. In our study though the small number of the samples, the tissue data are luckily available due to the removal of plaques by surgery. Tissue iron and ferritin levels were presented in Figure 1. During revision, serum hepcidin was measured and shown in Figure 1E, explaining the higher tissue iron in LPM group and in agreement with the claim that plasma hepcidin and serum ferritin concentrations are highly correlated (PMID: 19211819). Serum iron is higher in LPM group in our study, likely due to no physiological blood loss, estrogen reduction, and/or the chronic and low inflammation levels in those atherosclerosis patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1E, Ferritin (Ft-L) levels are highly variable among the LPM group. The authors mentioned that the western blot samples in Figure 1E are the same as in figure 1A.

Could the authors please explain the reason for this variability across the two techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for that the sample order in original Figure 1E (Figure 1B in Revision) and 1A. The “same” means the same 8 samples. We realized the order difference in the beginning. Since P6 and P7 are in the same group, we did not redo it.

These responses were very mild except Fpn1 in early stage (Figure 2D), which suggests that not all cell types are responsive to E2 in aorta tissue, particularly the disrupted iron homeostasis in late stage”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 3, how do the authors explain the iron-dependent effect of E2 on increasing atherosclerosis in the macrophage FPN KO ApoE KO mice since E2 appears to restore tissue iron and serum iron back towards more normal levels (ie, closer to the ApoE KO mice)? An ApoE + E2 control would also have been helpful here.</p></disp-quote><p>Since reviewing editor Q1 repeated this question, we copy from the answer provided above: Physiologically, E2 decreases tissue iron, increases serum iron, and also increases iron uptake to compensate the periodic loss of iron in blood. Then, body iron gradually reach balance and estrogen level goes back to the bottom line. Cellular physiological response to estrogen starts with estrogen binding to either ERa or ERb.

The “*” marks had been misplaced in the previous version. Interaction p-value for Figure 4A and B was of no significance. We also performed a two-way ANOVA for Figure 4C and the interaction p-value was 0.0099. The explanation is that ERα was upregulated when cells were treated with E2 alone, but E2+FAC aggravated ERα downregulation compared to FAC only group. So, the interaction p-value for Figure 4A and 4B was seemingly not significant because FAC was treated in all groups, and for Figure 4C definitely significantly. Therefore, we think it is E2-dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In Figure 5C, can the authors explain the relative levels compared to the sham group?</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the experiments.

The efficacy of DFP-only is unexpectedly even better than E2+DFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) In Figure 2, treatment with E2 reduces atherosclerosis in ApoE mice in EPM. In Figure 6, the DFP is administered at the same time as E2. Would pre-treatment with DFP prolong an &quot;EPM state&quot; thus resulting in E2 causing a reduction in atherosclerotic lesions?</p></disp-quote><p>This hypothesis is very interesting. It looks like the truth if we just see the DFP-only group.

List patient demographics and compare them directly (age, risk factors, symptomatic, chol lowering meds). What types of plaque were collected? I assume the rationale between late and early is that iron accumulates in late but not early? Make this rationale clear--it is important for the ENTIRE manuscript.

Higher power please with more details.</p></disp-quote><p>Here is the information concerning demographics and comparisons, presented in the new manuscript as Table 1.</p><p>Prussian blue is visible when iron level is high enough. Physiologically, we can see some small iron-stained spots in iron-rich tissues, e. g. live and spleen. In other tissues, we generally used DAB enhanced staining to show the relative iron levels.

Needs to make clear why you looked at early versus late OVX? How was dose of E2 chosen and why. The micrographs of lipid staining are not particularly convincing. It looks as if there is no difference in the late group between saline and E2? Would be useful to show estrogen levels. Why does Fe drop in the late E2 and in Eary E2? Total body iron stores should increase in both groups according to me? Why not show ferritin levels in all mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Below we provide answers to all these helpful questions.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Early versus late OVX: we observed the serum and plaque iron difference in LPM and EPM in atherosclerosis patients, more iron in LPM and less iron in EPM.

For Figure 2, we chose 8 weeks old as a start, which age is considered as a young adulthood with high expression levels of ERα and serum lipid was not overloaded. OVX was performed, subsequently along with or without E2 treatment to examine the protective effects of estrogen through ERα and the detrimental effects of OVX (loss of estrogen) on iron metabolism.

DFP, as an iron chelator, was used for confirming that iron accumulation at LPM stage plays an important role to hinder E2 protective effects through ERa. We provided evidences that the recovery of ERα by iron chelation met the E2 benefits from the development of atherosclerosis. The increased amount of ERa was not very big but significant enough to be observed. The effects of estrogen, as a hormone, is produced via a cascade reaction, thus a significant increase of ERa is capable to contribute to the improvement of AS plaque. The expression of ABCA1 and VEGF could be a proof of ERα increase and its function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
