(MI). In both cases, the effect of RA signaling on cardiomyocytes, the principle cell type of the heart, has been reported to be indirect. Here we have developed an inducible murine transgenic RA-reporter line using CreER<sup>T2</sup> technology that permits lineage tracing of RA-responsive cells and faithfully recapitulates endogenous RA activity in multiple organs during embryonic development. Strikingly, we have observed a direct RA response in cardiomyocytes during mid-late gestation and after MI. Ablation of RA signaling through deletion of the <italic>Aldh1a1/a2/a3</italic> genes encoding RA-synthesizing enzymes leads to increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in adults subjected to MI.

RA is synthesized in two oxidative steps, with the second step being carried out by three retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3). Once synthesized<italic>,</italic> RA can activate or repress the transcription of various genes by binding to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARA, RARB, RARG), which form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRA, RXRB, RXRG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niederreither and Dollé, 2008</xref>). Unlike most other embryonic signals that are peptidic in nature and act through membrane receptors, RA is a very small lipophilic molecule that cannot be easily detected by conventional means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rhinn and Dollé, 2012</xref>). Hence, determining the activity of RA signaling in specific cell types or tissues is challenging, and has traditionally relied on RA reporter lines.</p><p>In mice, several transgenic RA reporter lines have been developed to better understand the RA signaling pathway. These include the <italic>Tg(RARE-Hspa1b/lacZ)12Jrt</italic> (hereafter referred to as RARE-LacZ), <italic>Tg(RARE/Hspa1b-cre)1Dll</italic> (referred to as RARE-Cre) and RARE-Luciferase lines, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossant et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dollé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilbija et al., 2012</xref>). All three lines utilize multiple copies of the <italic>Rarb</italic> retinoic acid response element (RARE) to drive β-galactosidase (β-gal), Cre recombinase, or Luciferase expression, and they have proven useful in understanding the wide range of RA responses during embryonic development and disease. Yet, due to inherent technical problems, these lines are limited in their ability to illustrate the full scope of RA activity in the mouse. For instance, the RARE-LacZ line is highly efficient at detecting acute RA activity at various stages of embryonic development, but is unable to trace the long-term fate of RA-responsive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossant et al., 1991</xref>). Moreover, the β-gal protein is very stable and persists in a tissue long after its expression ceases, so measurement of its activity may not reflect actual RA signaling. The RARE-Cre is also very effective at detecting RA-responses in tissues, but since it promotes constitutive Cre expression and permanent labeling of cells, the timing of the response cannot be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dollé et al., 2010</xref>). The RARE-Luciferase line can detect RA activity in vivo, but due to its use of Luciferase as a reporter, the cell types responding to RA in specific tissues cannot be identified by conventional immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilbija et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, despite the wide variety of lines available, there remains a need for new tools capable of detecting RA activity in a controlled, reliable, and efficient manner in order to better understand the roles of RA signaling in complex organs.</p><p>One such organ with which RA signaling is intimately linked is the heart. In order to meet high metabolic demands and ensure enough blood is efficiently pumped throughout the body, the mammalian heart must develop a compact layer of cardiomyocytes, whose coordinated contractions drive the pumping action of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Myocardial compaction occurs between embryonic day (E)10–14 in the mouse, and involves the proliferation and differentiation of cardiomyoblasts, the precursors of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zaffran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xavier-Neto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakajima, 2019</xref>). RA signaling is intricately linked with myocardial compaction and both <italic>Rxra</italic>-null and <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>-null mutant mice display severe hypoplasia of the compact layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jenkins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2010</xref>). Despite having a pronounced effect on the myocardium, it has been suggested that the effects of RA signaling on developing cardiomyocytes is indirect. For instance, studies have shown that RA, synthesized by ALDH1A2 in the epicardium, works in an autocrine manner with RXRA functioning as the principal receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zaffran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakajima, 2019</xref>). The ALDH1A2/RXRA axis stimulates the production of mitogens such as FGFs, which are then secreted to the myocardium to promote cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tran and Sucov, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stuckmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lavine et al., 2005</xref>). It has also been suggested that ALDH1A2/RXRA signaling in the liver and placenta promote the production of erythropoietin (EPO) and distribution of glucose, respectively, both of which sequentially activate epicardial <italic>Igf2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brade et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). IGF2 then stimulates myocardial proliferation and compaction. Hence, whether the effects of retinoids are within the epicardium or extra-cardiac tissues (or both), it appears that RA signaling does not act directly in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Regarding mammalian heart disease, many studies conducted in adult rats and mice suggest that RA signaling stimulates cardiac repair after myocardial infarction. Vitamin A-deficient rats subjected to ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD), a model of MI, exhibit increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial collagen deposition, while supplementation of RA to mice following ischaemia/reperfusion surgery results in decreased apoptosis and smaller infarct zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Minicucci et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). In both cases, the cell types responding to RA treatment were not identified. Direct evidence that RA signaling is reactivated in the heart post MI comes from a study performed with the RARE-Luciferase reporter line. In this study, the authors detected RA signaling in damaged hearts 24 hr to 1 week post MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilbija et al., 2012</xref>). Cardiac fibroblasts, and not cardiomyocytes, were determined to be the principal cell-types responding to RA, once again suggesting an indirect effect of RA on the myocardium.</p><p>Despite the majority of studies suggesting that cardiomyocytes are not the major RA-responsive cell types in the heart, minor, albeit important roles for RA signaling in the mammalian myocardium have been identified. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guleria et al., 2011</xref>, it was demonstrated that stimulation of the RA pathway in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes subjected to high-glucose conditions led to decreased apoptosis. The protective effect was attributed to RA-induced modulation of the Renin-angiotensin system (RAS). More recently, cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the RARA receptor in adult mice led to increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and calcium mishandling defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, in non-mammalian vertebrates capable of naturally restoring damaged cardiac tissue without scar formation, it has been shown that RA signaling is indispensable for the regenerative response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>). For example, in adult zebrafish subjected to ventricular resection injuries, <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> mRNA was found to be upregulated in the endocardium and epicardium, and inhibition of RA signaling through transgenic expression of dominant-negative RARA led to drastically reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kikuchi et al., 2011</xref>). Altogether, these studies suggest RA signaling is active in cardiomyocytes, and that the RA pathway may be involved in protecting and/or repairing damaged heart muscle.</p><p>Here, we have developed a novel RA reporter line using CreER<sup>T2</sup> technology (RARECreER<sup>T2</sup>) that closely mimics well-known RA reporter lines and allows for timed, cell-type-specific tracing of RA-responsive cells. Using this line, we have detected a myocardial-specific response to RA during mid-late stages of development (E11-18), and have observed RA activity in cardiomyocytes of adult mice subjected to MI. In order to better understand the role of RA in cardiac repair, we have crossed <italic>lox</italic>P-flanked (floxed) alleles of the <italic>Aldh1a</italic> enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vermot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dupé et al., 2003</xref>) with the ubiquitously expressed and inducible <italic>Tg(CAG-cre/Esr1*)5Amc</italic> line, hereafter referred to as CAGGCreER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi and McMahon, 2002</xref>), to generate time-controlled loss of functions. By temporally deleting the <italic>Aldh1a</italic> alleles in adult mice then subjecting them to MI, we have observed a drastic increase in cardiomyocyte-specific apoptosis. RNA sequencing of primary cardiomyocytes treated with RA followed by genome-wide analysis reveals RA can stimulate a notable transcriptional response in cardiomyocytes. Importantly, some of the identified RA-responsive genes, such as transglutaminase 2 (<italic>Tgm2</italic>) and angiotensin converting enzyme (<italic>Ace1</italic>), have well characterized roles in cardiac repair, thereby providing new molecular links between RA signaling and heart disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> line recapitulates endogenous RA signaling in developing mouse embryos</title><p>The RA signaling pathway is extremely dynamic, acting on various tissues at different stages of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duester, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niederreither and Dollé, 2008</xref>). In order to better understand the timing and identity of the cell types responding to RA, we developed a novel tamoxifen-inducible RA reporter line using CreER<sup>T2</sup> technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, schematic). Previous work has shown that RA signaling, activated by expression of <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> in caudal regions of the embryo, is first detected around E7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossant et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ang et al., 1996</xref>). To see if we could detect this early RA activity, we crossed our line with the <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1Sor</sup></italic> reporter line (referred to as R26L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soriano, 1999</xref>) and administered tamoxifen (TAM) one day earlier, at E6.5, to account for tamoxifen processing and eventual reporter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Strikingly, analysis of embryos at E9.5 via whole-mount X-gal staining demonstrated high reporter activity up to posterior hindbrain/pharyngeal regions of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel). Administration of tamoxifen at E7.5 followed by analysis at E10.5 revealed a similar pattern of staining, as well as efficient labeling of the developing limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). The X-gal staining at both time-points closely matched the staining pattern observed with other RARE reporter lines such as the RARE-LacZ and RARE-Cre, and is consistent with the conserved roles of RA signaling role in embryo posteriorization, and limb bud formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossant et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dollé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durston et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sive et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stratford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niederreither et al., 2002b</xref>). However, we detected very few X-gal<sup>+</sup> cells in the forebrains of our RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> embryos, a known site of RA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossant et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dollé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ribes et al., 2006</xref>). To address this issue, we crossed our line with the <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo</sup></italic> reporter line (referred to as mTmG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>), which expresses GFP protein upon Cre recombination and is more sensitive than the R26L line. Whole mount GFP immunofluorescence (IF) of embryos induced at E7.5 and sacrificed at E10.5 revealed efficient labeling of the forebrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). To examine the full spectrum of the RA response detected with the RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> line, we repeated the lineage-tracing experiments with two pulses of tamoxifen at E7.5 and E8.5 to improve the overall recombination efficiency, and then analyzed embryos at E11.5, when most organs are further developed. Analysis of whole embryo sections by GFP IF revealed efficient and consistent labeling of various well-known RA-responsive organs such as the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Malpel et al., 2000</xref>), liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brade et al., 2011</xref>), spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sockanathan and Jessell, 1998</xref>), heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niederreither et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niederreither et al., 2002a</xref>), and differentiating somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossant et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niederreither et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diez del Corral et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duester, 2007</xref>) in all embryos analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

No apoptosis was observed in RAKO mice subjected to sham surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Interestingly, many of the apoptotic cells in RAKO mice were cardiomyocytes and they tended to concentrate in clusters or so called ‘patches’ that were positive for both active caspase3 and TUNEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Thus, dampening the RA response prior to MI leads to increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and mortality, suggesting RA signaling plays a protective role in damaged heart muscle.</p><p>A previous study using exogenous RA supplementation in mice subjected to ischaemia/reperfusion determined that the RA pathway reduced apoptosis in damaged hearts by modulating the MAP kinase pathway. This was suggested to be through direct transcriptional regulation of <italic>Adam10</italic>, a gene which encodes for a protease that cleaves and inactivates the RAGE10 (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products) receptor, a positive regulator of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>).

To decipher the underlying mechanisms, we isolated primary cardiomyocytes from E18.5 hearts and treated them with 100 nM RA for 48 hr to mimic long-term exposure to RA, which is normally experienced after MI. We then extracted RNA and used the samples for high-throughput sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, schematic). Analysis of the sequencing data identified several canonical RA targets such as <italic>Rarb</italic>, <italic>Cyp26b1</italic> and <italic>Cyp26a1</italic> to be top hits among all genes analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of GO terms for inflammatory and DNA damage responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, several genes previously shown to be important in cardiac development and MI were also determined to be either up or downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Of note, <italic>Tgm2</italic>, which has been shown to promote ATP synthesis and thus limit damage after MI, was significantly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szondy et al., 2006</xref>). We also noticed that RA treatment significantly repressed the expression of Angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (<italic>Ace1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). ACE1 is responsible for converting angiotensin 1 into angiotensin 2, which in turn activates the renin angiotensin system and subsequent vasoconstriction. Upregulation of ACE1 has been observed in rodent hearts after MI and is generally considered to be harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun, 2010</xref>). Indeed, ACE inhibitors are commonly used to treat patients recovering from MI, and they have shown great success in various clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flather et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, a connection between RA signaling, the RAS system, and cardiomyocyte-specific apoptosis has been previously established in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palm-Leis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guleria et al., 2011</xref>). Respective activation and repression of <italic>Tgm2</italic> and <italic>Ace1</italic> after 48 hr RA treatment was confirmed by qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). <italic>Tgm2</italic> and <italic>Ace1</italic> modulation by RA signaling was also observed with 9-hr RA-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Next, we treated cardiomyocytes with BMS493 for 48 hr, and observed that <italic>Tgm2</italic> expression was repressed while <italic>Ace1</italic> levels were increased, consistent with our hypothesis that both genes are regulated by RA signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). <italic>Ace1</italic> is highly expressed by endothelial cells in the heart, and it is possible the repression of <italic>Ace1</italic> by RA may be a result of contaminating endothelial cells. To address this issue, we removed endothelial cells from our cardiomyocyte cultures using CD31 magnetic beads, then treated enriched cardiomyocytes with RA for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). Consistently, RA treatment repressed <italic>Ace1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). <italic>Tgm2</italic> and <italic>Ace1</italic> were also upregulated in MI hearts when compared to sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Finally, to see if <italic>Tgm2</italic> and <italic>Ace1</italic> are direct or indirect RA targets, we treated cultured cardiomyocytes with RA for only 3 hours and added the translational inhibitor cycloheximide to block non-specific activation of <italic>Tgm2/Ace1</italic>.

Overall, these data are consistent with previously described early roles of RA signaling in early embryonic germ layers and in body axis patterning, limb bud formation and neural tube patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stratford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niederreither et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niederreither et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diez del Corral et al., 2003</xref>). Other organs that have continuous RA activity throughout development such as the retina, somites, forebrain, and heart can be labeled using the RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> line with later pulses of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cunningham and Duester, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niederreither and Dollé, 2008</xref>). The biological relevance of these results not only validate our RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> line; they also highlight its sensitivity and vast potential as a reliable tool for studying RA signaling and the fate of RA responding cells in vivo. A limitation with the RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> is that it relies exclusively on the RARE element from the <italic>Rarb</italic> promoter<italic>,</italic> meaning it only functions in cells where <italic>Rarb</italic> is activated by RA. Moreover, the RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> line may also fail to detect RA signaling activation that is independent of RAR receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schug et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that RA signaling is involved in myocardial compaction but that RA does not act directly on cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tran and Sucov, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stuckmann et al., 2003</xref>). Instead, RA signaling was believed to act in an autocrine or extra cardiac manner in the epicardium and liver/placenta, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brade et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). Using our novel RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> line, we clearly demonstrate that cardiomyocytes do indeed respond to RA. Moreover, we have validated this response through in vivo and in vitro modulation of the RA pathway. However, it is still not clear whether this response plays an important role in myocardial compaction. Deletion of the RXRA receptor in the myocardium does not lead to an obvious heart phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tran and Sucov, 1998</xref>), but perhaps other receptors compensate for this loss of function. It is also possible that RA signaling may have essential roles in fine-tuning the patterning and maturation of the compact myocardium. One way of addressing this would be to perform a simultaneous myocardial-specific deletion of the three RARs. The deletion would have to target all three alleles since the RARs display high functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mark et al., 2006</xref>). Such a study would be useful in further delineating the roles of RA signaling during myocardial compaction and would provide additional insight into how RA regulates the proliferation, differentiation and/or maturation of cardiomyocytes.</p><p>The cardiomyocyte response as well as the dynamic pattern of ALDH1A2 protein localization observed during late stages of heart development is intriguing. Why do cardiomyocytes continue to respond to RA signaling at these time-points? Could RA be promoting the differentiation and maturation of these cells? Do the RA-responsive cells represent unique subpopulations with specific roles in the heart? All of these scenarios are plausible and should be addressed in future studies. The fact that ALDH1A2 protein is produced by alternative cell-types other than the epicardium is logical, since during later time-points, when the heart’s compact myocardial layer is thickened, it is unlikely RA can diffuse easily to cardiomyocytes located in deeper portions of the ventricular wall. Through a series of co-IF and lineage-tracing experiments we suggest that the ALDH1A2<sup>+</sup> cells at these time-points are cardiac fibroblasts or other connective tissue cells derived from the epicardium. However, more detailed analyses such as FACS analysis with multiple markers or single-cell RNA sequencing would have to be carried out in order to confirm these findings. It would also be interesting to investigate if these same cell-types also produce ALDH1A2 after MI.</p><p>It is well known that RA signaling plays a protective role in the heart after acute damage. Treatment of rats with RA reduces cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling after MI and deficiency of RA leads to larger infarct zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paiva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Minicucci et al., 2010</xref>). In mice, RA treatment also leads to smaller infarct zones and reduced apoptosis after ischaemia reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Our observation of increased scarring and apoptosis after infarct in RAKO mice is consistent with these studies. However, other studies suggest that the protective effects of RA signaling is context dependent, and that short-term localized exposure to retinoids after MI may even be harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Danzl et al., 2019</xref>). In healthy non-infarcted mice, deletion of the RARA receptor has detrimental effects, mainly due to increased reactive oxygen species and calcium mishandling, while long-term RA treatment leads to cardiac hypertrophy and overall negative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, these contradictory findings suggest that the effects of RA signaling in the heart are highly dependent on the dose and length of exposure to RA, meaning that for RA signaling to be protective, it needs to be tightly regulated.</p><p>With our RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> mice we have detected an RA response in several cell types in MI hearts. Moreover, we report upregulation of ALDH1A2 in the injured heart and propose it is the main driver of the RA response post MI. We also propose that, based on the proximity of the ALDH1A2<sup>+</sup> cells to the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, the RA response in the infarct region of the heart is localized. However, reports have shown that <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> is also upregulated in the epicardium after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kikuchi et al., 2011</xref>) and, given the length of our lineage tracing experiments (6 days), we cannot rule out epicardial-specific <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> as the main driver of RA signaling in injured hearts. Interestingly, cardiomyocytes were also responsive to RA signaling in MI hearts, especially in the border zone. However, the number of RA-responsive cardiomyocytes was relatively low. This may be explained by the RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> line not being sensitive enough to detect the full spectrum of the RA-response in the injured myocardium. The importance of myocardial RA signaling in protecting infarct hearts is supported by the increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis observed in RAKO mice.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct RNA sequencing on primary cardiomyocytes treated with RA. Despite traditionally being considered non-responsive cells, RA treatment led to a notable transcriptional response in cardiomyocytes. In many ways, this validates our observations with the RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> line, in which cardiomyocytes, especially at later time-points are highly responsive to RA. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution since the cardiomyocytes used for the RNA sequencing were isolated from E18.5 hearts, whose response to RA may not accurately reflect the transcriptional landscape during initial phases of myocardial compaction (E10.5-E14.5) or after MI, in which the myocardium experiences severe hypoxia and inflammation. Furthermore, RA signaling can regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and it is likely that many of the genes identified, such as <italic>Tgm2</italic> and <italic>Ace1</italic>, are indirect RA targets.</p><p>Among the many genes identified from the RNA sequencing analysis, <italic>Tgm2</italic> attracted our attention since it has previously been associated with regulating ATP synthesis after MI. In fact, <italic>Tgm2</italic> knockout mice exhibit larger infarcts when compared to controls, much like our RAKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szondy et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, however, <italic>Tgm2</italic> has been shown to promote cardiac fibrosis in MI hearts and pharmacological inhibition of TGM2 led to smaller infarcts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). It is thereby possible that the effects of <italic>Tgm2</italic> on heart repair, as with RA signaling, are dependent on the level of activity.</p><p>Another important finding relates to RA repression of <italic>Ace1</italic>, an essential RAS activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun, 2010</xref>). Previous work has identified numerous links between RA signaling and RAS but the mechanisms through which this crosstalk occurred were unclear since no RA targets from the RAS pathway had been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guleria et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Palm-Leis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takeda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dechow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haxsen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). The finding that <italic>Ace1</italic> expression is repressed by RA in cardiomyocytes demonstrates a direct connection between RA signaling and RAS. Moreover, it has important implications for cardiac disease, since <italic>Ace1</italic> upregulation after MI is long known to have negative effects on cardiac remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun, 2010</xref>). Indeed, ACE inhibitors have consistently led to improved patient outcomes in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flather et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, one study has even shown that ACE1 can be detected in cardiomyocytes from human infarct hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hokimoto et al., 1996</xref>). It is thus possible that combining RA, which specifically inhibits <italic>Ace1</italic> expression, with ACE inhibitors may have synergistic beneficial effects in protecting cardiomyocytes post-MI, an interesting prospect for future studies aimed at improving the survival of patients suffering from heart disease.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that cardiomyocytes are responsive to RA signaling and that depletion of the RA pathway leads to increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI. These findings have important implications in the heart development and cardiac regeneration research fields.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

One dose of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) was administrated subcutaneously for pre-operative analgesia. After 30 min, they were anesthetized by inhalation of 4 % isoflurane in a filled chamber and immediately intubated for artificial ventilation to maintain a respiratory rate of 135 /min with pure oxygen mixed with 1–2% isoflurane. A left-sided thoracotomy was performed between the third and fourth ribs: the pericardium was cut open and ligation of the descending branch of the left coronary artery was made 2.5 mm under the tip of the left auricle using 8–0 silk suture. Sham operated mice underwent the same procedure, except no ligation around the left coronary artery was made. Subsequently, the intercostal space, muscles of the external thoracic wall and skin were sutured with 6/0 polyester.

After each 15-min incubation, the supernatant was removed and 5 ml FBS was added to stop the reaction. After the digestion, all solutions were pooled, run through a 70 µM filter and then spun down for 5 minutes at 1600 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was then removed, and the pellet resuspended in DMEM +8 % FBS. The cells were then plated for 1–2 hr on uncoated plastic wells of six-well plates for fibroblasts to adhere. The non-adherent cells containing the cardiomyocytes were then resuspended and plated on collagen coated (50 µg/ml) wells of six-well plates. The next day the media was changed and the cardiomyocytes grown to 50–60% confluency before being treated. For RA (SIGMA) and BMS493 (TOCRIS) treatments, solutions were pre-diluted in 100 % ethanol before being added directly to the media at final concentrations of 100 nM (RA for RNA-seq) or 1 µM (BMS493 and RA for qPCR analysis). For RARECreER<sup>T2</sup> activation in cultured cardiomyocytes, 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4 µM) was supplemented together with RA, as indicated in the figure legends.

All cells isolated were counted as cardiomyocytes and were visualized and quantified via Tomato (not activated by RA) or GFP (activated by RA) (both from mTmG transgene) fluorescence. To avoid bias from FBS, cells were washed twice with PBS and media was replaced with KnockOut DMEM (Gibco 10829018) supplemented with 10 % KnockOut serum replacement (Gibco 10828028), 1 % MEM non-essential amino acids (Gibco 11140050) and 1 % GlutaMAX prior to RA treatments. Live cell imaging was performed with AxioObserver - Zeiss (2011) and images were acquired for a total of 48 hr. For dose titration experiments, cells were fixed in methanol, stained with anti-GFP antibody (Abcam: a13970), and revealed with anti-chicken Cy5 antibody (Jackson: 03-175-155).

For all analyses, sections were on average spaced by 40 µM, covering a total area of at least 250–400 µM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Sample sizes (individual embryos, litter numbers, and wells (in vitro experiments)) are reported in each figure legend. All cell counts were performed in standardized microscopic fields using either the ImageJ cell counter plug in or user-defined macros. All statistical analyses were conducted using Graphpad Prism. Data normality was tested by Shapiro-Wilk normality test and variances between groups were tested using F-test. Means between two groups were compared using two-tailed unpaired student’s <italic>t</italic>-test and means between multiple groups were compared using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Statistical outliers were calculated using the Grubb’s test. Results are displayed as arithmetic mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). Where indicated results are shown as fold change vs. controls. Statistically significant data are indicated as: * p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, and ***p &lt; 0.001. Non-significant data is indicated as ns.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

A new inducible RARE-Cre-ERT2 mouse model was developed where RA can be deleted at specific times of development and in multiple tissues. After validating that the new line mimics endogenous RA signaling by crossing RARE-Cre-ERT2 with R26L and mTmG lines, results show that cardiomyocytes from E11-E18 embryos and from adult mice subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) display RA activity. Elegant experiments were performed in embryos of pregnant females injected with RA. Additional data from mice subjected to MI document increased RA signaling in a variety of cells including cardiomyocytes. Mice with a 50% reduction of ALDH1A have larger infarcts and increased fibrosis and apoptosis. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing from isolated cardiomyocytes treated with RA identify Tgm2 and Ace1 as RA-responsive genes in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>The current study is important because it challenges the current dogma on the indirect role of RA in the heart according to which cardiac fibroblasts are the major cell types responsive to RA which acts in an autocrine manner. The new RA-reporter line developed allows lineage tracing of cells responsive to RA with great sensitivity. Overall, this well-designed study reveals important new information on RA protective signaling mechanism in the heart from an impressive amount of in vivo work. While RA signaling is clearly documented in cardiomyocytes during specific windows of heart development, some concerns are raised in the adult heart. In particular, the contribution of cardiomyocytes conferring a protective response after MI should be better documented considering the relatively small fraction responsive to RA. Additional concerns are with the MI model and the use of proper control mice. Major issues that need to be addressed are listed below.</p></disp-quote><p>We were pleased to read the overall very positive evaluation by reviewer 1, who found our study to be “important”, “well-designed”, and to contain an “impressive amount of in vivo work”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. One concern is with the claim that RA signaling in cardiomyocytes and especially in adult cardiomyocytes, is independent of the epicardium and arises from a local source of RA based on GFP positive cells located away from the epicardium. A relatively small population of cardiomyocytes respond to RA signaling and are detected because of the sensitivity of the new RARE-Cre-ERT2 line generated. The question is what is the contribution of the cardiomyocyte population in the cardioprotective effect of RA after MI? To address this, the responsiveness to RA signaling should be compared to mice with cardiomyocyte-specific or endothelial-specific expression of RA reporters. What is the extent of MI and cardiac remodeling in these 2 lines? Is-there protection in both lines?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for these comments. ALDH1A2 protein is upregulated in various cell types in the injury and border zones (this study), and in the epicardium (Kikuchi et al., 2011). We cannot formally rule out that MI-induced epicardial-<italic>Aldh1a2</italic> expression contributes to the GFP response but given the proximity of the GFP cells to the ALDH1A2<sup>+</sup> cells within the injury/border zones, it is likely that the primary response is local. Regarding the number of cardiomyocytes responding to RA after infarction, we would like to point out that GFP activation in our transgenic strain requires a certain level of RA signaling, and it is possible that a larger number of cardiomyocytes respond to RA than can be detected using our reporter strain. This has been added to the discussion of our revised manuscript in lines 434-438.</p><p>We also agree that multiple cell-types respond to RA signaling (e.g. PECAM1<sup>+</sup> cells, αSMA<sup>+</sup> cells, TropT<sup>+</sup> cells, see Figure 4E). Deciphering the exact contribution of each cell type to the phenotype observed with ubiquitous ALDH1A would require deleting all three retinoic acid receptor genes (<italic>Rar</italic>a/b/g<italic>)</italic> in a cell type specific manner. Building these strains would take more than a year and we feel that this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>After reading this reviewer’s comments, we realize that the title or our paper may have been misleading, as we have not formally proven that RA signaling in cardiomyocytes is responsible for the better recovery after LAD-ligation. We have therefore changed the title to: “Retinoic acid signaling is directly activated in cardiomyocytes and protects mouse hearts from apoptosis after myocardial infarction”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. RNA sequencing was performed from cardiomyocytes isolated from embryonic hearts treated with RA to identify RA responsive genes. What was the reason for not performing RNA-seq in adult cardiomyocytes isolated from RARECreERT2 mouse hearts after MI? At minimum, qPCR should be done to assess whether the 2 genes identified (Tgm2 and Ace1) are also up-regulated in adult RARECreERT2 mouse hearts after MI.</p></disp-quote><p>Isolating pure cardiomyocyte populations from adult hearts is difficult and typically yields low amounts of viable cells that are often contaminated with cardiac fibroblasts. Identifying a cardiomyocyte-specific response to RA signaling in adults is therefore difficult to achieve. We thus resorted to E18.5 hearts, for which good cardiomyocyte isolation procedures exist.</p><p>Regarding the second point, we have now added qPCR data showing that both <italic>Tgm2</italic> and <italic>Ace1</italic> are upregulated in infarct <italic>RARE-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup></italic> hearts when compared to sham controls (Figure 6—figure supplement 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The legends of whole-mount X-gal or GFP staining are lacking information on the number of embryos used. Please indicate the number of embryos used in all the appropriate Figures to document scientific rigor.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for pointing this out. The number of embryos analyzed for the whole-mount stainings have now been added to the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Negative control immunofluorescence with ALDH1A2 antibody should be provided to show specificity of the signal.</p></disp-quote><p>ALDH1A2 protein is not detectable in the uninjured heart; and we have added an inset from the sham <italic>RARE-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup></italic> heart stained with ALDH1A2 (Figure 4B), which does not display specific labelling. To further confirm the specificity of the ALDH1A2 antibody, we have performed embryonic deletions of <italic>Aldh1a1/a2/a3</italic> be injecting tamoxifen at E13.5 and analyzing at E18.5. Deletion of <italic>Aldh1a</italic> enzymes during late cardiac development leads to a drastic reduction of ALDH1A2 immunoreactivity in the heart when analyzed by IF. Analysis of <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> mRNA levels by qPCR confirms the knockdown efficiency (&gt;90%) using this strategy. These data have been added in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 4 documents RA signaling in adult RARECreERT2 hearts after sham or MI. Control CreERT2 hearts after sham or MI should be shown in parallel. Also, what control mice were used in Figure 5?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Aldh1a1<sup>f/f</sup>;a2<sup>f/f</sup>;a3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> (triple floxed mice, without the Cre transgene) were used as controls and this information has been now added to figure 5 and to the text (lines 286-287). A previous study has shown that activation of the <italic>CAGGCreER</italic> line (JAX No. 004682) (the same line used here) by tamoxifen injection for 10 days followed by MI led to no transient side effects as revealed by echocardiographic analysis (Konstandin et al., 2013) (see lines 284-286). Hence, we believe there is no need for performing MI surgeries on control <italic>CAGGCreER</italic> as these experiments have already been carried out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It is intriguing that 5 doses of tamoxifen only reduce ALDH1A2 by 50%. Please provide an explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>The efficiency of Cre-mediated deletion is highly influenced by chromatin structure and silenced genes are known to be more difficult to excise (Long and Rossi, 2009). We performed tamoxifen injections one week prior to MI, a time point when ALDH1A2 protein is not detected (see Figure 4B and Zhou et al., 2011; Kikuchi et al., 2011) and <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> is therefore likely epigenetically silenced. The incomplete excision in the adult heart can also be seen on the genomic level, which shows approximately only 60% of the recombined allele (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D). We would also like to draw the reviewer’s attention to our response to comment 4, where we demonstrate a much higher reduction (&gt;90%) in <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> mRNA levels upon tamoxifen-induced <italic>CAGGCreER</italic> deletion in late cardiac development, when <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> is actively expressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The transverse sections of control and RAK ko hearts after MI are atypical as they do not show the expected loss of myocardial tissue especially after 6 days of MI as shown in Figure 4B. Longitudinal sections or cross-sections at different levels should be shown to document the extent of the MI in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>Analyzing the loss of myocardial tissue after MI on transverse sections is a standard method that has been implemented in numerous publications (e.g. Gao et al., 2019). In our study, we analyzed 6 transverse sections per mouse, with each section being spaced by 40 µm. A significant and highly representative portion of the infarct zone in operated mice has therefore been analyzed. As to why the expected loss of tissue is less than expected by reviewer 1 is not clear, but this may be due to surgical procedures. We would like to point out that all surgeries were performed by the same researcher using the same conditions for both control and <italic>RAKO</italic> mice. We are therefore confident that the observed increase in infarct size is due to the loss of RA signaling rather than experimental variations.</p><p>Analyzing infarct areas on longitudinal sections is not possible in the hearts collected since we removed the apices for RNA extraction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Because it is challenging to obtain reproducible infarcts after MI surgery, the number of mice should be increased to at least 10 in each group.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the number of mice analyzed to 10 per group in our revised version of the manuscript, as suggested by reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Are the survival rates of control and RAK mice after MI identical? With such a difference in fibrosis, one would expect that control mice have a longer life span than RAK ko after MI.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5—figure supplement 2D we now document the survival rates of RAKO at 6 days post MI. As predicted by reviewer 1, <italic>RAKO</italic> mice exhibit increased early death when compared to controls (4 out of 14 <italic>RAKO</italic> mice died before 6 days, while no early death is documented in control mice).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. What is the effect of BMS493 in sham or MI operated mice? Inactivation of RA signaling with BMS493 should reduce the infarct size of RAK ko mice after MI.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data suggest that RA signaling has a protective effect after myocardial infarction and BMS493 treatment would not ‘rescue’ the increased infarct in RAKO mice. In addition, BMS493 has a relatively short half-life and mice would have to be injected several times per day to efficiently block RA signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>1. Line 92: add reference 22 from Guleria 2011.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please run a spell check for typos.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The study is significant technically because a new mouse line allowing RA lineage tracing at specific times of development and in multiple tissues was developed. The conceptual novelty is with the finding that a population of cardiomyocytes is responsive to RA signaling at late stages of embryonic development and also in the injured adult heart. As an expert in heart failure mechanisms, I believe the current study is potentially highly significant for the cardiac field.</p></disp-quote><p>We were pleased to read that Reviewer 1 found our study to be “technically significant” and to be “potentially highly significant for the cardiac field”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>I totally agree with the comments of Reviewer 2 with respect to issues with the MI experiments and the lack of quantitative analysis using immunofluorescence to assess RA signaling in general. I am also in agreement with the issues raised by Reviewer 3.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>A novel cell line was developed to monitor retinoic acid signaling (RA) that is useful in multiple cell lines. The activation of retinoic acid signaling was studied during embryogenesis and post-MI. There is shown that RA signaling is activated mainly in fibroblasts post-MI and that downregulation of RA leads to allegedly larger infarcts with greater scar is shown. Classic responses to select RA downstream effectors is shown. The studies are well written. Technical issues include the lack of a risk area assessment in the infarct studies, making the assertion that infarct size is increased an unsubstantiated assertion. Cellular studies are performed with exogenous RA that show that activation of RA gene programs occurs.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer is correct that our study did not include a risk assessment analysis. We disagree however with his/her opinion that our claim of increased infarct size in <italic>Aldh1a</italic> mutant animals is unsubstantiated. Indeed, our measurements performed on sections show a statistically significant increase in infarct size in animals in which <italic>Aldh1a1/2/3</italic> have been deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Though stated in the introduction; the clear advantage of the new cell line should be better documented by both direct comparison studies and an improved discussion. The indicator appears to be all or none; the extent of activation of RA signaling, the amount of RA needed to turn a cell &quot;positive&quot; and the durability of the response remain unclear. The data during embryogenesis are all qualitative fluorescence studies, a relative limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank reviewer 2 for these helpful comments. Unfortunately, a quantitative assessment of the amount of atRA required to activate RA signaling in vivo is difficult to perform<italic>.</italic> As a solution, we have addressed these issues using primary cardiomyocytes isolated from <italic>RARECreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>; <italic>mTmG</italic> E18.5 hearts. Briefly, by treating cells with 10 nM of atRA and then performing live cell imaging, we could detect first GFP<sup>+</sup> cells after 28 hours of RA treatment, and that the levels of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells peaked around 48 hours. We then treated cells with different doses of atRA (i.e. 0.1 nM-1000 nM) for 48 hours (length of treatment based on time course experiment) and counted the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. Cardiomyocytes responded to RA signaling in a dose dependent fashion (Figure 2I). Moreover, as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, we could detect GFP<sup>+</sup> cells with RA concentrations as low as 0.1 – 1 nM, which are physiologically relevant. These quantitative data provide valuable information on the doses of RA required to ‘turn’ cardiomyocytes ‘positive’.</p><p>We are not sure we understood the question regarding the “durability” of the response correctly. <italic>Cre</italic>induced recombination of the mTmG transgene using the <italic>RARE-CreER<sup>T</sup></italic><sup>2</sup> line leads to a permanent activation of GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The potential occurrence of select receptor activation by RA should be discussed, the cell line clearly only detects RARb. Also, non-receptor interactions of RA should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>RARECreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> line utilizes the retinoic acid response element (RARE) from the <italic>Rarb</italic> gene, a faithful direct target gene of RA signaling, that is the most commonly employed strategy for generating RA reporter mouse lines (Rossant et al., 1991; Dolle et al., 2010; Bilbija et al., 2012). However, we do realize that activation of the <italic>Rarb</italic> RARE may not reflect RA signaling in its complete capacity, nor does it account for non-receptor interactions, as correctly pointed out by reviewer 2. This is a limitation of our line which has now been addressed in lines 384-387 of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>Agree with the comments of Reviewers 1 and 3; especially major comment 1 of Reviewer 1.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper tests a new inducible murine transgenic retinoic acid-reporter line that allows lineage tracing experiments for cells in which retinoic acid occurs. This is used to show that retinoic acid directly acts on cardiomyocytes during mid-late gestation and interestingly also occurs after myocardial infarction in the adult. An appropriate set of controls were used and impressive that there is a strong inhibition of reporter when the RAR inverse agonist BMS493 is applied. Overall the studies are logical and provide a direct test of well formulated ideas.</p></disp-quote><p>We were happy to read the overall positive evaluation by reviewer 3 who found our study to be logical and to provide a direct test of well formulated ideas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. Aldh1a1 and Aldh1a3 transcripts increase with infarction. What is their protein distribution compared to Aldh1a2? This is particularly important because the deletion of enzyme studies results in only 50% reduction in ALDH1A2 protein (Figure 5C) but a near 70% decrease of Aldh1a1 and Aldh1a2 mRNA levels. In addition, quantitation of change in protein expression by fluorescence intensity will be highly inexact. If this is the best approach some attempt to demonstrate how this relates to real levels needs to be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that measuring ALDH1A2 protein-levels by IF is not very reliable, and we have removed Figure 5C form the paper.</p><p>We had previously tested several commercial antibodies for ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3, but found them to be unsatisfactory. We have now tested new antibodies but did not observe ALDH1A1 or ALDH1A3 immunoreactivity in the MI heart by IF. Hence, due to technical difficulties, we were not able to provide data on the distribution of ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 protein in the heart after MI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It was proposed that regulation of Tgm2 by RA was direct from its action within 9 hours however given measurable regulation of transcript can occur in 2-3 hours this argument is not strong.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point brought up by reviewer 3. Indeed, the claim that the activation of <italic>Tgm2</italic> by RA may be direct based on the 9 hours RA treatment data could be strengthened. To further test whether <italic>Tgm2</italic> and <italic>Ace1</italic> are direct or indirect RA targets, we performed experiments where RA treatment was reduced to 3 hours, and in which the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide was supplemented to the media to further limit indirect activation of <italic>Tgm2</italic> and <italic>Ace1.</italic> As shown in figure 6 Figure supplement 2D, no modulation of <italic>Tgm2</italic> or <italic>Ace1</italic> expression is observed upon 3 hour RA treatment, both with and without cycloheximide. <italic>Rarb</italic> expression is still upregulated with only 3 hour RA treatment. Altogether, this data suggests that <italic>Tgm2</italic> and <italic>Ace1</italic> are indirect RA targets. This new data is addressed in lines 352-359 of the Results section and in lines 447-448 of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. On line 36 it is described that oxidation of retinaldehyde to retinoic acid is considered the rate-limiting step. What is the reference for this? In the past it was considered the oxidation of retinol to retinal e.g. Wolf G. The regulation of retinoic acid formation. Nutr Rev. 1996;54:182-4.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 3 that this is a controversial statement and we have removed it from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What might account for differences with the Rossant mouse retinoic acid reporter mouse in the limb buds i.e. Rossant showing low/absent reporter in the limbs at E8.5?</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>RARE-LacZ</italic> line used in Rossant et al. 1991 documents acute activation of RA activity and does not permanently label cells. The <italic>RARECreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> line, coupled with the <italic>Rosa26 LacZ</italic> or <italic>mTmG</italic> reporters, permanently labels RA-responsive cells and is thus suitable for cell lineage analysis. We therefore believe that the labelling of the limbs with our <italic>RARECreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> line is a result of RA activation in limb progenitors at an early stage (e.g. E6.5 or E7.5), which by E8.5 have migrated into the limb buds and, due to the permanent nature of the reporter activation, continue to express <italic>β-gal</italic>/GFP. Testing this hypothesis would require specific experiments that are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. On line 414-415 the discussion suddenly jumps to discussion of the RAS pathway without any explanation of this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the transition was very abrupt, and we thank reviewer 3 for pointing this out.
