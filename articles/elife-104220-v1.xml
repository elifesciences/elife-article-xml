However, the results so far have been relatively modest and time-consuming. Here, we implemented a novel 3-min combination of personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (intermittent theta burst, iTBS) coupled with simultaneous application of gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation (γtACS) over the precuneus, a brain area connected with the hippocampus, to modulate long-term memory in healthy subjects. Only dual electromagnetic stimulation of the precuneus produced an increase in long-term associative memory as compared to iTBS alone and sham conditions in a sample of healthy volunteers. The effects were replicated in another independent sample, in which the increased associative memory was retained for up to 1 week. Moreover, dual stimulation increased gamma oscillations and precuneus–hippocampus functional connectivity through the white matter tracts linking the precuneus with the temporal lobe. These findings show that dual stimulation may lead neuronal assemblies in a state favorable to enhance long-term plasticity. Personalized dual electromagnetic stimulation of the precuneus may represent a new powerful approach for enhancing memory functions in several healthy and clinical conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>long-term memory</kwd><kwd>non-invasive brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>precuneus</kwd><kwd>hippocampus connectivity</kwd><kwd>cognitive enhancement</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00k4n6c32</institution-id><institution>H2020 Future and Emerging Technologies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101017716</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koch</surname><given-names>Giacomo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00k4n6c32</institution-id><institution>NextGenerationEU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PE00000006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koch</surname><given-names>Giacomo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00k4n6c32</institution-id><institution>NextGenerationEU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC42</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casula</surname><given-names>Elias Paolo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rapid, combined and personalized non-invasive stimulation of the precuneus improves associative memory, enhances local gamma expression, and strengthens precuneus–hippocampal connectivity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As the world’s population ages, the prevalence of age-related memory deficits is growing. This phenomenon often signals the onset of more severe cognitive decline, which has a strong impact on society. In light of this escalating challenge, there is an urgent need for innovative strategies aimed at enhancing cognitive functions and potentially mitigating cognitive decline.</p><p>Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have been largely used to enhance human cognition in the last two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antal et al., 2022</xref>). Encouraging results have been reported in both healthy and pathological conditions, including depression, stroke, and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blumberger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koch et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lefaucheur et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) are two forms of NIBS widely used to enhance memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grover et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). rTMS, based on the principle of Faraday, induces depolarization of cortical neuronal assemblies and leads to after-effects that have been linked to changes in synaptic plasticity involving mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jannati et al., 2023</xref>). On the other hand, tACS causes rhythmic fluctuations in neuronal membrane potentials, which can bias spike timing, leading to an entrainment of the neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wischnewski et al., 2023</xref>). In particular, the induction of gamma oscillatory activity has been proposed to play an important role in a type of LTP known as spike timing-dependent plasticity, which depends on a precise temporal delay between the firing of a presynaptic and a postsynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffiths and Jensen, 2023</xref>). Both LTP and gamma oscillations have a strong link with memory processes such as encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffiths and Jensen, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rossi et al., 2001</xref>), pointing to rTMS and tACS as good candidates for memory enhancement.</p><p>However, despite the increasing expectations, their overall effects are relatively modest, even with prolonged stimulation sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grover et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Polanía et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, the behavioral and clinical effects are extremely variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corp et al., 2020</xref>), especially when used to modulate memory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pabst et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies explored the possibility of combining these two techniques, showing that the simultaneous application of tACS in the range of the gamma frequency band (γtACS) with intermittent theta burst (iTBS), an rTMS protocol known to induce LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), enhances the after-effects of iTBS alone on the motor and prefrontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guerra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maiella et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Long-term memory formation has been associated with the neural activity of the precuneus (PC). The PC represents one of the main hubs of the default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavanna and Trimble, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cunningham et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jitsuishi and Yamaguchi, 2021</xref>) and is involved in the formation of associative, episodic, and autobiographic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnì et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flanagin et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, it is connected with the temporal lobe and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cunningham et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dadario and Sughrue, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tanglay et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, the PC represents an ideal target for NIBS to modulate memory functions with profound clinical implications, such as in the case of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koch et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koch et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koch et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koch et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that γtACS would activate key neural mechanisms underlying memory formation, favoring the iTBS-mediated plasticity induction by entraining and synchronizing endogenous gamma oscillations, thereby improving long-term memory. Thus, we reasoned that the dual application of iTBS and γtACS over the PC could be a promising tool for memory enhancement by enhancing plasticity mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dual precuneus iTBS + γtACS improves long-term associative memory performance</title><p>In the first experiment, subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 20) were asked to perform two tasks measuring long- and short-term memory performances immediately after three balanced, randomized, and double-blind stimulation conditions with a cross-over design (iTBS + γtACS, iTBS + sham-tACS, sham-iTBS + sham-tACS). Stimulation parameters were personalized and identified using functional MRI (fMRI) and TMS–EEG (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Long-term memory was assessed by the face–name associative task (FNAT), requiring the memorization of 12 faces with corresponding names and occupations, while short-term memory was assessed by the short-term memory binding test (STMB) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Individual target extraction and experimental design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Methodological workflow used to extract the individualized target for the neuromodulation protocol used in experiments 1, 3, and 4.

Target individualization was derived by computing a PC functional connectivity profile for each participant, thus obtaining a map of positively correlated voxels, respectively, representing the DMN (panel A, left). The individual stimulation targets were defined as the centroid of the strongest PC activation being on the top of a cortical gyrus and representing the shortest perpendicular path connecting the stimulating TMS coil on the scalp and the cortex (panel A, center).

The effect of simultaneous iTBS + γtACS on memory performance was investigated in experiments 1 (<bold>C</bold>) and 2 (<bold>D</bold>) through two memory tasks: the face–name associative task (FNAT), which required the memorization of 12 faces with corresponding names and occupations, and the visual short-term memory binding test (STMB), which consisted of a change detection task. In the main experiment 1 (<bold>C</bold>), subjects were involved in a cross-over design with different experimental sessions of neuromodulation separated by a washout week. Every session corresponded to a different balanced and randomized stimulation condition (i.e., iTBS + γtACS, iTBS + sham-tACS, sham-iTBS + sham-γtACS) immediately followed by the FNAT learning phase and immediate recall, the STMB and the FNAT delayed recall (15 min delayed) and recognition. In experiment 2 (<bold>D</bold>), subjects were involved in a cross-over design with two balanced and randomized stimulation conditions (i.e., iTBS + γtACS, iTBS + sham-tACS) separated by a washout week. During the first session (day 1), participants received the neuromodulation protocol and then performed the learning phase and immediate recall FNAT, the STMB, and the FNAT delayed recall. In the second session (day 2), participants performed FNAT recall with a 24-hr delay from the neuromodulation protocol, while in the third session (day 7), participants performed FNAT recall and recognition with a 1-week delay. In experiment 3 (<bold>E</bold>), participants were involved in two randomized and balanced experimental sessions of neuromodulation (i.e., iTBS + γtACS, iTBS + sham-tACS) separated by a washout week. TMS–EEG recordings were performed before (T0), immediately after (T1), and 20 min after the neuromodulation (T2). In experiment 4 (<bold>D</bold>), after the first MRI scanning used for neuronavigation, participants were involved in two randomized and balanced experimental sessions of neuromodulation (i.e., iTBS + γtACS, iTBS + sham-tACS) separated by a washout week. The fMRI scanning was performed before (T0) and immediately after (T1) the neuromodulation protocol.

Dual stimulation increased the ability to recall the association between faces, names, and occupations as compared to the iTBS alone or sham conditions. Moreover, the increased memory trace was long-lasting, being evident 1 week after the stimulation. On the other hand, iTBS alone did not result in any memory improvement, in agreement with previous studies showing contradictory effects of this protocol on neuroenhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hamada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ziemann and Siebner, 2015</xref>). Hence, we show that the combination of neuroplasticity induction promoted by iTBS and gamma oscillations entrainment produced by γtACS may be the key to memory boosting. We believe that the novel results reported here may have several implications for treating memory impairments, gamma dysregulation, and network dysfunction in a large variety of conditions.</p><p>Our results seem to identify the PC as having a role in mediating long-term memory formation. Given the existing evidence on TMS propagation and the computation of the biophysical model with the e-field, we can assume that the individually identified PC was involved in the observed effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ridding and Rothwell, 2007</xref>). Moreover, we observed specific cortical changes in the posteromedial parietal areas, as evidenced by the whole-brain analysis conducted on TMS–EEG data and the absence of effect on the lateral posterior parietal cortex used as a control condition. The PC has been associated with memory engram formation and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flanagin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hebscher et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, it is a prime candidate in processing relations among entities, including semantic concepts, making its activity fundamental for associative memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fernandino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rentz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Summerfield et al., 2020</xref>). These notions found support in our current findings, showing that neuromodulation of the PC resulted in an improvement of long-term associative memory.</p><p>Visual short-term associative memory, measured by STBM performance, was not modulated by any experimental condition. Even if we cannot exclude the possibility that the stimulation could have influenced short-term verbal associative memory, we expected this result since short-term associative memory is known to rely on a distinct frontoparietal network while FNAT, used to investigate long-term associative memory, has already been associated with the neural activity of the PC and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Parra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rentz et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, we observed a main effect on the ability to concomitantly recall face, name, and occupation, while for single association, we observed minimal (face–name) or no effect (face–occupation). Forming face–name associations is widely acknowledged to be particularly difficult due to the lack of contextual properties to formulate an associative link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Werheid and Clare, 2007</xref>). In contrast, forming an association between a face and other biographical information, such as occupations or hobbies, is easier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McWeeny et al., 1987</xref>). We can hypothesize that retaining multiple associations (face–name–occupation) together is even more effortful and cognitively demanding. For these reasons, the stimulation could have promoted effects in a gradient way related to the difficulty of the task.</p><p>Apart from improving long-term memory, dual iTBS + γtACS promoted a long-term increase in gamma oscillatory activity, as measured by TMS–EEG. Cortical gamma-band oscillations are thought to be primarily generated by parvalbumin-positive GABA-ergic interneurons interacting with excitatory pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cobb et al., 1995</xref>). The repeated activation of these circuits through gamma oscillations fosters LTP formation, which is the neurobiological basis of long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bikbaev and Manahan-Vaughan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Debanne and Inglebert, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Headley and Weinberger, 2011</xref>). This finding is consistent with the idea that increased gamma oscillatory activity may facilitate cortical plasticity, neural communication, and mechanisms of memory encoding and retrieval, thereby ensuring the successful formation of an episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffiths and Jensen, 2023</xref>). We hypothesize that γtACS, by entraining and synchronizing ongoing oscillatory gamma activity, may have facilitated the formation of LTP induced by iTBS.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that dual iTBS + γtACS enhanced the connections between the PC and the hippocampus as measured by fMRI connectivity analysis. Effective neural communication driven by gamma oscillations ensures that, during memory formation, incoming information processed in the neocortex activates the relevant cell assemblies in the hippocampus to ensure associative binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffiths and Jensen, 2023</xref>). Gamma-band oscillatory activity drives network connectivity, allowing for information processing and binding through synchronization between distant cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jensen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miltner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Osipova et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, we argue that PC gamma oscillations could have bound relevant stimuli for perceptual representation, while synchronization between cortical and hippocampal neurons could have allowed the representation to be encoded into the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nyhus and Curran, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our findings seem to suggest that higher functional connectivity was supported by higher white matter integrity (FA) of MdLF, the main white matter tract connecting the PC with the temporal lobe. Altogether, these results help to trace the possible anatomo-functional network engaged by PC stimulation, providing further support for the successful involvement of long-range pathways connecting the PC with the temporal lobe underlying memory formation.</p><p>A strength of the current work is the personalization of stimulation parameters that was achieved by targeting the PC spot more connected with the temporal lobe and by selecting the intensity of stimulation for iTBS using TMS–EEG. Hence, we argue that personalization of NIBS protocols is a key factor in reducing the inter-individual variability that currently limits the use of common protocols such as TBS and in increasing the overall beneficial effects on cognitive functions.</p><p>Why should the dual application of γtACS + iTBS lead to such a strong boosting effect as compared to iTBS alone? It is well established that tACS alone does not induce relevant after-effects, especially when applied for a short period of 3 min, such as in the current case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guerra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guerra et al., 2018</xref>). However, during stimulation, tACS alters membrane potential toward depolarization or hyperpolarization in an oscillatory fashion, manipulating the excitability of neurons that become aligned with the introduced electric field, mostly pyramidal cells in layer V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fröhlich and McCormick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guerra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schutter and Hortensius, 2011</xref>). Notably, these neurons are characterized by intrinsic resonance and neuroplastic activity. In particular, synchronous neural activation in the γ range is considered crucial for the induction of neuroplasticity and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>). Gamma oscillations can synchronize the firing of multiple presynaptic neurons so that they exert a stronger depolarizing effect on the target postsynaptic neuron than if they were to fire in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>). Synchronizing multiple inputs to a postsynaptic neuron enhances the likelihood of LTP. Hence, gamma oscillations are perhaps ideal because they provide a comparatively short window of excitability that ensures all neurons fire in near-perfect unison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jensen et al., 2007</xref>). This provides a long-sought link between gamma oscillations, LTP, and the formation of new memories. For these reasons, γtACS may have provided the ideal neural substrate for the iTBS to exert its plasticity induction mechanisms. This might have occurred by driving neuronal assemblies in a state devoted to inducing long-term changes in cortical networks involved in memory formation. In humans, iTBS has been inspired by protocols used in animal models to elicit LTP in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>On top of iTBS, γtACS may have synchronized PC neuronal elements, boosting gamma oscillatory activity during the induction of LTP driven by iTBS. Notably, this interaction is rather specific, since previous studies showed that the application of γtACS alone does not induce any after-effects, while only gamma, but not theta or beta tACS, combined with iTBS induces long-lasting changes in cortical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guerra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maiella et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, our biophysical modeling calculations showed that γtACS induced a marginal augmentation of the e-field (~0.15 mV), which is below the amount of induced current needed to induce an effect in superficial cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Opitz et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, tACS alone cannot account for the observed increase in memory as well as for enhancing cortical activity.</p><p>This study has some limitations. Although we studied TMS and tACS propagation through the e-field modeling and observed an increase in the precuneus gamma oscillatory activity, excitability, and connectivity with the hippocampi, we cannot exclude that our results might reflect the consequences of stimulating more superficial parietal regions other than the precuneus, nor report direct evidence of microscopic changes in the brain after the stimulation. Invasive neurophysiological recordings in humans for this type of study are not feasible due to ethical constraints. Studies on cadavers or rodents would not fully resolve our question due to significant differences between them (i.e., rodents do not have an anatomical correspondence, while cadavers have alterations in electrical conductivity occurring in postmortem tissue). However, further exploration of this aspect in future studies would help in the understanding of γtACS + iTBS effects.</p><p>We did not assess the effects of γtACS alone. This decision was based on the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guerra et al., 2018</xref>, who investigated the same protocol and reported no aftereffects. Given the substantial burden of the experimental design on patients and our primary goal of demonstrating an enhancement of effects compared to the standalone iTBS protocol, we decided to leave out this condition. While examining the effects of γtACS alone could help isolate its specific contribution to this target and memory function, extensive research has shown that achieving a cognitive enhancement aftereffect with tACS alone typically requires around 20–25 min of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grover et al., 2023</xref>). We did not study memory functions, gamma oscillations, and synchronization between the PC and hippocampus in the same session due to technical limitations with the current techniques (i.e., fMRI and TMS–EEG). Consequently, these findings do not allow precise inferences regarding the specific mechanisms by which dual iTBS and γtACS of the precuneus modulate learning and memory. Methodological restraints related to the high-frequency protocols employed in this study did not allow for closed-loop implementation. Moreover, we did not test tACS applied at different frequency bands combined with iTBS since our working hypothesis was based on the combination of gamma activity and plasticity induction.</p><p>Future studies should further investigate the effects of stimulation on distinct memory processes. In particular, stimulation could be applied before retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rossi et al., 2001</xref>) to better elucidate its specific contribution to the observed enhancements in memory performance. Additionally, it would be worth examining whether repeated stimulation, administered both before encoding and before retrieval, could produce a boosting effect.

RMT was tested over the relaxed first dorsal interosseous (FDI) hotspot of the primary motor cortex (M1) in the left dominant hemisphere, with the tACS electrode under the coil to guarantee the same scalp-to-coil distance of the neuromodulation protocol. Electromyographic activity was recorded from the contralateral FDI muscle, using two Ag–AgCl surface cup electrodes (9 mm) in a belly-tendon montage.

Right after the learning phase, there was an immediate cued recall phase, in which the participants were asked to recall the name and the occupation of each face previously shown while observing the faces again for 8 s each. The delayed cued recall consisted of showing the same faces and asking participants to say each name and occupation. Finally, during the recognition trial, participants were asked to recognize the studied face from a distractor face matched for age and sex. Then, for those names and/or occupations not recollected, they had to identify the correct name and/or occupation among three alternatives each.

Subjects were instructed not to focus their thoughts on any particular topic, not to cross their arms or legs, and to keep their eyes open.</p><p>For the individualization of the stimulation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, panel A), the functional ROI representing the PC node of the DMN (for experiments 1, 3, and 4) and the l-PPC node of the fronto-parietal network (FPN) (for experiment 3) was derived from the Harvard-Oxford atlas available in CONN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012</xref>). A seed-to-voxel correlation map was computed for each participant, thus obtaining a map of positively and negatively correlated voxels, respectively, representing the DMN and FPN. An investigator expert in MRI checked both rs-FC maps and structural MRI data (i.e., T1-weighted images) to identify individual hotspots based on ad hoc criteria. In particular, the stimulation sites were defined as the ones closest to the local maxima of the rs-FC cluster identified as DMN-PC and FPN-PPC, being on the top of a cortical gyrus and representing the shortest perpendicular path connecting the stimulating TMS coil on the scalp and the cortex. Based on best judgment, the resulting set of coordinates was picked as the individual stimulation site. The individual set of coordinates was then transformed using a nonlinear transformation to reconstruct the targets in individual brain spaces. Lastly, to ensure a coherent intrasession and intersession stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cocchi and Zalesky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fitzgerald et al., 2009</xref>), the individualized targets were marked in the subject’s anatomical MRI and loaded into our neuronavigation system. Both personalized points were used for the TMS–EEG assessment, whereas only the personalized PC was used for the neuromodulation protocol in experiments 1, 3 and 4. fMRI data preprocessing.</p><p>SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping), CONN, and MATLAB 2018a (MathWorks, MA, USA) software were used to preprocess datasets. The following preprocessing steps were applied to the BOLD images: discarding of the first three volumes to allow for steady-state magnetization and stabilization of participant status; slice timing; realigning to correct for head motion; co-registration to structural images; segmentation; nonlinear normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template brain; voxel resampling to an isotropic 3 × 3 × 3 mm voxel size; smoothing with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full-width at half maximum, 8 mm). Structural images were co‐registered to the mean volume of functional images and segmented. Linear trends were removed to reduce the influence of the rising temperature of the MRI scanner and all functional volumes were band-pass filtered at 0.01 Hz &lt; <italic>f</italic> &lt; 0.08 Hz to reduce low‐frequency drifts. Finally, we regress out potential confounding signals, like physiological high-frequency respiratory and cardiac noise, from gray matter voxels’ BOLD time course using the Compcorr algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012</xref>), to reduce artificial negative correlation and provide adequate filtering of the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>DTI preprocessing</title><p>The FMRIB Software Library (FSL) and DSI-studio were used to preprocess datasets. Binary masks were made and then the data were corrected for susceptibility artifacts using the TOPUP function. Volumes acquired with opposing phase-encoding directions were combined and then corrected for artifacts of motion and eddy-current distortion using EDDY. The corrected diffusion-weighted dataset and reoriented <italic>b</italic>-table were then imported to DSI Studio, registered (rigid body), and resampled to the space of T1. The accuracy of <italic>b</italic>-table orientation was examined by comparing fiber orientations with those of a population-averaged template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>). The restricted diffusion was quantified using restricted diffusion imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>). The diffusion data were reconstructed using generalized <italic>q</italic>-sampling imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yeh et al., 2010</xref>) with a diffusion sampling length ratio of 1.25. The tensor metrics were calculated using DWI with a <italic>b</italic>-value lower than 1750 s/mm². A deterministic fiber tracking algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yeh et al., 2013</xref>) was used with augmented tracking strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yeh, 2020</xref>) to improve reproducibility. The anatomy prior to a tractography atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>) was used to map the bilateral MdLF with a distance tolerance of 16 mm in the ICBM152 space. The anisotropy threshold was randomly selected. The angular threshold was randomly selected from 15° to 90°. The step size was randomly selected from 0.5 to 1.5 voxels. Tracks with lengths shorter than 30 or longer than 300 mm were discarded. A total of 10000 tracts was calculated. Topology-informed pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yeh et al., 2019</xref>) was applied to the tractography with 16 iterations to remove false connections. Finally, the MdLF FA was extracted for each subject.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Memory performance and local oscillatory changes data were analyzed through SPSS v22 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Before undergoing parametric or non-parametric statistical procedures, the assumption of normal distribution of data residuals was assessed with the Shapiro–Wilk test. The assumption of sphericity was tested with the Mauchly test; if this test was significant, we used the Huynh–Feldt correction. The level of significance was set at <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$\alpha = 0.05$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>.</p><p>To assess memory performances in experiment 1, we run repeated-measures ANOVAs with stimulation condition as a within-subject factor (i.e., iTBS + γtACS; iTBS + sham-tACS; sham-iTBS + sham-tACS) for each dependent variable. In detail, a separate ANOVA was conducted for every FNAT measure (i.e., name, occupation, total) on each memory process (i.e., immediate recall, delayed recall, and recognition). Separate ANOVAs were also conducted for STBM accuracy and RTs, both for the shape and the binding condition. Post hoc comparisons were performed with paired <italic>t</italic>-tests corrected with the Bonferroni method.</p><p>To confirm the results obtained from experiment 1 and to investigate the long-lasting effect on long-term memory, we performed experiment 2, where we first ran a repeated-measures ANOVA with stimulation condition as a within-subject factor (i.e., iTBS + γtACS, iTBS + sham-tACS) for the immediate recall, as in experiment 1. Then, a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted for FNAT delayed recall performance, where stimulation condition (i.e., iTBS + γtACS, iTBS + sham-tACS) and time (i.e., days 1, 2, and 7) were considered as within-subject factors. Following the results obtained in this analysis (see ‘results’ paragraph), we conducted exploratory paired <italic>t</italic>-tests aimed at investigating the effect of stimulation conditions on each time point.</p><p>Since we do not have an a priori effect size for experiments 1 and 2, we performed a sensitivity power analysis to ensure that these experiments were able to detect the minimum effect size with 80% power and an alpha level of 0.05.</p><p>To assess cortical oscillation changes in experiment 3, we computed repeated-measures ANOVAs with stimulation condition (iTBS + γtACS, iTBS + sham-tACS) and time T1–T0, T2–T0 (ΔT1, ΔT2) as within factors for each frequency band. Also, in this case, paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted to investigate the effect of stimulation conditions on each time point. A one-tailed hypothesis was considered, given the precise hypothesis of gamma increase deriving from our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maiella et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To assess cortical excitability effects, we used multiple paired <italic>t</italic>-tests. The analysis was run in the four time windows of the TEP waveform (i.e., 10–30, 21–60, 61–120, and 121–150 ms after TMS; see paragraph ‘Cortical excitability’ in ‘TMS–EEG data acquisition and preprocessing’) comparing T1 and T2 to T0 in each stimulation condition. To reduce the occurrence of type I errors, we used the Monte Carlo method, which computes the estimates of the significance probabilities from two surrogate distributions constructed by randomly permuting the two original conditions’ data 3000 times. Moreover, p-values were corrected with the false discovery rate (FDR) method considering the number of electrodes and were considered significant when at least 10 successive <italic>t</italic>-tests reached the significance threshold (p &lt; 0.05). The same statistical analysis was performed to assess changes in source activation. The time series extracted and analyzed from the ROIs (see paragraph ‘source activation’ in ‘TMS–EEG data acquisition and preprocessing’) ranged from −50 to 150 ms from the TMS pulse. As for excitability analysis, we avoided the occurrence of type I errors by implementing Monte Carlo permutation and considering a significant result when at least 10 successive <italic>t</italic>-tests reached the significance threshold (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>To test rs-FC modulation, we used a general linear model. The statistical analyses were carried out using the CONN (v.20b) toolbox and Matlab 2018b software (Mathworks, MA, USA) and were performed considering stimulation conditions (i.e., iTBS + γtACS and iTBS + sham-tACS) and time points (i.e., pre and post) as factors. In particular, we performed an ROI-to-ROI analysis focusing on six specific ROIs, based on our hypothesis: left and right PPC, medial prefrontal cortex, PC, left and right hippocampus, chosen based on the Harvard-Oxford (cortical and subcortical) atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/">https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Desikan et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, rs-FC changes were calculated by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient between the average time series extracted from each individual ROI. Multiple comparisons between ROIs were then performed using a two-sided contrast with a cluster level of p &lt; 0.05 FDR-corrected. In addition, the significant nodes were considered as seeds for the voxel-wise analysis, specifically performed by comparing the pre- and post-iTBS + γtACS. Temporal correlations were calculated between these seeds and all other voxels in the brain. Results were computed by applying a cluster-level threshold of p &lt; 0.05 FDR-corrected.</p><p>The sample size for experiments 3 and 4 was estimated based on a previous study using the same protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maiella et al., 2022</xref>).

In their first experiment (n = 20), they find that a 3-minute offline (i.e., prior to task completion) stimulation that combines both techniques leads to superior memory recall performance in an associative memory task immediately after learning associations between pictures of faces, names, and occupation, as well as after a 15-minute delay, compared to iTBS alone (+ tACS sham) or no stimulation (sham for both iTBS and tACS). Performance in a second task probing short-term memory was unaffected by the stimulation condition. In a second experiment (n = 10), they show that these effects persist over 24 hours and up to a full week after initial stimulation. A third (n = 14) and fourth (n = 16) experiment were conducted to investigate neural effects of the stimulation protocol. The authors report that, once again, only combined iTBS and γtACS increases gamma oscillatory activity and neural excitability (as measured by concurrent TMS-EEG) specific to the stimulated area at the precuneus compared to a control region, as well as precuneus-hippocampus functional connectivity (measured by resting state MRI), which seemed to be associated with structural white matter integrity of the bilateral middle longitudinal fasciculus (measured by DTI).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Combining non-invasive brain stimulation techniques is a novel, potentially very powerful method to maximize the effects of these kinds of interventions that are usually well-tolerated and thus accepted by patients and healthy participants. It is also very impressive that the stimulation-induced improvements in memory performance resulted from a short (3 min) intervention protocol. If the effects reported here turn out to be as clinically meaningful and generalizable across populations as implied, this approach could represent a promising avenue for treatment of impaired memory functions in many conditions.</p><p>Methodologically, this study is expertly done! I don't see any serious issues with the technical setup in any of the experiments. It is also very commendable that the authors conceptually replicated the behavioral effects of experiment 1 in experiment 2 and then conducted two additional experiments to probe the neural mechanisms associated with these effects. This certainly increases the value of the study and the confidence in the results considerably.</p><p>The authors used a within-subject approach in their experiments, which increases statistical power and allows for stronger inferences about the tested effects. They also used to individualize stimulation locations and intensities, which should further optimize the signal-to-noise ratio.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors make a bold claim that a combination of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (intermittent theta burst-iTBS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (gamma tACS) causes slight improvements in memory in a face/name/profession task.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The idea of stimulating the human brain non-invasively is very attractive because, if it worked, it could lead to a host of interesting applications. The current study aims to evaluate one such exciting application.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The title refers to the &quot;precuneus-hippocampus&quot; network. A clear definition of what is meant by this terminology is lacking. More importantly, mechanistic evidence that the precuneus and the hippocampus are involved in the potential effects of stimulation remains unconvincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the observation. We believe that the evidence collected supports our state relative to the stimulation of the precuneus and the involvement of the hippocampus. In particular, given the existing evidence on TMS methodology and precuneus non-invasive stimulation (see Koch et al., Brain, 2022, Koch et al., Alzheimer's research &amp; therapy, 2025), the computation of the biophysical model with the E-field we produced (see Biophysical modeling and E-field calculation section in the supplementary information), together with the individual identification of the precuneus through the RM (see iTBS+γtACS neuromodulation protocol and MRI data acquisition in the main text), we can reasonably assume that the individually identified PC was stimulated.</p><p>As we acknowledged in the Limitations section, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that our results might also reflect stimulation of more superficial parietal regions adjacent to the precuneus. Nor do we provide direct evidence of microscopic changes in the precuneus following stimulation. However, the results we provide in terms of changes in precuneus oscillatory activity and precuneus-hippocampi connectivity sustain both our thesis of the precuneus stimulation and of hippocampi involvement in the stimulation effects.</p><p>Despite this consideration, we agree on the fact that a clear definition of what is meant by the terminology “precuneus-hippocampus network” is lacking. Moreover, since our data and previous evidence sustain the notion of PC stimulation, while this study does not produce direct evidence of the hippocampi stimulation - but only of the effect of the neuromodulation protocol on its connection with the precuneus, we soften the claim in the title. We remove the mention of the precuneus-hippocampus network so that the modified title will be as follows: “Dual transcranial electromagnetic stimulation of the precuneus boosts human long-term memory.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The question of the extent to which the stimulation approach and the stimulation parameters used in these experiments causes specific and functionally relevant neural effects remains open. Invasive recordings that could address this question remain out of the scope of this non-invasive study. The authors conducted scalp EEG experiments in an attempt to address this question using non-invasive methods. However, the results shown in Fig. 3 are unclear. The results are inconsistently reported in units of microvolts squared in some panels (3A, 3B) and in units of microvolts in other panels (3C). Also, there is insufficient consideration of potential contamination by signal components reflecting eye movements, other muscle artifacts, or another volume-conducted signal reflecting aggregate activity inside the brain.</p></disp-quote><p>As you correctly noted, Figure 3 presents results obtained from the TMS–EEG recordings. However, there is no inconsistency regarding the measurement units, as we are referring to two distinct indices: one in the frequency domain—oscillatory power shown in Figures 3A and 3B, expressed in microvolts squared (μV<sup>²</sup>)—and one in the time domain—the TMS-evoked potential shown in Figure 3C, expressed in microvolts (μV).</p><p>Regarding the concern about artifacts, this is an important issue on which our group has a strong expertise, having published well-established, highly cited procedures on how to record and clean TMS-EEG signals (e.g., Casula et al., Clinical Neurophysiology, 2017; Rocchi et al., Brain Stimulation, 2021). In the current study, we adopted a well-established and rigorous approach for both data acquisition and preprocessing. This ensured that the recorded TMS–EEG signals were not contaminated by physiological or electrical artifacts.</p><p>As regards the recording procedure, all participants were instructed to fixate on a black cross to minimize eye movements. To avoid auditory-related components caused by the TMS click, we adopted an ad-hoc procedure optimized for TMS-EEG recordings (Rocchi et al., Brain Stimulation, 2021). First, participants were given earphones that continuously played an ad-hoc masking noise composed of white noise mixed with specific time-varying frequencies of the TMS click (Rocchi et al., Brain Stimulation, 2021). The masking noise volume was adjusted to ensure that participants could not detect the TMS click, or as much as tolerated (always below 90 dB). To further reduce the impact of the TMS click on the EEG signal, we placed ear defenders (SNR=30) on top of the earphones. Please see TMS–EEG data acquisition section in the main text.</p><p>As regards the offline cleaning process, we applied Independent Component Analysis (INFOMAX-ICA) to the EEG data to identify and remove components associated with muscle activity, eye movements, blinking, and residual TMS-related artifacts, in line with the most recent guidelines on TMS–EEG preprocessing (Hernandez-Pavon et al., Brain Stimulation, 2023). Specifically, for TMS-related muscle artefacts, we strictly followed the criteria based on their scalp topography, spectral content, timing, and amplitude, which we published in a paper focused on this topic (Casula et al., Clinical Neurophysiology, 2017). We add this detail in the TMS–EEG preprocessing and analysis section in the supplementary information (lines 119-120).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 3 indicates &quot;Precuneus oscillatory activity ...&quot;, but evidence that the activity presented reflects precuneus activity is lacking. The maps shown at the bottom of Figure 3C suggest that the EEG signals recorded with scalp EEG reflect activity generated across a wide spatial range, with a peak encompassing at least tens of centimeters. Thus, evidence that effects specifically reflect precuneus activity, as the paper's title and text throughout the manuscript suggest, is lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe there may have been a misunderstanding. As indicated in the figure caption, panels A and B represent oscillatory activity, whereas panel C displays the TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). Therefore, the topographical maps mentioned (i.e., those in panel C) did not refer to oscillatory activity, but to differences in TEP amplitude. Specifically, the topographies shown in Figure 3C illustrate statistically significant differences in TEP amplitudes between post-stimulation time points (T1—immediately after stimulation, and T2—20 minutes after stimulation) and the pre-stimulation baseline (T0).</p><p>In this figure, we focused our analysis on a cluster of electrodes overlying the individually identified precuneus, capturing EEG responses to single TMS pulses delivered to that target. This approach, widely used in previous literature (e.g., Koch et al., NeuroImage, 2018; Casula et al., Annals of Neurology, 2022; Koch et al., Brain, 2022; Maiella et al., Clinical Neurophysiology, 2024; Koch et al., Alzheimer’s Research &amp; Therapy, 2025), supports the interpretation that the observed responses reflect precuneus-related activity. Furthermore, the wide spatial range change you mention proved to be statistically different only when conducting the TMS-EEG over the precuneus (i.e., administering the TMS single pulse over the precuneus) and not when performing it over the left parietal cortex. We modified the discussion section in the main text to make it more clear (lines 196-199).</p><p>“Moreover, we observed specific cortical changes in the posteromedial parietal areas, as evidenced by the whole-brain analysis conducted on TMS-EEG data when performed over the precuneus and the absence of effect when TMS-EEG was performed on the lateral posterior parietal cortex used as a control condition.”</p><p>That said, we do not state that the effects observed specifically reflect the precuneus activity; indeed, we think the effect of the stimulation is broader, as discussed in the Discussion section. We rather sustain, in line with the literature (Koch et al., Neuroimage 2018; Koch et al., Brain, 2022; Koch et al., Alzheimer's research &amp; therapy, 2025), the idea that the effects observed are a consequence of the precuneus stimulation by the dual stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The paper as currently presented (e.g., Figure 3) also lacks rigorous evidence of relevant oscillatory activity. Prior to filtering EEG signals in a particular frequency band, clear evidence of oscillations in the frequency band of interest should be shown (e.g., demonstration of a clear peak that emerges naturally in the frequency range of interest when spectral analysis is applied to &quot;raw&quot; signals). The authors claim that gamma oscillations change because of the stimulation, but a clear peak in the gamma range prior to stimulation is not apparent in the data as currently presented. Thus, the extent to which spectral measurements during stimulation reflect physiological gamma oscillations remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand correctly, your concern relates to the lack of a clear gamma peak before neuromodulation, which may suggest uncertainty about the observed changes in gamma oscillatory activity. Is that correct?</p><p>First, it is important to underline that the natural frequency typically observed in the precuneus falls within the beta range, not the gamma range (see Rosanova et al., Journal of Neuroscience, 2009; Casula et al., Annals of Neurology, 2022). This explains why a prominent gamma peak is not expected at baseline (T0).</p><p>Differently, our neuromodulatory protocol was specifically aimed at boosting gamma oscillatory activity given its well-established role in learning and memory processes (Griffiths &amp; Jensen, Trends in Neurosciences, 2023). Thus, to assess the effect of the neuromodulatory protocol, we compared the oscillatory activity before (T0) and after stimulation (T1 and T2), which showed a clear increase in the gamma band. This effect is visible in the raw oscillatory power plot and is most clearly represented in Figure 3B, where the gamma band emerged as the only frequency range showing significant changes across time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Concerns remain regarding the rigor of statistical analyses in the revised manuscript (see also point 8 below). Figure 3B shows an undefined statistical test with p&lt;0.05. The statistical test that was used is not explained. Also, a description of how corrections for multiple comparisons were made is missing. Figures 3A and 3C are not accompanied by statistics, making the results difficult to interpret. For Figure 4C, a claim was made based on a significant p-value for one statistical test and a non-significant p-value in another test. This is a common statistical mistake (see Figure 1 and accompanying discussion in Makin and Orban de Xivry (2019) Science Forum: Ten common statistical mistakes to watch out for when writing or reviewing a manuscript. eLife 8:e48175).</p></disp-quote><p>All statistical tests are described in the Statistical Analysis section of the main text. Specifically, to assess cortical oscillation changes in Experiment 3, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVAs with stimulation condition (iTBS+γtACS vs. iTBS+sham-tACS) and time (ΔT1 = T1–T0; ΔT2 = T2–T0) as within-subject factors, for each frequency band. To further explore the effects of stimulation at each time point, we performed paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A one-tailed hypothesis was adopted, based on our a priori prediction of gamma-band increase derived from previous work (Maiella et al., 2022).</p><p>Please note that Figures 3A and 3C are purely descriptive and are therefore not accompanied by statistical tests. Figure 3A shows the full spectral profile across frequencies and conditions, while statistical significance for these data is reported in Figure 3B. Similarly, the upper part of Figure 3C displays the TMS-evoked potential (TEP) in the precuneus, while the statistical comparison of TEP amplitudes across time points is shown in the lower part of Figure 3C.</p><p>Regarding Figure 4C and the article you cited, are you referring to the error described as “Interpreting comparisons between two effects without directly comparing them”? If we understand correctly, this refers to the mistake of inferring an effect by observing that a significant result occurs in one condition or group, while the corresponding result in another condition or group is not significant, without directly testing the difference between them.</p><p>In the case of Experiment 4, which investigates fMRI effects and is illustrated in Figure 4, we employed a general linear model that explicitly modeled both conditions and time points, allowing for a direct statistical comparison. Therefore, the connectivity effect reported does not fall into the category of the error you mentioned.</p><p>Importantly, Figure 4C does not depict the effect of the neuromodulatory protocol itself. Rather, its purpose is to show that, within the real stimulation condition, there is a correlation between the observed effect and the integrity of the bilateral Middle Longitudinal Fasciculus. No conclusions or assumptions were made based on the absence of a significant correlation in the sham condition. However, since it was an exploratory analysis, we decided to soften our claims relative to the neural mechanism in the discussion section of the main text (lines 241-246).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In the second question posed in the original review, I highlighted that it was unclear how such stimulation would produce memory enhancement. The authors replied that, in the absence of mechanisms, there are many other studies that suffer from the same problem. This raises the question of placebo effects. The paper does not sufficiently address or discuss the possibility that any potential stimulation effects may reflect placebo effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on the potential role of a placebo effect in our study. For this reason, our experimental study had several stimulation conditions, including a placebo condition, which corresponded to the sham iTBS-sham tACS condition, which did not produce any effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The third major concern in the original review was the lack of evidence for a mechanism that is specific to the precuneus. Evidence for specific involvement of the precuneus remains lacking in the revised manuscript. The authors state: &quot;the non-invasive stimulation protocol was applied to an individually identified precuneus for each participant&quot;. However, the meaning of this statement is unclear. Specifically, it is unclear how the authors know that they are specifically targeting the precuneus. Without directly recording from the precuneus and directly demonstrating effects, which is outside of the scope of the study, specific involvement of the precuneus seems speculative. Also, it does not seem as though a figure was included in the paper to show how the stimulation protocol specifically targets the precuneus. In their response to the original reviews, the authors state that posterior medial parietal areas are the only regions that show significant differences following the stimulation, but they did not cite a specific figure, or statistics reported in the text, that show this. In any event, posterior medial parietal areas encompass a wide area of the brain, so this would still not provide evidence for an effect specifically involving the precuneus.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the claim that targeting the precuneus in our study is speculative. The statement that “without directly recording from the precuneus and directly demonstrating effects, which is outside the scope of the study, specific involvement of the precuneus seems speculative” would, by that logic, implicitly call into question a large body of cognitive neuroscience research employing non-invasive techniques such as EEG and fMRI.</p><p>Our methodological approach—combining MRI-guided stimulation, biophysical modeling, and TMS–EEG—is well established and widely used for targeting and studying the role of specific cortical regions, including the precuneus (e.g., Wang et al., Science, 2014; Koch et al., NeuroImage, 2018; Casula et al., Annals of Neurology, 2022, 2023; Koch et al., Brain, 2022; Maiella et al., Clinical Neurophysiology, 2024; Koch et al., Alzheimer’s Research &amp; Therapy, 2025).</p><p>In line with previously published protocols (Santarnecchi et al., Human Brain Mapping, 2018; Özdemir et al., PNAS, 2020; Mantovani et al., Journal of Psychiatric Research, 2021), we identified individual targets (i.e., the precuneus) for each participant based on structural and resting-state functional MRI data (see MRI Data Acquisition and Preprocessing section in the main text). This target was then accurately localized using MRI-guided stereotaxic neuronavigation, ensuring reproducible and anatomically precise stimulation across subjects.</p><p>Finally, concerning the last comment about the lack of figures/statistics showing how the stimulation protocol targets the precuneus and the specificity of the effect observed, we would like to let the focus go over:</p><p>Figure 3 in the main text, where we show the results of the TME-EEG over the posterior medial parietal areas;</p><p>Figure S1 in the supplementary information, which shows with the e-fied simulation how the stimulation protocol targets the brain;</p><p>the Precuneus iTBS+γtACS increases gamma oscillatory activity section in the main text results, where we report the results of the statistical analysis of the TMS-EEG conducted over the precuneus and the left posterior parietal cortex, used as a control condition to test for the specificity of the neuromodulation protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Regarding chance levels, it is unfortunate that the authors cannot quantify what chance levels are in the immediate and delayed recall conditions. This makes interpretation of the results challenging. In the immediate and delayed conditions, the authors state that the chance level is 33%. It would be useful to mark this in the figures. If I understand correctly, chance is 33% in Fig. 2A. If this is the case and if I am interpreting the figure correctly:</p><p>Gray bars for the sham condition appear to be below chance (~20-25%). Why is this condition associated with an accuracy level that is lower than chance?</p><p>Cyan bars and red bars do not appear to be significantly different from chance (i.e., 33%), with red slightly higher than cyan. What statistic was performed to obtain the level of significance indicated in the figure? The highest average value for the red condition appears to be around 35%. More details are needed to fully explain this figure and to support the claims associated with this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>The immediate and recall conditions you mention correspond to a free recall task. In this case, the notion of a fixed &quot;chance level&quot; is not straightforward as it would be in recognition or forced-choice paradigms, which is why we did not quantify it at first. I will now try to explain this extensively.</p><p>Unlike multiple-choice tasks, where participants select the answer from a limited set of alternatives and the probability of a correct response by chance can be precisely quantified (e.g., 33% in a 3-alternative forced choice), free recall involves the spontaneous retrieval of items from memory without external cues or predefined options. As such, the response range in free recall is essentially unconstrained, encompassing the entire vocabulary of the participant.</p><p>Because of this open-ended nature, the probability of correctly recalling a studied item purely by chance is exceedingly low and could be approximated to zero. Also, in our task, participants had to correctly recollect both name and occupation, doubling the possibility of the answers.</p><p>This assumption is further supported by the fact that random guesses in free recall are unlikely to match any of the studied items, given the vast number of possible alternatives. As a result, performance above zero can be reasonably interpreted as reflecting genuine memory retrieval, rather than random guessing.</p><p>As regards statistics, repeated-measures ANOVAs with stimulation condition as a within-subject factor (i.e., iTBS+γtACS; iTBS+sham-tACS; sham-iTBS+sham-tACS) for each dependent variable (see statistical analysis section in main text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) In the revised version of the paper, the authors did not address concerns associated with the block design (please see question 4d in the original review).</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the misunderstanding. We did not address your concerns related to block design since it does not apply to our study. As reported in the paper you mentioned in the original review, block design involves data collection performed in response to different stimuli of a given class presented in succession. If this is the case, it does not correspond to our experimental design since both TMS-EEG and fMRI were conducted in the resting state (i.e., without the presentation of stimuli) on different days according to the different randomized stimulation conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, this study presents an admirable aspirational goal, the notion that a non-invasive stimulation protocol could modulate activity in specific brain regions to enhance memory. However, the evidence presented at the behavioral level and at the mechanistic level (e.g. the putative involvement of specific brain regions) remains unconvincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope our response will be carefully considered, fostering a constructive exchange and leading to a reassessment of your evaluation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Borghi and colleagues provides evidence that the combination of intermittent theta burst TMS stimulation and gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation (γtACS) targeting the precuneus increases long-term associative memory in healthy subjects compared to iTBS alone and sham conditions. Using a rich dataset of TMS-EEG and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) maps and structural MRI data, the authors also provide evidence that dual stimulation increased gamma oscillations and functional connectivity between the precuneus and hippocampus. Enhanced memory performance was linked to increased gamma oscillatory activity and connectivity through white matter tracts.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The combination of personalized repetitive TMS (iTBS) and gamma tACS is a novel approach to targeting the precuneus, and thereby, connected memory-related regions to enhance long-term associative memory. The authors leverage an existing neural mechanism engaged in memory binding, theta-gamma coupling, by applying TMS at theta burst patterns and tACS at gamma frequencies to enhance gamma oscillations. The authors conducted a thorough study that suggests that simultaneous iTBS and gamma tACS could be a powerful approach for enhancing long-term associative memory. The paper was well-written, clear, and concise.</p><p>Comments on Revision:</p><p>I thank the authors for their thoughtful responses to my first review and their inclusion of more detailed methodological discussion of their rationale for the stimulation protocol conditions and timing. Regarding the apparent difference in connectivity at baseline between conditions, the explanation that this is due to intrinsic dynamics, state, or noise implies the baseline is reflecting transient changes in dynamics rather than a true or stable baseline. Based on this, it looks like iTBS solely is significantly greater than the baseline before the iTBS and γtACS condition but maybe not that much lower than post-stimulation period for iTBS and γtACS. A longer baseline period should be used to ensure transient states are not driving baseline levels such that these endogenous fluctuations would average out. This also raises questions about whether the effect of iTBS and γtACS or iTBS alone are dependent on the intrinsic state at the time when stimulation begins. Their additional clarification of memory scoring is helpful but also reveals that the effect of dual iTBS+γtACS specifically on the association between faces and names is just significant. This modest increase in associative memory should be taken into consideration when interpreting these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the feedback. We fully agree that considering baseline dynamics is critical when assessing the neurophysiological and connectivity effects of stimulation protocols.</p><p>In Experiments 3 and 4, baseline measurements were specifically included in our design to account for the possibility that intrinsic dynamics, state, or noise could influence the observed effects of neuromodulation. Indeed, if we had compared only post-stimulation connectivity between the real and sham conditions, the effects might have appeared larger. The inclusion of baseline measurements allows us to contextualize and better isolate the neuromodulatory impact by controlling such endogenous fluctuations. Importantly, the fMRI connectivity measurements, which comprise the baseline, are derived from 10-minute BOLD signal acquisitions, which help mitigate the influence of transient fluctuations and provide a quite stable estimate of intrinsic connectivity.</p><p>Moreover, regarding the possibility that stimulation effects may depend on the intrinsic state at stimulation onset, we hypothesize that gamma-frequency entrainment induced by tACS could reduce the variability of intrinsic dynamics, promoting a more stable neural state that is favorable for the induction of long-term plasticity.</p><p>As regards the memory scoring, we would like to clarify that the significant improvement observed in the dual iTBS+γtACS condition does not pertain solely to the face–name association. Rather, it concerns the more demanding task of recalling the association between face, name, and occupation. While we agree that the observed effect could be considered modest, it is worth noting that it follows from only 3 minutes of stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Borghi and colleagues present results from 4 experiments aimed at investigating the effects of dual γtACS and iTBS stimulation of the precuneus on behavioral and neural markers of memory formation. In their first experiment (n = 20), they find that a 3-minute offline (i.e., prior to task completion) stimulation that combines both techniques leads to superior memory recall performance in an associative memory task immediately after learning associations between pictures of faces, names, and occupation, as well as after a 15-minute delay, compared to iTBS alone (+ tACS sham) or no stimulation (sham for both iTBS and tACS). Performance in a second task probing short-term memory was unaffected by the stimulation condition. In a second experiment (n = 10), they show that these effects persist over 24 hours and up to a full week after initial stimulation. A third (n = 14) and fourth (n = 16) experiment were conducted to investigate neural effects of the stimulation protocol. The authors report that, once again, only combined iTBS and γtACS increases gamma oscillatory activity and neural excitability (as measured by concurrent TMS-EEG) specific to the stimulated area at the precuneus compared to a control region, as well as precuneus-hippocampus functional connectivity (measured by resting state MRI), which seemed to be associated with structural white matter integrity of the bilateral middle longitudinal fasciculus (measured by DTI).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Combining non-invasive brain stimulation techniques is a novel, potentially very powerful method to maximize the effects of these kinds of interventions that are usually well-tolerated and thus accepted by patients and healthy participants. It is also very impressive that the stimulation-induced improvements in memory performance resulted from a short (3 min) intervention protocol. If the effects reported here turn out to be as clinically meaningful and generalizable across populations as implied, this approach could represent a promising avenue for treatment of impaired memory functions in many conditions.</p><p>Methodologically, this study is expertly done! I don't see any serious issues with the technical setup in any of the experiments. It is also very commendable that the authors conceptually replicated the behavioral effects of experiment 1 in experiment 2 and then conducted two additional experiments to probe the neural mechanisms associated with these effects. This certainly increases the value of the study and the confidence in the results considerably.</p><p>The authors used a within-subject approach in their experiments, which increases statistical power and allows for stronger inferences about the tested effects. They also used to individualize stimulation locations and intensities, which should further optimize the signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I think one of the major weaknesses of this study is the overall low sample size in all of the experiments (between n = 10 and n = 20). This is, as I mentioned when discussing the strengths of the study, partly mitigated by the within-subject design and individualized stimulation parameters. The authors mention that they performed a power analysis but this analysis seemed to be based on electrophysiological readouts similar to those obtained in experiment 3. It is thus unclear whether the other experiments were sufficiently powered to reliably detect the behavioral effects of interest. In the revised manuscript, the authors provide post-hoc sensitivity analyses that help contextualize the strength of the findings.</p><p>While the authors went to great lengths trying to probe the neural changes likely associated with the memory improvement after stimulation, it is impossible from their data to causally relate the findings from experiments 3 and 4 to the behavioral effects in experiments 1 and 2. This is acknowledged by the authors and there are good methodological reasons for why TMS-EEG and fMRI had to be collected in separate experiments, but readers should keep in mind that this limits inferences about how exactly dual iTBS and γtACS of the precuneus modulate learning and memory.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I suggest:</p><p>(1) Removing all mechanistic claims about the precuneus and hippocampus.</p></disp-quote><p>We soften our claims about the precuneus-hippocampus network.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Repeating and focusing on the behavioral experiments with a much larger number of images and stronger statistical power to try to demonstrate a compelling behavioral correlate of the proposed stimulation protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the misunderstanding relative to the chance level of the behavioral experiments raised by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Use longer baseline to establish stable gamma level for comparisons in Figure 3</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand correctly, you propose to increase the baseline to establish the gamma oscillatory activity as expressed in Figure 3 (showing the results of experiment 3). Is that right? In the figure, you see a baseline of -100; 0ms, which we use for a merely graphical reason, since no activity is usually observable before the TMS pulse. However, to establish the level of gamma, we used a larger baseline correction ranging from -700 ms to -300 ms (i.e., 400ms). We added this important information in the cortical oscillation section of the supplementary information (lines 134-135).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I think that the authors did a great job responding to the concerns raised by the reviewers. All of my own comments have been satisfactorily addressed. I will update my public review to be more concise, so that it only includes the overall assessment of the manuscript, including the strengths and weaknesses, but without the requests for clarification. Strengths and weaknesses remain largely the same, as the authors did not conduct additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.</p></body></sub-article></article>
