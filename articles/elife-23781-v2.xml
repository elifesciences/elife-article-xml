At the onset of this process, the inner mitochondrial membrane becomes depolarized and permeable to osmolytes, proposedly due to the opening of a non-selective protein channel of unknown molecular identity. A recent study purports that this channel, referred to as Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (MPTP), is formed within the c-subunit ring of the ATP synthase, upon its dissociation from the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Here, we examine this claim for two c-rings of different lumen width, through calculations of their ion conductance and selectivity based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We also quantify the likelihood that the lumen of these c-rings is in a hydrated, potentially conducting state rather than empty or blocked by lipid molecules. These calculations demonstrate that the structure and biophysical properties of a correctly assembled c-ring are inconsistent with those attributed to the MPTP.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23781.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23781.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>bioenergetics</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Wenchang</given-names></name><name><surname>Marinelli</surname><given-names>Fabrizio</given-names></name><name><surname>Faraldo-Gómez</surname><given-names>José D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The notion that the lumen of the ATP synthase membrane rotor is the long-sought megachannel that triggers the onset of the mitochondrial permeability transition is found to be inconsistent with its actual structural and functional properties.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Under certain pathological conditions mitochondria cease ATP production and instead trigger apoptosis. At the onset of this process is the depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which under normal conditions sustains the proton-motive-force powering the ATP synthase. It has long been hypothesized that this depolarization is mediated by a channel protein referred to as the Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (MPTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Szabó and Zoratti, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardi and Forte, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Halestrap, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzolin et al., 2010</xref>). The hallmark properties of this putative channel are: very large ionic conductance (up to 1300 pS); high permeability to small molecules, including osmolytes (less than 1.5 kDa); and no solute specificity (aside from size-limit) or ion selectivity. Thus, opening of the MPTP, thought to be induced, for example, by excessive amounts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or ROS in the mitochondrial matrix, is catastrophic for the cell: not only does it short-circuit the respiratory chain, causing the ATP synthase to reverse its activity and deplete cellular ATP, but it also induces the osmotic swelling of the matrix, rupturing the outer membrane and causing the release of pro-apoptotic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Halestrap, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The molecular identity of the MPTP remains to be established. Seemingly promising studies have implicated mitochondrial proteins as diverse as the outer-membrane Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC), the inner-membrane Adenine Nucleotide Translocase (ANT), and the non-transmembrane cyclophilin D; ultimately, however, none of these proteins was found to be actually essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardi and Forte, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Halestrap, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzolin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardi et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, Jonas and co-workers have proposed that a sub-complex of the mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, known as the c-ring, is the MPTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavian et al., 2014</xref>). The c-ring is an oligomer of identical copies of subunit-c, each of which is a hairpin of two transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>); when assembled, these helices are arranged in two concentric rings around a central lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pogoryelov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Symersky et al., 2012</xref>). The F<sub>1</sub> domain, which projects out of the membrane and contains the catalytic domain, sits atop the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dautant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watt et al., 2010</xref>). In the operating enzyme, the membrane F<sub>o</sub> domain works like a turbine, with the c-ring rotating against other static elements as protons sequentially bind to each of the c-subunits and are released across the membrane after a revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Meier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Leone and Faraldo-Gómez, 2016</xref>). These proton-binding sites are on the outer surface of the ring, and feature a conserved glutamate and other polar groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pogoryelov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Symersky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vollmar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>); the lumen, by contrast, is largely hydrophobic. What Jonas et al. propose is that the metabolic conditions associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition induce the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>o</sub> sectors to dissociate, upon which the lumen of the c-ring would become the MPTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavian et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to directly investigate the plausibility of this claim, which has been questioned by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Halestrap, 2014</xref>). Specifically, we consider two c-rings of different size, and examine their ion-conducting properties under the assumption that their lumen is hydrated. Independently, we examine the validity of this assumption, that is, we evaluate whether a hydrated lumen, which is a requisite for ion/solute permeation, is more or less probable than an empty lumen or a lumen occupied by a lipid bilayer, which would not permit conduction at the expected rates. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the c-subunit ring, if correctly folded and assembled, is not the elusive MPTP, even if it did in fact became detached from the F<sub>1</sub> sector.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The hydrated c-ring lumen does not conduct like the MPTP</title><p>We first considered the c<sub>10</sub>-ring from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which is the only mitochondrial c-ring of known atomic structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Symersky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>).

(Note the mitochondrial permeability transition has also been observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzolin et al., 2010</xref>)). To evaluate the conducting properties of this c<sub>10</sub>-ring, we calculated the free-energy profile associated with the permeation of either K<sup>+</sup> or Cl<sup>−</sup> across the lumen, as well as the diffusion-coefficient profile for each ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>), in a state in which the c-ring lumen is filled with water at bulk-like density (as will be discussed below, this state is intrinsically metastable though not the most probable). The resulting conductance values are 2.5 ps for K<sup>+</sup> and 116 ps for Cl<sup>−</sup> (for 100 mM KCl). These values are clearly inconsistent with the properties of the MPTP, not only in terms of their magnitude, but also in that they reveal a marked anion selectivity. Analogous calculations carried out in the absence of electrolytes indicate that this selectivity owes to a ring of arginine side-chains at the mouth of the lumen, on the matrix side, which influences the energetics and dynamics of ion permeation electrostatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and A</xref>). This electropositive arginine ring, which is conserved in other mitochondrial c-rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), counters the cost of dehydration for Cl-<sup>−</sup>, but imposes an additional barrier for K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), incompatible with the high conductance properties of the MPTP.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23781.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of the ion-conducting properties of the c-ring lumen, assuming a hydrated state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cross-section of the c<sub>10</sub>-ring of the mitochondrial ATP synthase from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.

Thus, another way to evaluate the notion that the c-ring is the MPTP is to determine whether this lumen is indeed likely to be filled with water. We therefore sought to calculate the free-energy gain or cost associated with varying the density of water inside this region. To do so, we developed a variation of the Metadynamics enhanced-sampling technique, with which we simulated multiple transitions between an empty state of the c-ring lumen and another that is maximally hydrated, while quantifying the energetics of this process (Materials and methods). The resulting free-energy profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) reveals that a metastable state does exist in which the lumen of the mitochondrial c-ring is filled with water, at bulk-like density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, this water-filled state is approximately 15 kcal/mol less favorable than a second state in which most of the lumen of the c-ring is void of any water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>, however, the three simulations consistently demonstrate that all this water is quickly displaced by lipid molecules gradually entering the c-ring lumen; ultimately, these lipid molecules occupy the totality of the pore, in a bilayer-like arrangement akin to that outside the c-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). There is no reason to assume that the incorporation of the two missing c-subunits would alter the lipid occupancy of the lumen, which would therefore remain in a non-conducting state when the c-ring assembles completely.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23781.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Evidence that lipid molecules block the lumen of the c-ring.</title><p>Three independent molecular dynamics simulations were carried out of assembly intermediates of the c<sub>10</sub>- and c<sub>13</sub>-rings lacking two of the c-subunits.

This expansion is not entirely implausible; indeed, subtle variations in the amino-acid sequence of the c-subunits can destabilize the native state of a c-ring, and favor the assembly of larger c-rings with a slightly greater number of c-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pogoryelov et al., 2012</xref>). With this in mind, we repeated all calculations presented thus far for a variant of the c<sub>13</sub>-ring from the bacterium <italic>Bacillus pseudofirmus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Among the ATP synthase c-rings of known structure, this specific c<sub>13</sub>-ring features the widest lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Preiss et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, although no process akin to the permeability transition has been described in bacteria, we reasoned this ring would be a suitable system to assess whether an expanded mitochondrial c-ring might be the MPTP. For a better comparison, two of the residues lining the lumen of the ring were mutated, to make it more similar to the mitochondrial c-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). The results from this new set of calculations, however, confirm the conclusions drawn above. Because the lumen is wider, the permeability of the hydrated state is significantly larger, but this state remains highly anion-selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), unlike the MPTP. Moreover, this water-filled state is still disfavored, relative to the empty lumen, albeit to a lesser degree than in the c<sub>10</sub>-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Importantly, though, independent simulations of an assembly intermediate lacking two c-subunits demonstrate that the preferred state is again one in which lipid molecules occlude the lumen, in a bilayer arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that the characteristics of the lumen of the mitochondrial c-ring are incompatible with the conducting properties of the MPTP. Consistent with the fact that the F<sub>1</sub> domain does not actually seal the entrance to the lumen of the c-ring in the fully assembled, operating enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), the interior of the ring is not water-filled, but occupied by lipid molecules; that is, it is in a non-conducting state, thereby precluding the dissipation of the ion-motive-force that powers ATP synthesis. Our results also show that even if the c-ring became dissociated from the F<sub>1</sub> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavian et al., 2014</xref>), despite the nanomolar affinity of this interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pogoryelov et al., 2008</xref>), and even if its lumen was to become hydrated, under some hypothetical in vitro conditions, the conductance levels sustained by the c-ring would be unlike those of the MPTP.</p><p>Admittedly, this study does not rule out that an as-yet-unknown molecular structure consisting of c-subunits, distinct from that of the c-ring, matches the properties of the MPTP. However, it is also worth noting that no evidence of such alternative structure exists, to our knowledge. Structural studies of the c-subunit and its oligomers date back two decades; these studies include two- and three-dimensional crystallography, liquid and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, atomic-force microscopy, and more recently, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Meier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Leone and Faraldo-Gómez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">von Ballmoos et al., 2009</xref>). Across a wide variety of species and experimental conditions, the consistent conclusion from these studies is that the c-subunits assemble in ring-like oligomers such as those analyzed here. This conclusion holds true for wild-type, mutagenized and inhibited forms of the c-ring, and for a variety of expression systems (including cell-free). Moreover, to our knowledge no apparent discrepancy exists between this set of structural data and the even larger collection of biochemical and functional measurements gathered for this enzyme or its constituent elements. Indeed, in the instances where clear thermodynamic data has been attained, for example, on Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> binding to isolated c-rings, it was found to be not only quantitatively consistent with kinetic measurements for the complete enzyme functioning in membranes, but also explicable based on existing structures and theoretical considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Leone et al., 2015</xref>). In absence of concrete experimental evidence of the existence of an alternative architecture, the logical conclusion from this body of work and the present study is therefore that the c-ring from the mitochondrial ATP synthase is not the MPTP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Simulation systems and general specifications</title><p>The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation systems used to study the mitochondrial c<sub>10</sub>-ring from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> were adapted from a system used in earlier studies of the proton-binding sites in this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Symersky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, the c<sub>10</sub>-ring had been embedded in a hydrated (and pre-equilibrated) palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatydyl-choline (POPC) lipid bilayer, using GRIFFIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Staritzbichler et al., 2011</xref>), and equilibrated extensively through a series of restrained and unrestrained MD simulations. Here, the four lipid molecules occupying the center of the c-ring were removed, and instead the lumen was initially filled with water molecules. Several alternative systems were prepared: for the complete ring, one system included 100 mM KCl, while the other included counter-ions only; a simulation system was also prepared in which the c-ring lacks two c-subunits, thus resembling an assembly intermediate. After making these changes, energy minimizations, restrained and unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations were used to equilibrate these systems.</p><p>The simulation systems for the c<sub>13</sub>-ring from <italic>B. pseudofirmus</italic> OF4 were also adapted from a system used in a previous study of its proton-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leone et al., 2010</xref>). The central lumen of this ring is about two-fold wider than that of the mitochondrial c<sub>10</sub> ring, but the amino-acid composition of the protein surface lining this lumen differs. Thus, to make the c<sub>13</sub>-ring more similar, we introduced two mutations (K26L and E30Q) at the entrance of the lumen, on the side that would be exposed to the mitochondrial interior or matrix. In addition, the POPC lipid molecules inside the central lumen were also replaced by water. The resulting systems (with and without added 100 mM KCl, for the complete c<sub>13</sub>-ring, plus a system missing two c-subunits) were equilibrated analogously to the c<sub>10</sub>-ring systems.</p><p>All MD simulations were performed with NAMD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>), using the CHARMM36 forcefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">MacKerell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Klauda et al., 2010</xref>), at constant temperature (298 K) and pressure (1 atm) and with periodic boundary conditions in all directions.

In our case, these atoms are all the water oxygen atoms in the simulation system, which in principle would make the calculation of the density collective variable and related biasing forces prohibitively slow. However, because at a given time the value of the weight function (and associated forces) is non-zero only for the atoms found inside the target volume, we can speed up the calculations by introducing a ‘neighbor search’ in the algorithm, whereby a list of water molecules within and in the vicinity of that volume is created and updated regularly, but not at every simulation step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, we note that unlike earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mirjalili and Feig, 2015</xref>), our implementation defines <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">X</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in reference to the protein coordinates, that is, not in absolute Cartesian space, and therefore the tumbling and diffusion of the ring in the membrane is unrestricted during the simulations.</p><p>The geometric definitions of the target volumes considered for quantification of the free-energies of hydration of the c<sub>10</sub> and c<sub>13</sub>-ring lumens are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>. The Metadynamics simulations were carried out using eight concurrent replicas, or walkers, which update and share a common bias potential but sample different configurations. The biasing potential applied to the density variable <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> consisted of a series of Gaussian functions of width 0.0005 Å<sup>−3</sup>, added in 4-ps intervals. The height of the Gaussians was gradually diminished throughout the simulations, ultimately reaching a value of 0.0035 kcal/mol; the free-energy profiles were obtained by time-averaging the biasing potential after this time-point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Marinelli et al., 2009</xref>). The total simulation times per walker were 140 ns for the c<sub>10</sub>-ring (using the last 50 ns for analysis), and 120 ns for the c<sub>13</sub>-ring (using the last 80 ns for analysis). The ‘neighbor search’ comprised a region that is 4 Å larger than the target volume in all directions, and the list of atoms therein was updated every 200 simulation steps, resulting in a ~ 1000-fold speed-up of the calculations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the Division of Intramural Research of the National Heart, Lung and

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Yibing Shan, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Zhou el at. used fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the c-subunit ring of F1F0 ATP synthases as a membrane pore. In this sophisticated and well executed simulation study, the conductance of the channel was shown to be low and selective, inconsistent with the properties of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), which plays a crucial role in rupture of mitochondrial envelope in cell death. Moreover, the lumen of the ring was shown to be likely dehydrated, suggesting that the apparent pore is non-conductive at its ground state. The authors thus concluded that the MPTP cannot be the lumen of the c-subunit ring of F1F0 ATP synthases. This work is not the first in questioning the notion of the c-subunit ring as the MPTP, but it has added to the debate crucial and otherwise unavailable atomic details using MD simulations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree with one another in their primary concern to this work, that is that it does not seem to rule out the possibility of another structural configuration of the c-subunit ring different from the one that has been simulated. It is perceivable that in the alternative configuration the c-subunit ring be more hydrated, more conducive, and less selective, and thus more MPTP-like. This concern is accentuated by the report (Alavian et al., 2014, PNAS) of the existence of an open and a closed state of the c-subunit ring, where the closed state is conductive at ~100-300 pS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of the paper), which agrees very well with the simulation conductance, although the ion selectivity is different. The authors did try to study the conductance change upon widening of the pore. But apart from widening of the pore, there might be other conformational changes correlated with conductance. There might be a simple and convincing argument to address this concern, but in any case, an in-depth discussion to rule out the alternative (more open) configuration is vitally important to the drawn conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23781.009</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers agree with one another in their primary concern to this work, that is that it does not seem to rule out the possibility of another structural configuration of the c-subunit ring different from the one that has been simulated.

We concur with the reviewers that our study does not specifically rule out this possibility, and admit so in the text. However, we also point out that no evidence of such an alternative structure has been reported, to our knowledge, by any of the many and diverse structural studies of the c-subunit and its oligomers conducted over the past two decades – which, in turn, have consistently helped to explain a large body of biochemical and functional data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
