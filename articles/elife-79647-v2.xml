evolutionary influences on ecological communities by driving them to alternative states. It remains unclear if these wide-ranging consequences of priority effects can be explained systematically by a common underlying factor. Here, we identify such a factor in an empirical system. In a series of field and laboratory studies, we focus on how pH affects nectar-colonizing microbes and their interactions with plants and pollinators. In a field survey, we found that nectar microbial communities in a hummingbird-pollinated shrub, <italic>Diplacus</italic> (formerly <italic>Mimulus</italic>) <italic>aurantiacus</italic>, exhibited abundance patterns indicative of alternative stable states that emerge through domination by either bacteria or yeasts within individual flowers. In addition, nectar pH varied among <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> flowers in a manner that is consistent with the existence of these alternative stable states. In laboratory experiments, <italic>Acinetobacter nectaris</italic>, the bacterium most commonly found in <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar, exerted a strongly negative priority effect against <italic>Metschnikowia reukaufii</italic>, the most common nectar-specialist yeast, by reducing nectar pH. This priority effect likely explains the mutually exclusive pattern of dominance found in the field survey. Furthermore, experimental evolution simulating hummingbird-assisted dispersal between flowers revealed that <italic>M. reukaufii</italic> could evolve rapidly to improve resistance against the priority effect if constantly exposed to <italic>A. nectaris</italic>-induced pH reduction. Finally, in a field experiment, we found that low nectar pH could reduce nectar consumption by hummingbirds, suggesting functional consequences of the pH-driven priority effect for plant reproduction. Taken together, these results show that it is possible to identify an overarching factor that governs the eco-evolutionary dynamics of priority effects across multiple levels of biological organization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>community assembly</kwd><kwd>rapid evolution</kwd><kwd>metacommunity</kwd><kwd>pollination</kwd><kwd>priority effect</kwd><kwd>eco-evolutionary dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Metschnikowia reukaufii</kwd><kwd>Acinetobacter nectaris</kwd><kwd>Diplacus aurantiacus</kwd><kwd>Calypte anna</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB 1149600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukami</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB 1737758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukami</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE 1656518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chappell</surname><given-names>Callie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009193</institution-id><institution>Marsden Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MFP-LCR-2002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dhami</surname><given-names>Manpreet K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herrera Paredes</surname><given-names>Sur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016662</institution-id><institution>Carnegie Institution for Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Czech</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of microbial communities in floral nectar shows that it is possible to identify an overarching factor that governs the eco-evolutionary dynamics of priority effects across multiple levels of biological organization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many ecological communities take one of multiple alternative states even under the same species pool and the same initial environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beisner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chase, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scheffer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schröder et al., 2005</xref>). Alternative states can vary not just in species composition, but also in functional, ecosystem-level characteristics such as invasion resistance, total biomass, and nutrient cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bittleston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delory et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leopold et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pausas and Bond, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sprockett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Suding et al., 2004</xref>). However, it is often hard to predict which of the alternative states an ecological community will take. The main challenge is that alternative states are caused by priority effects, the elusive, historically contingent process in which the order and timing of species arrival dictate the trajectory of community assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Debray et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Drake, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fukami, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Palmgren, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Song et al., 2021</xref>). To further complicate matters, the strength of priority effects is not always static, but can change rapidly through evolutionary changes in species traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Meester et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Faillace et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Faillace and Morin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Knope et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Urban and De Meester, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wittmann and Fukami, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zee and Fukami, 2018</xref>). The broad scope of priority effects makes it difficult to fully understand which of the alternative states is realized under what conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fukami, 2015</xref>). For any ecological community, this understanding requires simultaneous examination of the compositional, functional, and evolutionary consequences of priority effects.</p><p>Questions that need to be addressed to understand the causes and consequences of priority effects are indeed wide-ranging. For example, how do priority effects happen (mechanism)? When are priority effects particularly strong (condition)? How rapidly can priority effects change in strength (evolution)? And how do priority effects affect the functional, not just taxonomic, properties of the communities being assembled (functional consequences)? These questions are interrelated, but given that they concern different scales of time and biological organization, it seems reasonable to expect each question to involve a different set of species traits and environmental factors. In this paper, we present empirical evidence that, contrary to this expectation, it is possible for one common factor to underlie many aspects of priority effects, including mechanism, condition, evolution, and functional consequences. Specifically, we show that environmental pH is an overarching factor governing priority effects in a microbial system.</p><p>Simple microbial systems can help identify general basic principles that organize ecological communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cadotte et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Drake et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jessup et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vega and Gore, 2018</xref>), and the nectar microbiome has recently emerged as a well-characterized simple system for understanding community assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brysch-Herzberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chappell and Fukami, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Vega et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lachance et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Letten et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vannette, 2020</xref>). Our study system here consists of the bacteria and yeasts that colonize the floral nectar of the sticky monkeyflower, <italic>Diplacus</italic> (formerly <italic>Mimulus</italic>) <italic>aurantiacus</italic>, a hummingbird-pollinated shrub native to California and Oregon of the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belisle et al., 2012</xref>). Initially sterile, floral nectar is colonized by these microbes via pollinator-mediated dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belisle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Vega et al., 2022</xref>). Microbial communities that develop in nectar through this dispersal are often simple, dominated by one or a few species of nectar-specialist bacteria or yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Álvarez-Pérez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Golonka and Vilgalys, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Herrera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tsuji and Fukami, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Warren et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our previous work has shown that hummingbird-mediated dispersal is highly stochastic because the pollinators differ in the species identity of yeasts and bacteria they carry on their beaks and tongues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toju et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vannette et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vannette and Fukami, 2017</xref>). Additionally, the outcome of local antagonistic interactions among these microbial species can be sensitive to relative initial abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dhami et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dhami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grainger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mittelbach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tucker and Fukami, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vannette and Fukami, 2014</xref>). Together, the stochastic dispersal and the history-dependent interactions jointly cause priority effects in nectar microbial communities. Moreover, recent studies indicate that whether flowers are dominated by bacteria or yeasts can affect pollination and seed set, although a mechanism for this effect remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Vega et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Good et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Herrera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jacquemyn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Junker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rering et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schaeffer and Irwin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vannette et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vannette and Fukami, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the increasing amount of knowledge about this system, whether or not there is a common factor that explains the various phenomena associated with priority effects has not been investigated in this system, or any other system for that matter, to our knowledge.</p><p>In this paper, we present and synthesize multiple independent pieces of evidence that all point to the pervasive role of pH across several aspects of priority effects in this nectar microbiome. First, we report the results of a field survey of <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> flowers across a 200-km coastline in California, showing that microbial communities in the nectar exhibit distribution patterns that are consistent with the existence of two alternative community states, one dominated by bacteria and the other dominated by yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we describe findings from laboratory experiments that suggest that the potential alternative states we observed in the field survey are caused by inhibitory priority effects between bacteria and yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then show that these priority effects are largely driven by bacteria-induced reduction in nectar pH , a finding consistent with the tri-modal distribution of nectar pH among flowers that we observed in the field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Motivated by these results as well as the high variation we found in the strength of priority effects among yeast strains, we then use experimental evolution in artificial nectar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) to show that the low pH of nectar can cause rapid evolution of yeast traits, resulting in increased resistance to the pH-driven priority effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This evolution appears to be constrained by a trade-off between tolerance to a low-pH environment and growth in a neutral-pH environment.

Finally, we show in a field experiment that the low pH of nectar reduces nectar consumption by flower-visiting hummingbirds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that pH reduction is the likely explanation for our earlier observations that nectar bacteria reduced pollination and seed set in <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic>.

We used a classification method called CLAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chazdon et al., 2011</xref>) to classify flowers into four groups: bacteria-dominated flowers, yeast-dominated flowers, co-dominated flowers, and flowers with too few microbes to be accurately classified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). For each site, we then calculated the proportion of co-dominated flowers that would be expected if bacteria and yeasts were distributed among flowers independently of each other. This analysis showed that the observed proportions of co-dominated flowers were lower than expected by chance alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; paired t-test: n=12, 95% CI [-5.3,–1.1], p=0.006).</p><p>This scarcity of co-dominance may have been caused by stochastic factors such as dispersal limitation that creates spatial segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belisle et al., 2012</xref>) or deterministic factors such as nectar chemistry that allows for niche partitioning. For example, some flowers may have nectar characteristics that intrinsically favor bacterial growth, while other flowers with different nectar chemistry may preferentially support yeast growth. However, another possibility is that the scarcity of co-dominance was caused jointly by stochastic and deterministic factors. Specifically, if a flower happens to become dominated by bacteria, it may prevent yeast from becoming abundant, and vice versa, through differential modification on nectar chemistry by bacteria vs. yeasts. This mutual suppression would represent inhibitory priority effects, where stochastic dispersal dictates the trajectory of local community assembly because early-arriving colonists deterministically exclude late-arriving immigrants.</p><p>To examine the possibility of spatial segregation, we regressed the geographic distance between all possible pairs of plants to the difference in bacterial or fungal abundance between the paired plants. If plant location affected bacterial or yeast abundance, we should see a positive relationship between distance and the difference in abundance between a given pair of plants. Contrary to this expectation, we found no strong relationship between distance and the difference in bacterial colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>, LM: n=8775, p=0.07, R<sup>2</sup>=0.0003) and a slightly negative association between distance and the difference in fungal colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>, LM: n=8775, p&lt;0.05, R<sup>2</sup>=0.004), suggesting that spatial segregation is unlikely to explain the observed abundance pattern.</p><p>It is also possible that climatic variables affected the colonization of bacteria and yeasts. However, in a linear mixed model predicting bacterial or yeast abundance by average annual temperature, temperature seasonality, annual precipitation, sampling date, and site location included as a random effect, none of the predictors were significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). This result indicates that the observed abundance pattern is unlikely to have been strongly influenced by spatial proximity, temperature, moisture, or seasonality, reinforcing the hypothesis that the distribution pattern is instead underlain by bacterial and yeast dominance as alternative stable states.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that higher densities of bacteria were tightly associated with lower nectar pH (Spearman rank-order: n=94, R<sup>2</sup>(adj.)=0.69, p=2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), whereas higher densities of yeast were weakly associated with higher nectar pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, monoculture yeast grew poorly in low-pH nectar (pH = 3) when inoculated at low density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), but not if introduced at high density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Bacterial growth was not affected by lowered nectar pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Together, these data provide further evidence that nectar pH reduction by bacteria mediates their priority effects on yeast.</p><p>One likely reason for this density-dependent effect of pH on yeast is that, when yeast arrive first to nectar, they deplete nutrients such as amino acids and consequently limit bacterial growth, thereby avoiding pH-driven suppression that would happen if bacteria were initially abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tucker and Fukami, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vannette and Fukami, 2018</xref>). Another possible reason is that larger yeast populations have higher phenotypic heterogeneity, which increases the probability that the population will include cells that are resilient to low pH. This mechanism has been suggested in the baker’s yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Guo and Olsson, 2016</xref>), although whether it applies to <italic>M. reukaufii</italic> remains to be tested. In addition to priority effects, phenotypic plasticity or stochastic phenotypic switching could contribute to increased variation in the extent of bacterial dominance among flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morawska et al., 2022</xref>). In fact, previous work on <italic>M. reukaufii</italic> suggested that epigenetic changes contribute to its broad niche width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Herrera et al., 2010</xref>). However, our experiments manipulating initial abundance provide evidence for priority effects between nectar bacteria and yeast. Since we have already sought to elucidate priority effects of early-arriving yeast in our previous papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tucker and Fukami, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vannette and Fukami, 2018</xref>), we focus primarily on the other side of the priority effects, where initial dominance of bacteria inhibits yeast growth, in this paper.</p><p>To assess whether the nectar pH reduction by bacteria that we observed in the laboratory experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) had relevance for explaining variation in nectar pH among real flowers in the field, we conducted a survey of <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar at two sites, San Gregorio (site 6) and Jasper Ridge, in June and July of 2022. We found that the distribution of nectar pH ranged from 2 to 9 in a way consistent with the prediction that fresh <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar has a mean pH of about 7.5 and that, once colonized, yeast and bacteria reduce nectar pH to an average of 5.5 and 2.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vannette et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, we found that the distribution of nectar pH in the field was non-unimodal (Hartigan’s dip test: n=576, D=0.05, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>). Furthermore, a 3-mode model was a better fit than a 2-mode model (Likelihood ratio test: p=1.6 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, AIC<sub>k=2</sub> = 2365, AIC<sub>k=3=</sub>2296, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). According to the mixture model we used, nectar pH had local modes at 7.8, 5.5, and 2.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, solid vertical lines), which are strikingly similar to those from the experiment we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vannette et al., 2013</xref>), where filtered nectar from newly opened <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> flowers was inoculated with no microbes, the yeast <italic>M. reukaufii</italic>, or the bacterium <italic>Neokomagataea</italic> sp. under controlled laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, dashed vertical lines). In addition, we observed that older and pollinated flowers were more likely to have low nectar pH, reflecting the fact that, in these flowers, microbes would have more chance to grow and modify the nectar pH than in younger and non-pollinated flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also found that the two sites differed in their distributions of nectar pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). At Jasper Ridge, many of the pollinated flowers had low pH values consistent with bacterial dominance. In contrast, at San Gregorio, these flowers had intermediate pH values that characterize yeast dominance. At another site within the region, Stanford University’s Dish hill, we measured both nectar pH and bacterial growth and found that <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> flowers with higher bacterial densities tended to have lower nectar pH (LMM: n=62, p=7.4 × 10<sup>–8</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). All of these results give field-based support for the idea that microbial abundance and nectar pH are dictated by the priority effects between bacteria and yeasts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Field survey of nectar pH in <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of nectar pH in individual <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> flowers collected at Jasper Ridge and San Gregorio (n=576 flowers from which we were able to extract a sufficient amount of nectar to measure pH; 21% of flowers sampled, i.e.,152 of 728 flowers, had too little nectar for pH measurement).

The locations of these mutations displayed some spatial concordance with patterns of LOH, corroborating the putative role of these genomic regions in adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). Yeast evolved in low-pH and bacteria-conditioned nectar both exhibited putative de novo mutations near genes involved in solute regulation, such as membrane transport, vesicle cargo recognition, and solute carrier proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata3">Figure 9—source data 3</xref>). Solute regulation has been implicated in adaptation to high-osmolarity environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pozo et al., 2015</xref>), where osmotolerant yeast has been found to compete more strongly in sugar-rich nectar. Although we cannot yet directly establish that these are causal variants, they are consistent with our hypothesis that yeasts undergo rapid genetic adaptation to pH-mediated priority effects in nectar.</p><p>We also found some differences between yeast evolved in low-pH and bacteria-conditioned nectars. For example, strains evolved in low-pH nectar had repeated LOH events in genes associated with stress responses and growth, whereas strains evolved in bacteria-conditioned nectar did not. Further studies are necessary to deduce the effect that such genomic differences have on their phenotypes and strategies to resist priority effects. Although our phenotypic data suggest that alterations to pH drive priority effects, yeast may take a variety of molecular approaches to resist priority effects by bacteria. Additionally, these results suggest that yeast might develop multiple genomic strategies to resist priority effects, potentially explaining the genetic diversity we see in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dhami et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these results indicate that the observed patterns of phenotypic evolution were concurrent with changes in genomic variation. Future work within this system could elucidate the specific loci underpinning yeast adaptation to bacterial priority effects. These results also highlight that, although our phenotypic data suggest alterations to pH as the most important factor for this priority effect, it still may be one of many affecting the coevolutionary dynamics of wild yeast in the microbial communities they are part of. In the full community context in which these microbes grow in the field, multi-species interactions, environmental microclimates, etc. likely also play a role in rapid adaptation of these microbes, which was not investigated in the current study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Reduced consumption of low-pH nectar by flower-visiting animals</title><p>Finally, we present evidence that bacteria-induced reduction in nectar pH not only drives microbial priority effects, but also has functional consequences for <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> plants.

However, the mechanism behind this effect remains unknown. To test whether pH affects nectar consumption by flower-visiting animals, we conducted a field experiment using an array of artificial plants at an outdoor garden at the Stock Farm Growth Facility on the Stanford University campus, located 5 km from Jasper Ridge. We used artificial flowers attached to garden stakes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) and measured changes in nectar volume after one day, correcting for reduction in volume through evaporation as opposed to consumption by animals like hummingbirds and bees.

In addition, because nectar-colonizing microbes, particularly <italic>M. reukaufii</italic>, can reduce amino acid concentrations in nectar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dhami et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vannette and Fukami, 2018</xref>), we also manipulated the concentration of amino acids in the artificial nectar to quantify the relative importance of pH compared to amino acid concentration. Nectar contained either a high (0.32 mM) or low (0.032 mM) concentration of amino acids in a factorial design with pH manipulation. We found that for the high amino acid nectar, which resembled the synthetic nectar used in the previously described microcosm experiments, less nectar was consumed from flowers with low-pH nectar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). This result indicates that low pH, but not low concentrations of amino acids, was the primary factor that caused a reduction in nectar consumption. One possible explanation as to why hummingbirds responded less to amino acids than pH is that hummingbirds are less sensitive to the taste of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldwin et al., 2014</xref>). Because the bacteria lower pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>), these findings suggest that bacteria-dominated flowers can negatively affect nectar consumption by pollinators by lowering nectar pH. We did not observe an effect of pH on pollinator preference when sugar concentrations were also altered, potentially since the pH reduction was less extreme (3.2) in those years or the weather was not as conducive to hummingbird foraging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results, together with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vannette et al., 2013</xref>), suggest that in addition to impacting microbial interactions and community assembly, low nectar pH associated with bacteria-dominated flowers affects the relationship between plants and pollinators via microbial priority effects. pH is thought to be a strong predictor of community assembly in other microbial systems as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ratzke and Gore, 2018</xref>), including those in the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fierer and Jackson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tedersoo et al., 2014</xref>), the human gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beasley et al., 2015</xref>), and food products such as sourdough bread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oshiro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Valmorri et al., 2008</xref>), cheese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ferreira and Viljoen, 2003</xref>), and milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Álvarez-Martín et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gadaga et al., 2001</xref>).

Using nectar-inhabiting microbes, we have shown that pH-mediated priority effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) give rise to bacterial and yeast dominance as alternative community states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). We have also shown, however, that pH is not merely a mechanism of the priority effects, but it also determines the strength of the priority effects, fuels rapid evolution that changes the strength of the priority effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), and causes functional consequences of the priority effects for the host plants’ reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). These findings indicate that historical contingency via priority effects can be understood more simply than generally thought once we identify a common factor that dictates various aspects of priority effects. Although this study has focused on one specific system, we hope that its message serves as a source of optimism for evolutionary ecology: even the phenomena regarded as difficult to explain like wide-ranging consequences of historical contingency in community assembly can sometimes be given a surprisingly simple explanation if we study them in depth.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>pH is an eco-evolutionary driver of priority effects in nectar microbes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Field observations show that nectar yeast and bacteria in individual flowers exhibit alternative stable states, where some flowers are either dominated by bacteria (dark blue), yeast (yellow (ancestral) or red (evolved)) or lack significant microbial growth (gray).

Plates were incubated at 25 °C for five days and colony forming units (CFUs) were counted on the YMA and R2A plates to estimate yeast and bacterial abundance, respectively. Molecular identification of colonies via amplification and sequencing of ribosomal genes (16 S rDNA for bacteria and 28 S rDNA for fungi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Good et al., 2014</xref>) indicated that <italic>Neokomagataea</italic> sp. was capable of forming colonies on the chloramphenicol-supplemented YMA and that these bacterial colonies tended to be distinctly smaller than yeast colonies. Observations of cells from these small colonies under a compound microscope confirmed that the size of the cells tended to be distinctly smaller than cells found in yeast colonies. Furthermore, we found that the small colonies failed to proliferate during subsequent sub-culturing on YMA, whereas most colonies identified as yeast grew optimally, providing additional indication that the small colonies were bacteria. For these reasons, we removed the small colonies from CFU on YMA for our estimation of yeast abundance.

The CLAM program was originally developed to classify species into habitat specialists and generalists, focusing on two types of habitats, with species grouped into four categories: habitat A specialists, habitat B specialists, generalists, and species that are too rare to be classified into any of the other three groups. The same principle can be applied to classifying microbial communities into bacteria-dominated, yeast-dominated, co-dominated, and microbial communities with too few bacteria and/or yeast for classification. We applied the CLAM method separately for flowers in each of the 12 sites.

Single strains sub-cultured from individual colonies were resuspended in synthetic nectar and inoculated into wells in 96-well plates at either a density of 10,000 cells/µL (a high density of microbes, simulating microbes that arrive early to a flower and subsequently grow to a high density) or 10 cells/µL (a low density of microbes, simulating a late arrival to the flower) with a competitor species or alone in a fully factorial design (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Yeast density was measured using a bright-line hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA). Bacterial density was measured using an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) with Attune autosampler and all data was analyzed using Attune NxT Software (v.3.2.1). The concentration of cells per µL was determined by gating by forward scatter height (FSC) and side scatter height (SSC) at 350 V and threshold of 2.0. After inoculation, 96-well plates were covered with sterile, air-permeable membranes and incubated at 25 °C. After 2 days, cultures were resuspended, serially diluted in sterile 0.85% NaCl, and plated on TSA plates with 100 mg/L cycloheximide or YMA plates with 100 mg/L chloramphenicol.

Experiments were repeated over four rounds with two independent replicates (96-well plates) per week. The data from the first week of each academic quarter was omitted from the final analysis due to variation in training new student researchers. Two additional rounds of this experiment were conducted using low-pH nectar instead of the normal nectar to investigate differential growth of ancestral <italic>M. reukaufii</italic> in low- vs. normal-pH nectar.

LOH events were then characterized as those instances in which any of the evolved strains was homozygous at a site identified as heterozygous in the ancestor, an event occurring 1,699 times across all end point clones. We did not expect to see contiguous segments of the genome where all sites show LOH because we do not see recombination in this yeast species (they are clonal), assessed four independent evolutionary replicates per treatment, and conducted the experiment over a relatively short period of time. To explore evidence of treatment-specific LOH events, we computed an odd’s ratio of alternate to reference allele counts in the control relative to the low-pH or bacteria-conditioned treatment genotypes. For each odds ratio, we generated 1000 permuted odds ratios in which the genotype data at that site were randomly shuffled across control treatment and either low-pH or bacteria-conditioned samples. P-values were subsequently computed by comparing the observed odds ratio to that of the 1000 permuted ratios.</p><p>Next, to further quantify the genomic differentiation between treatments, we computed a Weir-Cockerham estimator of <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> using <italic>vcftools</italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Leonora S Bittleston (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please note that your point-by-point response must address the essential revisions, but does not need to address the individual reviews.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that the work was interesting and well done, but had important suggestions for clarity and presentation. In particular:</p><p>1) The resequencing of evolved strains: please clarify this section and add appropriate analysis and/or discussion (see reviewer comments)</p><p>2) Field survey: please clarify/expand the diversity of bacteria and yeast from the field survey, other factors that might influence alternative states (e.g. spatial structure, seasonality), and your confidence in colony counts as a measure of abundance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In addition to the public comments, here I offer some more specific suggestions for improvement for clarity. I think the genome resequencing part of the paper is a bit of a diversion from the main narrative; it is worth considering whether this is necessary for this particular manuscript. Showing that evolved strains are better at surviving low pH seems sufficient. The discussion of various mutations is rather speculative and would be better expanded (with additional experimental confirmation) in a separate study. (e.g. line 363-366, unclear how pH and amino acids are linked)</p><p>There are several paragraphs of discussion that could be reduced and/or removed to streamline the paper and reduce speculation (lines 214-219, 302-316). I found the potential regional evolution scenario to be a bit too speculative without additional data.</p><p>Methods (e.g. Line 143-145): I think there needs to be more discussion of whether these CFU counts are valid indicators of total cell abundance (16S data is compositional so doesn't tell you abundance). Are there microscopy counts to validate this approach? Additionally, what about other species in this system? The experiments reduce the system to 1 bacterial and 1 yeast species, but presumably, there are others in the nectar. Is it reasonable to ignore these other species? Are they contributing significantly to cell counts in the field survey?</p><p>Line 155, 192: &quot;and vice versa&quot; – but the inverse is never really discussed. Perhaps just mention that this manuscript will only focus on the B→Y effect. Is nutrient draw-down by yeast (line 204-207) the proposed mechanism?</p><p>Methods for priority effect experiments: I was unclear on the 10 cells/ul vs 10,000 cells/ul design for early/late. I don't quite understand this experimental design. If this is for yeast, what about bacteria? (or vice versa)</p><p>One important question is how generalizable this story is. The experiments showing priority effects use the strain MR1 that seems most vulnerable to these effects. Perhaps the bacterial strain used also causes the most dramatic pH drop. It is hard to tell from the paper whether this 2-strain demonstration is really prevalent in nature. The authors argue that this strain level variation underlies the observed variation in Figure 2A, but a bit more clarity on this issue would help. Also for the pollinator experiments, pH 2 was used, which seems to be the extreme end – again, unclear how general.</p><p>Line 430-437: this made me think of food fermentations – I think there are lots of nice examples there of B-Y interactions through pH.</p><p>Figure 3C, Supp Figure 3&amp;4 all show &quot;difference in final yeast density&quot; on the y-axis, but it seems to mean something different in each case. Clearly explain the axis in each legend. Why is it negative? If it really is initial-final, this seems counterintuitive for how one would show &quot;growth&quot;. Does zero indicate no growth?</p><p>Line 737-740 and supp figure 9: I nearly missed this, but it seems important! The data seem to show no effect of pH in these experiments. To avoid the appearance of cherry-picking the data, better explain this discrepancy with the 2017 experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figures:</p><p>Figure 2: A legend with blue, yellow, and green could be added here. Also, the figure description does not say what the inset is in panel A (looks like log10 version but should be described in the text).</p><p>Figure 3, panel B: A legend with the circles vs squares and open vs filled or crosshatched would help readers interpret this panel.</p><p>Figure 6, panel A: Why is scaffold 4 shown twice, and with scaffold 3 in between?</p><p>Figure supplement 6: Listing the treatment (&quot;Bacteria added before yeast&quot; and &quot;Yeast monoculture&quot;) as the title of each panel would make this figure clearer for readers</p><p>The trade-off in abundance between yeasts vs. bacteria is outlined (in Figure 2 and related text), but how much diversity is there among the bacteria and yeasts in the broad sampling along the CA coast? Can this be estimated either from the culture data (e.g. morphospecies connected to DNA barcode) or previous work? If it can't be estimated, it would still be good to address it more in the text.</p><p>Lines 297-298 and Figure Supplement 6B: It looks like the yeast evolved in bacterially-conditioned nectar grows to significantly lower densities in monoculture when compared with the yeast evolved in normal nectar. This suggests that there could be a trade-off in terms of growth in normal vs. bacterially-conditioned nectar which I think is interesting and should be addressed in the text. Also, were these evolved yeasts all grown in low-pH nectar at the end? If so, what did those densities look like, and was it the same pattern that you see with the BY treatment? This would give more insight into the differences between growing in low pH nectar vs growing with high-density bacteria.</p><p>Do you see consistent differences in growth/density among the different replicate strains from the evolution experiment? Perhaps you could tie some of the high LOH variation seen among replicates in Figure 6A to functional differences of the replicate strains.</p><p>Line 355: Were there more shared differences in LOH between the low-pH and bacteria-conditioned strains vs. the normal nectar-grown strains? From Figure Supplement 8 it looks like that is not the case. The reported analysis does a good job of looking at the shared ways in which low-pH and bacterial conditioning might lead to genetic changes, but it doesn't address if low-pH is acting in the same way as bacterial conditioning. From Figure 6, it looks like the most LOH was happening in the bacteria-conditioned strains. Panel B also shows a really interesting region between scaffolds 2-3 where a lot of putative de novo mutations are happening only in the bacteria-conditioned strains. Your data presents a great opportunity to delve into genetic change driven by an abiotic vs biotic source.</p><p>Methods Section starting at 661: It would be helpful to outline here how many strains were sequenced, and how you arrived at the 444X sequencing depth per sample.

First, to clarify/expand the diversity of bacteria and yeast from the field survey, we now refer to the results published in Dhami et al. (2018), in which we reported that <italic>M. reukaufii</italic> was the most commonly found culturable species of fungi in <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar samples that we had in the regional survey of the 12 sites used in our present study. For reference, please see Table S2 from Dhami et al. (2018), which summarizes the number of colonies (per species) found at each field site.</p><p>As for bacteria, the data we have available from Dhami et al. (2018) are unfortunately not extensive enough to be reliable. However, we added to the manuscript new, previously unpublished data from a six-year survey of nectar-inhabiting bacteria cultured from <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar at one local site, Jasper Ridge. Even though Jasper Ridge is not one of the sites used in our 12-site survey, it is located within the same region where we did the 12-site survey. Jasper Ridge is the site where much of our prior work studying nectar microbes in <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> was conducted (e.g., Belisle, Peay, and Fukami 2012; Vannette and Fukami 2018; Vannette, Gauthier, and Fukami 2013; Vannette and Fukami 2017). These longitudinal data were collected since 2016 in collaboration with undergraduate students who took a field biology course at Stanford University (Fukami 2013), which we now summarize in a new Figure 3.</p><p>The results in this figure support previously published culture-independent (metabarcoding) data on bacterial species composition of <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar at Jasper Ridge (Vannette and Fukami 2017) and a nearby site (Toju et al. 2018). Specifically, both the culture-dependent and culture-independent investigations indicate that <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> was the most dominant bacterial genus in <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar.</p><p>We also looked at culturable fungi along with culturable bacteria at Jasper Ridge. In this fungal dataset, too, <italic>M. reukaufii</italic> was prevalent, being the second most frequently cultured species after <italic>Starmerella bombicola</italic>. However, sample size for the fungal data was more than ten times smaller (n = 53 isolates identified by Sanger sequencing) than the bacterial data (n = 619). Furthermore, the Jasper Ridge isolates were collected early in the flowering season (in mid May), whereas the 12-site regional survey we report in our paper was conducted later in the season (in late June to mid July). Seasonal changes in fungal species composition in floral nectar have been documented by other studies at Jasper Ridge (Vannette and Fukami 2017) and elsewhere (e.g., Brysch-Herzberg 2004, Tsuji and Fukami 2018). For these reasons, we are hesitant to make any firm conclusion regarding fungi just from this Jasper Ridge dataset. The data from Dhami et al. 2018 (Table S2 above), where <italic>M. reukaufii</italic> was clearly the most dominant species, are both more extensive and more directly relevant to our present study.</p><p>Additionally, the most common species within the most common genera of bacteria and yeast observed in our study system, such as <italic>Acinetobacter, Neokomagataea, Pseudomonas,</italic> and <italic>Metschnikowia</italic>, have been indicated to be common nectar specialists in other plants elsewhere as well, based on culture-independent approaches (e.g., Fridman et al. 2012; Warren, Kram, and Theiss 2020).</p><p>Taken together, these independent pieces of evidence on the diversity of bacteria and fungi collectively indicate that, given their prevalence, <italic>A. nectaris</italic> and <italic>M. reukaufii</italic> are a reasonable pair of species to focus on as a first step toward understanding the nectar microbial community of <italic>D. auranaticus</italic> in our study landscape. We have presented and discussed these relevant data in lines 216-235.</p><p>As for the second point raised in this comment (other factors that might influence alternative states), we added a series of new analyses to assess potential effects of spatial structure, temperature, precipitation, and seasonality on microbial abundance. In these analyses, we did not detect any statistically significant influence of any of the factors considered. This new finding suggests that the patterns that we present in this paper as being consistent with the possibility of bacterial vs. fungal dominance as two alternative states are unlikely to be explained by alternative factors, reinforcing the conclusion we draw from the field survey data. The new analyses are described in lines 183-205, 707-716, and Figure 2—figure supplements 2-4 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We agree that these factors could potentially explain the presented results. Accordingly, we conducted spatial and seasonal analyses of the data, which we detail below and include in two new paragraphs in the manuscript (lines 183-205):</p><p>First, to determine whether spatial proximity influenced yeast and bacterial CFUs, we regressed the geographic distance between all possible pairs of plants to the difference in bacterial or fungal abundance between the paired plants. If plant location affected microbial abundance, one should see a positive relationship between distance and the difference in microbial abundance between a given pair of plants: a pair of plants that were more distantly located from each other should be, on average, more different in microbial abundance. Contrary to this expectation, we found no significant relationship between distance and the difference in bacterial colonization (A, p=0.07, R<sup>2</sup>=0.0003) and a small negative association between distance and the difference in fungal colonization (B, p&lt;0.05, R<sup>2</sup>=0.004). Thus, there was no obvious overall spatial pattern in whether flowers were dominated by yeast or bacteria (Figure 2—figure supplement 4).</p><p>Next, to determine whether climatic factors or seasonality affected the colonization of bacteria and yeast per plant, we used a linear mixed model predicting the average bacteria and yeast density per plant from average annual temperature, temperature seasonality, and annual precipitation at each site, the date the site was sampled, and the site location and plant as nested random effects. We found that none of these variables were significantly associated with the density of bacteria and yeast in each plant.</p><p>To look at seasonality, we also re-ordered Figure 2C, which shows the abundance of bacteria- and yeast-dominated flowers at each site, so that the sites are now listed in order of sampling dates. In this re-ordered figure, there is no obvious trend in the number of flowers dominated by yeast throughout the period sampled (6.23 to 7/9), giving additional indication that seasonality was unlikely to affect the results (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><p>Additionally, sampling date does not seem to strongly predict bacterial or fungal density within each flower when plotted as follows (Figure 2—figure supplement 2):</p><p>These additional analyses, now included (Figure 2—figure supplements 2-4) and described (lines 183-205) in the manuscript, indicate that the observed microbial distribution patterns are unlikely to have been strongly influenced by spatial proximity, temperature, moisture, or seasonality, reinforcing the possibility that the distribution patterns instead indicate bacterial and yeast dominance as alternative stable states.</p><p>On the third point, to explain our confidence in colony counts as a measure of abundance, we present laboratory data correlating cell counts and colony counts. Please see below and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for detail.</p><p>We have revised the text to address the relationship between cell counts and colony counts with nectar microbes. Specifically, we point out that our previous work (Peay <italic>et al.</italic> 2012) established a close correlation between CFUs and cell densities (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.76) for six species of nectar yeasts isolated from <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar at Jasper Ridge, including <italic>M. reukaufii</italic>. For the reviewers’ reference, see Figure S2 in Peay et al. 2012.</p><p>As for <italic>A. nectaris</italic>, we used a flow cytometric sorting technique to examine the relationship between cell density and CFU (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This result should be viewed as preliminary given the low level of replication, but this relationship also appears to be linear, as shown below, indicating that colony counts likely reflect true cell abundance of this species in nectar. We have added the plot to the manuscript as Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>It remains uncertain how closely CFU reflects total cell abundance of the entire bacterial and fungal community in nectar. However, a close association is possible and may be even likely given the data above, showing a close correlation between CFU and total cell count for several yeast species and <italic>A. nectaris</italic>, which are indicated by our data to be dominant species in nectar.</p><p>We have added the above points in the manuscript (lines 156-157, 829-833).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In addition to the public comments, here I offer some more specific suggestions for improvement for clarity. I think the genome resequencing part of the paper is a bit of a diversion from the main narrative; it is worth considering whether this is necessary for this particular manuscript. Showing that evolved strains are better at surviving low pH seems sufficient. The discussion of various mutations is rather speculative and would be better expanded (with additional experimental confirmation) in a separate study. (e.g. line 363-366, unclear how pH and amino acids are linked)</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback and agree that this part of the study would be strengthened with additional experimental confirmation in a separate study. The phenotypic differences between evolved strains suggest evolutionary change, but we believe it is important to present the genomic resequencing results in this paper as evidence for genetic adaptation as opposed to just plastic and/or epigenetic response. As the reviewer points out, detailed discussion of various mutations needs to be speculative at this stage, however, and we have sought to be clear about it in the text (lines 503-506, 517-519, 520-529). The main point we would like to highlight with the genomic data is that yeast strains responded evolutionarily to discuss eco-evolutionary changes in priority effects. One of the most direct ways to verify if there was evolutionary change is to identify shifts in genetic variation, which is what the genomic results provide. We would also like to point out that reviewer 2 encouraged us to expand this section. To incorporate suggestions from both reviewers, we would like to keep these results in the final manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several paragraphs of discussion that could be reduced and/or removed to streamline the paper and reduce speculation (lines 214-219, 302-316).

Our results suggest that adaptation to limited amino acid availability could be associated with differential resistance to priority effects in low-pH environments, though further experimentation is needed to determine the precise targets of selection.” (lines 500-506).</p><p>With respect to the regional evolution scenario, we have added additional analysis showing a tradeoff between local priority effect strength and monoculture growth. See responses to Reviewer 2 for a more detailed discussion of this analysis and how it provides data to support the regional evolution scenario.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods (e.g. Line 143-145): I think there needs to be more discussion of whether these CFU counts are valid indicators of total cell abundance (16S data is compositional so doesn't tell you abundance). Are there microscopy counts to validate this approach? Additionally, what about other species in this system? The experiments reduce the system to 1 bacterial and 1 yeast species, but presumably, there are others in the nectar. Is it reasonable to ignore these other species?

Perhaps just mention that this manuscript will only focus on the B→Y effect. Is nutrient draw-down by yeast (line 204-207) the proposed mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that, in our original manuscript, we did discuss the inverse priority effects, referring to relevant findings that we previously reported (Tucker and Fukami 2014, Dhami et al. 2016 and 2018, Vannette and Fukami 2018). Specifically, we wrote that: “when yeast arrive first to nectar, they deplete nutrients such as amino acids and limit subsequent bacterial growth, thereby avoiding pH-driven suppression that would happen if bacteria were initially more abundant (Tucker and Fukami 2014; Vannette and Fukami 2018)” (lines 280-283). However, we now realize that this brief mention of the inverse priority effects was not sufficiently linked to our motivation for focusing mainly on the priority effects of bacteria on yeast in the present paper. Accordingly, we added the following sentences: “Since our previous papers sought to elucidate priority effects of early-arriving yeast, here we focus primarily on the other side of the priority effects, where initial dominance of bacteria inhibits yeast growth.” (lines 293-296).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods for priority effect experiments: I was unclear on the 10 cells/ul vs 10,000 cells/ul design for early/late. I don't quite understand this experimental design. If this is for yeast, what about bacteria? (or vice versa)</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following explanation to clarify this point: “Single strains sub-cultured from individual colonies were resuspended in synthetic nectar and inoculated into wells in 96-well plates at either a density of 10,000 cells/µL (a high density of microbes, simulating microbes that arrive early to a flower and subsequently grow to a high density) or 10 cells/µL (a low density of microbes, simulating a late arrival to the flower) with a competitor species or alone in a fully factorial design (source data 6). (lines 823-828)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One important question is how generalizable this story is. The experiments showing priority effects use the strain MR1 that seems most vulnerable to these effects. Perhaps the bacterial strain used also causes the most dramatic pH drop. It is hard to tell from the paper whether this 2-strain demonstration is really prevalent in nature. The authors argue that this strain level variation underlies the observed variation in Figure 2A, but a bit more clarity on this issue would help. Also for the pollinator experiments, pH 2 was used, which seems to be the extreme end – again, unclear how general.</p></disp-quote><p>We were also curious whether strain- and species-level variation in the field might complicate our story. To address this point, as well as whether the pH range in the pollinator experiments are realistic, we conducted a new field survey to study the range and distribution of nectar pH in <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> plants at two sites, Jasper Ridge and San Gregorio (site 5), which we have included as a new paragraph in the manuscript: “To assess whether the nectar pH reduction by bacteria that we observed in the laboratory experiment (Figure 4B) had relevance for explaining variation in nectar pH among real flowers in the field, we conducted a survey of <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar at two sites, San Gregorio (site 6) and Jasper Ridge, in June and July of 2022. We found that the distribution of nectar pH ranged from 2 to 9 in a way consistent with the prediction that fresh <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar has a mean pH of about 7.5 and that, once colonized, yeast and bacteria reduce nectar pH to an average of 5.5 and 2.5, respectively (Vannette et al. 2013). We found that the distribution of nectar pH in the field was non-unimodal (Hartigan’s dip test: n=576, D=0.05, p&lt;2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>), and a 3-mode model was a better fit than a 2-mode model (Likelihood ratio test: p=1.6x10<sup>-16</sup>, AIC<sub>k=2</sub> = 2365, AIC<sub>k=3=</sub>2296, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). According to the mixture model we used, nectar pH had local modes at 7.8, 5.5, and 2.6 (Figure 5A, solid vertical lines), which are strikingly similar to those from the experiment we reported previously (Vannette et al., 2013), where filtered nectar from newly opened <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> flowers was inoculated with no microbes, the yeast <italic>M. reukaufii</italic>, or the bacterium <italic>Neokomagataea</italic> sp. under controlled laboratory conditions (Figure 5A, dashed vertical lines). In addition, we observed that older and pollinated flowers were more likely to have low nectar pH, reflecting the fact that, in older flowers, microbes would have more chance to grow and modify the nectar pH (Figure 5B, Figure 5—figure supplement 2). We also found that the two sites differed in their distributions of nectar pH (Figure 5B, Figure 5—figure supplement 2). At Jasper Ridge, many of the pollinated flowers had low pH values consistent with bacterial dominance. In contrast, at San Gregorio, these flowers had intermediate pH values that characterize yeast dominance. At another site within the region, Stanford University’s Dish Hill, we measured both nectar pH and bacterial growth and found that <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> flowers with higher bacterial densities tended to have lower nectar pH (LMM: n=62, p=7.4x10<sup>-8</sup>) (Figure 5C). All of these results give field-based support for the idea that microbial abundance and nectar pH are dictated by the priority effects between bacteria and yeasts” (lines 306-333).</p><p>Together, these results support that even when looking at nectar microbe communities in aggregate by looking at a community-level aggregate characteristic like nectar pH, we see differences in community states that could drive the eco-evolutionary processes we observed in our experimental evolution approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 430-437: this made me think of food fermentations – I think there are lots of nice examples there of B-Y interactions through pH.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have added the following to the manuscript: “pH is thought to be a strong predictor of community assembly in other microbial systems as well (Ratzke &amp; Gore, 2018), including those in the soil (Fierer &amp; Jackson, 2006; Tedersoo et al., 2014), the human gut (Beasley et al., 2015), and food products such as sourdough bread (Oshiro et al., 2020; Valmorri et al., 2008), cheese (Ferreira &amp; Viljoen, 2003), and milk (Álvarez-Martín et al., 2008; Gadaga et al., 2001).” (lines 591-596)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3C, Supp Figure 3&amp;4 all show &quot;difference in final yeast density&quot; on the y-axis, but it seems to mean something different in each case.

In 2017, the pollinator choice experiment varied pH and amino acid concentration (Figure 10). We found that pH, but not amino acid concentration, affected pollinator preference, consistent with the fact that Anna’s hummingbird (and probably hummingbirds in general) does not respond to amino acid concentration (Baldwin et al. 2014). In 2016 and 2019, we varied pH and sugar concentration (Figure 10—figure supplement 1). It is unclear why we did not detect a pH effect in these years, but one possibility is that pH reduction was less extreme in these years (3.2 in 2016 and 2019, and 2 in 2017). Another possibility is that weather was not as conducive for hummingbird foraging in 2016 and 2019 than in 2017, resulting in less nectar consumption, which may have in turn led to smaller differences among the nectar type treatments. We have added a brief discussion of these possibilities into the manuscript: “We did not observe an effect of pH on pollinator preference when sugar concentrations were also altered, potentially since the pH reduction was less extreme (3.2) in those years or the weather was not as conductive to hummingbird foraging (Figure 10—figure supplement 1)” (lines 582-587).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figures:</p><p>Figure 2: A legend with blue, yellow, and green could be added here.

However, we here present data from a multi-year survey of bacteria cultured from <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar at one site, Jasper Ridge (JR, Figure 3), from 2012 to 2022. Jasper Ridge is not one of the sites used in our 12-site survey, but it is located within the region where we did the survey (Figure 2A). The Jasper Ridge data support culture-independent (metabarcoding) data on bacterial species composition of <italic>D. aurantiacus</italic> nectar at the same site (Vannette and Fukami 2017) and a nearby site (Toju et al. 2018): both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods indicate that <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp. were the dominant species of bacteria in D. aurantiacus nectar, followed by <italic>Neokomagataea</italic> (formerly Gluconobacter) sp.

Also, were these evolved yeasts all grown in low-pH nectar at the end? If so, what did those densities look like, and was it the same pattern that you see with the BY treatment?

We have included a figure in the main text (Figure 8) and included a brief discussion (lines 428-444):</p><p>“Furthermore, we observed a pattern that preliminarily suggests a potential evolutionary tradeoff between adaptation to low pH and neutral pH (Figure 8—Figure 8-source data 1). When considered across all experimental evolution treatments, strains that evolved stronger resistance to priority effects of pH-reducing bacteria became marginally worse at growing in neutral-pH monoculture (strains that are in the upper left quadrant in Figure 8). Conversely, strains that did not increase resistance to bacterial priority effects during experimental evolution were better able to grow in neutral-pH monoculture (those in the upper right quadrant in monoculture) (LMM: n = 48, p = 0.05, Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Incidentally, this type of evolutionary trade-off is the basis for the “eco-evolutionary buffering” hypothesis recently proposed by Wittmann &amp; Fukami (2018). This hypothesis provides one potential reason why species that engage in strong inhibitory priority effects in local communities can still co-exist in a metacommunity even though such priority effects should eventually cause only one species to persist in the metacommunity, with others driven to extinction. Our finding here, i.e., rapid evolution of resistance to priority effects under a trade-off constraint, may partly explain why both yeast and bacteria persist in the field despite strong priority effects, but this possibility remains highly speculative at this stage.”</p><p>Unfortunately, we did not grow the evolved yeasts in low-pH nectar in sufficient replication to be reliable for reporting (we did some preliminary trials, but not with adequate replication).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do you see consistent differences in growth/density among the different replicate strains from the evolution experiment?

From Figure Supplement 8 it looks like that is not the case. The reported analysis does a good job of looking at the shared ways in which low-pH and bacterial conditioning might lead to genetic changes, but it doesn't address if low-pH is acting in the same way as bacterial conditioning. From Figure 6, it looks like the most LOH was happening in the bacteria-conditioned strains. Panel B also shows a really interesting region between scaffolds 2-3 where a lot of putative de novo mutations are happening only in the bacteria-conditioned strains. Your data presents a great opportunity to delve into genetic change driven by an abiotic vs biotic source.</p></disp-quote><p>Yeast strains evolved in bacteria-conditioned and low-pH nectar had a similar phenotypic trait, i.e., increased resistance to bacterial priority effects, but we agree that our data suggest that the genetic basis for this trait may have differed. To clarify this point in the manuscript, we have included a more extended discussion speculating on possible differences between two groups of strains.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have included an expanded discussion in the revised manuscript (lines 520-529). Specifically, to show overall genomic variation between treatments, we calculated genome-wide Fst comparing the various nectar conditions. We found that Fst was 0.0013, 0.0014, and 0.0015 for the low-pH vs. normal, low pH vs. bacteria-conditioned, and bacteria-conditioned vs. normal comparisons, respectively. The similarity between all treatments suggests that the differences between bacteria-conditioned and low pH are comparable to each treatment compared to normal. This result highlights that, although our phenotypic data suggest alterations to pH as the most important factor for this priority effect, it still may be one of many affecting the coevolutionary dynamics of wild yeast in the microbial communities they are part of. In the full community context in which these microbes grow in the field, multi-species interactions, environmental microclimates, etc. likely also play a role in rapid adaptation of these microbes which was not investigated in the current study.</p><p>Based on this overall picture, we have included additional discussion focusing on the effect of pH on evolution of stronger resistance to priority effects. We compared genomic differences between bacteria-conditioned and low-pH evolved strains, drawing the reader’s attention to specific differences in Figure 9-source data 2 and 3<bold>.</bold> Loci that varied between the low pH and bacteria-conditioned treatments occurred in genes associated with protein folding, amino acid biosynthesis, and metabolism.</p><p>We also looked into the suggested region between scaffolds 2-3 and found that the bacteria-conditioned strains contained putative de novo mutations proximal to genes involved in secretion, oxidative phosphorylation, and membrane insertion in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the future, it would be interesting to study which genes within these regions might be associated with differential responses to each environment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods Section starting at 661: It would be helpful to outline here how many strains were sequenced, and how you arrived at the 444X sequencing depth per sample.

The mean coverage of the assembled genome is 444X, which might not be exactly the same as 444X sequencing depth, given the evolved yeast genomes could be smaller or larger than the reference genome. Because of the minimal differences between the ancestral and evolved genomes, we expect the numerical difference to be trivial.</p><p>We recognize that 444X is unnecessarily high for a genome resequencing project.

We used a classification method called CLAM (Chazdon et al., 2011) to classify flowers into four groups: bacteria-dominated flowers, yeast-dominated flowers, co-dominated flowers, and flowers with too few microbes to be accurately classified (Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 3). For each site, we then calculated the proportion of co-dominated flowers that would be expected if bacteria and yeasts were distributed among flowers independently of each other. We found that the observed proportions of co-dominated flowers were lower than expected by chance alone (Figure 2D; paired t-test: n=12, 95% CI [-5.3, -1.1], p=0.006).</p><p>This scarcity of co-dominance may have been caused by stochastic factors such as dispersal limitation that creates spatial segregation (Belisle et al., 2012) or deterministic factors such as nectar chemistry that allows for niche partitioning. For example, some flowers may have nectar characteristics that intrinsically favor bacterial growth, while other flowers with different nectar chemistry may preferentially support yeast growth. However, another possibility is that the scarcity of co-dominance was caused jointly by stochastic and deterministic factors. Specifically, if a flower happens to become dominated by bacteria, it may prevent yeast from becoming abundant, and vice versa, through differential modification on nectar chemistry by bacteria vs. yeasts. This mutual suppression would represent inhibitory priority effects, where stochastic dispersal dictates the trajectory of local community assembly because early-arriving colonists deterministically exclude late-arriving immigrants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Clam classification: explain in greater detail how this method classifies flowers (# 47)</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more information about the CLAM test into the methods section (lines 669-682):</p><p>“We used the CLAM (Classification Methods) program (Chazdon et al., 2011), a multinomial model that uses estimated species relative abundance to classify flowers into (1) bacteria-dominated flowers, (2) yeast-dominated flowers, (3) co-dominated flowers, and (4) flowers with too few microbes to be classified into any of the three other groups. The CLAM program was originally developed to classify species into habitat specialists and generalists, focusing on two types of habitats, with species grouped into four categories: habitat A specialists, habitat B specialists, generalists, and species that are too rare to be classified into any of the other three groups. The same principle can be applied to classifying microbial communities into bacteria-dominated, yeast-dominated, co-dominated, and microbial communities with too few bacteria and/or yeast for classification. We applied the CLAM method separately for flowers in each of the 12 sites. At each site, the resultant flowers (bacteria-dominated, yeast-dominated, co-dominated, too few to classify) were summed and a two-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to determine differences between sites.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Colony forming units: explain confidence in quantifying microbial growth using colony forming units (# 77).</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to address the relationship between cell counts and colony counts with nectar microbes.
