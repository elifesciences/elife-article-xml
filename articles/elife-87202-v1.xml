techniques are promising for achieving such goals. However, rice is usually grown under field conditions and influenced by surrounding ecological community members. How ecological communities influence the rice performance in the field has been underexplored despite the potential of ecological communities to establish an environment-friendly agricultural system. In the present study, we demonstrate an ecological-network-based approach to detect potentially influential, previously overlooked organisms for rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>). First, we established small experimental rice plots, and measured rice growth and monitored ecological community dynamics intensively and extensively using quantitative environmental DNA metabarcoding in 2017 in Japan. We detected more than 1000 species (including microbes and macrobes such as insects) in the rice plots, and nonlinear time series analysis detected 52 potentially influential organisms with lower-level taxonomic information. The results of the time series analysis were validated under field conditions in 2019 by field manipulation experiments. In 2019, we focused on two species, <italic>Globisporangium nunn</italic> and <italic>Chironomus kiiensis</italic>, whose abundance was manipulated in artificial rice plots. The responses of rice, namely, the growth rate and gene expression patterns, were measured before and after the manipulation. We confirmed that, especially in the <italic>G. nunn</italic>-added treatment, rice growth rate and gene expression pattern were changed. In the present study, we demonstrated that intensive monitoring of an agricultural system and the application of nonlinear time series analysis were helpful to identify influential organisms under field conditions. Although the effects of the manipulations were relatively small, the research framework presented here has future potential to harness the ecological complexity and utilize it in agriculture. Our proof-of-concept study would be an important basis for the further development of field-basis system management.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rice</kwd><kwd>agricultural system</kwd><kwd>environmental DNA</kwd><kwd><italic>Chironomus kiiensis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Globisporangium nunn</italic></kwd><kwd>unified information-theoretic causality</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJPR16O2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ushio</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI (B) 20H03323</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ushio</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005950</institution-id><institution>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ushio</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005683</institution-id><institution>Kyoto University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hakubi Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ushio</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By leveraging quantitative environmental DNA metabarcoding and ecological network analysis, influential organisms in rice fields are identified, thereby revealing potential avenues for environmentally friendly agricultural practices.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Global food production supports energy requirements for human beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Godfray et al., 2010</xref>), while the food production is a major driver of greenhouse gas emission and other environmental loads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleksandrowicz et al., 2016</xref>). How to achieve sustainable food production while reducing environmental impacts is thus a major concern in agricultural science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenaerts et al., 2019</xref>). Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), one of the world’s major staple crops, is an essential component of the diets and livelihood of over 3.5 billion people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wing et al., 2018</xref>). A large number of studies have investigated how the performance of rice can be improved, and genomics-based breeding, combined with other advanced technologies such as high-throughput field-based phenotyping, is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wing et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While the advanced breeding techniques are promising, rice is usually grown under field conditions and inevitably influenced by the surrounding biotic and abiotic environment. Previous studies have investigated how meteorological and endogenous (e.g. plant age and genotype) variables influence the gene expression patterns (transcriptome dynamics) of rice under fluctuating field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kashima et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagano et al., 2012</xref>), and have suggested that transcriptome dynamics can be predominantly explained by endogenous factors and abiotic variables such as ambient air temperature and solar radiation. Nonetheless, biotic variables such as insect herbivory and microbial mutualists/pathogens also play an important role in determining the transcriptome dynamics and productivity of crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen and Leach, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Savary et al., 2019</xref>). However, the dynamics of biotic variables (i.e. ecological community members) under field conditions are difficult to predict because they often show more complex, nonlinear dynamics than abiotic variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsieh et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, understanding whether and how biotic variables influence the rice performance (i.e. interspecific interactions) has been underexplored despite its importance for sustainable agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toju et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In ecological studies, biotic interactions have been studied theoretically and empirically for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allesina and Tang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">May, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ushio et al., 2018a</xref>). Ecologists have traditionally studied interspecific interactions based on observations and manipulations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paine, 1966</xref> measured the strength of interspecific interactions by removing predator in a rocky tidal system, and showed that the relatively less abundant predator species affected the community diversity disproportionally strongly through interspecific interactions (i.e. such a species is a so-called ‘keystone’ species). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reynolds and Bruno, 2013</xref> also showed that multiple predator species altered population growth of an estuarine food web through complex interactions among species. Thus far, interspecific interactions and their influences on the system dynamics have been studied as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wootton and Emmerson, 2005</xref>. However, despite the substantial contributions to ecology, these observation- and manipulation-based approaches have critical limitations: the identification of multitaxa species and the quantification of their abundance under field conditions are challenging, and the quantification of their interactions is even more difficult (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ushio, 2022</xref>). Overcoming these difficulties and understanding how ecological community members influence the rice performance under field conditions will provide insights into how we can improve the rice performance and how rice responds to the ongoing and future anthropogenic impacts.</p><p>One of the promising approaches for overcoming the current limitations is to monitor the system frequently and detect interspecific interactions using time series data. Recent advances in empirical and statistical methods provide a practical way to achieve this goal. First, use of environmental DNA (eDNA) enables researchers to efficiently detect ecological community members under field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taberlet et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies have shown that eDNA metabarcoding, an approach to comprehensively amplify and sequence DNAs belonging to a target taxa in an environmental sample, is a cost- and time-effective means to detect a large number of species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miya et al., 2015</xref>), and the eDNA-based community data is especially informative when it is obtained quantitatively (e.g. sequencing with internal spike-in DNAs: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ushio, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ushio et al., 2018b</xref>). For example, quantitative eDNA metabarcoding enabled effective evaluation of intraspecific genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsuji et al., 2020</xref>) and frequent and comprehensive monitoring of community dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ushio, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ushio et al., 2023</xref>). Second, nonlinear time series analytical tools enable researchers to reconstruct complex interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deyle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osada et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schreiber, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugihara et al., 2012</xref>), and previous studies adopting the approach have detected causality among many variables (e.g., reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Runge et al., 2019</xref>). These methods detected and quantified biological interactions in complex systems such as microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fujita et al., 2023</xref>), and contributed to understanding and forecasting complex dynamics driven by the interactions.</p><p>In the present study, we reconstructed the interaction network surrounding rice and detected potentially influential organisms for rice under field conditions. First, in 2017, we established small experimental rice plots, and monitored rice performance (i.e. growth rates) and ecological community dynamics intensively and extensively. Rice performance was quantified by measuring the growth rates (cm/day), and ecological community members were monitored by a quantitative eDNA metabarcoding approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ushio, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ushio et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We selected growth rates as a monitoring variable for rice because frequent and inexpensive monitoring is possible, and because it integrates various physiological states. The monitoring was performed daily from 23 May 2017 to 22 September 2017 (122 consecutive days). Second, we analyzed the generated extensive time series containing 1197 species and rice growth rates and produced a list of 52 potentially influential species using a time-series-based causality analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Third, in 2019, we empirically tested the effects of two species that had been identified as potentially influential in 2017 using manipulative experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). During the growing season in 2019, an Oomycetes species, <italic>Globisporangium nunn</italic> (syn. <italic>Pythium nunn</italic>), was added, and a midge species, <italic>Chironomus kiiensis</italic>, was removed from small rice plots. The rice responses (the growth rate and gene expression patterns) were measured before and after the manipulation. We confirmed that the two species, especially <italic>G. nunn</italic>, indeed had statistically clear effects on the rice performance, which demonstrated that integration of the eDNA-based monitoring and time series analysis would be effective for detecting previously overlooked influential organisms in agricultural systems.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rice plot, growth rate, air temperature, and ecological community dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 90 cm × 90 cm rice plot and Wagner pot alignments.

This suggested that our quantitative eDNA metabarcoding reasonably quantified the concentrations of eDNA, which can be a ‘rough’ index of species abundance in the artificial rice plots. Some time-series-based causal inference methods required quantitative data (i.e. relative abundance data that is typical for amplicon sequencing is not suitable; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osada et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schreiber, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sugihara et al., 2012</xref>), and our method justifies the use of the advanced time series method to infer the causal relationship between rice growth and ecological community members.</p><p>Rice growth was monitored by a manual measurement, for example, rice height measurements made using rulers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Although the measurements successfully captured the seasonal dynamics of the rice growth, one might speculate whether only a single variable is sufficient to capture the rice performance. Indeed, it is true that assessing more variables, for example, gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagano et al., 2012</xref>) and multispectral image monitoring during the whole growth season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Candiago et al., 2015</xref>), would be potentially useful to fully capture the trajectory of the rice growth. Nonetheless, we suggest that very frequent monitoring of a single variable is sufficient to reconstruct and predict the dynamics of the whole system dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takens, 1981</xref>).

Thus, validating the effects of these species on the rice performance is important, and targeting ASVs with a large TE value would be a promising direction to find previously overlooked beneficial/detrimental organisms for rice under field conditions. In addition, we could not test the effects of species that had no clear effects on the rice performance according to the time series analysis. It will also be important to validate that such species do not have clear influence on the rice performance in the field, which would further validate the effectiveness of our research framework.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential limitations and future perspectives</title><p>Although the present study has shown that our framework is potentially useful for detecting potentially influential, previously overlooked organisms for rice growth under field conditions, there are potential limitations that should be acknowledged.</p><p>One limitation is the quantitative capacity and species identification accuracy of the eDNA metabarcoding. As for the first issue, the quantitative eDNA metabarcoding approach used in this study provides reasonable estimates of eDNA concentrations (see the following studies for the comparison between quantitative eDNA metabarcoding and the fluorometric method and quantitative PCR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ushio, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ushio et al., 2018b</xref>), and the eDNA concentrations usually positively correlate with the number or biomass of individuals. However, there are species- and environment-specific eDNA dynamics such as degradation and release processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dejean et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maruyama et al., 2014</xref>), which may bias the estimation of absolute abundance. Although our causality detection might not be strongly influenced by the species-specific bias (i.e. time series were standardized before the analysis), accurate estimations of the absolute abundance will improve the accuracy of analyses. Identifications and enumerations of individuals using eDNA would be a fascinating direction to improve the accuracy of the species abundance estimations. As for the second issue, short-read sequencing has dominated current eDNA studies, but it is often not sufficient for lower-level taxonomic identification (i.e. species or subspecies identification). Using long-read sequencing techniques (e.g. Oxford Nanopore MinION) for eDNA studies is a promising approach to overcome the second issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baloğlu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Another limitation is that the monitoring of rice and the introduced organisms in this study was not comprehensive. While intensive monitoring was conducted during the rice growing season, only a limited number of variables were measured for a limited number of rice individuals and the detailed dynamics of the two introduced species was unclear (i.e. the fate of the introduced species). This is particularly important for understanding how the introduced organisms affected rice performance. At the molecular level, acquiring larger scale ‘omics’ data for rice and ecological community members, for example long-term gene expression monitoring data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagano et al., 2019</xref>), will facilitate understanding of detailed mechanisms. In addition, at the field level, future studies should consider applying a more advanced monitoring approach, such as unamended aerial vehicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujiwara et al., 2022</xref>), multispectral camera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Candiago et al., 2015</xref>), and/or neural network-based image analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toda and Okura, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, while we used an advanced nonlinear time series analysis to detect potential causal organisms for rice growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osada et al., 2023</xref>), there is still room for improvement. Nonlinear time series analysis is also a rapidly developing field, and many new techniques are emerging for causal inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Runge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>), quantification of interaction strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2021</xref>) and near future forecasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Applying these techniques to agricultural data may help to identify previously overlooked beneficial organisms under field conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we demonstrated that intensive monitoring of an agricultural system and the application of nonlinear time series analysis are helpful for identifying potentially influential organisms under field conditions. Although the effects of the two species were relatively small and how the two species influenced the rice performance (i.e. the fate of the introduced species) was still unclear, the research framework presented here has future potential. The intensive monitoring, nonlinear time series analysis, and in situ validation of the statistical results may be applicable for other agricultural and aquatic systems. For example, the application of our framework to fishery aquaculture systems may be helpful for detecting potential pathogens of fish. Also, if the continuous monitoring of soil ecological communities becomes possible, our approach can be extended to other crops and vegetables. An automated, real-time monitoring system combined with advanced machine learning methods would provide a promising tool for increasing the accuracy and applicability of our approach. In conclusion, we proposed a novel framework to integrate the ecological network concept and agricultural practices to explore and detect potentially influential organisms. Our proof-of-concept study would be an important basis for the further development of field-based system management.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Field experimental setting and rice monitoring in 2017</title><p>Five artificial rice plots were established using small plastic containers (90×90 × 34.5 cm; 216 L total volume; Risu Kogyo, Kagamigahara, Japan) in an experimental field at the Center for Ecological Research, Kyoto University, in Otsu, Japan (34° 58′ 18″ N, 135° 57′ 33″ E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>).

Approximately 200 ml of water in each rice plot was collected from each of the four corners of the plot using a 500 ml plastic bottle and taken to the laboratory within 30 min. The water was filtered using Sterivex filter cartridges (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Two types of filter cartridges were used to filter water samples: to detect microorganisms, φ0.22-µm Sterivex (SVGV010RS) filter cartridges that included zirconia beads inside were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ushio, 2019</xref>), and to detect macroorganisms, φ0.45-µm Sterivex (SVHV010RS) filter cartridges were used.

In total, 1220 water samples (122 days × 2 filter types × 5 plots) were collected during the census term. In addition, 30 field-level negative controls, 32 PCR-level negative controls with or without the internal standard DNAs, and 10 positive controls to monitor the potential DNA cross-contamination and degradation during the sample storage, transport, DNA extraction and library preparations were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Quantitative analysis of environmental DNA: Library preparations, sequencing, and sequence data processing</title><p>Detailed protocols of the quantitative eDNA metabarcoding are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ushio, 2022</xref>, and the protocols below were also adopted for the samples collected in 2019.

There were three treatments, namely, ‘<italic>Globisporangium nunn</italic>-added’ (GN), ‘<italic>C. kiiensis</italic>-removed’ (CK), and control (CT) treatments with three replicates for each treatment. For the GN treatment, isolated and incubated <italic>G. nunn</italic> was mixed in vermiculite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tojo et al., 1993</xref>) and approximately 200 ml of vermiculite was added to each Wagner pot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). Vermiculite without <italic>G. nunn</italic> was added to Wagner pots in the two other treatments. For the CK treatment, midge larvae were removed instead of adding them because isolation and cultivation of this insect species are technically difficult and time- and effort-consuming. Midge larvae were removed using a φ1.0 mm net (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). On average, 283 midge larvae were removed from each plot and the DNA of about 100 removed larvae was sequenced using Sanger sequencing, and all were confirmed as <italic>C. kiiensis</italic>. For the other treatments, the net was also inserted into plots, the water in each plot was mixed by the net for a while, but midge larvae were not removed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Rice growth and ecological community monitoring, and rice leaf sampling during the manipulation experiments</title><p>Rice growth was monitored by measuring rice leaf height of target individuals using a ruler, as in 2017. We selected one rice individual in the middle of each of the Wagner pots as the target individuals (indicated by the three red points in the inlet panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; labelled as locations ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’ from east to west). Leaf SPAD was also measured using a SPAD meter as in 2017. The ecological communities in the rice plots were monitored by analyzing eDNA as in 2017. After we harvested rice, we counted the number of fertile and sterile grains and quantified rice yields.</p><p>In 2019, the rice growth was monitored weekly or biweekly except during the period of the manipulation experiments. The manipulations were performed three times (i.e. 24, 26, and 28 June 2019), and the daily monitoring of the rice plots was performed before and after the manipulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Rice performance (growth rates and SPAD) was monitored every day from 11 June to 12 July (32 days). Water samples for eDNA-based ecological community monitoring were collected every day from 18 June to 12 July (25 days). Rice leaf samples for RNA-seq were collected four times before and after the field manipulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The leaf samples were immediately frozen by dipping into liquid nitrogen under field conditions, and kept frozen until stored in a freezer at –20 °C.

For rice growth rates, the effect of the treatment was tested with the random effects of rice individual and rice plot (in R, this is <monospace>lme4::lmer(growth_rate ~treatment + (1|ind/plot), data = data)</monospace>), and the effects were separately analyzed for before/after the manipulation. Rice cumulative growth (i.e. cumulative growth before the third manipulation or 10 days after the third manipulation) was analyzed similarly, but the random effect of rice individuals was not included because there was only one cumulative value for each rice individual. Also, we tested alternative models including the timing and manipulation treatments (in R, these are <monospace>lme4::lmer(growth_rate ~before_or_after_manipulation*treatment + (1|ind/plot), data = data</monospace>) and <monospace>lme4::lmer(cumulative_growth ~before_or_after_manipulation*treatment + (1|plot), data = data)</monospace>), and obtained general agreement with the results of the above-mentioned analysis. For ecological community, we analyzed the eDNA data taken during the intensive monitoring period before and after the field manipulation experiments (18 June to 12 July; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), and the effects of the manipulation (i.e. the addition of <italic>G. nunn</italic> or the removal of <italic>C. kiiensis</italic>) were separately tested for each treatment with the random effect of rice plot assuming a gamma error distribution (in R, this is<monospace> lme4::glmer(DNA_conc ~ before_or_after_manipulation + (1|plot), data = data, family = Gamma(link=&quot;log&quot;))</monospace>).

Differences in the ecological community compositions were visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>). In the present study, we used the term ‘statistical clarity’ instead of ‘statistical significance’ to avoid misinterpretations, according to the recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dushoff et al., 2019</xref>, when p&lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantifications of RNA expressions of rice leaves</title><p>The leaf samples were ground under cryogenic conditions using a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan). Total RNA was extracted using the Maxwell 16 LEV Plant RNA Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

DESeq2 provides statistical frameworks for determining differential expression using a model based on the negative binomial distribution. Briefly, size factors and dispersions were estimated, generalized linear models (GLMs) assuming a negative binomial error distribution were fitted, and the differences were tested. These analyses were performed using <monospace>DESeq2::DESeq()</monospace> function implemented in the package. In the DESeq2 analysis, false discovery rate was set as 0.05, and genes with an adjusted p&lt;0.05 found by DESeq2 were assigned as differentially expressed. We measured rice gene expression four times and we detected almost no DEGs at sampling events 1, 3, and 4 except for two DEGs at sampling event 4. Therefore, we report only the results of sampling event 2 in the present study (one day after the third field manipulation).

Thus, it is still difficult to obtain deep understanding of the mechanisms of our findings that the species introduced in the system would influence rice growth. Nonetheless, our study demonstrated the effectiveness of our research framework as we found evidence that the species that were discovered by the eDNA monitoring and time series analysis indeed cause changes in the system. We believe that the first step is to show that the framework is workable and that detailed understanding of the mechanisms or genetic pathway was not a focus of our study. To avoid misunderstanding, we have added several explanations regarding this point in L426–431 and L447. For example, in L426, we have added the following statement: &quot;... the detailed dynamics of the two introduced species was unclear (i.e., the fate of the introduced species). This is particularly important for understanding how the introduced organisms affected rice performance...&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors did not check the fate of two species after introducing into rice.

Understanding molecular mechanisms of the phenomenon that we found is important (especially from the viewpoint of molecular biology), but our primary objective was to demonstrate that our &quot;eDNA x time series analysis&quot; framework is feasible for detecting previously overlooked but influential organisms. To this end, we believe that we achieved our objective and repeating the validation experiment should be for a different purpose (i.e., for understanding molecular mechanisms).

Based on the metabarcoding technique, various variables that may affect rice growth were quantitatively measured, although not perfectly, and the causal relationship between these variables and rice growth was analyzed by using information transfer analysis. Using this method, two new players capable of manipulating rice growth were verified, despite their unknown functions until now.

We are pleased to see you found that our approach is novel. We have revised our manuscript in accordance with your comments, and we hope that the revision and responses resolved your concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #1-2 1. Experimental setting: Authors made up small scale pot system in 2017 and then expanded manipulative experiment. I do not understand how two influencing organism sequences were identified from the single treatment depending on different time points. How they can be convince the two organisms affect the rice growth rather than other biological and environmental factors.</p></disp-quote><p>In 2017, we performed an intensive monitoring of the experimental rice plots and obtained large time series data (122-day consecutive monitoring x 5 plots = 610 data points). The time series data were analyzed using the information-theoretic causal analysis. The analysis is critically different from correlational analyses and designed to identify causal relationships among variables. Although we understand that field manipulation experiments are a common and straightforward approach to identify causal relationships among organisms, we chose the &quot;fieldmonitoring + time-series-based causal analysis&quot; approach. This is because, as explained in the main text, there are numerous factors that could influence rice performance, and it is practically impossible to perform manipulative experiments for all the potential factors that could influence rice growth. On the other hand, our &quot;field-monitoring + timeseries-based causal analysis&quot; approach has a potential to identify multiple factors under field conditions, even by the single experimental treatment.</p><p>Nonetheless, we must admit that our time-series-based approach still has a chance to misidentify causal factors. Our framework relies on statistics, so the chance of false-positive detection of causality cannot be zero. This was exactly the reason why we performed the &quot;validation&quot; experiment in 2019. To complement the statistical results of the 2017 experiments, we performed another experiment in 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #1-3 2. eDNA technology: The eDNA analysis based on four universal primers 16s rRNA, 18s rRNA, ITS, and COI regions must not be enough to identify specific species. The resolution of species classification may not meet to confirm exact species. Thus, the accuracy of two species that they selected for further experiment is difficult to be confirmed. Authors also referred to &quot;putative Globisporangium&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Your point is correct. The DNA barcoding regions we selected are short and it is often difficult to identify species. However, this limitation could not have been overcome even if we had chosen a different genetic marker. The long-read sequencing technology could partially solve the issue, but the number of sequence reads generated by the long-read technique is less than that by the short-read sequencing technology, and comprehensive detection of all species in an ecological community was still challenging. Our approach struck a balance among the identification resolution, comprehensiveness of the analysis, and sequencing costs. In addition, even though we could not identify most ASVs at the species level, some ASVs could be identified at the species level (52 ASVs among the 718 ASVs which had causal influences on rice growth), and we selected the two species (G. nunn and C. kiiensis) from the 52 species.</p><p>Further, the taxa assign algorithm we used here (i.e., Claident; Tanabe &amp; Toju 2012 PLoS ONE 10.1371/journal.pone.0076910) adopted conservative criteria for species identification and has a low falsepositive probability.</p><p>More importantly, this is also the reason why we performed the &quot;validation&quot; experiment in 2019. The species identified in the 2017 experiment are still &quot;potential&quot; organisms that influence rice growth (i.e., the hypothesis-generating phase), and we tested the hypothesis in 2019.</p><p>Nonetheless, we must admit that clear description of potential limitations is important. Thus, we have discussed this in L418: &quot;As for the second issue, short-read sequencing has dominated current eDNA studies, but it is often not sufficient for lower-level taxonomic identification. Using long-read sequencing techniques (e.g., Oxford Nanopore MinION) for eDNA studies is a promising approach to overcome the second issue&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #1-4 3. Biological relevance 1: Authors identify two organisms as influencing organism for rice growth. As conducting the first experiment in 2017, the 2019 experiment was different from natural condition. The two experiments in 2017 and 2019 were conducted under different conditions. How do they compare the experiments? At least, the eDNA analyses in 2017 and 2019 should be very similar. I cannot find such data.</p></disp-quote><p>The experimental conditions were different between 2017 and 2019 because they were conducted in different years. Theoretically, it is ideal if the experimental conditions in 2019 are covered by the range of experimental conditions in 2017 (e.g,. rice variety, air temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation). If this condition were satisfied, the attractor (i.e., rice growth trajectory delineated in the state space) in 2019 would be within that in 2017, and our model prediction in 2017 would be used to predict dynamics in 2019 accurately. To fulfill the conditions, we made as much effort as possible: we used the same rice variety and soils in 2019 as those used in 2017, and started our experiment at the same timing in 2019 as that in 2017.</p><p>Although natural ecological dynamics cannot be precisely controlled, our monitoring revealed that the ecological dynamics in 2019 was qualitatively similar to that in 2017. To demonstrate that the experimental conditions and eDNA community data were similar between the two experiments, we have presented the climate and eDNA data in an inset figure in Figure 3a, Figure 1–figure supplement 2, Figure 3–figure supplement 2. We must admit that these dynamics are not identical, but we hope that this resolves your concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #1-5 4. Lack of detail description: In the Materials and Methods, there are many parts which lack on detail description.

Also, to improve the logical flow and readability of our manuscript, we have added brief explanations about what/how we did at the first sentence of Results subsections (some of these explanations were only in Materials and Methods in the original manuscript). We have added the reference for how to cultivate G. nunn in L608 (Kobayashi et al., 2010; Tojo et al., 1993) (C. kiiensis was not cultivated but removed from the system as in Materials and Methods), and application concentrations. Application methods were described in Materials and Methods, the section Field manipulation experiments in 2019 in L596.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #1-6 5. Validation: Application of one species clearly resulted to promote rice growth. They must include appropriate control treatment. If they pick same genus but different species that identified no specific effect on rice growth through eDNA analysis, no effect on growth can be provided. Generally application of large population of certain non-harmful organism confer plant growth promotion. It is not surprising result. Authors need to prove effectiveness of eDNA analysis. In addition, the field experiments required at least two years of consistent data for publication because environmental factors are so dynamic.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We agree with your comment that species that were predicted to have no effect should not promote rice growth in a validation experiment. It was also one of our inititial experimental plans to include such species in our manipulation experiment in 2019, but we could not include them because of the limitation of time, labor, and money. More extensive validation of the statistical results of the 2017 data, including multi-year experiments, would further validate the effectiveness of our approach, which should be done as future studies. To clarify this point, we have added statements in the paragraph starting at L396.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #1-7 In conclusion, I suggest that authors need more large data analysis and validate with more accurate and meaningful protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>As we explained in the revised manuscript and the Response to Comments #1-2 to #1-7, our study demonstrated a novel research framework to detect previously overlooked influential organisms under field conditions. We agree that larger data analysis would be ideal to further validate our approach, but whether and how to collect larger data is constrained by time, money, and labor. We believe that our study was designed carefully and could provide meaningful avenues for developing an ecological-network based, novel, and environment-friendly agriculture solutions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Comment #2-1 Lines 97-110: This is so cool.

More direct estimations of the Jacobian can be done using the MDR S-map method (Chang et al. 2021 DOI:10.1111/ele.13897), but we did not perform the MDR S-map in the present manuscript (see Ushio et al. 2023<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85795">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.85795</ext-link> for the application of the MDR S-map).

We have mentioned this in L278 and L383: &quot;We found almost no DEGs for leaf samples taken one day before and 14 and 38 days after the third manipulation (the leaf sampling event 1, 3, and 4), suggesting that the influences of the treatments on the gene expression patterns were transient.&quot; (L278) and &quot;These changes were observed relatively quickly and transient.&quot; (L383)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #2-16 I wonder if a conceptual framework figure would help to generalize the workflow that can be used for other studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

Therefore, we might find similar RGR patterns if we focus on a specific period of the growing season. However, unfortunately, we performed the intensive (i.e., daily) monitoring in 2019 only during the field manipulation period (middle June to middle July 2019), and we cannot investigate the changes in cumulative growth throughout the growing season (this depends on how many days we add up RGR to calculate the cumulative growth, though). We agree that, if we had investigated the detailed pattern of RGR throughout the growing season in 2019, we could have found similar pattens between RGR and cumulative growth rate at a certain period in the growing season. In Figure 4, the cumulative growths were calculated based on the RGRs before the third manipulation or during 10 days after the third manipulation.
