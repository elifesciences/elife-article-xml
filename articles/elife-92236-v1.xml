to anti-cancer treatments, and often arises as a consequence of increased signaling flux channeled to mRNA-bearing eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F). However, the post-translational regulation of eIF4A1, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and subunit of the eIF4F complex, is still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that IBTK, a substrate-binding adaptor of the Cullin 3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, interacts with eIF4A1. The non-degradative ubiquitination of eIF4A1 catalyzed by the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex promotes cap-dependent translational initiation, nascent protein synthesis, oncogene expression, and cervical tumor cell growth both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we show that mTORC1 and S6K1, two key regulators of protein synthesis, directly phosphorylate IBTK to augment eIF4A1 ubiquitination and sustained oncogenic translation. This link between the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex and the mTORC1/S6K1 signaling pathway, which is frequently dysregulated in cancer, represents a promising target for anti-cancer therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tumorigenesis</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>mTORC1/S6K1

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enhanced protein synthesis is a critical process that allows cancer cells to survive, multiply, metastasize, and resist anti-cancer treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fabbri et al., 2021</xref>). This process typically results from increased signaling through the eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), which binds to mRNAs. eIF4F complex is composed of four proteins: eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4B, and eIF4A. Of these, eIF4A is responsible for unwinding the secondary structure in the 5'-UTR region of the mRNA, allowing the ribosomal subunit to bind and begin translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Merrick, 2015</xref>). The eIF4A protein family consists of three paralogs, eIF4A1, eIF4A2, and eIF4A3. Although eIF4A1 and eIF4A2 have similar roles in translation initiation, eIF4A3 is not involved in translation control but an important component of the exon junction complex (EJC) and plays a critical role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Increased eIF4F activity promotes the translation of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation and survival, and tumor immune evasion, which are hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boussemart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerezo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malka-Mahieu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pelletier et al., 2015</xref>). Several eIF4A inhibitors, such as eFT226, silvestrol, hippuristanol, and pateamine A, have demonstrated promising anti-tumor activities in various cancer types conducted in vitro and in vivo studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boussemart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malka-Mahieu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pelletier et al., 2015</xref>). In particular, eFT226 is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ernst et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The mTORC1 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in promoting cell growth and anabolism while inhibiting catabolism. It integrates various signals from nutrients, cellular energy levels, growth factors, and environmental stimuli to regulate this process. Translation is a highly energy-intensive process and tightly regulated by the mTORC1 signaling. Ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks) and 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are two major downstream targets of the mTORC1 signaling. They regulate various aspects of mRNA translation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. For example, S6Ks phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6, which promotes translation initiation and elongation. 4E-BPs, on the other hand, bind to eIF4E and inhibit its activity, preventing the translation of specific mRNAs. In addition, mTORC1 coordinates translation by phosphorylating other components of the translational machinery, such as eEF2K, eIF2B, and LARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battaglioni et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The Cullin 3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex subfamily is composed of a catalytic core made up of RBX1 and CUL3, and a substrate-binding adaptor that contains an interchangeable BTB domain. The CRL3 complex plays roles in regulating various cellular processes,such as cell division, differentiation, and signal transduction. Through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, the CRL3 complex promotes the degradation of specific proteins by marking them with ubiquitin. However, the CRL3 complex can also facilitate non-degradative ubiquitination, which can modulate substrate activity, localization, or interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Genschik et al., 2013</xref>). Initially characterized as an inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (IBTK), the IBTK contains two BTB domains and can assemble an active CRL3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pisano et al., 2015</xref>). The downstream targets and biological processes of the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex are still poorly understood, but a limited number of studies suggest that IBTK plays a pro-survival role in cancer cells. IBTK was preferentially translated in response to eIF2α phosphorylation during endoplasmic reticulum stress. Knockdown (KD) of IBTK expression reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baird et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Willy et al., 2017</xref>). A genome-wide RNAi screen identified IBTK as a synthetic lethal partner of the Ras oncogene in colorectal cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2009</xref>). In Eμ-myc transgenic mice, <italic>Ibtk</italic> gene knockout (KO) delayed the onset of pre-B/B lymphoma and improved animal survival due to increased apoptosis of pre-cancerous B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vecchio et al., 2019</xref>). The expression of IBTK was significantly increased in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression, but decreased in remission following chemotherapy. KD of IBTK expression increased spontaneous and chemotherapy agent-induced apoptosis and impaired cell cycle progression in CLL cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albano et al., 2018</xref>). To date, only two substrates of the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex have been reported. CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> targeted PDCD4, an eIF4A1 inhibitor, for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pisano et al., 2015</xref>). Another study showed that CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> activated β-catenin-dependent transcription of MYC by promoting GSK-3β degradation in cancerous B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vecchio et al., 2022</xref>). These findings indicate that CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> may play a crucial role in cancer development and progression, as well as in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis.</p><p>Through a variety of biochemical and cell biology approaches, we have identified eIF4A1 as a non-degradative ubiquitination substrate of the CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> complex. Our findings also suggest that a mTORC1/S6K1-IBTK-eIF4A1 signaling axis mediates cap-dependent translation, facilitates oncoprotein expression, and promotes tumor cell growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of eIF4A family proteins as IBTK interacting proteins</title><p>Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and proximity-dependent biotinylation identification (BioID) methods are two powerful tools for interrogating protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Using these techniques, we sought to comprehensively characterize the interaction partners of IBTK in living cells. To accomplish this, we developed a tag workflow that enabled simultaneous AP-MS and BioID analysis with a single construct, pcDNA5/FRT vector containing FLAG-BirA*-IBTK. This construct was stably transfected into Flp-In T-REx 293 cells, resulting in inducible expression of IBTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We observed that levels of doxycycline (DOX)-induced FLAG-BirA*-IBTK protein were comparable to those of endogenous IBTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Through our AP-MS and BioID analysis, we identified multiple potential IBTK interactors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a and b</xref>). One notable finding was the presence of multiple eIFs in the purified IBTK complexes, including the subunits of eIF2, eIF3, and eIF4 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Of particular interest, eIF4A1 is a crucial subunit of the eIF4F complex and a promising therapeutic target for cancer. Previous large-scale interactome mapping datasets have also revealed a potential interaction between IBTK and eIF4A1, though it had not been analyzed for its biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huttlin et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we performed additional analyses to explore the pathophysiological significance of the eIF4A1-IBTK interaction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (IBTK) interacts with eIF4A1 in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot (WB) analysis of the indicated proteins in the whole cell lysates (WCLs) from FLAG-BirA*-IBTK Tet-on-inducible Flp-In T-REx 293 cells treated with doxycycline (DOX) (10 ng/ml) for 12 hr.

Therefore, this study primarily focused on investigating the functional consequences of CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup>-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination.</p><p>After identifying that CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup>-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination is non-degradative, we explored the specificity of polyubiquitin chain linkage on eIF4A1 catalyzed by CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup>. To do this, we conducted ubiquitination assays using a panel of ubiquitin mutants with a single lysine-to-arginine (KR) mutation at seven lysine residues or only one lysine present with the other six lysine residues mutated to arginine (KO). Additionally, we included a ubiquitin mutant in which all lysine residues were replaced with arginine (K-ALL-R). Strikingly, co-expression of any Ub-KR or -KO mutants did not significantly impact IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination, whereas co-expression of the Ub K-ALL-R mutant, which is unable to form polyubiquitin chains, caused only a moderate reduction in IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Indeed, co-expression of the Ub-ΔGG mutant totally abolished IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). At last, we aimed to identify the specific lysine sites on eIF4A1 where ubiquitin was attached.

Thus, four out of seven sites (excluding S992, T1008, and T1068) were confirmed as mTORC1/S6K1 phosphorylation sites in vitro, thereby confirming that IBTK is an authentic mTORC1/S6K1 substrate. Then, we generated an IBTK mutant (IBTK-7S/TA) in which seven Ser/Thr were replaced with Ala to abolish phosphorylation regulated by mTORC1/S6K1. Simultaneous mutation of seven Ser/Thr sites to Ala nearly abolished the mobility shift of IBTK<sub>900-1150aa</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>), indicating that most, if not all, mTOR-regulated sites are localized in this region. Recognizing that S990/992/993 are three adjacent sites, we deemed it appropriate to generate a single antibody to recognize the phospho-S990/992/993 epitope.

The results showed a marked upregulation of IBTK protein expression in CESC tissues compared to adjacent normal cervical tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

In general, cancer cells upregulate eIF4F activity to promote cap-dependent translation and oncogene expression, leading to rapid cell growth. Our study reveals an uncharacterized signaling axis involving mTORC1/S6K1-IBTK-eIF4A1 that promotes cap-dependent translation and oncoprotein expression, contributing to tumor cell growth. Additionally, we demonstrate that mTORC1 and S6K1 phosphorylate IBTK at multiple sites to boost CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup>-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination under nutrient-rich conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Overall, our study adds to our understanding of how cancer cells hijack protein synthesis machinery to promote their survival and proliferation, and provides potential avenues for developing new cancer treatments.</p><p>The development of eIF4A inhibitors as therapeutic agents for cancer patients is an exciting area of research. However, the emergence of resistance to these inhibitors highlights the need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance. The recent genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen has identified three negative NRF2 regulators (KEAP1, CUL3, and CAND1) whose inactivation can confer resistance to the silvestrol analogue, providing insights into potential pathways that may contribute to drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sanghvi et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, our study shows that IBTK overexpression suppresses AS-induced SG assembly and that ablation of IBTK sensitizes cancer cells to eIF4A inhibitor-induced cell death, making IBTK a potential therapeutic target to overcome intrinsic resistance to eIF4A inhibitors. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of continued research in the development of eIF4A inhibitors and the identification of new therapeutic targets to combat drug resistance in cancer cells.</p><p>We observed that IBTK depletion indeed led to a substantial reduction in the protein levels of most detected eIF4A1-regulated oncogenes, but there were exceptions. For instance, IBTK KO in H1299 cells exerted minimal influence on the protein levels of ROCK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Several possible explanations might account for this observation: first, given that our list of eIF4A1 target genes collected from previous studies conducted using distinct cell lines, it is not unexpected for different cell lines to exhibit subtle differences in regulation of eIF4A1 target genes. Second, as a CRL3 adaptor, IBTK potentially possesses other biological functions via ubiquitination of multiple substrates; dysregulation of these could buffer the impact of IBTK deficiency on the protein expression of specific eIF4A1 targets.</p><p>The tumor suppressor PDCD4 inhibits translation by binding directly to eIF4A. Pisano et al. reported that PDCD4 is the first CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> substrate and that CRL3<sup>IBTK</sup> targets PDCD4 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pisano et al., 2015</xref>). Although this study highlighted the potential involvement of IBTK in translation regulation, we did not observe any changes in protein levels of PDCD4 in IBTK-KD or -KO cells. Instead, our study demonstrated that eIF4A1 is a major downstream effector of IBTK, which has been previously observed to regulate several well-characterized eIF4A targets, such as MYC and MCL-1, in Eμ-myc mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vecchio et al., 2019</xref>). Our results also indicate that IBTK may play a role in tumor immune escape through modulating the eIF4F-STAT1-IRF1-PD-L1 axis. This finding is in line with a recent study that eIF4A1 promotes PD-L1-mediated tumor immune escape by facilitating the translation of STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cerezo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to eIF4A1/2, IBTK does not possess the ability to ubiquitinate eIF4A3, despite a robust interaction between these two proteins. It remains unclear whether IBTK can facilitate eIF4A3 ubiquitination under specific conditions or merely modulate eIF4A3 activity through direct binding. eIF4A3 is an essential subunit of EJC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). The role of IBTK in post-transcriptional gene regulation through modulation of EJC activity is an area that warrants further investigation, particularly given that KD of eIF4A3 or IBTK all had an impact on alternative splicing in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fiume et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Alongside its interaction with eIF4A1/2, IBTK may also play diverse roles in different stages of the translation process. The AP-MS analysis and biochemical validation provide strong evidence for the interaction between IBTK and eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). A previous study showed that a functional uORF in the 5’-UTR sequence allows for preferential translation of IBTK in response to p-eIF2α and ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2023</xref>). Our findings suggest that IBTK may interact with eIF2α and modulate its activity, either positively or negatively, through direct binding in response to p-eIF2α and ER stress. Furthermore, the identification of IBTK interacting with multiple subunits of eIF3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and G</xref>), which plays key roles in different stages of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomes-Duarte et al., 2018</xref>), highlights the potential role of IBTK in modulating translation through the eIF3 complex. Taken together, these findings provide a molecular basis for comprehensive investigations into the precise roles of IBTK in controlling the efficiency and fidelity of protein synthesis.</p><p>Several quantitative phosphoproteomic studies have used mTOR inhibitors coupled with MS to demonstrate that mTOR modulates the phosphorylation of thousands of currently uncharacterized mTOR substrates, either directly or indirectly through its downstream kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). One such potential mTOR substrate is IBTK. We noted that seven mTOR-regulated Ser/Thr sites are clustered in a short region of IBTK and hyperphosphorylation of IBTK<sub>900-1150aa</sub> mutant was abolished when mTOR activity was inhibited. In particular, using in vitro kinase assays combined with MS, we have identified S999/S1004 as sites phosphorylated by mTOR, and S990/993 as sites phosphorylated by S6K1. However, the kinases responsible for the remaining three phosphorylation sites are still unidentified, necessitating further investigation. Understanding the precise mechanisms by which mTOR regulates IBTK phosphorylation and activity could offer insights into the broader functions of mTOR signaling in protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and lentiviral infection</title><p>SiHa, HeLa, 293T, H1299, and CT26 cells were acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

We attempted to perform Phos-tag assays to detect the overexpressed full-length FLAG-IBTK or endogenous IBTK. However, we encountered difficulties in successfully transferring the full-length FLAG-IBTK or endogenous IBTK onto the nitrocellulose membrane during Phos-tag WB analysis. This is likely due to the limitations of this technique. Based on our experience, phos-tag gel is less efficient in detecting protein motility shifts with large molecular weights. As the molecular weight of IBTK protein is approximately 160 kDa, it falls within this category. Considering these technical constraints, we did not include Phos-tag assay results for full-length IBTK in our study. We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's understanding regarding this matter.</p><p>The binding of Phos-tag to phosphorylated proteins induces a mobility shift during gel electrophoresis or protein separation techniques. This shift allows for the visualization and quantification of phosphorylated proteins separately from non-phosphorylated proteins. It's important to note that these mobility shifts indicate phosphorylation status, rather than actual molecular weights. pre- stained protein markers are typically used as a reference to assess the efficiency of protein transfer onto the membrane [Ref: 1]. Considering the aforementioned reasons, we did not add molecular weights to the WB images.</p><p>Reference [1].

Torin1 is a synthetic mTOR inhibitor by preventing the binding of ATP to mTOR, leading to the inactivation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, whereas rapamycin primarily targets mTORC1 activity and may inhibit mTORC2 in certain cell types after a prolonged treatment. We have identified that the predominant mediator of IBTK phosphorylation is the mTORC1/S6K1 complex. Therefore, in this context, we think that rapamycin is sufficient to inactivate the mTORC1/S6K1 pathway. As shown in Fig. 5F, the phosphorylated IBTK900-1150aa was markedly decreased while the non-phosphorylated form was simultaneously increased in rapamycin- treated cells. As per the reviewer's suggestion, we treated FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa overexpressed cells with lambda phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 5G, lambda phosphatase treatment completely abolished the mobility shifts of phosphorylated FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa. Additionally, the lowest band displayed an abundant accumulation of the non-phosphorylated form of FLAG-IBTK900-1150aa.

We added a sentence to describe the properties of the ΔBTB mutant. This mutant lacks the BTB1 and BTB2 domains (deletion of aa 554–871), which have been previously demonstrated to be essential for binding to CUL3. The original reference has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 2G how do the authors explain the fact that co-expression of the Ub K-ALLR mutant, which is unable to form polyubiquitin chains, formed only a moderate reduction in IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. The Ub K-ALLR mutant can indeed conjugate to substrate proteins, but it cannot form chains due to its absence of lysine residues, resulting in mono-ubiquitination. Multi- mono-ubiquitination refers to the attachment of single ubiquitin molecules to multiple lysine residues on a substrate protein. It's worth noting that a poly- ubiquitinated protein and a multi-mono-ubiquitinated protein appear strikingly similar in Western blot. Our findings demonstrated that the co-expression of the Ub K-ALL-R mutant resulted in only a modest reduction in IBTK-mediated eIF4A1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2G), and that eIF4A1 was ubiquitinated at twelve lysine residues when co-expressed with IBTK (Fig. S2F). As such, we conclude that the CRL3IBTK complex primarily catalyzes multi-mono-ubiquitination on eIF4A1..</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 5, The identity of the seven sites in the IBTK 7ST A mutants should be specified.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point.

Upon demonstrating that IBTK can be phosphorylated—with evidence from positive Phos-tag and in vitro phosphorylation assays—we sought to directly detect changes in the phosphorylation levels using an antibody specific to IBTK phosphorylation. However, the expense of generating seven phosphorylation- specific antibodies for each site is significant. Recognizing that S990/992/993 are three adjacent sites, we deemed it appropriate to generate a single antibody to recognize the phospho-S990/992/993 epitope. Moreover, out of the seven phosphorylation sites, S992 perfectly matches the consensus motif for S6K1 phosphorylation (RXRXXS). Utilizing this antibody allowed us to observe a substantial decrease in the phosphorylation levels of these three adjacent Ser residues in IBTK following either AA deprivation or Rapamycin treatment (Fig. 5L). We have specified these points in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The following suggestions would strengthen the study:</p><p>(1) Directly examine the effects of IBTK modulation (knockdown/knockout/ overexpression) on eIF4A1 helicase activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. We agree with the reviewer's suggestion that evaluating IBTK's influence on eIF4A1 helicase activity directly would enhance the strength of our conclusion. However, the current eIF4A1 helicase assays, as described in previous publications [Ref: 1, 2], can only be conducted using in vitro purified recombinant proteins. For instance, it is feasible to assess the varying levels of helicase activity exhibited by recombinant wild-type or mutant EIF4A1 proteins [Ref: 2]. Importantly, there is currently no reported methodology for evaluating the helicase activity of EIF4A1 in vivo, as mentioned by the reviewer in gene knockdown, knockout, or overexpression cellular contexts. Therefore, we have not performed these assays and we sincerely appreciate the reviewer's understanding in this regard.

As the reviewer has pointed out, we assessed the protein levels of ten reported eIF4A1 target genes across three cancer cell lines (Fig.4, Fig. S4A, C). We observed that IBTK depletion led to a substantial reduction in the protein levels of most eIF4A1- regulated oncogenes upon IBTK depletion, although there were some exceptions. For instance, IBTK KO in H1299 cells exerted minimal influence on the protein levels of ROCK1 (Fig. S4A). Several possible explanations might account for this observation: firstly, given that our list of eIF4A1 target genes collected from previous studies conducted using distinct cell lines, it is not unexpected for different lines to exhibit subtle differences in regulation of eIF4A1 target genes. Secondly, as a CRL3 adaptor, IBTK potentially performs other biological functions via ubiquitination of specific substrates; dysregulation of these could buffer the impact of IBTK KO on the protein expression of some eIF4A1 target genes.

In order to inhibit mTORC1 activation, we employed several approaches including AA starvation, Rapamycin treatment, or Raptor knockout. Our results have demonstrated that both AA starvation and rapamycin treatment led to a reduction in eIF4A1 ubiquitination (Fig. 5M). Moreover, we have included new findings in the revised manuscript, which highlight that Raptor knockout specifically decreases eIF4A1 ubiquitination (Fig. 5N). It is worth mentioning that the impacts of mTOR inhibition or activation on protein translation have been extensively investigated and documented in numerous studies. Therefore, in our study, we did not feel it necessary to examine these treatments further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Although not absolutely necessary, it would be nice to see if some of these findings are true in other cancer cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this crucial point. We concur with the reviewer's suggestion that including data from other cancer cell types would enhance the strength of our conclusion. While the majority of our data is derived from two cervical cancer cell lines, we have corroborated certain key findings— such as the impact of IBTK on eIF4A1 and its target gene expression—in H1299 cells (human lung cancer) (Fig. 2C, Fig. S4A, B) and in CT26 cells (murine colon adenocarcinoma) (Fig. S4C, D). Additionally, we demonstrated that IBTK promotes IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression and tumor immune escape in both the H1299 and CT26 cells (Fig. S6A-K).</p></body></sub-article></article>
