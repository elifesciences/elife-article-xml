neurons, a prominent clathrin-coated structure, the endocytic zone (EZ), controls the trafficking of glutamate receptors and is essential for synaptic plasticity. Despite its importance, little is known about how this clathrin structure is organized to mediate endocytosis. We used live-cell and super-resolution microscopy to reveal the dynamic organization of this poorly understood clathrin structure in rat hippocampal neurons. We found that a subset of endocytic proteins only transiently appeared at postsynaptic sites. In contrast, other proteins were persistently enriched and partitioned at the edge of the EZ. We found that uncoupling the EZ from the synapse led to the loss of most of these components, while disrupting interactions with the actin cytoskeleton or membrane did not alter EZ positioning. Finally, we found that plasticity-inducing stimuli promoted the reorganization of the EZ. We conclude that the EZ is a stable, highly organized molecular platform where components are differentially recruited and positioned to orchestrate the endocytosis of synaptic receptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>clathrin</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>dendrite</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALW Open Program grant NWO-ALWOP. 191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacGillavry</surname><given-names>Harold D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The postsynaptic endocytic zone is a highly organized structure composed of a diversity of endocytic proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the principal mechanism for the internalization of membrane components, and is essential for cellular homeostasis, intercellular signaling, and nutrient uptake in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McMahon and Boucrot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). This process involves the tightly controlled initiation and maturation of clathrin-coated pits that is mediated by the sequential recruitment of clathrin, cargo, and endocytic adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cocucci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). Apart from these well-characterized, small (~100 nm) and short-lived ( &lt; 120 sec) clathrin coats, numerous electron and (live-cell) light microscopy studies have revealed that clathrin can assemble into a remarkably large variety of membrane-attached structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heuser, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leyton-Puig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saffarian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanan and Anderson, 1991</xref>). In fact, the lifetime, size, and morphology of clathrin assemblies at the membrane diverge enormously between cell types and even within cells. Clathrin structures varying from 100 nm up to 1 µm with lifetimes ranging from seconds to tens of minutes have been reported. The origins and functional relevance of this striking heterogeneity remain to be elucidated.</p><p>This heterogeneity is particularly evident in neurons that contain a divergent population of clathrin structures distributed over their immense and complex plasma membrane. At postsynaptic sites, a clathrin-coated structure (CCS) referred to as the endocytic zone (EZ) is stably associated with the postsynaptic density (PSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanpied et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2007</xref>), via a Shank-Homer1c-Dynamin3 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosendale et al., 2017</xref>). Disrupting the PSD-EZ interaction severely affects glutamate receptor levels at synapses. Particularly, the ionotropic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petrini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosendale et al., 2017</xref>) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheefhals et al., 2019</xref>) have been found to undergo trafficking mediated by the EZ, while transferrin receptors are not preferentially internalized near the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosendale et al., 2017</xref>). It has been proposed that once internalized at the EZ, glutamate receptors enter the local recycling mechanism, that retains receptors in intracellular pools that can recycle back to the synaptic membrane in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, the local recycling of receptors via the EZ is essential for synaptic plasticity as uncoupling the EZ from the PSD depletes synaptic AMPA receptors and aborts activity-induced trafficking of receptors to the synaptic membrane during long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petrini et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, disruptions in EZ structure and function have been associated with the development of neuronal disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cortese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheefhals et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite the clear functional importance of the EZ for synaptic transmission and plasticity in neurons, the molecular organization and how this organization contributes to its function is poorly understood. In electron microscopy studies, CCSs have been observed within dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Petralia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tao-Cheng et al., 2011</xref>) at an approximate distance of 100–600 nm from the PSD, coinciding with an enrichment of endocytic proteins such as dynamin2 and AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rácz et al., 2004</xref>). However, fundamental information on the spatial distribution and dynamics of endocytic proteins relative to the EZ and how these proteins contribute to EZ organization is missing. Here, we resolved the spatial and temporal organization of CCSs in dendrites and spines using live-cell imaging and super-resolution microscopy. We found that the postsynaptic EZ contains a unique and stable assembly of endocytic proteins, that is highly organized at the nanoscale level and is reorganized during synaptic plasticity. Based on these findings, we propose that the EZ is a highly distinct clathrin-coated structure that operates as a preassembled platform for endocytosis of synaptic components to sustain efficient synaptic transmission and plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heterogenous morphology of clathrin-coated structures in dendrites</title><p>To visualize CCSs in mature cultured hippocampal neurons (DIV16-21), GFP-clathrin light-chain-A (GFP-CLCa) was co-transfected with Homer1c-mCherry as a marker of excitatory synapses. We found a large variety of CCSs distributed throughout the entire neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In dendrites, a high density of clathrin structures was found in the shaft and the majority of dendritic spines contained a distinct EZ, defined as a clathrin puncta closely associated with the PSD (75% ± 5%), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanpied et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheefhals et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, labeling endogenous CLCa using a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willems et al., 2020</xref>) resulted in comparable distribution of clathrin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To resolve CCSs in dendrites at high spatial resolution, we used stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, allowing quantitative analyses of clathrin structure morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, STED resolved individual structures at much higher resolution than confocal, often resolving distinct substructures within clathrin patches that appeared homogenous in confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). PSDs associated with more than one clathrin structure were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We found that 59% ± 5% of the PSDs were associated with one clathrin structure, while 14% ± 2% and 5.4% ± 0.8% were associated with two or three clathrin structures, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heterogenous morphology of clathrin-coated structures in dendrites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example image of neuron expressing Homer1c-mCherry and GFP-CLCa.

On average, the area of PSD-associated clathrin structures was lower, albeit not statistically different from the average area of clathrin structures found in the shaft (area clathrin structures in shaft: 0.045 ± 0.003 µm<sup>2</sup>, spine: 0.038 µm<sup>2</sup> ± 0.002, p &gt; 0.1). However, the variability in sizes of clathrin structures in the shaft, was much larger than in spines (CV shaft: 1.3; spines: 0.84), with larger structures exclusively found in the shaft and not in spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>; range in width/length shaft: 0.15 µm to 1.7 µm, spine: 0.084 µm to 0.78 µm). Indeed, large clathrin structures were regularly observed in the shaft, approximately ~3 per 20 µm of dendrite (data not shown). Thus, dendrites contain a large variation of clathrin-marked structures, with PSD-associated EZs being a distinct, homogenous sub-population of clathrin structures in dendritic spines.</p><p>Studies in non-neuronal cells often classify clathrin structures as flat lattices based on size and shape. Compared to small, circular clathrin structures, presumably representing endocytic pits or intracellular vesicles, lattices are defined as large and irregularly shaped clathrin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leyton-Puig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saffarian et al., 2009</xref>). We generated scatterplots of the circularity and area of individual dendritic clathrin structures to test if we could find a similar classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, there was no correlation between size and circularity in dendritic clathrin structures (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.006). Also, we did not observe a clear distinction in clathrin structures using this approach, suggesting that CCSs in dendrites form a highly heterogeneous population that, at this resolution ( &lt; 100 nm), cannot easily be classified based on these morphological parameters. Altogether, these data highlight the morphological heterogeneity of CCSs in neuronal dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Clathrin dynamics at the EZ are distinct from CCSs in the dendritic shaft</title><p>To study the dynamic properties of CCSs in both spines and dendritic shaft we next performed live-cell imaging of GFP-CLCa in dendrites. We first investigated the dynamics of CCSs on short time intervals by imaging at 0.2 Hz for 5 min. To differentiate stationary from moving particles, we used a Fourier analysis-based filtering on kymographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mangeol et al., 2016</xref>). The dendritic shaft predominantly contained stationary CCSs, however smaller anterograde and retrograde moving puncta were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, these fast-moving particles were small (IQR: 0.013–0.065 µm<sup>2</sup>) most likely reflecting intracellular vesicle transport. Within the stationary pool in the shaft, we observed a few distinct CCSs. The two most frequently observed structures were larger, high-intensity structures that either remained fluorescently stable over the entire course of imaging (CV fluorescence intensity = 0.09, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: upper panel), or showed large fluctuations in fluorescence intensity (CV = 0.16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: lower panel), perhaps indicating a more dynamic structure. In rare cases, transient budding of clathrin from these structures was observed, reminiscent of endocytic pit formation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The EZ is dynamically distinct from shaft CCSs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative dendrite expressing GFP-CLCa, scale bar: 5 µm, and kymographs of CCSs in the dendritic shaft only, separated in stationary (upper panel), retrograde (middle panel) and anterograde (lower panel) particles.

Strikingly, we were able to pick up, what seemed to be the budding of individual vesicles from the EZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panel). On average, the fluctuations in intensity of clathrin structures in shaft and spines were significantly different, with much lower fluctuations found in spines (shaft CV: 0.06 ± 0.004, spine CV: 0.02 ± 0.001, p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Longer acquisitions of 20 min at 30-s intervals showed that the CCSs in spines had a considerably higher average lifetime compared to CCSs in the shaft (average lifetime spines: 10 ± 0.7 min, shaft: 6.0 ± 0.3 minutes, p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Indeed, 68.1% ± 6.0% of PSDs remained associated with at least one clathrin structure that was present for the entire 20 min, confirming that the EZ is stably coupled to the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanpied et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheefhals et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, in the dendritic shaft, only a small fraction (~15%) of CCSs was long-lived ( &gt; 17.5 min) and the median lifetime of all events was ~2.5 min, indicating that the majority of CCSs in the dendritic shaft are transient structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>The relatively long lifetime and small fluctuations in intensity of clathrin at the EZ might suggest a considerably lower turnover of clathrin at the EZ compared to shaft structures. To determine the turnover of clathrin at stable dendritic structures, we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of GFP-CLCa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). A relatively long baseline of 2 min was acquired to make sure that only stationary structures would be included in the analysis. We determined that in stable shaft structures GFP-CLCa recovered relatively fast (tau: 13.0 min) to 75.8% ± 10% in 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), indicating a high level of clathrin exchange at these structures. In contrast to the high turnover of stationary structures in the shaft, the EZ showed relatively low levels of turnover (tau: 36.2 min) and total recovery (38.2% ± 5.2% after 20 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), suggesting little exchange of clathrin at the EZ. Taken together, these live-cell imaging experiments show that CCSs in the dendritic shaft are morphologically and dynamically highly diverse, and that the EZ in dendritic spines contains a stable accumulation of clathrin that is very similar from spine to spine, thereby differentiating itself from all other CCSs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nanoscale organization of the endocytic zone in dendritic spines</title><p>To further resolve the spatial organization of the EZ, we next used single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM).

Moreover, the dimensions (length and width) of individual structures were positively correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.58). Interestingly, we often found that PSDs were associated with multiple clathrin structures, similar as to what we observed with gSTED imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). We noted that two distinct populations could be observed based on morphological characteristics and distinguished between the primary and secondary clathrin structure based on size. The largest was classified as the primary structure and we found that this structure most likely corresponds to the EZ, as these were also the most closely linked to the PSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). The secondary, smaller structures were between 50 and 100 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), similar to the reported size of endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kirchhausen and Harrison, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pearse and Crowther, 1987</xref>). These smaller structures also appeared more circular and further away from the PSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, D</xref>), further suggesting that these smaller secondary structures are endocytic vesicles that perhaps budded off from the edge of the EZ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Endocytic proteins are differentially retained at perisynaptic sites</title><p>Apart from clathrin, only a few other endocytic components have been suggested to be part of the EZ. Among these proteins are synaptotagmin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Awasthi et al., 2019</xref>), PICK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fiuza et al., 2017</xref>) and CPG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cottrell et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the presence of dynamin2 and AP2 at the site of clathrin-coated pits in spines suggest that these proteins could also be part of the EZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rácz et al., 2004</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether these and other endocytic proteins are stably accumulated at the EZ, or whether these are perhaps transiently recruited only during endocytic events. To begin to address this, we first determined the localization of 12 well-known endocytic proteins using confocal microscopy and live-cell imaging. Among these proteins are the well-known F-BAR and N-BAR proteins like FCHO1, syndapin-1 (Sdp1), syndapin- 2 (Sdp2) and amphiphysin (Amph), β2-adaptin, a subunit of the membrane proteins AP2, scission protein dynamin2 (Dyn2) and other adaptor proteins like Eps15, PICALM, intersectin-1 long (Itsn1L) and epsin-2 (Epsn2). In addition, we included HIP1R and CPG2 that can couple the endocytic machinery to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen and Brodsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loebrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilbur et al., 2008</xref>). We found that most of these proteins localized at perisynaptic sites in a punctate manner, similar to clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Sdp1, Sdp2, and Amph showed a more diffuse signal within the spine and dendritic shaft. For Amph, clear puncta associated with the PSD could be detected occasionally; however, Sdp1 and Sdp2 did not seem to be enriched in distinct puncta and were not further analyzed. In this experiment, we found that 66.8% ± 6.9% of PSDs was associated with GFP-CLCa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). We found that the fraction of PSDs associated with HIP1R, β2-adaptin, Dyn2, CPG2, Eps15, and Itsn1L was similar to the percentage of clathrin-associated PSDs. In contrast, PICALM, Epsn2, Amph, and FCHO1 were less frequently found in association with the PSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Thus, HIP1R, β2-adaptin, Dyn2, CPG2, Eps15, and Itsn1L appear associated with the PSD and could be intrinsic components of the EZ. To validate that the localization of these proteins was not disrupted as a result of overexpression, we endogenously tagged Eps15, Itsn1 and Dyn2 using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willems et al., 2020</xref>). We attempted to generate knockin constructs for multiple AP2 subunits but were unfortunately not able to reliably tag these subunits. Importantly, for endogenously tagged Eps15, Itns1 and Dyn2 we found a similar distribution and perisynaptic localization as we found in the exogenous expression experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Neurons were imaged for 10 min at 20-s time intervals. We found very distinct behaviors in the dynamics of endocytic proteins. While some proteins only transiently occurred at perisynaptic sites (e.g. FCHO1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), other proteins appeared stable over the entire duration of the acquisition (e.g. CPG2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with our previous observations in fixed neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), the percentage of PSDs associated with a clear endocytic protein structure for the entire duration of the acquisition was high for HIP1R, β2-adaptin, Dyn2, CPG2, Eps15, and Itsn1L, and much lower for PICALM, FCHO1, Epsn2, and Amph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). From these live-cell acquisitions, we determined the lifetime of events where these proteins were enriched at perisynaptic sites. Interestingly, when plotted as histograms, a clear bimodal distribution of lifetimes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Endocytic proteins accumulated either briefly ( &lt; 3 min) or appeared persistent ( &gt; 9 min) at perisynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These data also indicated that HIP1R, β2-adaptin, Dyn2, CPG2, Eps15, and Itsn1L are stable components that are generally long-lived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, the average lifetimes of FCHO1 (2.74 ± 1.7 min), PICALM (1.73 ± 0.20 min), Epsn2 (3.00 ± 0.20 min), and Amph (2.73 ± 1.7 min) at perisynaptic sites were significantly lower compared to the average lifetime of CLCa. Notably, the lifetime of these short-lived events is comparable to the duration of endocytic events (~2 min), suggesting that these proteins are transiently recruited upon the induction of endocytosis. To determine the turnover of the long-lived endocytic proteins at perisynaptic sites, we performed FRAP experiments. Except for CPG2, all endocytic proteins showed considerably higher turnover than clathrin (percentage of recovery after 10 min CPG2: 29.4% ± 3.7%, HIP1R: 59.2% ± 5.2%, β2-adaptin: 56.7% ± 3.8%, Eps15: 88.1 ± 3.8, Itsn1L: 93.9 ± 8.7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these experiments reveal that apart from clathrin, HIP1R, β2-adaptin, Dyn2, CPG2, Eps15, and Itsn1L are also integral components of the perisynaptic EZ, while PICALM, FCHO1, Epsn2, and Amph only appear transiently at perisynaptic sites, perhaps to initiate or facilitate endocytosis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Endocytic proteins are differentially associated with the PSD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example image of FCHO1 (green) that is transiently associated with Homer1c (magenta).

First, we applied two-color gSTED on Halo-CLCa co-transfected with the stably retained endocytic proteins fused to GFP and stained for endogenous Homer1b/c to localize the PSD. We indeed found that Eps15, Itsn1L, Dyn2, β2-adaptin, and HIP1R all colocalize with clathrin next to the PSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, to dissect the spatial organization of endocytic proteins relative to the clathrin structure at the EZ we used two-color SMLM. Halo-CLCa was co-transfected with a GFP-tagged endocytic protein to efficiently label and acquire high-density localization maps in two channels. Strikingly, we found that β2-adaptin, Eps15, and Itsn1L were often distributed in smaller patches around and sometimes within the EZ marked by CLCa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). HIP1R showed a more homogenous distribution and often colocalized with the EZ entirely and even surrounding the EZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Dyn2 showed an overall more homogenous distribution, similar to HIP1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, we also found examples where Dyn2 localized in small clusters at the edge of the EZ. To analyze these distributions quantitatively, we manually selected regions around clathrin structures in dendritic spines for further analysis. We then used DBScan to determine the outline of the EZ marked by CLCa. We first mapped the absolute distance of localizations to the border of the EZ averaged over a population of EZs and found that all the endocytic proteins analyzed here peaked within 25 nm from the edge of the clathrin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, since individual EZs can vary in size, we next mapped the density of endocytic proteins in rings that were set in size relative to the clathrin structure. For each EZ, we defined eight incremental rings that were scaled with proportion to the outline of the EZ and binned the density of localizations within each of these rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). As expected, when plotting the relative fraction of Halo-CLCa localization within the rings, we found that the density of clathrin molecules was highest in the center (0–20% ring), gradually decreased towards the outer ring (80–100%) and dropped to close to zero in the rings surrounding the EZ (100–160% rings). In contrast, when we plotted the relative density of Homer1c localizations relative to CLCa, we found a clear separation of these distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), further validating the analysis. When analyzing the endocytic adaptor proteins relative to the EZ, we again found that the relative density of Eps15, β2-adaptin, and Itsn1L peaked within the EZ, but close to the edge of the EZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). The profiles of HIP1R and Dyn2 localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) showed less clear peaks, indicating a more homogenous distribution of these proteins within the EZ.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Endocytic proteins have distinct spatial organization relative to the clathrin structure marking the EZ.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) High-resolution example images of Halo-CLCa labelled with JF647 (orange) co-expressed with endocytic proteins fused to GFP labelled with CF568 (cyan).

The mechanisms that retain the EZ at this particular position, however, are not fully understood. The EZ is coupled to the PSD via Shank-Homer-Dyn3 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petrini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheefhals et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, we now identified several new EZ components that can couple to the plasma membrane, for example via AP2, or the actin cytoskeleton, for example via CPG2 and HIP1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loebrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saffarian et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that these modes of interaction could also contribute to the positioning of the EZ. To test this, we interfered with several of these connections. First, we tested whether Shank knockdown (KD), which we showed previously uncouples the EZ from the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheefhals et al., 2019</xref>), also leads to the loss of these newly identified EZ components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Indeed, we found that Shank-KD did not only reduce the number of clathrin-positive PSDs as found before (0.5 ± 0.1 relative to control), but also reduced the association of the PSD with other endocytic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We found that Shank-KD significantly reduced Homer1c-Eps15 (0.63 ± 0.1), Homer1c-Itsn1L (0.6 ± 0.1) and Homer1c-β2-adaptin (0.55 ± 0.1) coupling compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, HIP1R (0.89 ± 0.04), Dyn2 (0.91 ± 0.1), and CPG2 (0.86 ± 0.1) were not uncoupled from the PSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Together, these findings show that PSD-EZ coupling via Shank proteins is necessary for the integrity of the EZ. Next, to test if other mechanisms contribute to EZ maintenance we tested whether alterations in actin dynamics, membrane binding capacity or depleting specific EZ components would lead to a reduction of EZs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that disrupting the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton did not result in a clear reduction of the PSD-EZ association. The actin depolymerization drug Latrunculin B slightly decreased the PSD-EZ association (0.81 ± 0.1), but this was not statistically significant. The Arp2/3 inhibitor CK-666 (0.98 ± 0.1) also did not significantly alter PSD-EZ association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>), suggesting that disrupting actin dynamics does not disrupt positioning of the EZ. Jasplakinolide, an F-actin stabilizing drug, resulted in significantly more PSD-EZ association compared to control (1.27 ± 0.04, p &lt; 0.05). To test specific EZ-actin interactions, we assessed whether the binding of clathrin to HIP1R is necessary for EZ maintenance. Overexpression of a clathrin-light chain mutant that is unable to bind HIP1R (GFP-CLCb-EED/QQN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen and Brodsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poupon et al., 2008</xref>), did not affect the localization of the EZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>), further indicating that coupling to the actin cytoskeleton is not a primary mechanism for maintaining the EZ. In addition, we considered CPG2 as a candidate protein as it has been shown to couple the actin cytoskeleton to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loebrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loebrich et al., 2013</xref>) and we found it is an exceptionally stable EZ protein. However, knockdown of endogenous CPG2 using established shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cottrell et al., 2004</xref>) did not affect PSD-EZ coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The third mechanism that could allow the perisynaptic localization of the EZ involves interactions with the plasma membrane. To address this, we overexpressed a mutant form of the AP2 mu2 subunit that is unable to interact with PIP2 (AP2m2-P1) and was shown to hamper receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raman et al., 2014</xref>), but we found no change in the fraction of EZ-positive PSDs (1.1 ± 0.1), suggesting that coupling to the membrane via AP2-PIP2 interactions does not affect EZ maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). Lastly, we checked if removing specific, stable endocytic components would affect EZ positioning. Itsn1L is multi-domain scaffold protein that interacts with several endocytic proteins to orchestrate endocytosis and could thus have a central role as scaffold in the EZ. However, Itsn1L knockdown did not alter the fraction of EZ-positive PSDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). Altogether, based on these mechanistic experiments, we conclude that the EZ is assembled from a distinct set of endocytic proteins and is maintained and positioned primarily by interactions with the PSD.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Interactions with the PSD, but not with the membrane or actin cytoskeleton are required for positioning of the EZ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example images of dendrites expressing Homer1c-ALFA and endocytic proteins fused to GFP co-expressed with control or mirShank-mCherry construct.

To test this, we first compared two distinct paradigms to induce LTD: one triggered by NMDAR activation (NMDAR-LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 1998</xref>) and one induced by activation of group I mGluRs (mGluR-LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huber et al., 2001</xref>). We found that induction of mGluR-LTD by a 5 minute-application of DHPG, significantly increased the number of PSDs associated with multiple CCSs (control: 0.95 ± 0.1, 5’ DHPG: 2.1 ± 0.4). Strikingly, the effect of DHPG was transient and the number of PSDs associated with multiple CCSs returned to control levels after 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). This effect was blocked by the selective mGluR5 antagonist MPEP, indicating that this effect was mediated by mGluR5 activation. Intriguingly, application of NMDA had only a small, non-significant effect (control: 1.03 ± 0.08, 5’ NMDA: 1.47 ± 0.19), indicating that these protocols differentially affect the perisynaptic CCSs. Next, to see if synapse-potentiating paradigms induce EZ reorganization, we induced chemical LTP (cLTP) using glycine and bicuculin for 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We found that cLTP resulted in an increase in the number of PSDs containing multiple CCSs 30 min after induction (control: 17.6% ± 2.8%, 30‘ cLTP: 29.1% ± 2.7%, p &lt; 0.01). Remarkably, in contrast to cLTD this effect was long-lasting, up to 2 hr after cLTP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). The effect was blocked in the presence of AP5, an NMDAR antagonist, indicating that the observed effect is NMDAR-mediated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Next, we performed live-cell gSTED to observe CCSs over time within individual synapses after cLTP. Indeed, also in these live-cell experiments we observed that the EZ is structurally altered after cLTP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). In some cases, multiple CCSs could be observed already 5 min after cLTP induction, however these structures rapidly disappeared, perhaps indicating transient clathrin coat formation. Other examples clearly showed reorganization of the EZ after 5 min cLTP that resulted in multiple CCSs after 30 min. Interestingly, we noted that the appearance of new CCSs was preferentially observed at PSDs that increased in size in response to the cLTP protocol, while PSDs that were not associated with multiple CCS after 30 min remained the same size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). These results thus suggest that long-term reorganization of the EZ preferentially occurs at PSDs that undergo activity-dependent remodeling. We found that CLCa area was not different between control and cLTP (control: 0.06 ± 0.007, cLTP: 0.05 ± 0.009) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Similarly, live-cell confocal imaging showed that CLCa intensity was not affected after cLTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>), indicating that there is no recruitment of clathrin to spines, but suggests that the EZ undergoes remodeling, or perhaps splits in response to synaptic activity. These data show that synaptic activity patterns that induce long-term alterations in synaptic strength are accompanied by structural reorganization of the perisynaptic endocytic machinery at excitatory synapses.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Plasticity-induced reorganization of the EZ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example gSTED images of Homer1c-ALFA labeled with Cy3, and CLCa-GFP labeled with At647N under basal conditions (upper panel, control), after 5 min of DHPG (100 µM, middle panel) and after 5 min of NMDA (20 µM, lower panel).

However, the molecular composition and organization of the EZ has remained largely elusive. Here, we present evidence that the EZ is a highly unique clathrin structure that contains a defined arsenal of endocytic proteins, is differentially retained at the EZ and highly organized at the nanoscale level with respect to the clathrin assembly. Moreover, we show that the EZ is reorganized in response to synaptic activity.</p><p>While CCSs in the dendritic shaft form a highly heterogenous population, including small, fast-moving particles, as well as larger stationary structures, the EZ is remarkably stable with little variation from spine to spine. This heterogeneity in the dendritic shaft likely resembles CCSs found in other cell types, where small clathrin structures represent transient endocytic pits or intracellular vesicles while the large patches are stable, membrane-attached structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leyton-Puig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saffarian et al., 2009</xref>). Our findings on the EZ are in line with previous studies, showing little exchange of clathrin at the EZ, and highly similar morphology and dynamics from spine to spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanpied et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petrini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosendale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheefhals et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these results indicate that based on the morphological and dynamic behavior of clathrin, the EZ can be distinguished from other clathrin assemblies found in the dendritic shaft.</p><p>Importantly, our findings significantly expand on the notion that the EZ is a perisynaptic site of endocytosis by identifying several key endocytic proteins that reside at the EZ. Based on our live-cell imaging, quantitative super-resolution imaging and mechanistic studies, we conclude that the early-phase endocytic proteins β2-adaptin, Eps15, and Itsn1L are stable EZ residents that localize preferentially at the edge of the EZ, which is surprisingly similar to findings on flat clathrin lattices in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sochacki et al., 2017</xref>). The accumulation of the AP-2 complex and its binding partner Eps15 at the periphery of the EZ, likely contributes to the efficient capture of cargoes, that is synaptic membrane proteins, and their local uptake via endocytosis. In addition, we recently reported that Itsn1, a multi-domain scaffold protein that coordinates different aspects of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pechstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evergren et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hussain et al., 2001</xref>), also facilitates mGluR-mediated AMPAR trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Gelder et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, removing Shank proteins, which was previously shown to uncouple the EZ from the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheefhals et al., 2019</xref>), specifically uncoupled the early-phase proteins, indicating that these proteins are indeed stable residents and coupled to the EZ.</p><p>The later-phase proteins HIP1R, Dyn2, and CPG2 were also stably associated with the EZ, but this association seemed independent of PSD-EZ coupling via Shank. Interestingly, both Dyn2 and HIP1R were more widely distributed. For Dyn2 we found that in most cases, the distribution of Dyn2 at the EZ was diffuse, but the clear differential localization patterns between different EZs may indicate that Dyn2 relocates to the EZ upon endocytosis as has been suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosendale et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately for CPG2, we were not able to obtain high-density localization maps and were unable to draw any conclusions about the nanoscale organization of CPG2 at the EZ. Taken together, it is likely that the later-phase proteins are not directly coupled to the EZ under basal conditions but rather preferentially reside in close proximity via other interactions. Finally, we found that PICALM, FCHO1, Epsn2, and Amph were associated with the EZ to a much lesser extent and appeared only transiently at perisynaptic sites. Interestingly, Amph, Epsn2, and FCHO1 are BAR proteins, and preferentially bind curved membranes. Thus, perhaps these proteins are only transiently recruited to the EZ upon induction of endocytosis and the associated increase in membrane curvature.</p><p>We found that expression of a dominant-negative form of AP2-mu2 that interferes with the clathrin-PIP2 binding did not abrogate EZ positioning, suggesting that AP2 is not involved in EZ coupling to the membrane or membrane anchoring is not a prerequisite for EZ positioning. Similarly, we found that abrogating EZ-actin cytoskeletal interactions, did not disrupt the localization of the EZ at perisynaptic sites. Both HIP1R and CPG2 are actin-binding proteins that couple essential components of the endocytic machinery to the actin cytoskeleton, and were previously shown to facilitate endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen and Brodsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cottrell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engqvist-Goldstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Loebrich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loebrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nedivi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilbur et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, HIP1R has been shown to be involved in maintaining stable clathrin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saffarian et al., 2009</xref>). However, removing CPG2 or interfering with the HIP1R-Clathrin interaction did not disrupt the localization of the EZ, suggesting that although CPG2 and HIP1R are stable EZ residents they are not involved in maintaining the EZ. Moreover, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with did not abrogate PSD-EZ association. Thus, the actin cytoskeleton does not seem to have a prime structural role in maintaining or positioning the EZ.</p><p>We found that mGluR-LTD transiently increased the number of CCSs per PSD, while NMDAR-mediated LTD did not. Interestingly, while both NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD lead to a reduction of surface AMPARs, activation of NMDARs and mGluRs trigger different signaling pathways and internalize distinct pools of AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Casimiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oliet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Waung et al., 2008</xref>). It would thus be of interest to further delineate how these receptors differentially act on EZ structure and function. Strikingly, we found that cLTP, which is typically associated with increased exocytosis of AMPARs, induced long-lasting reorganization of clathrin at the EZ. Nevertheless, a recent computational study suggested that also LTP is associated with increased endocytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sumi and Harada, 2020</xref>). Similarly, an EM study showed that cLTP was associated with the appearance of multiple clathrin-coated pits per PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Puchkov et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that LTP-induced internalization of SK channels contributes to synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, perhaps the reorganization of perisynaptic CCSs facilitates changes in endocytic rate and modulates LTP induction and maintenance. On longer time scales, the reorganization of spine CCSs might endow potentiated spines with the ability to more readily recycle synaptic receptors and thus respond more efficiently to changes in synaptic activity.</p><p>Taken all together, we found that the EZ is a highly organized clathrin structure where endocytic proteins are differentially retained and stabilized. This distinct organization likely facilitates the efficient capture and endocytosis of synaptic membrane proteins close to the PSD. Moreover, for the first time, we show that the EZ is reorganized in response to synaptic activity. These findings motivate further investigation into the molecular composition, the mechanisms that control the recruitment and activation of individual EZ components and the coupling of the EZ to the intracellular endosomal system. Elucidating these aspects of the EZ will contribute to a better understanding of this subcellular structure in neurons that is so critical for the maintenance and activity-dependent modulation of neuronal synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines for the welfare of experimental animals issued by the Government of the Netherlands (Wet op de Dierproeven, 1996) and European regulations (Guideline 86/609/EEC).

For the endogenous antibody labeling, the same protocol was used as described above, using anti-Eps15 (1:400, Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 8855, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10949158">AB_10949158</ext-link>), anti-Itsn1 (1:400, Abcam Cat# ab118262, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10899433">AB_10899433</ext-link>), and anti-Dyn2 (1:400, BD Biosciences Cat# 610263, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_397659">AB_397659</ext-link>), further labeled with Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>For all the following experiments DIV15-16 neurons were used. Latrunculin B (20 µM, Bioconnect), jasplakinolide (20 µM, Tocris) and CK-666 (400 µM, Sigma), were incubated in prewarmed extracellular imaging buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. cLTD was induced using either NMDA (20 µM) or DHPG (100 µM) diluted in extracellular imaging buffer. NMDA was applied for 5 min. Neurons were either fixed directly after 5 min or were allowed to recover in extracellular imaging buffer and fixed at indicated timepoints. DHPG was added for 30 min unless indicated shorter. To induce cLTP, we used extracellular imaging buffer without magnesium, supplemented with freshly prepared glycine (Sigma, 300 µM) and bicuculin (25 µM, Tocris). Neurons were stimulated for 5 min after which the supplemented buffer was removed and replace with extracellular imaging buffer with magnesium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>Confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal laser-scanning microscope using a Plan-Apochromat 63 x NA 1.40 oil objective. Images consist of a z-stack of 5–9 planes at 0.37 µm interval, and maximum intensity projections were generated in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) for analysis and display.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>STED imaging</title><p>Gated STED (gSTED) images were taken with the Leica TCS SP83x microscope using a HC PL APO 100 x/NA 1.4 oil immersion STED WHITE objective. The 488 nm pulsed white laser (80 MHz) was used to excite Alexa-488, 561 nm to excite CF568, and the 647 nm to excite JF646 and ATTO647N labeled proteins. JF646 and ATTO647N were depleted with the 775 nm pulsed depletion laser, and for depleting CF568 the 660 nm pulsed depletion laser was used. The internal Leica HyD hybrid detector was set at time gate between 0.3 and 6 ns. Images were taken with a pixel size lower than 40 nm, and Z-stacks were acquired. Maximum intensity projections were generated in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) for analysis and display.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Live-cell imaging</title><p>Live-cell imaging was performed on a spinning disk confocal system (CSU-X1-A1; Yokogawa) mounted on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon) with Plan Apo VC 100 × 1.40 NA with excitation from Cobolt Calypso (491 nm), and Jive (561 nm) lasers, and emission filters (Chroma). The microscope was equipped with a motorized XYZ stage (ASI; MS-2000), Perfect Focus System (Nikon), Evolve 512 EM-CCD camera (Photometrics), and was controlled by MetaMorph 7.7.6 software (Molecular Devices). Neurons were maintained in a closed incubation chamber (Tokai hit: INUBG2E-ZILCS) at 37 °C in extracellular imaging buffer. For high-frequency live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>) images of GFP-CLCa were taken every 5 s for 5 min. For long-term live-cell imaging of Homer1c and CLCa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), images were taken every 30 s for 20 min. Lastly, imaging Homer1c and endocytic proteins fused to either mCherry or GFP was done taking images every 20 s for 10 min. In all the above-mentioned experiments Z-stacks of five to nine planes were acquired, with varying step sizes per neuron. Homer1c-mCherry was only imaged in the first and last frame. Maximum intensity images were analyzed in Fiji, by manually drawing same-size ROIs around individual puncta associated with PSDs. To measure lifetimes of clathrin and endocytic proteins we used the TrackMate plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</title><p>FRAP experiments were performed on the spinning disk confocal system as described above, using the ILas2 system (Roche scientific). A baseline of 2 min with a 20-s interval was taken, followed by photobleaching of individual puncta with a targeted laser. The recovery of fluorescence of GFP-CLCa was imaged for 3 min with 20-s interval, followed by 12 min with 60-s interval, and 4 min with 120-s interval, resulting in a total recovery time of 19 min. For imaging the fluorescence recovery of the endocytic proteins an acquisition of 10 min was taken (2-min baseline, 3 min with 20-s interval and 7 min with 60-s interval). For acquiring FRAP images, a single Z-plane was taken. Fluorescence intensity was measured in Fiji, by manually drawing same-size ROIs around puncta. For analysis, acquisitions were corrected for drift. For each ROI, the mean intensity was measured for every time point and corrected for background and bleaching. Normalized intensities were plotted over time. Individual curves were fitted with a single-exponential function I = A(1 – exp<sup>(-Kt)</sup>) to estimate the mobile fraction (A) and time constant tau.</p><p>Single-molecule localization microscopy and analysis dSTORM data was acquired on the Nanoimager S from ONI (Oxford Nanoimaging Ltd.), equipped with a 100 x, 1.4NA oil immersion objective, an XYZ closed-loop piezo stage, and four laser lines: 405 nm, 471 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm. Fluorescence emission was detected using a sCMOS camera (ORCA Flash 4, Hamamatsu). Stacks of 10,000 images were acquired at 20 Hz in TIRF mode. Samples were imaged in PBS containing 10–50 mM MEA, 5% w/v glucose, 700 μg/ml glucose oxidase, and 40 μg/ml catalase. Data was processed in NimOS software from ONI. Before each imaging session, a bead sample calibration was performed to align the two channels, achieving a channel mapping precision smaller than 8 nm. Images were rendered in ONI software and loaded into Fiji. Here, ROIs of 1 × 1 µm were drawn around individual EZs. The ROI sets were imported in Matlab (2018b) for analysis.</p><p>First, tracking was performed on the localization data to merge localizations that were detected in more than two consecutive frames as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willems et al., 2020</xref>. Next, a localization cutoff of 15 nm was taken to further analyze the localization data. A DBScan was performed to define the borders of Homer1c and CLCa in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, using an epsilon of 0.2 and minimum number of localizations of 100. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, an epsilon of 0.35 and minimum number of localizations of 50 was used. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, rings were applied to reveal the relative distribution of endocytic proteins to the EZ. Rings were calculated as a percentage of the 100% polyshape given by the DBScan. Inwards, 5 rings were created: 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, 80–100; and outwards three rings were created: 100–120, 120–140, 140–160. Then, the number of localizations for each of the endocytic proteins were calculated per ring. The fraction of these localizations per EZ, were plotted against the fraction of the area of the ring and normalized to 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification of EZ-associated synapses</title><p>For the Shank knockdown experiments, DIV14 neurons were transfected with pSM155-mCherry or pSM155-mirShank-mCherry together with Homer1c-ALFA and indicated construct. Homer1c-ALFA was labelled with JF646-conjugated FluoTAG X4 anti-ALFA (1:500 Fluotag X4, Nanotag). In the experiments manipulating actin dynamics, Homer-mCherry and GFP-CLCa expressing neurons were incubated with Latrunculin B (20 µM, Bioconnect), CK666 (400 µM, Tocris), or Jasplakinolide (20 µM, Tocris) in E4 for 30 min at 37 °C and fixed immediately after. As a control E4 containing DMSO was used. GFP-CLCa or GFP-CLCb-EED/QQN were co-expressed with Homer1c-mCherry. pSM155-mirItsn and shCPG2 were co-expressed with Homer1c-mCherry and Halo-CLCa labeled with JF646. AP2m2-WT or AP2m2-P1 was co-expressed with Homer1c-mCherry and GFP-CLCa. To quantify the fraction of synapses with an associated EZ or puncta of endocytic protein, circular regions with a fixed diameter (0.69–0.89 µm) were centered on the Homer1c signal to outline synaptic regions. These regions were then transferred to the GFP-CLC or tagged endocytic protein channel. A synapse was classified positive if the endocytic protein cluster overlapped partially or completely with the circular region. The fraction of positive synapses was calculated per cell and averaged per condition over the total population of neurons. Data plotted is normalized to the average of the control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was tested using a Student’s t-test when comparing two groups. When comparing multiple groups statistical significance was tested using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey or Dunnett’s multiple comparison post-hoc test. All the statistical tests with a p-value below 0.05 were considered significant. In all figures, significance is indicated as follows: p &lt; 0.05 is indicated by *, p &lt; 0.01 by **, and p &lt; 0.001 by ***.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Dynamics and nanoscale organization of the postsynaptic endocytic zone at excitatory synapses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers find that the manuscript is largely descriptive and lacks mechanistic insights. However, there was a consensus that the manuscript could be improved by tagging a selected subset of endogenous most relevant proteins of the complex and examining the effects of neuronal activity or plasticity-inducing stimuli on the kinetics of the EZ proteins. Therefore, we would like to open the possibility that you address these issues and re-submit the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors characterize the molecular organization of the endocytic zone (EZ) known to associate PSD with clathrin coats using advanced imaging approaches, including high-resolution STED imaging and time-lapse live-cell imaging. They also test 12 well-known endocytic proteins to see whether and how they colocalize with EZ and find that a subset of them show strong and long-lived colocalizations, whereas others show weak and transient colocalizations, with EZ by advanced imaging and cell biological disruptions. They find Shank is a key component of the postsynaptic density that coordinates the targeting and localization of the new EZ components. This is a careful and comprehensive analysis of the molecular composition and dynamics of known and additional EZ components using high-resolution and time-lapse imaging. The results are largely convincing and conclusive and provide insights into how synaptic membrane proteins and receptors are trafficked in and out of synapses to regulated synaptic plasticity, which would have significant impacts on broad fields of molecular and cellular neuroscience.</p><p>The authors test many well-known endocytic proteins for EZ colocalization using GFP tagging, but it is unclear to me whether these taggings might affect the stability of the proteins, normal distribution of the proteins to the EZ, or any normal protein-protein interactions, perhaps misleading the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Catsburg et al. attack an interesting topic with a combination of advanced molecular and imaging approaches. The endocytic zone in neuronal spines congregates the endocytic protein clathrin near synapses, and has been demonstrated in several studies to be of functional importance for regulating synaptic transmission by influencing the endocytosis and recycling of glutamate receptors. Basic characterization of this &quot;zone&quot; has been provided by these authors and others, but a more complete description of its character or components has been essentially missing in the field.</p><p>The work first provides new descriptive characterization of clathrin structures in spines vs dendrites using an excellent knock-in approach they recently developed. These results are straightforward but important validation of earlier findings here using the CRISPR approach, and also will be useful baseline information with which to examine changes in the zone for instance during various forms of neuronal plasticity. Then, taking what seems like a tip from the work in other cells as to the organization of proteins at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, they survey the abundance and stability vs transience of a large set of relevant proteins. This is fundamental information necessary to discern the nature and role of the zone.</p><p>The authors then test two mechanisms that might hold the zone or its proteins in place, connections to the PSD protein Shank or to the abundant spine actin cytoskeleton. Experiments to manipulate these two connections do not demonstrate unraveling of the entire system, but instead show a fairly remarkable and specific loss of different proteins. Most notably (to this reader), after Shank knockdown, beta2 adaptin (part of the AP2 complex that was originally used to define the zone in EM) is lost, but Dyn2 (a cytosolic and dynamically recruited part of the machinery during CME) is retained. These and the related results provide new insight to the complex mechanisms that must be at work governing the assembly and dynamics of this specialized domain in spines.</p><p>Overall, the work is systematically and rigorously conducted, and the results are nicely presented with a minor few exceptions. The knock-in application will help establish this general approach as the new standard in the field. Indeed, the overexpression approach used for the protein survey by contrast with the elegant knock-ins feels slightly disappointing, indicating how important it is that the field move as quickly as possible to utilize knock-ins where possible. The overall conclusions about the components, dynamics, and mechanisms of the endocytic zone are stated carefully, and add greatly to understanding of this structure.</p><p>Major conclusions (e.g. distribution of a key protein or two, or retention of Dyn2 but not adaptin or Eps15 after Shank knockdown) could be confirmed via immunocytochemistry if the available antibodies are suitable.</p><p>CPG2 is an interesting case, since it is very stable and the authors conclude it appears to be integral to the endocytic zone. This interesting conclusion would be strengthened by including its analysis in the spatial distribution in Figure 6 and the knockdown experiments of Figure 7.</p><p>It would be good to verify that the CLC knock-in does not alter total clathrin content in the neurons, and also that it does not affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis, though the abundant literature might provide sufficient evidence if this latter point has been tested directly.</p><p>Line 214 and Figure 3c: how can the EZ centroid be within the PSD? Are these structures overlapped in Z, or is there another explanation?</p><p>The distribution of proteins documented in Figure 6G is certainly interesting, but fairly hard to interpret; the differences in the graphs are fairly pointed out in the text, but not readily apparent without close investigation and reading. The graph in 6F is not a very helpful way to compare this set of proteins, and either a different LUT or a traditional line graph overlay might be better here.</p><p>The functional impact of the current findings is left for the most part unexplored, probably because this seems extremely difficult to attack. However, if the authors had the ability to examine any of the parameters measured here (protein abundance, structural characteristics of the zone, protein mobility) in the context of common neuron plasticity paradigms, it would likely fill that gap. To my reading, this is not necessary.</p><p>The discussion is rather long, and some of the speculation there could be made more concise.</p><p>Line 115: what is the STED resolution achieved, and is it capable of resolving the differences seen in previous EM studies? Speculation about the nature of the small structures in static images surely may be limited by the resolution.</p><p>The close apposition of PSD and endocytic zone suggests that the authors might be able to examine published synaptosome proteomes to see whether their observations of protein abundance are reflected in those datasets.</p><p>Figure 7C: what are the arrows pointing to? It looks like the one labeled &quot;Shank homer Dyn3&quot; is pointing at actin.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors first reproduce with some additional details, in particular using various superresolution approaches, our knowledge of the peri-synaptic localization of clathrin labelled endocytic zones (EZ) and determine that peri-synaptic EZ are dynamically distinct from shaft clathrin-coated structures, being more stable. They then perform an extensive characterization of the localization of a set of endocytic accessory proteins and show that a large fraction localizes to the perisynapse. These include HIP1R, ꞵ2-adaptin, Dyn2, CPG2, Eps15, and Itsn1L. In contrast, a subset of other endocytic proteins (PICALM, Epsn2, Amph and FCHO1) were less enriched at EZ. With time lapse video-microscopy, they analyze the residence of these various endocytic proteins next to the PSD and find that they exhibit a range of behavior, from short lived proteins such as FCHO1 to proteins more stably associated to the PSD.</p><p>Next, using two-color single molecule localization microscopy, the authors study the colocalization of these various proteins with respect to clathrin in EZ, and find that endocytic proteins have distinct spatial organization relative to the clathrin structure marking the EZ. They find that ꞵ2-adaptin, Eps15, and Itsn1L were often distributed in smaller patches around and sometimes within the EZ. HIP1R showed a more homogenous distribution and often colocalized with the EZ. Dyn2 showed an overall more homogenous distribution, similar to HIP1R.</p><p>Finally, they touch upon the mechanism of EZ localization next to the PSD. They first recapitulate the central role of Shank by finding that Shank-KD also reduced the association of the PSD with other endocytic proteins in addition to clathrin. They then use a pharmacological approach to suggest that EZ positioning is not related to actin dynamics, and overexpressed an AP2 mutant that unable to interact with PIP2 to suggest that interaction with the membrane is not necessary for EZ positioning.</p><p>Altogether this is a carefully performed study, but the knowledge acquired remains relatively incremental to our previous understanding of EZ positioning.</p><p>The identification of proteins of the endocytic machinery localized at EZ in not surprising and lacks mechanical insight. The study of the mechanism of EZ positioning next to the PSD also lacks additional insight compared to our previous knowledge of the implication of Shank. Finally, this study does not address either the mechanism of EZ assembly nor its function, nor its regulation, which are to my sense the important questions to answer regarding EZs.</p><p>Several lines could be developed to improve the impact of this study.</p><p>The authors could have for example studied the role of the various components in EZ function through coated pit formation, or cargo internalization. They could also have analyzed the impact of neuronal activity on the recruitment of the various components.</p><p>Regarding the experimental approach, several experiments rely of overexpression of tagged components which can have unpredictable effects on their localization. The authors elegantly performed gene editing of clathrin light chain to verify its localization at endogenous levels. It would have been nice to apply the same approach for the study of the other components.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74387.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Nevertheless, to compare the distribution and live-cell dynamics of these proteins, at the start of this project we decided to use tagged exogenous proteins as this is still the most direct, robust and broadly accepted approach in the field (and our knockin approach was still being developed). As we are aware of these caveats, throughout the experiments we ensured that only neurons with modest expression levels were selected for analysis. To address this point more directly, we took advantage of the recently established CRISPR/Cas9 approach in the lab (Willems <italic>et al.,</italic> PLOS Biology 2020), and developed knockin constructs for a number of key endocytic proteins. Unfortunately, despite testing several knockin approaches to tag endogenous AP2 subunits, we could not reliably tag the endogenous AP2 complex. Nevertheless, we successfully developed knockin constructs for other key endocytic proteins and found that endogenously tagged Eps15, Itsn1 and Dyn2 were distributed similar as we observed for exogenously tagged proteins. Moreover, we optimized antibody staining protocols for these proteins and could confirm that also endogenously labeled proteins were similarly distributed, further confirming that overexpression or tagging of these proteins did not disrupt their distribution. These results are now included in the revised manuscript and described on page 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Catsburg et al. attack an interesting topic with a combination of advanced molecular and imaging approaches.

These and the related results provide new insight to the complex mechanisms that must be at work governing the assembly and dynamics of this specialized domain in spines.</p><p>Overall, the work is systematically and rigorously conducted, and the results are nicely presented with a minor few exceptions. The knock-in application will help establish this general approach as the new standard in the field. Indeed, the overexpression approach used for the protein survey by contrast with the elegant knock-ins feels slightly disappointing, indicating how important it is that the field move as quickly as possible to utilize knock-ins where possible. The overall conclusions about the components, dynamics, and mechanisms of the endocytic zone are stated carefully, and add greatly to understanding of this structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the careful analysis of our manuscript, the raised points have encouraged us to further characterize endogenous distribution of key endocytic proteins</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major conclusions (e.g. distribution of a key protein or two, or retention of Dyn2 but not adaptin or Eps15 after Shank knockdown) could be confirmed via immunocytochemistry if the available antibodies are suitable.</p></disp-quote><p>We were successful in labeling these proteins with immunohistochemistry and confirmed that the distribution is consistent with the findings we present using tagged expressed proteins and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, see also our response to reviewer 1 and 3. However, as immunohistochemistry labels all neurons in our dense cultures, the analysis of PSD-associated puncta specifically in transfected neurons (e.g., with the Shank knockdown construct) is highly compromised and could unfortunately not be performed in a reliable manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>CPG2 is an interesting case, since it is very stable and the authors conclude it appears to be integral to the endocytic zone. This interesting conclusion would be strengthened by including its analysis in the spatial distribution in Figure 6 and the knockdown experiments of Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree CPG2 is an interesting candidate protein and based on previous work from the Nedivi lab and our findings we hypothesized it could fulfil a key role as stabilizing scaffold in the EZ. We therefore tested whether shRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous CPG2 destabilizes the EZ. However, we found no difference in PSD-EZ association in CPG2knockdown neurons. These results are included in the revised manuscript and described on page 21 and Figure 7. We attempted to analyze the spatial distribution of CPG2 using SMLM as presented in Figure 6 for other endocytic proteins, but we were unfortunately unable to collect reliable datasets as the localization densities acquired for CPG2 were not sufficiently high, preventing accurate estimates of single-molecule distribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be good to verify that the CLC knock-in does not alter total clathrin content in the neurons, and also that it does not affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis, though the abundant literature might provide sufficient evidence if this latter point has been tested directly.</p></disp-quote><p>Tagging clathrin light-chain (CLC) at the N-terminus has been a standard and wellcharacterized approach in the field to tag clathrin structures in live cells as it does not affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Engqvist-Goldstein <italic>et al.,</italic> JCB 2001; Gaidarov <italic>et al.,</italic> Nat Cell Biology 1999; Wu <italic>et al.,</italic> JCB 2001), also in neurons (Blanpied <italic>et al.,</italic> Neuron 2002). We therefore designed the clathrin light-chain knock-in construct such that it is similar to the overexpression construct. Unfortunately, precise quantification of clathrin levels in knockin neurons is difficult. Determining protein levels using Western blot analysis is not feasible as only a few cells (&lt; 1% of the culture) are positive for GFP-CLC. Also, in our hands, the quality of attempts to label with commercial antibodies has been too low to reliably detect absolute protein levels in individual cells. We do observe that the levels of endogenous GFP-CLC are sufficient to readily detect in individual cells and are comparable between cells, indicating that the knockin approach does not induce undesired indel mutations, consistent with our deep-sequencing analysis of donor integration in knockin neurons (Willems <italic>et al.,</italic> PLOS Biology 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 214 and Figure 3c: how can the EZ centroid be within the PSD? Are these structures overlapped in Z, or is there another explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed 2D-STORM imaging in these experiments, so this is indeed most likely reflecting overlap in Z.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The distribution of proteins documented in Figure 6G is certainly interesting, but fairly hard to interpret; the differences in the graphs are fairly pointed out in the text, but not readily apparent without close investigation and reading. The graph in 6F is not a very helpful way to compare this set of proteins, and either a different LUT or a traditional line graph overlay might be better here.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret the presentation of the data is hard to interpret. We have compared several ways to present the different aspects of information that we could extract from these experiments. As to the reviewer’s suggestion, we replaced the heatmap for a histogram line graph (Figure 6F). We also added three example maps showing how the rings are drawn around the EZ (Figure 6G). We hope this will help convey the principle of the ring analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The functional impact of the current findings is left for the most part unexplored, probably because this seems extremely difficult to attack. However, if the authors had the ability to examine any of the parameters measured here (protein abundance, structural characteristics of the zone, protein mobility) in the context of common neuron plasticity paradigms, it would likely fill that gap. To my reading, this is not necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We undertook experiments to address how synaptic plasticity-inducing stimuli alter the structure of the EZ that we think add functional impact to our findings. Strikingly, we found that mGluR-LTD, but not NMDAR-LTD induced a rapid, but transient increase in the number of clathrin-coated structures associated with synapses. Moreover, we found that a chemical LTP protocol induced a long-lasting increase in the number of PSDs associated with multiple EZs. This latter finding, we followed up with live-cell STED imaging, providing for the first-time evidence that potentiation of synapses is accompanied with the molecular reorganization of the perisynaptic endocytic machinery. We present these data in Figure 8 and discuss these on page 24 and 25.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion is rather long, and some of the speculation there could be made more concise.</p></disp-quote><p>We shortened the discussion considerably and formulated our speculations more concisely. We think the discussion is now more to the point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 115: what is the STED resolution achieved, and is it capable of resolving the differences seen in previous EM studies? Speculation about the nature of the small structures in static images surely may be limited by the resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>The resolution we typically gain with STED is 50-100 nm, indeed far from the nanometer resolution provided by EM. We here intended to refer to similar analyses performed in the cited papers using confocal microscopy (Saffarian <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009) and other super-resolution studies (Grove <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014; Figure 2 and Leyton-Puig <italic>et al.,</italic> 2017; Figure 1c). We adapted our conclusion to include the notion that perhaps the imaging resolution is not sufficient to make the distinction between clathrin pits and lattices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The close apposition of PSD and endocytic zone suggests that the authors might be able to examine published synaptosome proteomes to see whether their observations of protein abundance are reflected in those datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting suggestion by the reviewer, indeed many endocytic proteins are identified in proteomics studies on synaptosomes (e.g., see Bieseman <italic>et al.,</italic> EMBO J 2014). In such preparations there is however a contribution of both the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments. Since there is in fact a strong accumulation of similar endocytic proteins (e.g., clathrin, dynamin, Itsn1, AP2) at presynaptic sites, quantifications of relative abundance will be difficult to interpret.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7C: what are the arrows pointing to? It looks like the one labeled &quot;Shank homer Dyn3&quot; is pointing at actin.</p></disp-quote><p>We intended to illustrate that the EZ is coupled to the PSD via Shank-Homer-Dyn3 interactions, however we agree this is not clear. We removed the arrows in this illustration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors first reproduce with some additional details, in particular using various superresolution approaches, our knowledge of the peri-synaptic localization of clathrin labelled endocytic zones (EZ) and determine that peri-synaptic EZ are dynamically distinct from shaft clathrin-coated structures, being more stable. They then perform an extensive characterization of the localization of a set of endocytic accessory proteins and show that a large fraction localizes to the perisynapse. These include HIP1R, ꞵ2-adaptin, Dyn2, CPG2, Eps15, and Itsn1L. In contrast, a subset of other endocytic proteins (PICALM, Epsn2, Amph and FCHO1) were less enriched at EZ. With time lapse video-microscopy, they analyze the residence of these various endocytic proteins next to the PSD and find that they exhibit a range of behavior, from short lived proteins such as FCHO1 to proteins more stably associated to the PSD.</p><p>Next, using two-color single molecule localization microscopy, the authors study the colocalization of these various proteins with respect to clathrin in EZ, and find that endocytic proteins have distinct spatial organization relative to the clathrin structure marking the EZ. They find that ꞵ2-adaptin, Eps15, and Itsn1L were often distributed in smaller patches around and sometimes within the EZ. HIP1R showed a more homogenous distribution and often colocalized with the EZ. Dyn2 showed an overall more homogenous distribution, similar to HIP1R.</p><p>Finally, they touch upon the mechanism of EZ localization next to the PSD. They first recapitulate the central role of Shank by finding that Shank-KD also reduced the association of the PSD with other endocytic proteins in addition to clathrin. They then use a pharmacological approach to suggest that EZ positioning is not related to actin dynamics, and overexpressed an AP2 mutant that unable to interact with PIP2 to suggest that interaction with the membrane is not necessary for EZ positioning.</p><p>Altogether this is a carefully performed study, but the knowledge acquired remains relatively incremental to our previous understanding of EZ positioning.</p><p>The identification of proteins of the endocytic machinery localized at EZ in not surprising and lacks mechanical insight. The study of the mechanism of EZ positioning next to the PSD also lacks additional insight compared to our previous knowledge of the implication of Shank. Finally, this study does not address either the mechanism of EZ assembly nor its function, nor its regulation, which are to my sense the important questions to answer regarding EZs.</p><p>Several lines could be developed to improve the impact of this study.</p><p>The authors could have for example studied the role of the various components in EZ function through coated pit formation, or cargo internalization. They could also have analyzed the impact of neuronal activity on the recruitment of the various components.</p></disp-quote><p>We are motivated to track the dynamic behavior of the EZ and components through different phases of endocytosis. However, the specific and efficient labeling of cargoes (e.g., synaptic receptors) that undergo endocytosis is not trivial. Thus, correlating recruitment of EZ components to coated pit formation or cargo internalization, or gaining detailed mechanistic insight in the contribution of individual components to this process is technically highly challenging – as acknowledged by reviewer 2. Moreover, as we and others found that many components of the EZ are stably enriched and appear ‘optically stable’, visualization of endocytosis by tracking the appearance and disappearance of markers that are frequently used in other cell types, such as clathrin or dynamin, is unfortunately not feasible at the EZ. Instead, we decided to study the impact of synaptic plasticity paradigms on the structural organization of the EZ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the experimental approach, several experiments rely of overexpression of tagged components which can have unpredictable effects on their localization. The authors elegantly performed gene editing of clathrin light chain to verify its localization at endogenous levels. It would have been nice to apply the same approach for the study of the other components.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important point, and this point has also been raised by the other reviewers. We developed knockin constructs for a number of key endocytic proteins and found that the distribution of endogenously tagged Eps15, Itsn1 and Dyn2 was not different than as we observed for exogenously tagged proteins. Moreover, we used immunostaining for Eps15, Itsn1 and Dyn2 to further confirm that also endogenously labeled proteins were similarly distributed. We therefore concluded that overexpression or tagging of these proteins did not disrupt their distribution. These results are now included in the revised manuscript and described on page 13.</p></body></sub-article></article>
