precancerous lesion. To comprehensively delineate the underlying mechanisms for the whole progression from normal skin to AK to invasive cSCC, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to acquire the transcriptomes of 138,982 cells from 13 samples of six patients including AK, squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS), cSCC, and their matched normal tissues, covering comprehensive clinical courses of cSCC. We identified diverse cell types, including important subtypes with different gene expression profiles and functions in major keratinocytes. In SCCIS, we discovered the malignant subtypes of basal cells with differential proliferative and migration potential. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis screened out multiple key driver genes including transcription factors along AK to cSCC progression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)/immunofluorescence (IF) experiments and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data verified the expression changes of these genes. The functional experiments confirmed the important roles of these genes in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in cSCC tumor. Furthermore, we comprehensively described the tumor microenvironment (TME) landscape and potential keratinocyte-TME crosstalk in cSCC providing theoretical basis for immunotherapy. Together, our findings provide a valuable resource for deciphering the progression from AK to cSCC and identifying potential targets for anticancer treatment of cSCC.</p></abstract><kwd-group

cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common skin malignancy accounting for 20% of keratinocyte carcinomas and the fatality rate is also second to melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stratigos et al., 2020</xref>). The morbidity of cSCC is steadily increasing, posing a significant threat to public health. The most important cause of cSCC is ultraviolet (UV) irradiation from sunlight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marks et al., 1988</xref>). The occurrence of UV-induced cSCC is a multi-stage process, and its progression is usually slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boukamp, 2005</xref>). Early detection, diagnosis, and treatment are very important for patients with cSCC in the progressive multi-step process. The most significant risk factor for cSCC is actinic keratosis (AK), a precancerous lesion developed from the damage effects of chronical UV irradiation, which has an extremely high incidence in the elderly. Up to 65–97% of cSCCs are reported to originate in lesions previously diagnosed as AKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Röwert-Huber et al., 2007</xref>). The two diseases have a lot in common in terms of etiology, pathogenesis, and genetic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chitsazzadeh et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is difficult to predict whether early precancerous lesions will further develop into invasive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schmitz et al., 2018</xref>). Even though significant mutations of important genes closely related to cSCC were also detected in AK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inman et al., 2018</xref>), most AK with these mutations did not transform into cSCC. Therefore, there is an urgent research need to define the critical molecular biomarkers and origin cancerous cells driving AK progress to cSCC, which will contribute to the prevention, early diagnosis, and effective treatment of cSCC.</p><p>At the same time, the occurrence, development, invasion, and metastasis of tumors are closely related to the tumor microenvironment (TME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parker et al., 2021</xref>). The TME includes immune and inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, microvessels, and biomolecules infiltrated therein around tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">da Cunha et al., 2019</xref>). During the growth process, tumor cells interact with these cells and extracellular stroma, forming a special TME, affecting the production of chemokines, growth factors, and proteolytic enzymes, and promoting tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nissinen et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, numerous studies have showed complex cellular communication network between tumor cells and TME in many types of cancer including cSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the analysis of cell-cell communication in TME of cSCC will help us to understand the potential mechanisms during the progression from AK to cSCC in depth and develop new immunotherapy strategy for cSCC.</p><p>However, due to the complex tumor heterogeneity and high mutation load of cSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sordillo et al., 2018</xref>), it is more difficult to identify the driving genes for the occurrence and development of cSCC. Although a number of cSCC-related genes have been identified, the results in different studies vary greatly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thomson et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, due to limitations of technologies, the previous results based on bulk sequencing generally include a mixture of various cells, which may cover up key characteristic changes in tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta and Kuznicki, 2020</xref>). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides a powerful tool for obtaining transcriptome characteristics at the single-cell resolution level. It can not only reveal the heterogeneity of tumor cells and the progress of tumor development, but also reveal the intercellular communication between tumor cells and their TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shao et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, single-cell sequencing technology has been applied in the studies of skin diseases, including skin aging, psoriasis, and cSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). However, characterization of the initiation and progression of cSCC, especially the key transformation from AK to cSCC, is still lacking.</p><p>In this study, we used scRNA-seq technology to analyze 138,982 cells from 13 samples of six patients including AK, squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS), cSCC, and their matched normal tissues, covering comprehensive clinical courses of cSCC and filling the current blank of single-cell profiling of these diseases. Using this unique resource, we identified key cell subpopulations that may play an important role in the development from AK to cSCC. Importantly, we identified the early malignant cell subpopulation in SCCIS and comprehensively analyzed the characteristics related to the malignant status of these cells. Based on the identification of key cell subpopulations, we screened out key candidate genes of each important step in the transformation from normal skin to cSCC. The functional experiment verified that these key genes may play important driving roles in tumorigenesis. In addition, we described the TME landscape and cell-cell crosstalk of poorly differentiated cSCC in details and identified important signaling pathways related to tumor progression. Together, our comprehensive analysis deeply revealed the whole malignant progression from normal skin to cSCC, and uncovered the heterogeneity of cSCC tumors, providing insights into understanding of cSCC initiation and progression and new therapeutic treatment development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell transcriptome profiling identified different subgroups of keratinocytes in human skin</title><p>We generated scRNA-seq profiles of 13 samples from six patients presenting for surgical resection using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform.

Combining references with CellMarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>), Panglao DB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Franzén et al., 2019</xref>), Mouse Cell Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Han et al., 2018</xref>), and ImmGen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heng and Painter, 2008</xref>) databases, we annotated each cell population based on their specific markers, including basal cells (COL17A1, KRT5, KRT14), spinous cells (KRT1, KRT10), granular cells (FLG, LOR), proliferating keratinocytes (Pro KCs) (MKI67, TOP2A), follicular cells (KRT6B, KRT17, SFRP1), Langerhans cells (LC) (CD207, CD1A), T cells (CD3D, PTPRC), melanocytes (PMEL, TYRP1), and fibroblasts (DCN, COL1A1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we identified different subtypes of basal, spinous, and follicular cells. UMAP analysis classified the keratinocytes into undifferentiated epidermal cells encompassing two subgroups of basal cells (Basal1 and Basal2) and Pro KCs, differentiated keratinocytes encompassing two spinous subpopulations (Spinous1 and Spinous2), and terminally differentiated cells (Granular) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Compared to Basal1, the expression levels of stemness markers of epidermal stem cells in normal skin (COL17A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsumura et al., 2016</xref>], TP63 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pellegrini et al., 2001</xref>], ITGB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones and Watt, 1993</xref>], ITGA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kurata et al., 2004</xref>] ) were decreased while inflammatory response genes (KRT16, S100A8, S100A9) were increased in Basal2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Functional gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of highly expressed genes of Basal1 and Basal2 subpopulations suggested that Basal1 were closely related to hemidesmosomes formation, while Basal2 were related to cell differentiation, migration, and inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, we inferred that Basal1 were most likely the quiescent basal cells adhering to the basement membrane, which may represent epidermal stem cells. And Basal2 were cells that have finished proliferation to form the spinous layer for directional differentiation. In two subgroups of spinous cells, Spinous1 were associated with epidermal development, differentiation, and keratinization, while Spinous2 were associated with oxidative phosphorylation, neutrophil degranulation, and immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Compared with Spinous1, Spinous2 highly expressed small proline rich region proteins (SPRRs) encoding genes, such as SPRR1B, SPRR2D, and SPRR2E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), which are involved in the formation of keratinocyte envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carregaro et al., 2013</xref>). Meanwhile, Spinous2 also highly expressed the cysteine protease inhibitor M/E (CST6), suggesting that Spinous2 subgroup was a well-differentiated upper spinous layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zeeuwen et al., 2001</xref>). Follicular cells were also divided into two groups (Follicular1 and Follicular2). The functional enrichment of Follicular1 suggested that they were related to skin development and differentiation, while Follicular2 showed high levels of genes related to WNT signaling pathway (SFRP1, FRZB, and DKK3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). WNT signaling pathway plays a decisive role in regulating the functions of hair follicle stem cells, and inhibition of WNT signaling pathway can maintain the proliferation and inhibit the differentiation of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the Follicular2 may represent outer bulge cells, which have been shown to secrete WNT inhibitors, influencing differentiation of the inner bulge.</p><p>In sum, we identified different subgroups in major types of keratinocytes including basal, spinous, and follicular cells. The identification of these subgroups is important to understand the function and mechanisms of keratinocytes in human skin in depth and investigate the origin of cancer cells in the progression from normal skin to cSCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of potential key driver genes from normal skin to AK</title><p>To identify the potential drivers for AK, we first performed integration on all AK samples and patient- and site-matched normal samples.

It may be related to local epidermal atrophy in AK samples.</p><p>To further explore the mechanism of AK at the cell subpopulation level, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in major cell types of keratinocytes, especially cells with proliferation ability such as basal cells and Pro KCs between AK and normal. 549, 305, and 434 significantly up-regulated DEGs were identified in Basal1, Basal2, and Pro KCs subpopulations, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b-d</xref>, Wilcoxon test, p_val_adj &lt;0.05). GO enrichment analysis showed that it was mainly enriched in the terms associated with epidermal development, oxidative stress response, RNA metabolism, cell cycle, cytoskeleton, response to growth factors, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). An analysis between AK-related up-regulated DEGs and genes from the DisGeNET database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Piñero et al., 2017</xref>) which collected genes and variants associated to human diseases revealed the high correlation of these genes and skin diseases such as dermatologic disorders, dermatitis, atopic, ichthyoses, acanthosis, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).</p><p>To identify the key driver genes, we selected top 20 DEGs in major keratinocytes. Combined with functional enrichment analysis and information from published literature, we screened out a group of important candidate genes that may be closely related to AK occurrence and development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). Among the important candidate genes, some genes have been reported in previous studies showing close relationship with AK or related skin diseases. For example, CDKN2A is well known to take an important role in cSCC, and the latest study also found its mutation in AK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thomson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lazo de la Vega et al., 2020</xref>). The up-regulation of CDKN2A in AK and cSCC has already been confirmed in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inman et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, CDKN2A expression was slightly increased in Basal1 and Basal2 subpopulations in AK stage (avg_log2FC = 0.49 in Basal1, avg_log2FC = 0.36 in Basal2, p_val_adj &lt;0.05), suggesting that CDKN2A may play a key role in the development of AK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b and c</xref>). For those genes that have not been reported, we selected seven candidate genes and verified their protein expression levels in an independent cohort including 20 pairs of facial AK and normal skin samples by immunofluorescence (IF). The results showed that the expression of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 (ALDH3A1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was significantly up-regulated in AK tissues and specifically mainly accumulated at the typical keratinocytes of the epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Interestingly, there was no significant up-regulation of ALDH3A1 and IGFBP2 in neither SCCIS nor cSCC, and ALDH3A1 even showed down-regulation in cSCC. It indicated the unique role of ALDH3A1 and IGFBP2 in precancerous lesions of skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>).</p><p>ALDH3A1, as an important member of the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily, plays an important role in the occurrence and development of malignant tumors. DEG analysis showed that ALDH3A1 was expressed in almost all keratinocytes and highly expressed especially in Basal1 cells of AK samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). IF experiment showed ALDH3A1 protein expression levels were significantly increased in 85% (17/20) AK tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Previous study verified that ALDH3A1 has several protective roles, including direct absorption of UV irradiation, scavenging of free radicals, and generation of the antioxidant NADPH in human corneal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Estey et al., 2007</xref>). In corneal epithelial cells, ALDH3A1-induced reduction in cell growth may contribute to protection against oxidative stress by extending time for DNA and cell repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Voulgaridou et al., 2020</xref>). ALDH3A1 is sensitive to UV-induced damage and that UV irradiation leads to inactivation of ALDH3A1. UVB down-regulates ALDH3A1 expression at the transcriptional and/or post-translational level depending on the dose of UVB in human corneal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pappa et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>To explore the relationship between ALDH3A1 expression and UV irradiation, HaCat cells were subjected to UVB irradiation followed by analysis of ALDH3A1 expression. The results showed that ALDH3A1 expression decreased upon UVB irradiation in a dosage-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>) in contrast to the increased ALDH3A1 level in AK samples. The discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro results may be attributed to the shorter duration of UVB treatment in vitro. Moreover, the development of AK is a long dynamic process, during which many comprehensive alterations other than short-time UVB irradiation may up-regulate ALDH3A1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>IGFBP2 plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). The high expression of IGFBP2 is significantly correlated with the malignant progression and prognosis of melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2020</xref>) and other tumors. In epidermal cells, recent study reported the aberrant expression of IGFBP2 and its dual action during growth and senescence processes in psoriatic keratinocytes. Intracellular IGFBP2 can inhibit apoptosis by interacting with p21 and abrogation of IGFBP2 leads to the restoration of common apoptosis mechanisms in psoriatic keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mercurio et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, IGFBP2 was specially highly expressed in Basal1 and Basal2 cells of AK samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). IF experiment showed that IGFBP2 protein expression levels were significantly increased in 75% (15/20) AK tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). It is inferred that in AK development, IGFBP2 might also take an important role in keratinocytes. To investigate the effects of IGFBP2 on epidermal cells, we performed overexpression of IGFBP2 in HaCaT and A431 cells and measured the cell proliferation and cell invasion. The results showed that the overexpression of IGFBP2 promoted the proliferation of HaCaT cells and A431 cells, while also promoting the invasive ability (p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these results indicated that from normal skin to AK, a lot of genes have changed expression. Especially, the basal cells specific up-regulated molecules ALDH3A1 and IGFBP2 likely contribute to the development of AK and may be the key driver genes in the process from photoaged skin to AK.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Monotonically changed DEGs play important roles in the progression of AK to SCCIS</title><p>The individual P2 with both AK and SCCIS is a typical model to investigate the mechanisms of development from AK to SCCIS. We first integrated AK sample, SCCIS sample, and normal adjacent skin sample from P2. In order to capture enough keratinocytes in AK samples for subsequent research, we separated the epidermal tissue from the dermis. In SCCIS sample, the dermis was not separated, therefore it contained more non-keratinized cells including endothelial cells, T cells, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), fibroblasts, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The marker genes COL17A1, MKI67, and KRT1 represent basal, Pro KC, and terminally differentiated cells, respectively. The expression of these known representative genes showed the distribution of corresponding cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Notably, the proportion of basal cells in SCCIS is significantly increased compared with normal and AK samples, suggesting their specificity in SCCIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Monotonically changed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) play important roles in the progression of actinic keratosis (AK) to squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) of all cells from patient (<bold>P2</bold>) with both AK and SCCIS labeled by cell types; right, expression of basal, Pro KC, and differentiated genes in all keratinocytes from P2.

There are 21 overlapped up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>), most of them were reported to have important functions in skin disease including cSCC. For example, the growth-controlling transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 6 is an important contributor for epidermal decline and aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zou et al., 2021</xref>). The activator protein-1 (AP-1) family transcription factor subunit gene FOS-like 1 (FOSL1) is considered to be the potential driver of transformation from SCCIS to cSCC and is selectively highly expressed at the frontier of invasion in cSCC tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García-Díez et al., 2019</xref>). Another AP-1 family transcription factor subunit JunD proto-oncogene (JUND) can regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It has been proposed to protect cells from p53-dependent senescence and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Weitzman et al., 2000</xref>). These data indicated that the constant up-regulation of these key growth-controlling transcription factors may play important roles in the process of AK to SCCIS. In addition, the ubiquitin binding protein sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) is involved in cell signal transduction, oxidative stress, and autophagy. It was verified that UVA- induced SQSTM1 could act through COX-2 to promote the growth and progression of skin tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sample et al., 2017</xref>). The Ras homolog family member B (RHOB) is a key regulator of UVB response. UVB-induced RHOB overexpression is involved in the initiation of cSCC by promoting the survival of keratinocytes with DNA damage mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>). All of these findings suggested that these monotonically up-regulated genes are potential key drivers from precancerous lesion to carcinoma in situ during the development of cSCC, which may become potential targets for the prevention and treatment of cSCC.</p><p>In addition, we also investigated the monotonically down-regulated DEGs in this individual (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>). Although the number of these genes is also small, many of them showed strong associations with skin disorder or cancer, especially with cancer suppression. For instance, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 regulates apoptosis in response to DNA damage via its effect on mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ip et al., 2017</xref>). It is associated with skin atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2019</xref>). The S100A family member S100A14 can regulate cell survival and apoptosis by modulating TP53 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Levels of S100A14 have been found to be lower in cancerous tissue and associated with metastasis, suggesting a tumor suppressor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Enolase 1 has been shown to bind to the c-myc promoter and function as a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feo et al., 2000</xref>). Besides, the SPRR family member SPRR2A also showed constant down-regulation. Recent study has identified it as a noninvasive biomarker in gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Considering it is the component of cornified keratinocyte cell envelope and a well-known keratinocyte terminal differentiation marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischer et al., 1998</xref>), we have reason to speculate the constant down-regulation of SPRR2A, indicating cancerization and increased invasiveness during the development from AK to SCCIS.</p><p>Although the underlying mechanisms of these genes in carcinogenesis need further functional studies, all the above data provided abundant evidences that these monotonically up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs act synergistically and play key driving roles in the formation of SCCIS from AK.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Identification of malignant basal subpopulation in SCCIS</title><p>The increased proportion of basal cells in SCCIS hinted that they might be the crucial cell types in carcinomatous change of AK, thus we first investigated the characteristics of these cells.

We named the basal cells in SCCIS with higher CNV levels as Basal-SCCIS-tumor cells and the subgroup with lower CNV levels as Basal-SCCIS-normal cells. We next focused on the gene expression patterns in these two subpopulations and identified a total of 238 up-regulated genes in Basal-SCCIS-tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref>). GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were mainly associated with neutrophil degranulation, protein folding, keratosis, hemidesmosome assembly, cell proliferation, apoptotic signaling pathway, hemopoiesis, myeloid cell differentiation, stress response, and cell junction organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Notably, in Basal-SCCIS-tumor cells, DNA damage response-related replication genes (PCNA, MCM7) were significantly up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Especially MCM7 is required for S-phase checkpoint activation upon UV-induced damage, which indicated that the Basal-SCCIS-tumor cells were malignant cells from AK induced by UV damage. In addition, a large number of heat shock protein (HSP)-related genes (HSPA1A/B, HSP90AA1, HSPA6) were highly expressed in Basal-SCCIS-tumor cells, as well as activated keratin genes (KRT6A/B/C, KRT16, KRT17, KRT19) and S100 family genes (S100A7, S100A8, S100A9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). HSPs play a role in tumor-related biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, tumor cell stemness, angiogenesis, glycolysis, hypoxia, and inflammation. The HSP family is considered as a promising target for anticancer therapy. UV irradiation can induce keratinocyte injury and significant up-regulation of HSPs of in vitro skin model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marionnet et al., 2014</xref>), which was consistent with our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Previous studies have recognized that activated keratins are key early barrier alarmins, and the up-regulation of these genes are involved in the alteration of proliferation, cell adhesion, migration, and inflammatory characteristics of keratocytes, leading to hyperproliferation and innate immune activation of keratocytes in response to epidermal barrier disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2019b</xref>). The S100A family members were also reported to be significantly up-regulated in skin disorders or epithelial skin tumors. They participate in the immunoreactivity of keratocytes and have a potential utility as biomarkers for cancerous malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Halawi et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, Basal-SCCIS-tumor cells with high CNV level may be highly invasive. As malignant cells, they may migrate and invade the dermis, and develop into invasive cSCC by promoting the proliferation ability of cells and the degradation of ECM to destroy the basement membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Basal-SCCIS-tumor-specific genes were closely associated with progression from SCCIS to cSCC</title><p>Besides those genes were already reported closely related to cancerous malignances of SCCIS, we identified a group of candidate genes in the up-regulated genes in Basal-SCCIS-tumor subgroup that are closely related to tumor development. Combing with the single-cell transcriptomic data from invasive cSCC samples, we further screened out the candidate genes that were not only highly expressed in SCCIS samples, but also highly expressed in keratinocytes with proliferative capacity or differentiative potential (Basal1, Basal2, Pro KC, and Follicular1) in cSCC tumor samples, which play an important role in the progression of SCCIS to invasive cSCC. Comprehensively considering the fold change of expression and information from published literatures, we selected the candidate genes for further validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>). These candidate genes were validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an independent set of samples, including 15 normal skin tissues, 15 SCCIS tissues, and 60 invasive cSCC tissues (36 well-differentiated cSCC samples, 24 moderately differentiated/poorly differentiated cSCC samples), all of which were obtained from the faces of elderly patients.</p><p>Among them, MAGE family member A4 (MAGEA4) was found to be strongly positive in most SCCIS (73.33%) and invasive cSCC (76.67%). The expression of MAGEA4 in tumor group was significantly higher than that in normal group (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). However, the expression of MAGEA4 was not significantly different among SCCIS, well-differentiated cSCC group and moderately differentiated/poorly differentiated cSCC group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting MAGEA4 might be activated continuously in SCCIS and cSCC tumors of all stages. MAGEA4 was found to be highly expressed in melanoma, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Considering its potential utility as an indicator for malignancies of SCCIS tumor cells, we performed IF co-localization of COL17A1, PCNA, and MAGEA4 in SCCIS tissues to investigate stemness and proliferative state of tumor cells. We found that in MAGEA4+ tumor cells of SCCIS, the stem cell marker COL17A1 and the proliferation marker PCNA were significantly increased compared with the adjacent tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Besides, recent study has also identified it as a biomarker of tumor-specific keratinocyte (TSK), a special subgroup of basal tumor cells in cSCC, verifying its close relationship with invasive cSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ji et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, we inferred that MAGEA4 might become a new biomarker of higher malignancy in certain SCCIS individuals.</p><p>In addition, tumor-related gene integrin subunit alpha 6 (ITGA6) was also significantly overexpressed in Basal-SCCIS-tumor cells. The IHC results showed that ITGA6 only scattered expression in the basal layer of the normal skin tissue and was up-regulated in SCCIS (p&lt;0.05) and invasive cSCC (p&lt;0.001), as well as being expressed at a higher level in invasive cSCC than in SCCIS (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). However, there was no significant difference of ITGA6 expression between the well-differentiated cSCC group and moderately differentiated/poorly differentiated cSCC group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We observed moderate to strong cytoplasmic and membranous positivity of ITGA6 in tumor cells. ITGA6 expression can indicate the progenitor potential of mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nieto-Nicolau et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies have reported that high ITGA6 expression enhances invasion and tumor-initiating cell activities in metastatic breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks et al., 2016</xref>), providing evidence for the value of ITGA6 as cancer stem cell marker.</p><p>To further confirm the important role of MAGEA4 and ITGA6 in the development from SCCIS to cSCC, we performed functional experiment in human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) and cSCC cell lines (A431, SCL-I, SCL-II). We first investigated the expression levels of MAGEA4 and ITGA6 in these cell lines and observed that the expression of MAGEA4 mRNA was extremely high in A431 cells, but not detectable in SCL-I and SCL-II cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), which is consistent with the immunohistochemical results observed in our clinical samples and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Muehleisen et al., 2007</xref>. We silenced the expression of MAGEA4 gene in A431 cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>), and the results showed that the proliferation, migration, invasive ability of A431 cells was significantly reduced (p&lt;0.01), while the apoptosis rate was increased (p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The silencing of ITGA6 also significantly reduced the ability of proliferation, migration, and invasion in the three cSCC cell lines (p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B, D, F, and G</xref>), while apoptosis was significantly increased (p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>). It is suggested that MAGEA4 and ITGA6 had a potential carcinogenic role in the progression of SCCIS to cSCC by regulating cell stemness, proliferation, apoptosis, and ECM degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CNV scores positively correlated with malignant degrees of cSCC</title><p>To deeply investigate the genesis and key drivers of cSCC, we first integrated all three cSCC tumors and patient- and site-matched normal skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These three individuals represent different malignant degrees of cSCC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). The cell-type proportion analysis and the expression of cell proliferation and differentiation marker genes reflected significant difference between tumor and normal samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Basal1 cells showed higher proportion in tumor samples of each patient compared to normal skins, which indicated the loss of terminal differentiation in tumor basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, t test, p&lt;0.05). To define malignant cells, we identified large-scale CNV of keratinocytes based on averaged expression patterns across intervals of the genome. Keratinocytes in normal samples were set as reference cells. The presence of CNV in cSCC samples suggests that these cells may be tumor cells in squamous cell carcinoma samples. These tumor cells were mainly derived from Basal, Pro KCs, Follicular2 cells, and a small number of spinous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In poorly differentiated cSCC sample, the significant gains in chromosomes 7, 9 and deletion in chromosome 10 were reported in the previous study, indicating the reliability of the CNV analysis results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Purdie et al., 2009</xref>). Then, we compared the CNV landscapes among three patients. Well-differentiated individual displayed low CNV scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, poorly differentiated cSCC individual exhibited remarkably higher CNV levels in most types of keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), while moderately differentiated individual had moderate CNV levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Based on above differential gene expression and functional enrichment analysis, we identified a group of important candidate genes that may be closely related to tumor genesis and development in cSCC including CD74, CDKN2A, COL17A1, JUND, MMP1, BST2, LGALS1, IFITM3, ISG15, IFI6, FTH1, LAMA3, LAMC2, SAT1, and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>To verify the expression of those potential key genes with important functions in cSCC, we first performed IHC experiment of these genes with significant differences in independent cohort including 30 cases of facial cSCC (15 well-differentiated cSCC samples and 15 moderately differentiated/poorly differentiated cSCC samples) and 15 cases of para-cancer normal skin tissues. Among them, three out of eight genes were verified that they had significantly higher expression in cSCC group compared to normal group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1p</xref>). It was found that the protein expression levels of galectin 1 (LGALS1), interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) genes were significantly increased in cSCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). As a key promoter of angiogenesis and fibrosis, LGALS1 inhibits tumor immune response and is highly expressed in melanoma and head and neck cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chawla et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, LGALS1 showed moderate to strong cytoplasmic and nuclear immunoreactivity in most well-differentiated and poorly differentiated cSCC tumor cells, and some of them were weak staining, while para-cancer normal skin epidermal keratinocytes were almost negative. The LGALS1 expression in the tumor groups was significantly higher than that in the normal group (p&lt;0.001), but there was no statistical significance between the well-differentiated and poorly differentiated cSCC groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). IFITM3 is an interferon-stimulating response-related gene, which is related to cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, autophagy, inflammation, EMT, and many other processes. FTH1 is associated with iron metabolism, and may be involved in the protection of DNA from oxidative damage as well as in the regulation of inflammation and tumor immune microenvironment. Although IFITM3 and FTH1 showed moderate cytoplasmic/membranous immunoreactivity in basal cells in normal tissues, they were negatively expressed in other keratinocytes. In poorly differentiated cSCC, IFITM3 and FTH1 showed moderate to strong cytoplasmic, membranous immunoreactivity and a small number of nuclear staining. Medium to strong staining can also be seen at the leading edge or poorly differentiated keratinocytes of the well-differentiated cSCC, while the expression is negative/weakly positive in the differentiated keratinocytes and the central keratinized areas of tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

We also verified the mRNA expression levels of LGALS1, IFITM3, FTH1 in human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human cSCC cell lines (A431, SCL-I, SCL-II). The results showed that these genes were significantly overexpressed in at least two human cSCC cell lines compared to HaCaT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

The myofibroblasts are usually defined by ACTA2 and have ultrastructural characteristics between fibroblasts and VSMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagalad et al., 2017</xref>).

Studies have found that some tumor cells can play the role of antigen presentation by up-regulation of MHC-II expression on cell surface, inducing differentiation and invasion of Tregs cells and participating in tumor genesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaoul et al., 2018</xref>). Laminin is an important component of ECM, which is involved in basement membrane skeleton formation, cell adhesion, growth, differentiation, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cloutier et al., 2019</xref>). Laminin signaling pathways have been proven to regulate the morphology, differentiation, and movement of a variety of cells including keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yap et al., 2019</xref>).

In cSCC, the expressions of ligand-receptors corresponding to laminin signaling pathway were significantly enhanced in keratinocytes, suggesting that laminin signaling pathway has important significance for the occurrence and development of cSCC. The TNF family and its receptors play key roles in a variety of immune and inflammatory process. It plays a dual role in tumor, not only playing an immunomodulatory and tumor suppressive role, but also promoting tumor immune escape by inducing inflammatory response, promoting tumor cell survival, proliferation, and EMT, regulating Treg and bone marrow-derived suppressor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sheng et al., 2018</xref>).

We leveraged the annotated scRNA-seq dataset of tumor sample to predict scATAC-seq cell types with Seurat using label transfer. Comparison between scATAC-seq cell-type predictions and curated annotations of scRNA-seq dataset indicated that all major cell types were present in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Then, we detected accessible chromatin regions and investigated differentially accessible chromatin regions (DARs) between cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1v</xref>). The majority of DARs were located in a promoter region within 1 kb of the nearest transcriptional start site, especially in Basal1 the proportion was more than 95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Meanwhile, a lot of DARs were closely associated with DEGs in their respective cell types and we could distinguish cell groups in scATAC-seq dataset based on the state of DARs. For example, the ATAC peaks of KRT5 were increased in major keratinocytes. CD83 is one of the best markers for mature DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lechmann et al., 2002</xref>).

We observed that the cell types also could be distinguished by transcription factor activities, suggesting these cell-type-specific transcription factors could regulate chromatin accessibility. For example, as well-known driver genes in cSCC, TP63, and TP53 were detected an enrichment of their binding motifs within DAR in major keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1w</xref>) that was supported by increased chromatin accessibility and increased transcription in the scRNA-seq of them.

In this study, the gene expression profile information from 13 samples of six patients was obtained by single-cell transcriptomic sequencing, covering all stages of cSCC development including normal skin, AK, SCCIS, and invasive cSCC, and 138,982 high-quality single cells were finally obtained for analysis.</p><p>The six normal skin tissues near the lesions were all from the exposed sites of elderly individuals, showing obvious photoaging, but the histopathology did not show morphological abnormality of keratinocytes. Nine different main cell clusters were identified from normal skin tissues and further subgroup analysis found different subtypes in basal, spinous, and follicular cells. There have been reports about the subgroups of epidermal cells in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, according to the expression of marker genes, Basal1 subgroup had high expression of the main components of hemidesmosomes COL17A1 and stem cell marker genes, suggesting that Basal1 might be stationary Basal cells attached to the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghadially, 2012</xref>). Although Basal2 subgroup had high expression of basal cell-related markers, the expression of COL17A1 and stem cell-related genes was decreased, suggesting they may be the basal cells that have finished division and are about to directionally differentiate. The Pro KCs highly expressed MKI67 and also had basal cell markers. They are transient amplifying cells with strong proliferating ability, which can leave from the basal layer after limited mitosis and enter the process of terminal differentiation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eckert et al., 2013</xref>). Follicular cells can also be divided into Follicular1 and Follicular2 subgroups. Follicular2 had higher expression of WNT pathway-related suppressor genes such as SFRP1, FRZB, and DKK3 than that of Follicular1. Cheng et al. also identified these cells in human normal skin by single-cell sequencing technology and speculated that these cells were stem cell groups in the protuberant of the outer root sheath of hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The up-regulation of IGFBP2 was reported in both murine and human basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which promoted BCC development by mediating epidermal progenitor cell expansion via Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Villani et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, transcriptional level of main targets of Hh signaling pathway was analyzed to evaluate the activity of this pathway, and results showed no significant difference across cell types between normal and AK samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

This was even more significant in cSCC, especially in the Basal1 subpopulation with high expression of stem cell-related markers, while Pro KCs only slightly increased. These results suggested that cell terminal differentiation may be impaired during the development of cSCC, and that basal cells play a more important role than Pro KCs.</p><p>Although the origin of cSCC has always been controversial, it is believed that basal cells with rapid proliferation ability and differentiated keratinocytes may all be the origin cells of cSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldie et al., 2019</xref>). However, there are other studies that suggest that stem cells such as static epidermal stem cells and hair follicle stem cells are the most important origin cells of cSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). Morris et al. found that skin tumors came from stationary, 5-fluorouracil-insensitive epidermal stem cells rather than rapidly proliferating epidermal cells in mouse chemo-carcinogenic model of cSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morris et al., 1997</xref>). Adriana et al. also found that epidermal stem cells were the main origin cells of BCC, and proliferating epidermal cells mainly caused benign proliferative skin lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sánchez-Danés et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To identify the malignant keratinocytes in AK, SCCIS, and cSCC, we performed CNV analysis. Significant CNV differences were identified in cSCC samples, and the CNV differences among the samples were significant, which was proportional to the histopathological classification and risk grade, confirming the significant heterogeneity among the cSCC samples. However, we did not identify obvious CNV in AK samples, which may be related to the low proportion of malignant cells or the mild degree of malignancy in AK samples. In SCCIS samples, we also identified some cells with CNV differences, which may be the keratinocytes with early malignant transformation. Identification of malignant cells from SCCIS and invasive cSCC showed that these cells were mainly derived from stationary basal cells, some Pro KCs, Follicular2 cells, and a small number of spinous cells, again suggesting the importance of basal cells. Therefore, we focused on the characterization of these cells in SCCIS to understand the key events that promote the progression of precancerous lesions or carcinoma in situ to invasive cSCC. The characteristic marker genes of basal cells of SCCIS were compared with normal and AK basal cells. Two subpopulations of basal cells in SCCIS were identified based on CNV scores and re-clustering and Basal-SCCIS-tumor with higher CNV score were identified as malignant cell group.</p><p>Ji et al. identified TSK subgroup in European cSCCs by using scRNA-seq and revealed their spatial distribution in combination with spatial transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ji et al., 2020</xref>).

Besides, the subpopulation of TSKs in their study only accounted for 2.7–13.8% of all tumor cells. However, in our study, we found a unique subpopulation in early stage of cancer with certain invasive characteristics in SCCIS. This subpopulation highly expressed KRT15, COL17A1, MAGEA4, LAMC2, which is consistent with findings in TSK. We used SingleCellNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tan and Cahan, 2019</xref>) to compare the Basal-SCCIS-tumor/normal with the populations defined in Ji et al. The attribution plot and classification heatmap showed a strong similarity between Basal-SCCIS-tumor and Tumor_KC_Basal subcluster in Ji et al. Importantly, about 10% of Basal-SCCIS-tumor cells were classified as TSK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). In cSCC tumor samples, the basal cells also contained Tumor_KC_Basal and TSK populations in Ji et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C and D</xref>). The basal tumor cells of cSCC samples in our study highly expressed CCL2, CXCL14, FTH1, MT2A, which is consistent with the findings in Tumor_KC_Basal.</p><p>We compared the expression profiles of the same cell subpopulations during progression of AK, SCCIS, and cSCC and identified a group of important candidate genes in each disease stage. ALDH3A1, IGFBP2, DYNC1H1, NFKBIZ, and RND3 were specifically highly expressed in AK. ALDH3A1 is a newly discovered tumor stem cell marker in recent years. Overexpression of ALDH3A1 in melanoma and lung cancer not only regulates tumor cell stemness and the process of EMT, but also promotes inflammation through up-regulation of inflammatory factors such as COX2 and PGE2, and enhances the expression of PD-L1 to affect immune escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Terzuoli et al., 2019</xref>). In vitro studies have confirmed that IGFBP2 is involved in regulating the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells. IGFBP2 secreted in melanoma activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to promote tumor angiogenesis by binding to integrin αVβ3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). However, the expression of ALDH3A1 and IGFBP2 was not elevated in the three cSCC samples, suggesting that they may play different regulatory roles in different stages of AK and cSCC.</p><p>It is of concern that two basal subgroups with different levels of CNV were identified in SCCIS, and the expression of a large number of HSPs was generally increased in the Basal-SCCIS-tumor subgroup with higher level of CNV. Fernandez et al. found that HSP70 was increased in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes in cSCC tissues arising from AK and was positively correlated with dermal infiltration level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernández-Guarino et al., 2020</xref>). It may be an early potential marker of progression from AK to cSCC. The high expression of activated keratin genes and S100 family genes also indicated the high invasiveness of Basal-SCCIS-tumor subgroup, which had great potential to transform to invasive cSCC.</p><p>Among Basal-SCCIS-tumor subgroup-specific genes, MAGEA4 was confirmed to be strongly positive in most SCCIS and invasive cSCC by IHC. MAGEA4 has been proven to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells, enhance aggressivity of tumor cells, and induce cellular and humoral immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coles et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, it was also identified as one of TSK markers in Ji et al.’s paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ji et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we inferred that MAGEA4 is a new biomarker of higher malignancy in certain SCCIS individuals, although it needs further studies. In addition, ITGA6 and other tumor-related genes were also significantly overexpressed in Basal-SCCIS-tumor. They may play an important role in the progression of SCCIS to cSCC by regulating cell stemness, cell proliferation, cytoskeleton, and ECM degradation. We also identified a group of closely related significantly up-regulated genes in cSCC. The function of genes that have received little attention in the past was validated at the cellular level. Our functional experiments found that LGALS1, IFITM3, FTH1, BST2, and SAT1 genes affected the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of human cSCC.</p><p>In TME analysis of cSCC samples, we identified major subpopulations of immune, DC/Mac, and stromal cells based on their specific markers. In cell communication analysis, we found that the interactions of keratinocytes and TME cells were enhanced with the increase of malignant degree in cSCC tumor samples. In cell-cell communication analysis of poorly differentiated cSCC and patient-matched normal sample, we observed significantly enhanced cell-to-cell interactions in cSCC tumor sample. The increased interactions mainly enriched in basal cells with TME cells. In addition, we identified several crucial cancer-related signaling pathways in cSCC. The activation of these signaling pathways may play important regulatory function in cSCC tumor genesis and development.</p><p>In this study, we performed comprehensive analysis of scRNA-seq profiles in diverse samples to simulate the classic carcinogenic process from photoaged skin to AK, then to SCCIS, and finally to invasive cSCC. Especially, we deeply analyzed the AK as precancerous lesions and the SCCIS at the single-cell level and identified the key malignant cell subpopulation, which is significantly important to investigate the transformation from AK to cSCC. The results are significantly benefited to understand the occurrence and development of cSCC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>cSCC and AK patient samples</title><p>cSCCs, AKs, and patient-matched normal adjacent skin samples were collected during surgical treatment at the Dermatology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University (Yunnan, China). All AK and cSCC samples were derived from the UV-exposed areas from immunocompetent patients, and none of these patients had received any treatment before surgery. These fresh resected biopsies were divided into two parts: half of each sample was immediately dissociated into single-cell suspension for single-cell sequencing, and another half was formalin-fixed for pathological grading and immunohistochemical studies. Written informed consent for the samples obtained under protocols was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University. Diagnosis of all samples was confirmed by at least two independent pathologists. Histological grades of cSCC were performed according to Broder’s grading system and the risk classification was performed according to the 2019 European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO) guidelines. And we divided AK lesions into three categories: AK I, AK II, and AK III, based on the abnormal cells in the percentage of intraepidermal neoplasia, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Werner et al., 2015</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tissue dissociation</title><p>All fresh skin samples were gently washed in RPMI 1640 after removing crust, subcutaneous fat, and necrotic tissue with surgical scissors and cutting the tissue into small pieces of 2–4 mm in a sterile tissue-culture dish.

In order to capture enough keratinocytes in AK samples for subsequent research, we separate the epidermal tissue from the dermis and then dissociated into single-cell suspensions by combining mechanical dissociation with enzymatic degradation of the extracellular adhesion proteins using Epidermis Dissociation Kit for Human (130-103-464, MACS Miltenyi Biotec). The dissociated cell suspension was strained with a 40 μm filter (BD Falcon), and treated with Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (130-103-183, MACS Miltenyi Biotec) and dead cell removal using the Dead Cell Removal Kit (130-090-101, MACS Miltenyi Biotec) to confirm cell viability &gt;85% with trypan blue staining (Invitrogen).

Following lysis, nuclei were resuspended in chilled Diluted Nuclei Buffer (10x Genomics; PN-2000153) at approximately 5000–7000 nuclei/µL based on the starting number of cells and immediately used to generate scATAC-seq libraries. scATAC-seq libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol of Chromium Single Cell ATAC Library Kit (10x Genomics, PN-1000087). Nuclei of cSCC cells were incubated by Tn5 transposable enzymes (10x Genomics; 2000138) for 60 min at 37°C to form DNA fragments. Then, mononuclear GEMs with special 10x barcodes were generated using a microfluidic platform (10x Genomics). Next, we collected single-cell GEMs and conducted linear amplification in a C1000 Touch Thermal cycler. Emulsions were coalesced using the Recovery Agent and cleaned up using Dynabeads.

Finally, we generated a gene-barcode matrix containing the barcoded cells and gene expression counts. This output was then imported into the Seurat (4.0.5) R toolkit for quality control and downstream analysis of our scRNA-seq data. All functions were run with default parameters, unless specified otherwise. Low-quality cells (&lt;200 genes/cell, &lt;3 cells/gene, and &gt;10% mitochondrial genes) were excluded.

Differential chromatin accessibility between cell types was assessed with the Signac (1.4.0) ‘FindMarkers’ function. Genomic regions containing scATAC-seq peaks were annotated with ChIPSeeker (1.26.2) and clusterProfiler (3.18.1) using the UCSC database on hg38.

Highly variable genes were generated and used to perform principal component analysis (PCA). Significant principal components (PCs) were determined using JackStraw analysis and visualization of heatmaps focusing on PCs 1–20. PCs 1–10 were used for graph-based clustering (at res = 0.5 for samples) to identify distinct groups of cells. These groups were projected onto UMAP analysis run using previously computed PCs 1–10. We characterized the identities of cell types of these groups based on expression of known markers: basal cells (COL17A1, KRT5, KRT14), spinous cells (KRT1, KRT10), granular cells (FLG, LOR), proliferating keratinocytes (Pro KCs, MKI67, TOP2A), follicular cells (KRT6B, KRT17, SFRP1), LC (CD207, CD1A), T cells (CD3D, PTPRC), melanocytes (PMEL, TYRP1), and fibroblasts (DCN, COL1A1).

progression from actinic keratosis (AK) to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Using state-of-the-art single-cell RNA profiling of 138,982 cells from 13 samples of six patients including AK, squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS), cSCC, and their matched normal tissues, thus covering comprehensive clinical courses of cSCC, the authors provide an invaluable data resource. This study identified several previously unreported and interesting candidate genes involved in different stages of the malignant progression of skin neoplasias, which have been validated in situ, and partially in vitro. These findings substantially advance our understanding of the molecular changes leading to skin cancer.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85270.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lichtenberger</surname><given-names>Beate Maria</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05n3x4p02</institution-id><institution>Medical University of Vienna</institution></institution-wrap><country>Austria</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.12.22.521622">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.22.521622v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

A comparison to other tumor stages would be appreciated.</p><p>4) The methodology lacks a lot of detail throughout the paper. Please, clarify how data analysis was done, the rationale and selection criteria for the presented candidate genes and markers and cell subsets, which statistical tests were performed, and how significance is defined.</p><p>5) Some of the claims regarding in vitro and in situ validation of candidate genes including MAGEA4, ITGA6, IGFBP, and ALDH3A1 are not supported by the data. If these data cannot be provided, revise the text accordingly. In addition, clarify whether there is a correlation between gene expression with the clinical progression and cSCC differentiation status (AK versus SCCIS versus poorly and well-differentiated cSCC).

Is this the case for each individual pair of patient samples?</p><p>Figure 7: This analysis has been done on 1 patient sample only (poorly differentiated cSCC). The analysis highlights some interesting features, but it would have been great to see the differences or commonalities of the TME among AK and cSCC (or even different cSCC stages).</p><p>What are the DEGs that define the 3 CAF subsets?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 201. CDKN2A expression is too low to reach any meaningful conclusion.</p><p>Lines 240 – 295, all these findings are just based on one sample of SCCIS. All these need to be validated in a larger cohort.</p><p>Lines 244 – 248, rewrite, difficult to understand.</p><p>Line 298, an increased proportion of basal cells in SCCIS was only based on one sample. Could this be validated in publicly available scRNA-seq datasets?</p><p>Line 371 – line 376. MAGEA4 is full of speculations. Was MAGEA4 exclusively expressed by basal cells only? What was the rationale for investigating this gene? Is MAGEA4 expression associated with the clinical staging of the tumour? None of these were shown.</p><p>Line 399.- 401, the claim of MAGEA4 and ITGA6 regulating cell stemness, apoptosis, and ECM degradation was not supported by the data in the paragraph. Just speculation</p><p>Line 439. CDKN2A (p16) loss/deletion is one of the common genomics events in AK and cSCC. Can authors comment on why the expression of CDKN2A is up-regulated in cSCC in most of the keratinocyte cell types?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Single-cell Sequencing Highlights Heterogeneity and Malignant Progression in Actinic Keratosis and Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Tony Ng (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The analysis of the TME in Figure 7 has improved but the analysis of fibroblasts needs revision. It would be more accurate to remove the endothelial cells from the UMAP and perform second-level clustering on fibroblasts only. Moreover, the signature genes provided for the different subsets are not sufficient – e.g. RGS5 and KCNJ8 positive cells could also represent pericytes. Likewise, ACTA2 and MYH11 could mark vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC), which sometimes cluster together with fibroblasts. In general, it should be clarified why the subsets were named &quot;mesenchymal&quot;, &quot;canonical&quot; or &quot;secretoryreticular&quot; etc. Can you provide references for the subsets or describe the reason for the label, which suggest a certain function? A Heatmap with more DEGs would be useful. Maybe it is better to label them as Fib1-6 and describe similarities to previously published subsets, if available.</p><p>Furthermore, in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (former Figure S2D) the authors have not marked the border of epithelium and stroma but rather separated the tumor tissue from adjacent skin. A demarkation of the basement membrane would help to discriminate cancer cells from the stroma.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85270.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Analysis of the scRNAseq data needs improvement.

Since IGFBP2 is also increased in BCC, is Hedgehog signaling activated in IGFBP2+ cells of AK?</p></disp-quote><p>The upregulation of ALDH3A1 expression was found to be specific to AK samples with no significant upregulation observed in SCCIS and cSCC, indicating the unique role of ALDH3A1 in precancerous lesions of skin. We have added these results in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, A and B and main text.</p><p>To explore the relationship between ALDH3A1 expression and UV irradiation, HaCat cells were subjected to UVB irradiation followed by analysis of ALDH3A1 expression. The results showed that ALDH3A1 expression decreased in a dosage-dependent manner upon UVB irradiation (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C) in contrast to the increased ALDH3A1 level observed in AK samples. The discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro results may be attributed to the shorter duration of UVB treatment in vitro. Moreover, the development of AK is a long dynamic process, during which many comprehensive alterations other than short-time UVB irradiation may upregulate ALDH3A1 expression [2]. These results were presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 3C, and the discrepancy was discussed in the main text.</p><p>To investigate the effects of IGFBP2 on epidermal cells, we performed overexpression of IGFBP2 in HaCaT and A431 cells and measured the cell proliferation and cell invasion. The results showed that the IGFBP2 overexpression significantly promoted the proliferation and invasiveness of both HaCaT cells and A431 cells (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, D and E).</p><p>Transcriptional level of main target of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway were analyzed to evaluate the activity of this pathway, and results showed no significant difference across cell types between normal and AK samples (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). It suggests that IGFBP2 might mediate AK development through other signaling pathways, which requires further investigation. We have discussed these results in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: in lines 353-356 the authors write &quot;we further screened out the candidate genes that were not only highly expressed in SCCIS samples but also highly expressed in important keratinocytes in cSCC tumor samples, which play an important role in the progression of SCCIS to invasive cSCC&quot;. – Please define &quot;important keratinocytes&quot;!

We analyzed the expression levels of MAGEA4 and ITGA6 in cSCC of different stages. Results showed that the expression of MAGEA4 was not significantly different among SCCIS, WD cSCC and MD/PD cSCC, suggesting MAGEA4 might be activated continuously in SCCIS and cSCC tumors of all stages. These new results were presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Besides, MAGEA4 is identified as one of TSK markers in Ji et al.’s paper [3]. Taken together, we inferred that MAGEA4 is a new biomarker of higher malignancy in certain SCCIS individuals, although it needs further studies.</p><p>ITGA6 expression was also analyzed. Results showed that invasive cSCC had a higher level of ITGA6 compared with SCCIS, while there was no significant difference between the WD cSCC and MD/PD cSCC. These results were presented in new Figure 4—figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S3: The authors show that both MAGEA4 and ITGA6 affect proliferation, migration, invasiveness, and apoptosis rates of immortalized keratinocytes and cSCC cell lines.

We agree that xenograft assays will help clarify the in vivo relevance of genes identified in our study. We conducted the xenograft assays with A431 cells and athymic BALB/c-nu mice, but the general take rate was low, around 25-30% (5 out of 20, 3 out of 10). Moreover, the volume of tumor (1/2 the width<sup>2</sup> X the height) was quite small (~50 mm<sup>3</sup>). We subsequently performed xenograft assays with sh-MAGEA4 A431 cells (sh-MAGEA4 lentivirus infected) and control cells (mock lentivirus infected). Unfortunately, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we were unable to observe any tumor growth with the lentivirus infected A431 cells, neither mock virus or sh-MAGEA4 virus infected cells. It is plausible that the lentivirus infection significantly reduced the tumorigenicity of A431.</p><p>Although we were unable to carry out the xenograft assay successfully, the high expression of MAGEA4 in SCCIS and cSCC samples as well as the functional validation experiments in cSCC cell line indicated its important roles. Additionally, as previously mentioned, MAGEA4 is identified a marker of tumor specific keratinocytes in Ji et al.’s paper [3]. Taken together, we inferred that MAGEA4 has close relevance to cSCC progression.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The xenograft assay results.</title><p>4-6 weeks old male BALB/c-nu mice weighing 18-22g were selected for xenograft assays. A431 cells on log phase were digested and washed twice by centrifugation with serum-free culture medium. (A) In the first xenograft assay, cell suspension concentration was 2.5*10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL. Under the sterile conditions, 0.2 ml cell suspension was injected subcutaneously into the right armpit of each BALB/c-Nu mouse. After 2 weeks, 3 out of 10 mice (30%) developed subcutaneous tumors, with a volume of about 5-15 mm<sup>3</sup>. There was no significant increase of tumor volume after 30-days continued observation. (B) In the second xenograft assay, cell suspension concentration was adjusted to 5*10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL. Matrigel matrix were added to improve the rate of tumor formation. After 2 weeks, 5 out of 20 mice (25%) developed subcutaneous tumors, and the tumor volume was about 10-80 mm<sup>3</sup>.

We added TME analysis for all cSCC samples and presented these results in new Figure 7. However, due to the way of sample collection, we were unable to perform TME analysis in AK samples: in order to capture enough keratinocytes in AK samples for subsequent analysis, we separate the epidermal tissue from the dermis. Because of this, there were too few TME cells in AK samples for TME analysis. We plan to do this analysis with newly collected AK samples containing complete skin tissues in the future.</p><p>Due to increase of sample numbers, the CAF of all the 3 samples were pooled and recategorized into 6 subsets in the revised manuscript. The DEGs that define these subsets are as follows: canonicalFib (COL1A1/2, FBLN1/2, PDGFRA, DCN), perivascularFib (RGS5, KCNJ8), myoFib (ACTA2, MYH11), secretoryreticularFib (WISP2, MFAP5), mesenchymalFib (ASPN, OFN) and proliferatingFib (MKI67, STMN1). The new results were updated in Figure 7A.

MAGEA4 is full of speculations. Was MAGEA4 exclusively expressed by basal cells only? What was the rationale for investigating this gene?

We analyzed the expression levels of MAGEA4 in cSCC of different stages. Results showed that the expression of MAGEA4 was not significantly different among SCCIS, WD cSCC and MD/PD cSCC, suggesting MAGEA4 be activated continuously in SCCIS and cSCC tumors of all stages. These new results were presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, C and D.</p><p>MAGEA4 was investigated not only due to its higher expression level in SCCIS and cSCC, but also because of its significant role in other cancer types. MAGEA4 has been proven to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells, enhance aggressivity of tumor cells, and induce cellular and humoral immune responses [13]. Furthermore, MAGEA4 was found to be highly expressed in melanoma, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [14]. Importantly, it was also identified as one of TSK markers in Ji et al.’s paper (Figure 2C in their paper), indicating its close relationship to invasive cSCC. Therefore, we inferred MAGEA4 might be a new biomarker of higher malignancy in certain SCCIS individuals, although it needs further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 399.- 401, the claim of MAGEA4 and ITGA6 regulating cell stemness, apoptosis, and ECM degradation was not supported by the data in the paragraph.

There is inconsistency on CDKN2A expression level in AK and cSCC in previous reports.

It would be more accurate to remove the endothelial cells from the UMAP and perform second-level clustering on fibroblasts only. Moreover, the signature genes provided for the different subsets are not sufficient – e.g. RGS5 and KCNJ8 positive cells could also represent pericytes. Likewise, ACTA2 and MYH11 could mark vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC), which sometimes cluster together with fibroblasts. In general, it should be clarified why the subsets were named &quot;mesenchymal&quot;, &quot;canonical&quot; or &quot;secretoryreticular&quot; etc. Can you provide references for the subsets or describe the reason for the label, which suggest a certain function? A Heatmap with more DEGs would be useful. Maybe it is better to label them as Fib1-6 and describe similarities to previously published subsets, if available.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions. We have removed the endothelial cells and performed second-level clustering on fibroblasts only. As shown in new Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, the subpopulations of fibroblasts were consistent with our previous results.
