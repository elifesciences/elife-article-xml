interpretation, aligning with the speaker’s intended meaning. This rapid process is subject to multidimensional probabilistic constraints, including both linguistic knowledge and non-linguistic information within specific contexts, and it is their interpretative coherence that drives successful comprehension. To study the neural substrates of this process, we extract word-by-word measures of sentential structure from BERT, a deep language model, which effectively approximates the coherent outcomes of the dynamic interplay among various types of constraints. Using representational similarity analysis, we tested BERT parse depths and relevant corpus-based measures against the spatiotemporally resolved brain activity recorded by electro-/magnetoencephalography when participants were listening to the same sentences. Our results provide a detailed picture of the neurobiological processes involved in the incremental construction of structured interpretations. These findings show when and where coherent interpretations emerge through the evaluation and integration of multifaceted constraints in the brain, which engages bilateral brain regions extending beyond the classical fronto-temporal language system. Furthermore, this study provides empirical evidence supporting the use of artificial neural networks as computational models for revealing the neural dynamics underpinning complex cognitive processes in the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>incremental speech comprehension</kwd><kwd>deep language models</kwd><kwd>sentence structure</kwd><kwd>parsing</kwd><kwd>electroencephalography</kwd><kwd>magnetoencephalography</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>MEG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>669820</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyler</surname><given-names>Lorraine K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lyu</surname><given-names>Bingjiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chanping Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lyu</surname><given-names>Bingjiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural representations of sentences generated by deep language models correlate with human listeners' behaviours and neural activity, providing a quantifiable framework to uncover the neural dynamics underpinning incremental speech comprehension.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human speech comprehension involves a complex set of processes that transform an auditory input into the speaker’s intended meaning, wherein each word is sequentially recognized and integrated with the preceding words to obtain a coherent interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marslen-Wilson and Tyler, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lyu et al., 2019</xref>). Crucially, rather than simple linear concatenation, individual words are combined according to the non-linear and often discontinuous structure embedded in an utterance as it is delivered over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Everaert et al., 2015</xref>). For example, in the sentence <italic>“The boy who chased the cat was …”</italic>, it is the structurally close word ‘<italic>boy’</italic>, rather than the linearly close word ‘<italic>cat’</italic>, that is combined with ‘<italic>was’</italic>. However, the neural dynamics underpinning the incremental construction of a structured interpretation from a spoken sentence is still unclear.</p><p>Previous neuroimaging studies on the structure of language primarily focused on syntax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Matchin and Hickok, 2020</xref>), contrasting grammatical sentences against word lists or sentences with syntactic violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Law and Pylkkänen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>), manipulating the syntactic complexity in sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pallier et al., 2011</xref>), or studying artificial grammatical rules elicited by structured, unintelligible strings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friederici et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, finding the structure in an unfolding sentence also depends on the constraints jointly placed by other linguistic properties and non-linguistic information such as the broad world knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bever, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tyler and Marslen-Wilson, 1977</xref>).</p><p>Unlike the <italic>two-stage model</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frazier, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frazier and Rayner, 1982</xref>) which posits an initial parsing stage relying solely on syntax, the <italic>constraint-based</italic> approach to sentence processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">MacDonald et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Trueswell and Tanenhaus, 1994</xref>) proposes that speech comprehension is concurrently governed by multiple types of probabilistic constraints (e.g. syntax, semantics, world knowledge), generated by individual words as they are sequentially heard. There is no delay in the utilization of these multifaceted constraints once they become available, neither is a fixed priority assigned to one type of constraint over another; rather, it is the <italic>interpretative coherence</italic> of all available constraints that forms the basis for successful language comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altmann, 1998</xref>). Although lexical constraints of individual words can be estimated from large corpora data, it has been challenging to model the dynamic interplay between various types of linguistic and non-linguistic constraints in a specific context, especially at the sentence level and beyond.</p><p>Contemporary deep language models (DLMs) have made great strides in a wide array of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, parsing, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vaswani, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devlin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ouyang et al., 2022</xref>). While current DLMs are still imperfect in terms of human-level language understanding related to reasoning and complex physical or social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bisk et al., 2020</xref>), they are arguably valuable models of general linguistic capacities due to their ability to identify and leverage relevant statistical regularities of linguistic and non-linguistic world knowledge present in massive training data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Linzen and Baroni, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pavlick, 2022</xref>). Human language comprehension requires a contextualized integration of multifaceted constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tyler and Marslen-Wilson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marslen-Wilson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuperberg, 2007</xref>). In this regard, DLMs excel in flexible combination of different types of features (e.g. syntactic structure and semantic meaning) embedded in their rich internal representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Linzen and Baroni, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pavlick, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bengio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Manning et al., 2020</xref>). Their deep contextualized representations capture the distributed regularities that jointly determine the coherent interpretation of a given sentence, providing context-dependent composition and quantitative measures of the underlying sentential structure. These properties relate back to Elman’s recurrent neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elman, 1993</xref>) which automatically picks up and encodes lexical syntactic/semantic information in the hidden states.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed an overall congruence between language representations in DLMs and those observed in the human brain while processing the same spoken or written input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schrimpf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heilbron et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Toneva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caucheteux et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caucheteux and King, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caucheteux et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting the potential value of DLMs as a computational tool to investigate the neural basis of language comprehension. To move beyond comparing the similarities between entire model hidden states and brain activity, probing techniques that can extract specific contents from DLMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hewitt and Liang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tenney, 2019</xref>) make it possible to study the neural dynamics relevant to processing such specific information. The important advance here is that we can leverage the deep learning strengths of DLMs to create rigorously quantified models of the broader and multifaceted constraint environment in which a structured interpretation is constructed. Such models can be compared, dynamically, with more restricted and interpretable factors that capture the specific linguistic combinatorial constraints necessary for successful language comprehension.</p><p>Here, we take this approach further by designing sentences with contrasting linguistic structures and using a structural probe technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hewitt and Manning, 2019</xref>) to extract word-by-word contextualized representations of sentential structures from a widely used DLM, namely, BERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devlin et al., 2019</xref>). This provides the neurocomputational specificity required to elucidate the neural dynamics underlying the incremental construction of a structured interpretation from an unfolding spoken sentence. After a detailed evaluation of BERT structural measures according to the hypothesized <italic>constraint-based</italic> approach and human behavioural results, we used spatiotemporal searchlight representational similarity analysis (ssRSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>) to test these quantitative structural measures and relevant lexical properties against source-localized EMEG data recorded while participants were listening to the same sentences. Our findings reveal how the structured interpretation of a spoken sentence is incrementally built under multifaceted probabilistic constraints in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We constructed 60 sets of sentences with varying sentential structures (see ‘Materials and methods’) and presented them to human listeners. We also input them word-by-word to BERT to extract incremental structural representations. These natural spoken sentences were constructed to balance off specifically linguistic constraints on interpretation against varying non-linguistic constraints as the sentence is incrementally interpreted, providing a realistic simulation of real-life language use. In each stimulus set, there are two target sentences differing only in the transitivity of the first verb (Verb1) encountered, that is, how likely it is that Verb1 takes a direct object see [a] and [b] below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p><italic>The dog found in the park was covered in mud</italic>.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>The dog walked in the park was covered in mud</italic>.</p></list-item></list><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Example spoken sentence stimuli and plausible structured interpretations.</title><p>The two target sentences in each set differ only in the transitivity of the first verb (Verb1). Each sentence has two possible structured interpretations before the actual main verb is presented: an active interpretation, where the subject noun (SN) performs the action, and a passive interpretation, where the SN is the recipient of the action. The interpretative preference hinges on the likelihood of the SN acting as an agent or a patient (i.e. its thematic role) in conjunction with the transitivity of Verb1. As the sentence progresses to the prepositional phrase, a combination of higher SN agenthood and greater Verb1 intransitivity (i.e. a higher active index) generally favours an active interpretation. Conversely, increased SN patienthood coupled with higher Verb1 transitivity (i.e. a higher passive index) may lead to a passive interpretation. Note that while the SN is the same for the two target sentences within the same set, it varies across different sentence sets. All images were generated using Midjourney for illustrative purposes.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89311-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the first sentence, Verb1 (i.e. ‘<italic>found’</italic>) has high transitivity (HiTrans) and strongly prefers a direct object (e.g. ball), while in the second sentence, Verb1 (i.e. ‘<italic>walked’</italic>) has relatively low transitivity (LoTrans) and is often used without a following direct object. Critically, the structural interpretation of these sentences is ambiguous at the point Verb1 is encountered, and the preferred human resolution of this ambiguity depends on the real-time integration of linguistic and non-linguistic constraints as more of the sentence is heard. In the example above, the sequence <italic>“The dog found</italic> …” could initially have either an active interpretation – where the dog has found something – or a passive interpretation – where the dog is found by someone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because ‘<italic>find’</italic> is primarily a transitive verb, the human listener is likely to be biased towards an initial active interpretation. Similarly, the sequence <italic>“The dog walked …”</italic>, where <italic>walk</italic> is primarily used as an intransitive verb (without a direct object), could also bias the listener to an active interpretation, where the dog is doing the walking, rather than the less frequent passive interpretation where someone is taking the dog for a walk (i.e. walking the dog).</p><p>This initial structural interpretation up to Verb1 does not, however, just depend on linguistic knowledge such as Verb1 transitivity. It also depends on non-linguistic information, that is, how likely the subject is (or is not) to adopt the active (agent) role to perform the specified action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowty, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marslenwilson et al., 1993</xref>), that is, ‘thematic role’ properties of the subject noun. Although it could be reflected by statistical regularities in language, thematic role preference hinges more on world knowledge, plausibility, or real-world statistics. So, regardless of Verb1 transitivity, the active interpretation should be more strongly favoured in <italic>“The <bold>king</bold> found/walked …”</italic> given the higher agenthood of the ‘<italic>king’</italic> and thus the greater implausibility of a passive interpretation involving a ‘<italic>king’</italic> relative to a ‘<italic>dog’</italic>. Hence, the word-by-word interpretation of the sentential structure – and of the real-world event structure evoked by this interpretation – is determined by the constraints jointly placed by the subject noun and Verb1, which is manifested by the interpretative coherence between non-linguistic world knowledge (i.e. thematic role preference) and linguistic knowledge (i.e. verb transitivity).</p><p>As the sentence evolves, and the prepositional phrase ‘<italic>in the park’</italic> that follows Verb1 is incrementally processed, there is further modulation of the preferred interpretation, again reflecting both Verb1 transitivity and the plausibility of the event being constructed. Specifically, the passive interpretation will become more preferred in a HiTrans sentence, given the absence of an expected direct object for the highly transitive Verb1, so Verb1 tends to be interpreted as a passive verb [i.e. the head of a reduced relative clause in <italic>“The dog <bold>(that was) found in the park</bold> …”</italic>]. Conversely, in a LoTrans sentence, the active interpretation of Verb1 is strengthened by the incoming prepositional phrase, which is in accord with the verb’s intransitive use and the event conjured up by the sequence of words heard so far (e.g. <italic>“The dog walked in the park …”</italic>). Hence, these two sentence types are likely to differ in the structural interpretation preferred by the end of the prepositional phrase. However, with the appearance of the actual main verb (e.g. ‘<italic>was covered’</italic> in the example sentences), the active interpretation of Verb1 as the main verb will be completely rejected, which resolves the potential ambiguity and confirms the passive interpretation in both HiTrans and LoTrans sentences.</p><p>In brief, understanding these complex sentences require listeners to integrate discontinuous words to solve a long-distance dependency between the subject noun and the actual main verb separated by an intervening clause. This engages the neurobiological processes of integration across different lexical constraints and multiple levels of the sentence processing system. For example, the incremental building, maintenance, and update of sentential structure over time might primarily involve activity in the fronto-temporal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friederici, 2012</xref>), while estimating the plausibility of the event interpreted from the sentence with prior knowledge of the world may elicit neural responses in the default mode network (DMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yeshurun et al., 2021</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human incremental structural interpretations</title><p>As the first step, and to quantify how the stimulus sentences exemplified a constraint-based account of incremental structural interpretation, we conducted two pre-tests where participants listened to sentence fragments, starting from sentence onset and continuing either until the end of Verb1 or to the end of the prepositional phrase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and then produced a continuation to complete the sentence (see ‘Materials and methods’). Based on the continuations provided by the listeners at these two gating points, we can infer their online structural interpretations.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Human incremental structural interpretations derived from continuation pre-tests.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example set of target sentences differing only in the transitivity of Verb1, HiTrans: high transitivity; LoTrans: low transitivity.

As expected, the probability of a main verb (MV) in the continuations after the prepositional phrase was lower in LoTrans sentences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that listeners preferred the active interpretation and tended to interpret Verb1 as the main verb by the end of the prepositional phrase in LoTrans sentences, and vice versa in HiTrans sentences. Crucially, neither of the two pre-tests resulted in a complete separation between HiTrans and LoTrans sentences; instead, they were characterized by two different but overlapping probabilistic distributions. This finding suggests that passive and active interpretations varied in plausibility in each sentence type before the actual main verb was presented, reflecting the probabilistic constraints jointly placed by the combination of the specific subject noun, Verb1, and the prepositional phrase in each sentence.</p><p>To relate these human interpretative preferences to the broader landscape of distributional language data, we developed corpus-based measures of the thematic role preference of the subject noun (i.e. how likely it is interpreted as an agent that conducts an action) and the transitivity of Verb1 in each sentence, from which we derived a passive index and an active index (see ‘Materials and methods’). These indices separately capture the interpretative coherence between these two lexical properties towards passive and active interpretations. Both high subject noun agenthood and low Verb1 transitivity coherently preferred an active interpretation as the prepositional phrase was heard (i.e. a high active index), and vice versa for the passive interpretation (i.e. a high passive index). In accord with the <italic>constraint-based</italic> hypothesis, we found that human interpretative preference for the two types of sentences was significantly correlated with the lexical constraints placed by the subject noun and Verb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Incremental structural representations extracted from BERT</title><p>Next, we extracted structural representations at various positions in the same sentences from BERT and evaluated them according to the <italic>constraint-based</italic> hypothesis and human behavioural results.

Each edge links two structurally proximate words as being the head and the dependent separately (e.g. a verb and its direct object). However, such a parse tree is context-free, that is, it only captures the syntactic relation between each pair of words and abstracts away from the specific lexical (and higher order) contents of the sentence that constrain its structural interpretation. This context-free parse depth is always the same for words at the same position in sentences with the same structured interpretation (e.g. ‘<italic>found’</italic> and ‘<italic>walked’</italic> in either of the two parse trees in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Incremental interpretation of sentential structure by BERT.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Context-free dependency parse trees of two plausible structural interpretations.

Then we calculated the Spearman distance (i.e. 1-Spearman’s rho) between the original and the shuffled BERT parse depth vectors.

Note that BERT is a multi-layer DLM (24 layers in the version used in this study) which may distribute different aspects of its computational solutions over multiple layers. Accordingly, we trained a structural probing model for each layer and selected the one with the most accurate structural representations while also including its neighbouring layers to cover relevant upstream and downstream information. Following this strategy, we used the BERT structural measures obtained from layers 12–16 with the best performance achieved in layer 14 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>We input each sentence word-by-word to the trained BERT structural probing models, focusing on the incremental structural representation being built as it progressed from Verb1 to the main verb (see examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Note that we defined the first word after the prepositional phrase as the main verb since its appearance is sufficient to resolve the intended structure where Verb1 is a passive verb. We found that, for each type of sentences, the BERT parse depth of words at the same position formed a distribution ranging around the corresponding context-free parse depths in either the passive or the active interpretation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting a word-specific rather than position-specific structural representation. In addition, we quantified the contributions of words at different positions to the variances encoded in BERT parse depth vectors. Our analysis revealed that content words contributed significantly more than function words (i.e. the determiners) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Then we visualized BERT’s word-by-word structural measures, focusing on the dependency between the subject noun and Verb1 that is core to the current interpretation of the sentence – whether the subject noun is the agent or the patient of Verb1. To this end, we built a three-dimensional (3D) vector including BERT parse depths of the first three words up to Verb1 for each sentence (e.g. <italic>“The dog found …”</italic>). This 3D vector was updated incrementally with each additional word in the input, thereby capturing the dynamic interpretation of the structural dependency between the subject noun and Verb1, influenced by the context provided by subsequent words in a specific sentence. Like the probabilistic interpretation found within each type of sentences in human listeners, trajectories of individual HiTrans and LoTrans sentences are considerably distributed and intertwined (see the upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), implying that BERT structural interpretations are sensitive to the idiosyncratic contents in each sentence.</p><p>To make sense of these trajectories, we also vectorized the context-free parse depth of the first three words indicating passive and active interpretations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) separately and located them in the 3D vector space as landmarks (hollow triangle and circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), so that the plausibility of either interpretation can be estimated by a sentence’s distance from its landmark. As shown by the trajectories of the median BERT parse depth of the two sentence types (see the lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), in general, HiTrans sentences continuously moved towards the passive interpretation landmark after Verb1, with a significant change of distances detected at the main verb (see the orange bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). LoTrans sentences started by approaching the active interpretation landmark but were reorientated to the passive counterpart with the appearance of the actual main verb, with significant changes of distances detected at both Verb1 and main verb (see the purple bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results resemble the pattern of human interpretative preference observed in the continuation pre-tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), where the passive and active interpretations were separately preferred in HiTrans and LoTrans sentences by the end of the prepositional phrase in a probabilistic manner, before the passive interpretation was established with the appearance of the actual main verb.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BERT structural measures are correlated with constraints driving human interpretation</title><p>To further assess whether BERT’s preferences for structural interpretation align with the constraints considered by human listeners during speech comprehension, we correlated BERT structural measures with relevant corpus-based measures and human behavioural data (see ‘Materials and methods).</p><p>We first focused on BERT’s interpretative mismatch quantified as the distance between an unfolding sentence and each of the two landmarks in the model space, which was dynamically updated as the sentence unfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

This combination of methods gains improved neurocomputational specificity by probing the spatiotemporally resolved neural activity with detailed structural representations rather than the entire hidden states of BERT.

Specifically, we use a spatiotemporal searchlight in EMEG source space, which moves across the brain and captures the neural activity within a 10-mm-radius sphere over a 60 ms sliding time window. By correlating the model RDM with data RDMs from all spatiotemporal searchlights, we can identify whether, and if so, when and where the brain represents the information captured by the model RDM.

Then, we tested the interpretative mismatch between the incremental BERT parse depth vector and the corresponding context-free parse depth vector for the passive or the active interpretation. The degree of this mismatch is proportional to the evidence for or against the two interpretations, that is, the smaller the distance, the more positively loaded this interpretation. Besides these two measures based on the entire incremental input, we also focused on Verb1 since the potential structural ambiguity lies in whether Verb1 is interpreted as a passive verb or the main verb. Given the context-free parse depth of Verb1 that is 2 in the passive interpretation and 0 in the active interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), with each incoming later word, an increased BERT Verb1 parse depth towards 2 or a decreased value towards 0 reflects separately the preference biased to a passive or an active interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Notably, with the identification of the actual main verb, effects of the eventually resolved structure also involved regions in the left prefrontal and inferior parietal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) which belong to the multiple-demand network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duncan, 2010</xref>). The involvement of the prefrontal regions could be indicative of the varying working memory demands (e.g. the different number of open nodes in the sentence structures for active and passive interpretations before the actual main verb is recognized) for building the structure of the unfolding sentence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nelson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pallier et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Structural ambiguity resolution probed using BERT Verb1 parse depth</title><p>As mentioned above, the potential ambiguity between a passive and an active interpretation centres around whether Verb1 is considered as a passive verb or the main verb, which is resolved upon the appearance of the actual main verb. We probed how this is implemented in the brain using the dynamic BERT parse depth of Verb1. Specifically, the cognitive demands required by this resolution process can be characterized by the change between the updated BERT parse depth of Verb1 when the actual main verb is presented and its initial value when Verb1 is first encountered (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> for the dynamic change of BERT Verb1 parse depth).</p><p>We first tested the change of Verb1 parse depth in the main verb epoch. Significant fits to brain activity emerged in the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal regions upon the main verb uniqueness point, and then extended to more anterior temporal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). After the main verb offset, the declining effects of the Verb1 parse depth change in the left anterior temporal region seamlessly overlapped with the arising effects of the updated Verb1 parse depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). These results indicate that the recognition of the actual main verb immediately triggered an update of the previous interpretation of Verb1, with the resolved interpretation emerged in the left temporal lobe and was later delivered to the right posterior temporal and parietal areas. It is also worth noting that the left hippocampus was activated for both measures of Verb1 parse depth after the actual main verb is recognized, suggesting that the episodic memory of experienced events might contribute to the updating of structural interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bicknell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmann and Ekves, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Metusalem et al., 2012</xref>).

Therefore, in contrast to the passive or active index specialized for one particular structural interpretation, we constructed a non-directional index that merely quantifies the degree of interpretative coherence for one interpretation, whether passive or active (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). Thus, a higher value only indicates greater interpretative coherence between the subject noun and Verb1 regardless of which interpretation is preferred.</p><p>Effects of this non-directional measure of interpretative coherence appeared very soon after the main verb onset in both hemispheres and lasted till its offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), suggesting an immediate evaluation of the previously integrated constraints from the subject noun and Verb1 when a listener realized that the sentence had not finished yet. Moreover, these effects roughly co-occurred with the effects of subject noun patienthood (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>), indicating that a patient role for the subject noun was considered as the main verb was being recognized. Intriguingly, the most sustained regions associated with this non-directional index, including the left ATL, angular gyrus (AG), and precuneus, are also the classical areas of the DMN. This finding is consistent with recent claims that the DMN integrates external input with internal prior knowledge to make sense of an input stimulus such as speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yeshurun et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, precuneus and AG have been found to be involved in building thematic relationships and event structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Humphreys et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Following the declining effects of the non-directional index upon the recognition of the main verb, we found significant effects of the passive index in right anterior fronto-temporal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), suggesting that the intended passive interpretation was eventually established in all sentences. Previous studies have revealed that the relatively narrow sentence-specific information and the broad world knowledge are processed in the left and right hemispheres separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung-Beeman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Metusalem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Troyer et al., 2022</xref>). Relevant to this, in the main verb epoch, we found effects of the BERT parse depth vector and those of the passive index in the left and right hemispheres, respectively, arising almost at the same time as the main verb was recognized (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Therefore, a critical question is whether and how the online structural interpretation of a specific sentence is facilitated by the interpretative coherence conjured up from lexical constraints that also depend on broad world knowledge (e.g. thematic role).</p><p>To address this question, we adopted non-negative matrix factorization to decompose the whole-brain ssRSA fits of the passive index and the BERT parse depth vector found in the main verb epoch into two sets of components given their temporal synchronizations (see ‘Materials and methods’). We then conducted multivariate Granger causality analyses (GCA) to infer directed connections among them. We found only GC connections from the components of passive index to those of BERT parse depth vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Specifically, we identified information flows from the right hemisphere components of the passive index to the left hemisphere components of BERT parse depth vector, suggesting that a sentence’s structure represented in the left hemisphere might be influenced by the coarse estimate of the event plausibility concurrently determined by broad world knowledge in the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung-Beeman, 2005</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref> for more details).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Comparisons between BERT and corpus/behavioural measures in fitting neural activity</title><p>To directly assess the performance of BERT structural measures with that of traditional measures extracted from corpus or behavioural data in fitting listeners’ neural activity, we also conducted ssRSA with model RDMs of corpus-based or behavioural measures. In the Verb1 epoch, we tested Verb1 transitivity obtained from either corpus data or human continuations; however, neither of them exhibited significant model fits, which contrasted with the pronounced effects of BERT Verb1 parse depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, in the PP1 and MV epochs, the probabilities of PP and MV continuations, as determined from behavioural data, did not show any significant model fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">6</xref>). Furthermore, the effects of BERT parse depth vector in these two epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>) remained largely unchanged after controlling for the variance explained by the behavioural measures. These findings suggest that BERT structural measures, compared to corpus-based and behavioural measures, are better at fitting the neural dynamics during incremental speech comprehension.

Our study revealed the emergence and update of a structured interpretation, jointly constrained by different lexical properties related to both linguistic and non-linguistic world knowledge, in an extensive set of brain regions beyond the core fronto-temporal language network. Specifically, our results show (1) a shift from bi-hemispheric lateral frontal-temporal regions to left-lateralized regions in representing the current structured interpretation as a sentence unfolds, (2) a pattern of sequential activations in the left lateral temporal regions, updating the structured interpretation as syntactic ambiguity is resolved, and (3) the influence of lexical interpretative coherence activated in the right hemisphere over the resolved sentence structure represented in the left hemisphere.

This is crucial for quantifying the outcome of complex, interrelated constraints that arise in specific contexts, such as spoken sentences, and constructing the representational geometry to be probed in the brain. Where DLMs are concerned, recent studies have systematically compared the internal representations of DLMs to those observed in the human brain during language processing, which highlights the importance of predictive coding and contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schrimpf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heilbron et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Toneva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caucheteux et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caucheteux and King, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caucheteux et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, these studies have motivated the use of DLMs as a computational tool, or hypothesis, to study the neural substrates of language.</p><p>Here we asked a more specific question, that is, how a sequence of spoken words is incrementally structured and coherently interpreted in the brain? Our goal was to use quantitative measures of sentence structure that capture the interplay between different types of constraints that simultaneously influence this process. As a potential solution, we extracted detailed structural measures specific to the contents in each sentence from the hidden states of BERT, which was trained on massive corpora from real-life language use. Although DLMs such as BERT are not specifically designed to parse sentences, they can learn from training corpora the multi-dimensional properties related to sentence structure and dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Manning et al., 2020</xref>). In line with this, our analyses confirmed that BERT structural measures incorporate relevant lexical constraints and that they exhibit both behavioural and neural alignments with human listeners.</p><p>Taking advantage of the contextualized BERT structural measures, our ssRSA results provide neural evidence for the construction of a coherent interpretation driven by the interaction between linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge evoked by individual words as they are heard sequentially in a spoken sentence. Specifically, neural representations of an unfolding sentence’s structure initially emerged in bilateral fronto-temporal regions and became left-lateralized when more complex syntactic properties, rather than canonical linear adjacency, were considered to build a structured interpretation (e.g. beyond Verb1 in our stimulus sentences). Meanwhile, we found right-hemisphere activations associated with broad world knowledge, which is essential for understanding the intended meaning conveyed by the speaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bicknell et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to the core fronto-temporal language network, we found that the multiple-demand network and the DMN were also involved during online construction of structured interpretations, which may reflect additional cognitive demands for resolving potential structural ambiguity and evaluating the plausibility of underlying events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, our results show that, compared to corpus-based and behavioural measures, BERT structural measures are more effective in fitting listeners’ neural activity, possibly due to its advanced ability in modelling specific contexts within each sentence. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize the important role of corpus-based and behavioural measures as explanatory variables. They are crucial not only in interpreting BERT measures but also in understanding their alignment with listeners’ neural activity. This includes, for instance, the temporal sequence of activations of key lexical constraints and the emerging structure of a sentence (e.g. effects of subject noun patienthood leading those of BERT parse depth vector in the MV epoch, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>) and the spatial distribution of their model fits in the brain (e.g. contrasting model fits of passive index and BERT parse depth vector in the MV epoch across different hemispheres, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). Such an integrative approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex mental processes underpinning speech comprehension, which takes advantages of the interpretability of traditional measures and the deep contextualized representations of DLMs.</p><p>There are two points to note about the use of BERT. Firstly, unlike autoregressive DLMs trained using left-to-right attention and the next-word prediction task, BERT is trained to predict masked words in a sentence with a bidirectional attention mechanism. The additional right-to-left attention provides updated representations of preceding words every time an incoming word is added to the input (e.g. representation of ‘<italic>dog’</italic> in <italic>“The dog …”</italic> is different from that in <italic>“The dog found …”</italic>). This feature of BERT is useful for tracking the dynamic change of the representation of a specific word as its context evolves (e.g. Verb1 in this study), particularly in sentences with structural ambiguity. Although autoregressive DLMs also update hidden states as the input unfolds and could be used to study complex sentential structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jurayj et al., 2022</xref>), the updated contextual effects are reflected in the hidden states of the right-most incoming word, while those of the preceding words on the left remain unchanged (i.e. the representation of ‘<italic>dog’</italic> is the same in <italic>“The dog …”</italic> and <italic>“The dog found …”</italic>). This is different from BERT, where the updated contextual effects are reflected in the hidden states of all preceding words.</p><p>Secondly, although we input each sentence word-by-word to BERT, however, unlike human listeners or recurrent neural networks, BERT process two consecutive inputs (e.g. <italic>“The dog …”</italic> and <italic>“The dog found …”</italic>) independently, and there is no direct relationship between the hidden states of these two inputs. In fact, human listeners would not start over from the beginning of a sentence as it unfolds word-by-word, but update it continually as each word is heard and use whatever information currently available to build a coherent interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McRae and Matsuki, 2013</xref>). This difference, however, does not impede our objective of extracting contextualized structural representations at critical points within a sentence. In the case of BERT, the representation of each word is continuously updated in a bidirectional manner as a new word is added. This process accounts for the constraints imposed by all the words of the input and their interactions, forming a coherent interpretation. Nonetheless, for other hypotheses in speech comprehension, such as parallel parsing and how various grammatically correct sentence structures are maintained and compete in the brain, DLMs with recurrent memory might be more suitable. Such models can better stimulate the continuous, dynamic updating of interpretations that characterizes human sentence processing.</p><p>In summary, recent developments in DLMs have shown great potential in capturing the dynamic interplay between syntax, semantics, and broader world knowledge that is essential for successful language comprehension. The empirical evidence from this study supports the notion that DLMs, when utilized as potential models of brain computation and integrated with advanced neuroimaging techniques within a well-defined framework, can offer significant insights into human cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kriegeskorte and Douglas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doerig et al., 2023</xref>).

Thus, a listener could be initially ‘garden-pathed’ into the alternative active interpretation where the Verb1 is considered as the main verb when a following prepositional phrase fits its intransitive use. Whereas Verb1 in HiTrans sentences was selected to have a higher preference for taking a direct object than Verb1 in LoTrans sentences [subcategorization frame (SCF) probability for direct object according to VALEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Korhonen et al., 2006</xref>): HiTrans 0.71 ± 0.16, LoTrans 0.44 ± 0.19, two-tailed two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t</italic><sub>(117)</sub> = 8.45, p=9.3 × 10<sup>–14</sup>]. Therefore, Verb1 in HiTrans sentences was more likely to be recognized as the head of a reduced relative clause given the appearance of a prepositional phrase (e.g. <italic>in the park</italic>) rather than a highly expected direct object.</p><p>In all the six types of sentences, the subject noun phrase comprised a single-word noun and a preceding determine ‘<italic>The’</italic>. In each sentence set, sentences of the first four types had the same subject noun, while DO1 and DO2 sentences shared a different subject noun. The reduced relative clause in HiTrans and LoTrans sentences consisted of a head verb, that is, Verb1 (e.g. <italic>found/walked</italic>) which was followed by a three-word prepositional phrase (e.g. <italic>in the park</italic>). Note that, in 15 out of the 60 sentence sets, the actual main verb in UNA, RR, and GP conditions was preceded by an auxiliary verb (e.g. ‘<italic>was covered’</italic> in the example set in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In the following analyses, we defined the first word after the prepositional phrase as the main verb since its appearance is sufficient to resolve the intended passive interpretation where Verb1 is a passive verb (i.e. the head of a reduced relative clause).</p><p>Note that, although UNA, PAS, DO1, and DO2 conditions were not included in subsequent analyses, they added variety to the types of syntactic construction of the stimuli and ecological validity of the experiment, which also prevented potential adaption to a particular sentence structure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Procedure</title><p>The experimental stimuli (360 spoken sentences recorded by a female native British English speaker with a neutral intonation throughout) were equally divided into four blocks with 90 experimental trials in each. To maintain participants’ attention while they were listening to the stimuli, the experimental trials in each block were interspersed with nine additional trials consisting of questions related to the contents in the preceding sentence. These questions were presented in written form on the screen, and a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response was required by button pressing. Each of these question trials was followed by a filler trial (including a normal spoken sentence outside the experimental stimuli) to ensure that no residual task effects would be picked up in the next experimental trial. Each block started with two filler trials. All question trials and filler trials (20 in each block) were excluded from the following analyses. The order of blocks and the order of trials within each block were pseudorandomized across participants.</p><p>Each experimental trial began with a fixation cross presented at the centre of the screen with a random period ranging from 750 ms to 1250 ms (1000 ms on average) before the onset of the spoken sentence. Participants were asked to look at the fixation cross and avoid eye movement or blinking while listening to the spoken sentences. There was a 1000 ms silence from the end of each sentence followed by a ‘blink cue’ that lasted for 1400 ms during which participants could blink. E-Prime Studio version 2 (Psychology Software Tools Inc, PA) was used to present stimuli and record participants’ responses.</p><p>Auditory stimuli were delivered binaurally through MEG-compatible ER3A insert earphones (Etymotic Research Inc, IL). There was a 26 ms ± 2 ms delay in sound delivery due to the transmission of auditory signal from the stimulus computer to the earphones. This sound delivery delay was corrected in the following analyses. To ensure that participants were able to hear the stimuli through both earphones, a short hearing test was conducted before the main experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sentence continuation pre-tests</title><p>To obtain human incremental interpretations for each of the HiTrans and LoTrans sentences (120 in total), we conducted two continuation pre-tests which involved two different groups of native British English speakers (30 participants in the first pre-test, 18 participants in the second, aged between 18 and 34 y) who did not participate in the main experiment. Specifically, participants wore headphones and were seated in front of a computer. They listened to a fragment of one of the HiTrans/LoTrans sentences starting from its onset and continuing until a certain position in the sentence, and then they were asked to complete this sentence by producing a meaningful continuation. The sentence fragment was binaurally presented up to the Verb1 (e.g. <italic>The dog found</italic> …) in the first pre-test and was presented up to the end of the prepositional phrase in the second pre-test (e.g. <italic>The dog found in the park</italic> …). In the second pre-test, participants were allowed to provide a full stop as a continuation if they thought that what they had heard was a complete sentence.</p><p>Based on the continuations obtained in the first pre-test, we calculated the probability of direct object or prepositional phrase in the continuations immediately after the Verb1, that is, DO probability and PP probability. This provided contextualized measures of the transitive or the intransitive use of Verb1 given the preceding subject noun phrase. Specifically, we defined Verb1 transitivity as DO probability/(1 - DO probability) and defined Verb1 intransitivity as (1 - DO probability)/DO probability. Given the continuations collected in the second pre-test, we calculated the probability of a main verb in the continuations immediately after the prepositional phrase, that is, MV probability, which directly reflected a listener’s structural interpretation by the end of the prepositional phrase. The absence of a main verb in the continuation after the prepositional phrase indicated that the active interpretation was taken and the Verb1 was considered as the ‘main verb’, whereas the appearance of a main verb in the continuation indicated that the passive interpretation was taken (i.e. Verb1 was interpreted as a passive verb), and thus a main verb was needed to complete the sentence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>EMEG and MRI acquisition</title><p>Participants were seated in a magnetically shielded room (IMEDCO GmbH, Switzerland) with their head placed in the helmet of the MEG scanner. MEG data were collected using a Neuromag Vector View system (Elekta, Helsinki, Finland) with 102 magnetometers and 204 planar gradiometers at 1 kHz sampling rate. Simultaneous EEG was recorded at 1 kHz sampling rate from 70 Ag–AgCl electrodes within an elastic cap (ESACYCAP GmbH, Herrsching-Breitbrunn, Germany). Vertical and horizontal eye movements were recorded by two EOG electrodes attached below and lateral to the left eye, and cardiac signals were recorded by two ECG electrodes attached separately to the right shoulder blade and left torso. Five head position indicator (HPI) coils were used to monitor head motion. A 3D digitizer was used to record the position of EEG electrodes, HPI coils and head points on participants’ scalp relative to the three anatomical fiducials (i.e. nasion and bilateral preauricular points). To source localize EMEG data, T1-weighted MPRAGE structural MRI image with 1 mm isotropic resolution was acquired using a Siemens Prisma 3T scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). All EMEG and MRI data were collected at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>EMEG preprocessing and source localization</title><p>Maxfilter (Elekta) was applied to raw MEG data for bad channel removal and head-motion compensation. Signals outside the brain were removed using the temporal extension of signal-space separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taulu and Simola, 2006</xref>). EMEG data were low-pass filtered at 40 Hz and high-pass filtered at 0.5 Hz with a fifth-order bidirectional Butterworth filter using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL). Independent component analysis (ICA) was conducted using EEGLAB (SCCN, UCSD), components related to blink, eye-movement, and physiological noises were removed according to the correlation with EOG, ECG signals, and further visual inspection. The preprocessed EMEG data were then downsampled to 200 Hz. Three epochs were extracted from the continuous EMEG recordings of each HiTrans or LoTrans sentence with auditory delivery delay corrected – V1 epoch was aligned to the onset of the Verb1, PP1 epoch was aligned to the onset of the preposition, and MV epoch was aligned to the onset of the main verb. All the three epochs were 600 ms in length. For all three epochs, baseline correction was performed using the signal from a silent period (i.e. –200 ms to 0 ms relative to sentence onset). Finally, automatic artefact rejection was conducted to exclude trials with signals that exceeded predefined amplitude thresholds (60 ft/mm for gradiometers, 3000 ft for magnetometers, and 200 uV for EEG electrodes). The uniqueness point of V1/PP1/MV was defined as the earliest point in time when this word can be fully recognized after removing all of its phonological competitors. We first identified the phoneme by which this word can be uniquely recognized according to CELEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baayen, 1993</xref>). Then, we manually labelled the offset of this phoneme in the auditory file of the spoken sentence.</p><p>EMEG data source localization was performed using SPM12. Source space was modelled by a cortical mesh consisting of 8196 vertices. The sensor positions were co-registered to individual T1-weighted structural image by aligning fiducials and the digitized head shape to the outer scalp mesh. MEG forward model was constructed using the single-shell model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sarvas, 1987</xref>), while EEG forward model was built using the boundary element model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mosher et al., 1999</xref>). Inversion of EMEG data was conducted for V1, PP1, and MV epochs separately using the least-squares minimum norm method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hämäläinen and Ilmoniemi, 1994</xref>) and an empirical Bayesian MEG and EEG data fusion scheme implemented in SPM12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Henson et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Incremental structural representations of BERT</title><p>To obtain incremental structural representations of BERT, we adopted a structural probing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hewitt and Manning, 2019</xref>) to quantify a sentence’s structure by estimating each word’s parse depth in the corresponding dependency parse tree based on the contextualized word embeddings from the hidden states of BERT, which explicitly considers the specific contents of the words in the input. Specifically, a structural probing model was trained to find an optimal linear transformation to be applied to the BERT contextualized embeddings of words in the input sentence, so that the squared L2 norm of the transformed word embeddings provided the best estimate for each word’s parse depth of in the dependency parse tree of this sentence.</p><p>We followed the procedure described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hewitt and Manning, 2019</xref>) and trained a structural probing model for each BERT layer with the annotated corpus from Penn Treebank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marcus et al., 1993</xref>). Contextualized word embeddings were extracted from each of the 24 layers in a pre-trained version of BERT (BERT-large-cased) using HuggingFace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wolf, 2019</xref>). For each BERT layer, the training process was repeated 10 times with different random initializations, and the averaged BERT parse depth was used in the following analyses. The performance of structural probing models trained by different BERT layers was evaluated by root accuracy. Root accuracy is defined as the percentage of the sentences in which the smallest parse depth is assigned to the main verb (i.e. the root of the dependency parse tree has a parse depth of 0) when the whole sentence is input to the model.</p><p>Each HiTrans or LoTrans sentence was input word-by-word to the trained BERT structural probing models, which resulted in a vector consisting of the parse depth of each word in the incremental input (e.g. a3D BERT parse depth vector for the input “<italic>The dog found</italic> …”). Taking advantage of the bidirectional attention mechanism of BERT, the parse depth of each preceding word was constantly updated as the input unfolded word-by-word, capturing the incrementality of speech comprehension. Besides, we defined interpretive mismatch as the cosine distance between an incremental BERT parse depth vector and the corresponding incremental context-free parse depth vector for the passive or the active interpretation. The smaller the interpretive mismatch with one particular interpretation, the higher the preference for this interpretation given BERT structural representations.</p><p>To determine the contribution of the words at different positions in a sentence to the incremental BERT parse depth vectors, we shuffled the parse depths of the words at a particular position across sentences at a time and kept the parse depths of the other words unchanged. Then we calculated the Spearman distance (i.e. 1-Spearman’s rho) between the original BERT parse depth vector and the shuffled counterpart. The higher this distance, the more important the words at this position are to the BERT parse depth vectors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Corpus-based measures of multifaceted constraints and their interpretative coherence</title><p>We quantified subject noun thematic role properties and Verb1 transitivity preference based on a concatenated corpus (3.4 billion tokens, 162.1 million sentences) consisting of the British National Corpus, the Wikipedia dump (by October 2020) and ukWaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baroni et al., 2009</xref>). A dependency parser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mrini et al., 2020</xref>) was first applied to each sentence in the concatenated corpus to specify the subject noun and the verb(s) related to it. For the subject noun in each sentence, we used a semantic role labelling model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2020</xref>) to obtain its thematic role. For simplicity, we only considered the thematic role of an agent or a patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dowty, 1991</xref>).</p><p>For each subject noun in HiTrans and LoTrans sentences, we counted separately how many times it took the thematic role of an agent or a patient in the concatenated corpus. Then we defined its agenthood as the ratio of the number of its appearances as an agent to that of its appearances as a patient, and vice versa for its patienthood. We also counted separately how many times the Verb1 in each HiTrans or LoTrans sentence took a direct object or alternative SCFs in the corpus. Each Verb1’s transitivity was defined as the ratio of the frequency it took a direct object to that it took alternative SCFs, and vice versa for its intransitivity. By doing so, we obtained subject noun agenthood and patienthood, Verb1 transitivity and intransitivity. Note that the Verb1 (in)transitivity estimated from the human continuations in the pre-test is context-dependent given the specific preceding subject noun, while the Verb1 (in)transitivity estimated from the concatenated corpus is context-independent in the sense that it accounted for every appearance of this verb without being biased to a specific context.</p><p>We further derived passive/active index capturing the interpretative coherence between the subject noun and Verb1 as they affected passive and active interpretations separately. The passive index was obtained by multiplying subject noun patienthood with Verb1 transitivity, given that both high subject noun patienthood and high Verb1 transitivity coherently prefer a passive interpretation as the prepositional phrase is heard (e.g. <italic>The <bold>dog found</bold> in the park</italic> …). In contrast, the active index was obtained by multiplying subject noun agenthood by Verb1 intransitivity, capturing the preference for an active interpretation (e.g. <italic>The <bold>king walked</bold> in the garden</italic> …). Besides, we also calculated a contextualized version of passive/active index by using Verb1 (in)transitivity derived from human continuation pre-tests instead of that derived from the concatenated corpus. In addition, we derived a non-directional index by applying logarithmic transformation to the ratio measures of lexical constraints (i.e. subject noun agenthood or patienthood, Verb1 intransitivity or transitivity) before multiplying them. This manipulation removed the directionality of the passive or the active index, so that the non-directional index only indicates the interpretative coherence between the subject noun and Verb1 regardless of which interpretation is considered (see illustrations of directionality in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Spatiotemporal searchlight representational similarity analysis (ssRSA)</title><p>ssRSA was conducted to compare the (dis)similarity structure of BERT structural measures or the multifaceted probabilistic constraints with the (dis)similarity structure of observed spatiotemporal patterns of listeners’ brain activity. We used a spatiotemporal searchlight with a 10 mm spatial radius and 30 ms temporal radius (i.e. a 60 ms sliding time window) which was mapped across the whole brain in the source-localized EMEG.</p><p>For brain activity, we constructed data representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) by vectorizing the source-localized EMEG data within each spatiotemporal searchlight for all the trials (i.e. 60 HiTrans sentences and 60 LoTrans sentences) and calculated the pair-wise Pearson’s correlation distance (i.e. 1 - Pearson’s r) among them, which resulted in a 120 × 120 data RDM. Multivariate normalization was applied to improve the reliability of distance measures and reduce the task-irrelevant heteroscedastic structure across trials and vertices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guggenmos et al., 2018</xref>). Model RDMs of the same size (i.e. 120 × 120) were constructed by calculating either the absolute pair-wise difference for a scalar measure (e.g. SN agenthood/patienthood, passive/active index, BERT Verb1 parse depth) or the cosine distance among the incremental BERT parse depth vectors of the 120 sentences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a summary of all the model RDMs). We used ratio measures to represent subject noun agenthood/patienthood, Verb1 transitivity/intransitivity, and passive/active index because they provided the directionality needed to differentiate the two opposite aspects of the same lexical constraint in the model RDMs (see illustrations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>) and made it possible to test them separately in the brain.</p><p>Each model RDM was compared against the data RDM of a searchlight centred at each vertex and time point using Spearman’s rank correlation, which resulted in a time series of model fit (i.e. rank correlation coefficient rho) for each vertex. For each time point, a one-tailed one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was conducted at each vertex with the fits of all participants for this model RDM to test whether the mean model fit is significantly above zero.

Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was applied to this concatenated model fit matrix with negative model fits zeroed. NMF was repeated 20 times with random starting values using a multiplicative update algorithm in MATLAB, results with the least root mean square residual (RMS) was used in the following analyses. The optimal number of NMF factors was determined by searching for the one with the least RMS in a wide range of factor numbers (from 2 to 50). With the optimal number of factors, the resulted time series of NMF factors from all participants were reshaped into a factor by time point by participant matrix which was used as the input of multivariate GCA implemented by the Multivariate GCA toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnett and Seth, 2014</xref>). Multivariate GCA was conducted using two sets of NMF factors derived from the fits of two model RDMs with Akaike information criterion adopted for GCA model order estimation. GC significance was determined by a permutation test in which 1000 surrogate data sets were created by randomly rearranging short time windows (of length model order) from the original factor time course. p-Values &lt;0.005 were refined via a tail approximation from the Generalised Pareto Distribution using PALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winkler et al., 2016</xref>).

This is an important question because speech processing in general is lesser studied as compared to reading, and syntactic processes are lesser studied than lower-level sensory processes. The authors claim to shed light on the neural processes that build structured linguistic interpretations. The authors apply modern analysis techniques, and use state-of-the-art large language models in order to facilitate this investigation. They apply this to a cleverly designed experimental paradigm of EMEG data, and compare neural responses of human participants to the activation profiles in different layers of the BERT language model.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>Similar to my original review, I find the paper hard to follow, and it is not clear to me that the use of the LLM is adding much to the findings.

Since syntactic parsing is a hidden process, it is challenging to describe the syntactic structure a listener internally constructs at each time moment. Here, the authors overcome this problem by (1) asking listeners to complete a sentence at some break point to probe the syntactic structure mentally constructed at the break point, and (2) using a DNN model to extract the most likely structure a listener may extract at a time moment.</p><p>After obtaining incremental syntactic features using a DNN model, i.e., BERT, the authors analyze how these syntactic features are represented in the brain using MEG. The advantage of the approach is that BERT can potentially integrate syntactic and semantic knowledge and is a computational model, instead of a static theoretical construct, that may more precisely reflect incremental sentence processing in the human brain.

A unique contribution of the work is to use a large language model to quantify how the mental representation of syntactic structure updates as a sentence unfolds in time. Solid evidence is provided that distributive cortical networks are engaged for incremental parsing of a sentence, although the contribution could be further strengthened if the authors would further highlight the main results and clarify the benefit of using a large language model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors for the overall positive assessment. We have revised our manuscript to further emphasize our main findings and highlight the advantages of using a large language model (LLM) over traditional behavioural and corpus-based data.</p><p>This study aims to investigate the neural dynamics underlying the incremental construction of structured interpretation during speech comprehension. While syntactic cues play an important role, they alone do not define the essence of this parsing process. Instead, this incremental process is jointly determined by the interplay of syntax, semantics, and non-linguistic world knowledge, evoked by the specific words heard sequentially by listeners. To better capture these multifaceted constraints, we derived structural measures from BERT, which dynamically represent the evolving structured interpretation as a sentence unfolds word-by-word.</p><p>Typically, the syntactic structure of a sentence can be represented by a context-free parse tree, such as a dependency parse tree or a constituency-based parse tree, which abstracts away from specific content, assigning a discrete parse depth to each word regardless of its semantics. However, this context-free parse tree merely represents the result rather than the process of sentence parsing and does not elucidate how a coherent structured interpretation is concurrently determined by multifaceted constraints. In contrast, BERT parse depth, trained to approach the context-free discrete dependency parse depth, is a continuous variable. Crucially, its deviation from the corresponding discrete parse depth indicates the preference for the syntactic structure represented by this context-free parse. As BERT processes a sentence delivered word-by-word, the dynamic change of BERT parse depth reflects the incremental nature of online speech comprehension.</p><p>Our results reveal a behavioural alignment between BERT parse depth and human interpretative preference for the same set of sentences. In other words, BERT parse depth could represent a probabilistic interpretation of a sentence’s structure based on its specific contents, making it possible to quantify the preference for each grammatically correct syntactic structure during incremental speech comprehension. Furthermore, both BERT and human interpretations show correlations with linguistic knowledge, such as verb transitivity, and non-linguistic knowledge, like subject noun thematic role preference. Both types of knowledge are essential for achieving a coherent interpretation, in accordance with the “constraint-based hypothesis” of sentence processing.</p><p>Motivated by the observed behavioural alignment between BERT and human listeners, we further investigated BERT structural measures in source-localized EEG/MEG using representational similarity analyses (RSA). This approach revealed the neural dynamics underlying incremental speech comprehension on millisecond scales. Our main findings include: (1) a shift from bi-hemispheric lateral frontal-temporal regions to left-lateralized regions in representing the current structured interpretation as a sentence unfolds, (2) a pattern of sequential activations in the left lateral temporal regions, updating the structured interpretation as syntactic ambiguity is resolved, and (3) the influence of lexical interpretative coherence activated in the right hemisphere over the resolved sentence structure represented in the left hemisphere.</p><p>From our perspective, the advantages of using a LLM (or deep language model) like BERT are twofold. Conceptually, BERT structural measures offer a deep contextualized structural representation for any given sentence by integrating the multifaceted constraints unique to the specific contents described by the words within that sentence. Modelling this process on a word-by-word basis is challenging to achieve with behavioural or corpus-based metrics. Empirically, as demonstrated in our responses to the reviewers below, BERT measures show better performance compared to behavioural and corpus-based metrics in aligning with listeners’ neural activity. Moreover, when it comes to integrating multiple sources of constraints for achieving a coherent interpretation, BERT measures also show a better fit with the behavioural data of human listeners than corpus-based metrics.</p><p>Taken together, we propose that LLMs, akin to other artificial neural networks (ANNs), can be considered as computational models for formulating and testing specific neuroscientific hypotheses, such as the “constraint-based hypothesis” of sentence processing in this study. However, we by no means overlook the importance of corpus-based and behavioural metrics. These metrics play a crucial role in interpreting and assessing whether and how ANNs stimulate human cognitive processes, a fundamental step in employing ANNs to gain new insights into the neural mechanisms of human cognition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors investigate where and when brain activity is modulated by incoming linguistic cues during sentence comprehension. Sentence stimuli were designed such that incoming words had varying degrees of constraint on the sentence's structural interpretation as participants listened to them unfolding, i.e. due to varying degrees of verb transitivity and the noun's likelihood of assuming a specific thematic role. Word-by-word &quot;online&quot; structural interpretations for each sentence were extracted from a deep neural network model trained to reproduce language statistics. The authors relate the various metrics of word-by-word predicted sentence structure to brain data through a standard RSA approach at three distinct points of time throughout sentence presentation. The data provide convincing evidence that brain activity reflects preceding linguistic constraints as well as integration difficulty immediately after word onset of disambiguating material.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #1 (hereinafter referred to as R1) for their recognition of the objectives of our study and the analytical approaches we have employed in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors confirm that their sentence stimuli vary in degree of constraint on sentence structure through independent behavioral data from a sentence continuation task. They also show a compelling correlation of these behavioral data with the online structure metric extracted from the deep neural network, which seems to pick up on the variation in constraints. In the introduction, the authors argue for the potential benefits of using deep neural networkderived metrics given that it has &quot;historically been challenging to model the dynamic interplay between various types of linguistic and nonlinguistic information&quot;.

In fact, this perspective underpinned our decision to conduct extensive correlation analyses using both behavioural and corpus-based metrics to make sense of BERT metrics. These analyses were essential to interpret and validate BERT metrics before employing them to investigate listeners’ neural activity during speech comprehension. We do not in any way undermine the importance of behavioural or corpus-based data in studying language processing in the brain. On the contrary, as evidenced by our findings, these traditional metrics are instrumental in interpreting and guiding the use of metrics derived from LLMs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the data presented here don't directly test how large the benefit provided by this tool really is. In fact, the authors show compelling correlations of the neural network-derived metrics with both the behavioral cloze-test data as well as several (corpus-)derived metrics. While this is a convincing illustration of how deep language models can be made more interpretable, it is in itself not novel. The correlation with behavioral data and corpus statistics also raises the question of what is the additional benefit of the computational model? Is it simply saving us the step of not having to collect the behavioral data, not having to compute the corpus statistics or does the model potentially uncover a more nuanced representation of the online comprehension process? This remains unclear because we are lacking a direct comparison of how much variance in the neural data is explained by the neural network-derived metrics beyond those other metrics (for example the main verb probability or the corpusderived &quot;active index&quot; following the prepositional phrase).</p></disp-quote><p>From our perspective, a primary advantage of using the neural network-derived metrics (or LLMs as computational models of language processing), compared to traditional behavioural and corpus-based metrics, lies in their ability to offer more nuanced, contextualized representations of natural language inputs. There seems no effective way of computationally capturing the distributed and multifaceted constraints within specific contexts until the current generation of LLMs came along. While it is feasible to quantify lexical properties or contextual effects based on the usage of specific words via corpora or behavioural tests, this method appears less effective in modelling the composition of meanings across more words on the sentence level. More critically, it struggles with capturing how various lexical constraints collectively yield a coherent structured interpretation.</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that models designed for context prediction or next-word prediction, such as word2vec and LLMs, outperform classic count-based distributional semantic models (Baroni et al. 2014) in aligning with neural activity during language comprehension (Schrimpf et al. 2021; Caucheteux and King 2022). Relevant to this, we have conducted additional analyses to directly assess the additional variance of neural data explained by BERT metrics, over and above what traditional metrics account for. Specifically, using RSA, we re-tested model RDMs based on BERT metrics while controlling for the contribution from traditional metrics (via partial correlation).</p><p>During the first verb (V1) epoch, we tested model RDMs of V1 transitivity based on data from either the behavioural pre-test (i.e., continuations following V1) or massive corpora.

While no significant results were found for PP probability, we have plotted the uncorrected results for PP probability (Author response image 2). These model fits have very limited overlap with those of BERT parse depth vector (up to PP1) in the left inferior frontal gyrus (approximately at 360 ms) and the left temporal regions (around 600 ms). It is noteworthy that the model fits of the BERT parse depth vector (up to PP1) remained largely unchanged even when PP probability was controlled for, indicating that the variance explained by BERT metrics cannot be effectively accounted for by the PP probability obtained from the human continuation pre-test.</p><p>Author response image 2</p><p>Comparison between the RSA model fits of BERT structural metrics and behavioural / corpusbased metrics in the PP1 epoch.

When compared with the BERT parse depth vector (up to MV), we observed a similar effect in the left dorsal frontal regions (see Author response image 3). However, this effect did not survive after the whole-brain multiple comparison correction. Subsequent partial correlation analyses revealed that the MV probability accounted for only a small portion of the variance in neural data explained by the BERT metric, primarily the effect observed in the left dorsal frontal regions around 380 ms post MV onset. Meanwhile, the majority of the model fits of the BERT parse depth vector remained largely unchanged after controlling for the MV probability.</p><p>Note that the probability of a PP/MV continuation reflect participants’ predictions based on speech input preceding the preposition (e.g., “The dog found…”) or the main verb (e.g., “The dog found in the park…”), respectively. In contrast, BERT parse depth vector is designed to represent the structure of the (partial) sentence in the speech already delivered to listeners, rather than to predict a continuation after it. Therefore, in the PP1 and MV epochs, we separately tested BERT parse depth vectors that included the preposition (e.g., “The dog found in…”) and the main verb (e.g., “The dog found in the park was…”) to accurately capture the sentence structure at these specific points in a sentence. Despite the differences in the nature of information captured by these two types of metrics, the behavioural metrics themselves did not exhibit significant model fits when tested against listeners’ neural activity.</p><p>Author response image 3</p><p>Comparison between the RSA model fits of BERT structural metrics and behavioural / corpusbased metrics in the MV epoch.

In the MV epoch, while significant model fits of the passive index were observed, which temporally overlapped with the BERT parse depth vector (up to MV) after the recognition point of the MV, the effects of these two model RDMs emerged in different hemispheres, as illustrated in Figures 6C and 8D in the main text. Consequently, we opted not to pursue further partial correlation analysis with the corpus-derived interpretative preference. Besides, as shown in Figure 8A, 8B and 8C, subject noun thematic role preference and non-directional index exhibit significant model fits in the PP1 or the MV epoch. Interesting, these effects lead corresponding effects of BERT metrics in the same epoch (see Figure 6B and 6C), suggesting that the overall structured interpretation emerges after the evaluation and integration of multifaceted lexical constraints.</p><p>In summary, our findings indicate that, in comparison to corpus-derived or behavioural metrics, BERT structural metrics are more effective in explaining neural data, in terms of modelling both the unfolding sentence input (i.e., incremental BERT parse vector) and individual words (i.e., V1) within specific sentential contexts. This advantage of BERT metrics might be due to the hypothesized capacity of LLMs to capture more contextually rich representations. Such representations effectively integrate the diverse constraints present in a given sentence, thereby outperforming corpus-based metrics or behavioural metrics in this respect. Concurrently, it is important to recognize the significant role of corpus-based / behavioral metrics as explanatory variables. They are instrumental not only in interpreting BERT metrics but also in understanding their fit to listeners’ neural activity (by examining the temporal sequence and spatial distribution of model fits of these two types of metrics). Such an integrative approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex neural processes underpinning speech comprehension.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regards to the neural data, the authors show convincing evidence for early modulations of brain activity by linguistic constraints on sentence structure and importantly early modulation by the coherence between multiple constraints to be integrated. Those modulations can be observed across bilateral frontal and temporal areas as well as parts of the default mode network. The methods used are clear and rigorous and allow for a detailed exploration of how multiple linguistic cues are neurally encoded and dynamically shape the final representation of a sentence in the brain. However, at times the consequences of the RSA results remain somewhat vague with regard to the motivation behind different metrics and how they differ from each other. Therefore, some results seem surprising and warrant further discussion, for example: Why does the neural network-derived parse depth metric fit neural data before the V1 uniqueness point if the sentence pairs begin with the same noun phrase? This suggests that the lexical information preceding V1, is driving the results. However, given the additional results, we can already exclude an influence of subject likelihood for a specific thematic role as this did not model the neural data in the V1 epoch to a significant degree.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by R1, model fits of BERT parse depth vector (up to V1) and its mismatch for the active interpretation were observed before the V1 uniqueness point (Figures 6A and 6D). These early effects could be attributed to the inclusion of different subject nouns in the BERT parse depth vectors. In our MEG data analyses, RSA was performed using all LoTrans and HiTrans sentences. Each of the 60 sentence sets contained one LoTrans sentence and one HiTrans sentence, which resulted in a 120 x 120 neural data RDM for each searchlight ROI across the brain within each sliding time window. Although LoTrans and HiTrans sentences within the same sentence set shared the same subject noun, subject nouns varied across sentence sets. This variation was expected to be reflected in both the model RDM of BERT metrics and the data RDM, a point further clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In contrast, when employing a model RDM constructed solely from the BERT V1 parse depth, we observed model fits peaking precisely at the uniqueness point of V1 (see Appendix 1figure 10). It is important to note that BERT V1 parse depth is a contextualized metric influenced by the preceding subject noun, which could account for the effects of BERT V1 parse depth observed before the uniqueness point of V1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly, In Fig 2C it seems there are systematic differences between HiTrans and LoTrans sentences regarding the parse depth of determiner and subject noun according to the neural network model, while this is not expected according to the context-free parse.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank R1 for pointing out this issue. Relevant to Figure 3D (Figure 2C in the original manuscript), we presented the distributions of BERT parse depth for individual words as the sentence unfolds in Appendix 1-figure 2. Our analysis revealed that the parse depth of the subject noun in high transitivity (HiTrans) and low transitivity (LoTrans) sentences did not significantly differ, except for the point at which the sentence reached V1 (two-tailed twosample t-test, P = 0.05).</p><p>However, we observed a significant difference in the parse depth of the determiner between HiTrans and LoTrans sentences (two-tailed two-sample t-test, P &lt; 0.05 for all results in Appendix 1-figure 2). Additionally, the parse depth of the determiner was found to covary with that of V1 as the input unfolded to different sentence positions (Pearson correlation, P &lt; 0.05 for all plots in Appendix 1-figure 2). This difference, unexpected in terms of the contextfree (dependency) parse used for training the BERT structural probing model, might be indicative of a “leakage” of contextual information during the training of the structural probing model, given the co-variation between the determiner and V1 which was designed to be different in their transitivity in the two types of sentences.</p><p>Despite such unexpected differences observed in the BERT parse depths of the determiner, we considered the two sentence types as one group with distributed features (e.g., V1 transitivity) in the RSA, and used the BERT parse depth vector including all words in the sentence input to construct the model RDMs. Moreover, as indicated in Appendix 1-figure 3, compared to the content words, the determiner contributed minimally to the incremental BERT parse depth vector. Consequently, the noted discrepancies in BERT parse depth of the determiner between HiTrans and LoTrans sentences are unlikely to significantly bias our RSA results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The degree of this mismatch is proportional to the evidence for or against the two interpretations (...). Besides these two measures based on the entire incremental input, we also focused on Verb1 since the potential structural ambiguity lies in whether Verb1 is interpreted as a passive verb or the main verb.&quot; The neural data fits in V1 epoch differ in their temporal profile for the mismatch metrics and the Verb 1 depth respectively. I understand the &quot;degree of mismatch&quot; to be a measure of how strongly the neural network's hidden representations align with the parse depth of an active or passive sentence structure. If this is correct, then it is not clear from the text how far this measure differs from the Verb 1 depth alone, which is also indicating either an active or passive structure.</p></disp-quote><p>Within the V1 epoch, we tested three distinct types of model RDMs based on BERT metrics: (1) The BERT parse depth vector, representing the neural network’s hidden representation of the incremental sentence structure including all words up to V1. (2) The mismatch metric for either the Active or Passive interpretation, calculated as the distance between the BERT parse depth vector and the context-free parse depth vector for each interpretation. (3) The BERT parse depth of V1, crucial in representing the preferred structural interpretation of the unfolding sentence given its syntactic role as either a passive verb or the main verb.</p><p>While the BERT parse depth vector per se does not directly indicate a preferred interpretation, its mismatch with the context-free parse depth vectors of the two possible interpretations reveals the favoured interpretation, as significant neural fit is only anticipated for the mismatch with the interpretation being considered. The contextualized BERT depth of V1 is also indicative of the preferred structure given the context-free V1 parse depth corresponding to different syntactic roles, however, compared to the interpretative mismatch, it does not fully capture contributions from other words in the input. Consequently, we expected the interpretative mismatch and the BERT V1 depth to yield different results. Indeed, our analysis revealed that, although both metrics extracted from the same BERT layer (i.e., layer 13) demonstrated early RSA fits in the left fronto-temporal regions, the V1 depth showed relatively more prolonged effects with a notable peak occurring precisely at the uniqueness point of V1 (compare Figure 6C and Appendix 1-figure 10). These complementary results underscore the capability of BERT metrics to align with neural responses, in terms of both an incrementally unfolding sentence and a specific word within it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In previous studies, differences in neural activity related to distinct amounts of open nodes in the parse tree have been interpreted in terms of distinct working memory demands (Nelson et al. pnas 2017, Udden et al tics 2020). It seems that some of the metrics, for example the neural network-derived parse depth or the V1 depth may be similarly interpreted in the light of working memory demands. After all, during V1 epoch, the sentences do not only differ with respect to predicted sentence structure, but also in the amount of open nodes that need to be maintained. In the discussion, however, the authors interpret these results as &quot;neural representations of an unfolding sentence's structure&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the Active and Passive interpretations differ in terms of the number of open nodes before the actual main verb is heard. Given the syntactic ambiguity in our sentence stimuli (i.e., LoTrans and Hi Trans sentences), it is infeasible to determine the exact number of open nodes in each sentence as it unfolds. Nevertheless, the RSA fits observed in the dorsal lateral frontal regions could be indicative of the varying working memory demands involved in building the structured interpretations across sentences. We have added this perspective in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This article is focused on investigating incremental speech processing, as it pertains to building higher-order syntactic structure.

I am not sure why tree depth and BERT are being used to evaluate the degree to which a sentence is being processed as active or passive. If this is necessary, it would be helpful for the authors to motivate this more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, as pointed by R2, the only difference between LoTrans and HiTrans sentences is the first verb (V1), whose transitivity is crucial for establishing an initial preference for either an Active or a Passive interpretation as the sentence unfolds. Nonetheless, in line with the constraint-based approach to sentence processing and supported by previous research findings, a coherent structured interpretation of a sentence is determined by the combined constraints imposed by all words within that sentence. In our study, the transitivity of V1 alone is insufficient to fully explain the interpretative preference for the sentence structure. The overall sentence-level interpretation also depends on the thematic role preference of the subject noun – its likelihood of being an agent performing an action or a patient receiving the action.</p><p>This was evident in our findings, as shown in Author response image 1 above, where the V1 transitivity based on corpus or behavioural data did not fit to the neural data during the V1 epoch. In contrast, BERT structural measures [e.g., BERT parse depth vector (up to V1) and BERT V1 parse depth] offered contextualized representations that are presumed to integrate various lexical constraints present in each sentence. These BERT metrics exhibited significant model fits for the same neural data in the V1 epoch. Besides, a notable feature of BERT is its bi-directional attention mechanism, which allows for the dynamic updating of an earlier word’s representation as more of the sentence is heard, which is also changeling to achieve with corpus or behavioural metrics. For instance, the parse depth of the word “found” in the BERT parse depth vector for “The dog found…” differs from its parse depth in the vector for “The dog found in…”. This feature of BERT is particularly advantageous for investigating the dynamic nature of structured interpretation during speech comprehension, as it stimulates the continual updating of interpretation that occurs as a sentence unfolds (as shown by Figure 7 in the main text). We have elaborated on the rationale for employing BERT parse depth in this regard in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The main data result figures comparing BERT and the EMEG brain data are hard to evaluate because only t-values are provided, and those, only for significant clusters.

Note that RSA was conducted in the source-localized E/MEG, it is infeasible to plot the rho time course for each searchlight at one of the 8196 vertices on the cortical surface mesh.

For example, how was BERT masked to give word-by-word predictions? In its default form, I believe that BERT takes in a set of words before and after the keyword that it is predicting. But I assume that here the model is not allowed to see linguistic information in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>In our analyses, we utilized the pre-trained version of BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) as released by Hugging Face (https://github.com/huggingface). It is noteworthy that BERT, as described in the original paper, was initially trained using the Cloze task, involving the prediction of masked words within an input. In our study, however, we neither retrained nor fine-tuned the pre-trained BERT model, nor did we employ it for word-by-word prediction tasks. We used BERT to derive the incremental representation of a sentence’s structure as it unfolded word-by-word.</p><p>Specifically, we sequentially input the text of each sentence into the BERT, akin to how a listener would receive the spoken words in a sentence (see Figure 3C in the main text). For each incremental input (such as “The dog found”), we extracted the hidden representations of each word from BERT. These representations were then transformed into their respective BERT parse depths using a structural probing model (which was trained using sentences with annotated dependency parse tress from the Penn Treebank Dataset). The resulting BERT parse depths were subsequently used to create model RDMs, which were then tested against neural data via RSA.</p><p>Crucially, in our approach, BERT was not exposed to any future linguistic information in the sentence. We never tested BERT parse depth of a word in an epoch where this word had not been heard by the listener. For example, the three-dimensional BERT parse depth vector for “The dog found” was tested in the V1 epoch corresponding to “found”, while the fourdimensional BERT parse depth vector for “The dog found in” was tested in the PP1 epoch of “in”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How were the auditory stimuli recorded?

Here, the authors overcome this problem by (1) asking listeners to complete a sentence at some break point to probe the syntactic structure mentally constructed at the break point, and (2) using a DNN model to extract the most likely structure a listener may extract at a time moment. After obtaining incremental syntactic features using the DNN model, the authors analyze how these syntactic features are represented in the brain using MEG.</p></disp-quote><p>We extend our thanks to Reviewer #3 (referred to as R3 below) for recognizing the methods we used in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the analyses are detailed, the current conclusion needs to be further specified.

This assessment was accomplished by calculating the mismatch between the BERT parse depth vector and the context-free dependency parse depth vector representing each of the two structures. However, we only observed one preferred interpretation in each epoch (see Figures 6D-6F) and did not find evidence supporting the maintenance of parallel representations of different syntactic structures in the brain.

In the current study, this &quot;world knowledge&quot; is operationalized as the likelihood of a subject noun being an agent or patient and the probability for a verb to be transitive, so here a more specific term may have been the &quot;knowledge about statistical regularities in language&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we specifically define “non-linguistic world knowledge” as the likelihood of a subject noun assuming the role of an agent or patient, which relates to its thematic role preference. This type of knowledge is primarily non-linguistic in nature, as exemplified by comparing nouns like “king” and “desk”. Although it could be reflected by statistical regularities in language, thematic role preference hinges more on world knowledge, plausibility, or real-world statistics. In contrast, “linguistic knowledge” in our study refers to verb transitivity, which focuses on the grammatically correct usage of a verb and is tied to statistical regularities within language itself. In the revised manuscript, we have provided clearer operational definitions for these two concepts and have ensured consistent usage throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please spell out what exactly the &quot;constraint-based hypothesis&quot; is (even better, include an explicit description of the alternative hypothesis?).</p></disp-quote><p>The “constraint-based hypothesis”, as summarized in a review (McRae and Matsuki 2013), posits that various sources of information, referred to as “constraints”, are simultaneously considered by listeners during incremental speech comprehension. These constraints encompass syntax, semantics, knowledge of common events, contextual pragmatic biases, and other forms of information gathered from both intra-sentential and extra-sentential context.Notably, there is no delay in the utilization of these multifaceted constraints once they become available, neither is a fixed priority assigned to one type of constraint over another. Instead, a diverse set of constraints is immediately brought into play for comprehension as soon as they become available as the relevant spoken word is recognized.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis, proposed earlier, is the two-stage garden path model (Frazier and Rayner 1982; Frazier 1987). According to this model, there is an initial parsing stage that relies solely on syntax. This is followed by a second stage where all available information, including semantics and other knowledge, is used to assess the plausibility of the results obtained in the first-stage analysis and to conduct re-analysis if necessary (McRae and Matsuki 2013). In the Introduction of our revised manuscript, we have elaborated on the “constraint-based hypothesis” and mentioned this two-stage garden path model as its alternative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig1 B&amp;C: In order to make the data more interpretable, could you estimate how many possible grammatical structural configurations there are / how many different grammatical structures were offered in the pretest, and based on this what would be the &quot;chance probability&quot; of choosing a random structure or for example show how many responded with a punctuation vs alternative continuations?</p></disp-quote><p>In our analysis of the behavioural results, we categorized the continuations provided by participants in the pre-test at the offset of Verb1 (e.g., “The dog found/walked …”) into 6 categories, including DO (direct object), INTRANS (intransitive), PP (prepositional phrase), INF (infinitival complement), SC (sentential complement) and OTHER (gerund, phrasal verb, etc.).</p><table-wrap id="sa3table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">HiTrans sentences</th><th align="left" valign="top">LoTrans sentences</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">DO</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.89±0.16</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.33±0.34</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">PP</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.04±0.08</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.39±0.29</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">INTRANS</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.02±0.05</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.21±0.24</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">INF</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.01±0.04</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.02±0.06</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">SC</td><td align="left" valign="top">SC 0.00±0.01</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.00±0.02</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">OTHER</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.04±0.08</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.06±0.12</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Similarly, we categorized the continuations that followed the offset of the prepositional phrase (e.g., “The dog found/walked in the park …”) into 7 categories, including MV (main verb), END (i.e., full stop), PP (prepositional phrase), INF (infinitival complement), CONJ (conjunction), ADV (adverb) and OTHER (gerund, sentential complement, etc.).</p><table-wrap id="sa3table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">HiTrans sentences</th><th align="left" valign="top">LoTrans sentences</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">MV</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.66±0.19</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.12±0.15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">END</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.05±0.07</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.26±0.11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">PP</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.04±0.05</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.19±0.12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">INF</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.01±0.03</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.07±0.11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">CONJ</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.03±0.05</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.12±0.10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ADV</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.01±0.03</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.08±0.10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">OTHER</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.20±0.13</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.16±0.09</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>It is important to note that the results of these two pre-tests, including the types of continuations and their probabilities, exhibited considerable variability between and within each sentence type (see also Figures 2B and 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typo: &quot;In addition, we found that BERT structural interpretations were also a correlation with the main verb probability&quot; &gt;&gt; correlated instead of correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this typo.

This observation was particularly notable for the BERT parse depth vector in the main verb epoch when the potential syntactic ambiguity was being resolved. It is plausible that these effects observed are partly attributed to the varying working memory demands required to maintain the “opening nodes” in the different syntactic structures being considered by listeners at this point in the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The study first asked human listeners to complete partial sentences, and incremental parsing of the partial sentences can be captured based on the completed sentences. This analysis is helpful and I wonder if the behavioral data here are enough to model the E/MEG responses. For example, if I understood it correctly, the parse depth up to V1 can be extracted based on the completed sentences and used for the E/MEG analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The behavioural data alone do not suffice to model the E/MEG data. As we elucidated in our responses to R1, we employed three behavioural metrics derived from the continuation pretests. These metrics include the V1 transitivity and the PP probability, given the continuations after V1 (e.g., after “The dog found…”), as well as the MV probability, given the continuations after the prepositional phrase (e.g., after “The dog found in the park…”). These metrics aimed to capture participants’ prediction based on their structured interpretations at various positions in the sentence. However, none of these behavioural metrics yielded significant model fits to the listeners’ neural activity, which sharply contrasts with the substantial model fits of the BERT metrics in the same epochs. Besides, we also tried to model V1 parse depth as a weighted average based on participants’ continuations. As shown in Figure 3A, V1 parse depth is 0 in the active interpretation, 2 in the passive interpretation, while the parse depth of the determiner and the subject noun does not differ. However, this continuation-based V1 parse depth [i.e., 0 × Probability(active interpretation) + 2 × Probability(passive interpretation)] did not show significant model fits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this point, I wonder if the incremental parse extracted using BERT is consistent with the human results (i.e., parsing extracted based on the completed sentences) on a sentence-bysentence basis.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, we did provide evidence showing the alignment between the incremental parse extracted using BERT and the human interpretation for the same partial sentence input (see Figure 4 in the main text and Appendix 1-figures 4-6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, in Fig 1d, is it possible to calculate how much variance of the 3 probabilities is explained by the 4 factors, e.g., using a linear model? If these factors can already explain most of the variance of human parsing, is it possible to just use these 4 factors to explain neural activity?</p></disp-quote><p>Following R3’s suggestion, we have conducted additional linear modelling analyses to compare the extent to which human behavioural data can be explained by corpus metrics and BERT metrics separately. Specifically, for each of the three probabilities obtained in the pretests (i.e., DO, PP, and MV), we constructed two linear models. One model utilized the four corpus-based metrics as regressors (i.e., SN agenthood, V1 transitivity, Passive index, and Active index), while the other model used BERT metrics as regressors (i.e., BERT parse depth of each word up to V1 from layer 13 for DO/PP probability and BERT parse depth of each word up to the end of PP from layer 14 for MV probability, consistent with the BERT layers reported in Figure 6).</p><p>As shown in the table below, corpus metrics demonstrate a more effective fit than BERT metrics for predicting the DO/PP probability. The likelihood of a DO/PP continuation is chiefly influenced by the lexical syntactic property of V1 (i.e., transitivity), and appears to rely less on contextual factors. Since V1 transitivity is explicitly included as one of the corpus metrics, it is thus expected to align more closely with the DO/PP probability compared to BERT metrics, primarily reflecting transitive versus intransitive verb usage.</p><table-wrap id="sa3table3" position="float"><label>Author response table 3.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">Adjusted r<sup>2</sup>(corpora)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Adjusted r<sup>2</sup>(BERT)</th><th align="left" valign="top">F-statistic for model comparison</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">DO probability</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.28</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.06</td><td align="left" valign="top">F(1,115)=35.68, <italic>P</italic>=2.66 x 10<sup>–8</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">PP probability</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.18</td><td align="left" valign="top">–0.01</td><td align="left" valign="top">F(1,115)=28.62, <italic>P</italic>=4.54 x 10<sup>–7</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">MV probability</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.12</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.44</td><td align="left" valign="top">F(2,113)=33.21, <italic>P</italic>=4.51 x 10<sup>–12</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Actually, BERT V1 parse depth was not correlated with V1 transitivity when the sentence only unfolds to V1 (see Appendix 1-figure 6). This lack of correlation may stem from the fact that the BERT probing model was designed to represent the structure of a (partially) unfolded sentence, rather than to generate a continuation or prediction. Moreover, V1 transitivity alone does not conclusively determine the Active or Passive interpretation by the end of V1. For instance, both transitive and intransitive continuations after V1 are compatible with an Active interpretation. Consequently, the initial preference for an Active interpretation (as depicted by the early effects before V1 was recognized in Figure 6D), might be predominantly driven by the animate subject noun (SN) at the beginning of the sentence, a word order cue in languages like English (Mahowald et al. 2023).</p><p>In contrast, when assessing the probability of a MV following the PP (e.g., after “The dog found in the park ...”), BERT metrics significantly outperformed corpus metrics in terms of fitting the MV probability. Although SN thematic role preference and V1 transitivity were designed to be the primary factors constraining the structured interpretation in this experiment, we could only obtain their context-independent estimates from corpora (i.e., considering all contexts). Additionally, despite Active/Passive index (a product of these two factors) are correlated with the MV probability, it may oversimplify the task of capturing the specific context of a given sentence. Furthermore, the PP following V1 is also expected to influence the structured interpretation. For instance, whether “in the park” is a more plausible scenario for people to find a dog or for a dog to find something. Thus, this finding suggests that the corpus-based metrics are not as effective as BERT in representing contextualized structured interpretations (for a longer sentence input), which might require the integration of constraints from every word in the input.</p><p>In summary, corpus-based metrics excel in explaining human language behaviour when it primarily relies on specific lexical properties. However, they significantly lag behind BERT metrics when more complex contextual factors come into play at the same time. Regarding their performance in fitting neural data, among the four corpus-based metrics, we only observed significant model fits for the Passive index in the MV epoch when the intended structure for a Passive interpretation was finally resolved, while the other three metrics did not exhibit significant model fits in any epoch. Note that subject noun thematic role preference did fit neural data in the PP and MV epochs (Figure 8A and 8B). In contrast, the incremental BERT parse depth vector exhibited significant model fits in all three epochs we tested (i.e., V1, PP1, and MV).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To summarize, I feel that I'm not sure if the structural information BERT extracts reflect the human parsing of the sentences, especially when the known influencing factors are removed.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the results presented above and, in the manuscript, BERT metrics align closely with human structured interpretations in terms of both behavioural and neural data.
