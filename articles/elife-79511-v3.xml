and other processes. SAM is synthesized from methionine, which is imported or generated through the 1-carbon cycle (1 CC). Alterations in 1 CC function have clear effects on lifespan and stress responses, but the wide distribution of this modification has made identification of specific mechanistic links difficult. Exploiting a dynamic stress-induced transcription model, we find that two SAM synthases in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, SAMS-1 and SAMS-4<italic>,</italic> contribute differently to modification of H3K4me3, gene expression and survival. We find that <italic>sams-4</italic> enhances H3K4me3 in heat shocked animals lacking <italic>sams-1</italic>, however, <italic>sams-1</italic> cannot compensate for <italic>sams-4</italic>, which is required to survive heat stress. This suggests that the regulatory functions of SAM depend on its enzymatic source and that provisioning of SAM may be an important regulatory step linking 1 CC function to phenotypes in aging and stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>methyl donor metabolism</kwd><kwd>H3K4 methylation</kwd><kwd>heat shock</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AG053355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>Amy K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD072122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fazzio</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99CA273420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gopalan</surname><given-names>Sneha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Histone methylation patterns may differ depending on the enzymatic source of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, suggesting the biological effects of low SAM may affect methylation targets in different ways, depending on the synthase producing it.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 1-Carbon cycle (1 CC) is a group of interconnected pathways that link essential nutrients such as methionine, folate, and vitamin B12 to the production of nucleotides, glutathione, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the major methyl donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ducker and Rabinowitz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Lifespan lengthens in yeast, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and rodent models when methionine is restricted, genes in the methionine-SAM (Met-SAM) cycle are mutated, or polyamines are supplemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parkhitko et al., 2019</xref>). While multiple aspects of 1 CC function could affect aging, the Met-SAM cycle has particularly strong links. For example, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> SAM synthase, <italic>sams-1</italic>, was identified in a screen for long-lived animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2005</xref>) and multiple SAM-utilizing histone methyltransferases are also implicated as aging regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han and Brunet, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Of bioactive molecules, SAM is second only to ATP in cellular abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ye and Tu, 2018</xref>), which raises the question of how such an abundant metabolite can exert specific phenotypic effects. Strikingly, studies in multiple organisms from a variety of labs have shown that reduction in SAM levels preferentially affects H3K4me3 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mentch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shyh-Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). However, changes in SAM production may affect other histone modifications as well. For example, the Gasser lab showed that <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-3</italic> have distinct roles in heterochromatin formation, which involves H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>) A yeast SAM synthase has also been shown to act as part of the SESAME histone modification complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>) or to cooperate with the SIN3 repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Pile, 2017</xref>). In addition, most eukaryotes have more than one SAM synthase, which could allow partitioning of enzyme output by developmental stage, tissue type or cellular process and underlie specific phenotypic effects. Indeed, in budding yeast, SAM1 and SAM2 are co-expressed but regulated by different metabolic events, have distinct posttranslational modifications, and act differently in phenotypes such as genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffert et al., 2019</xref>). The two SAM synthases present in mammals are expressed in distinct tissues: MAT2A is present throughout development and in most adult tissues, whereas MAT1A is specific to adult liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maldonado et al., 2018</xref>). MAT2A may be present in distinct regulatory conformations with its partner MAT2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maldonado et al., 2018</xref>). However, the distinct molecular mechanisms impacted by these synthases are less clear. Studies exploring specificity of metazoan SAM synthase function have been difficult, as MAT1A expression decreases ex vivo and MAT2A is essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mato et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, the high methionine content of traditional cell culture media has limited functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sullivan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We have explored SAM synthase function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where the gene family has undergone an expansion. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, genetic and molecular assays allow separation of SAM synthase expression and function in vivo. Furthermore, no single SAM synthase is required for survival in normal laboratory conditions or diets. <italic>sams-1</italic> and the highly similar <italic>sams-3</italic>/<italic>sams-4</italic> are expressed in adult animals, whereas <italic>sams-5</italic> is present at low levels in adults and <italic>sams-2</italic> is a pseudogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris et al., 2020</xref>). We previously found that <italic>sams-1</italic> had multiple distinct functions, contributing to PC pools and stimulating lipid synthesis through a feedback loop involving <italic>sbp-1</italic>/SREBP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walker et al., 2011</xref>) as well as regulating global H3K4me3 levels in intestinal nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2015</xref>. Our studies also showed that loss of <italic>sams-1</italic> produced different phenotypes in bacterial or heat stress. While <italic>sams-1</italic> was necessary for pathogen challenge, promoter H3K4me3 and expression of immune genes, animals surprisingly survived better during heat shock when they lacked <italic>sams-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). Because heat shocked animals require the H3K4me3 methyltransferase <italic>set-16/MLL</italic> for survival, we hypothesized that SAM from a different source may be important for histone methylation and survival in the heat shock response. Here, we find that SAM source impacts the functional outputs of methylation. While the SAM and the 1 CC are well associated with regulation of lifespan and stress responses, direct molecular connections have been difficult to discover. Mechanisms controlling provisioning of SAM, therefore, could provide a critical level of regulation in these processes. We show that <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> differentially affect different populations of histone methylation and thus gene expression in the heat shock response, and that their loss results in opposing phenotypes. Our study demonstrates that SAM synthases have a critical impact on distinct methylation targets and phenotypes associated with the stress response. Thus, defining the specificity of SAM synthases may provide a method to identify from broad effects methylation events that are specific phenotypic drivers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> have overlapping and distinct expression patterns and gene regulatory effects</title><p>Animals respond to stress by activating specialized protective gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Nadal et al., 2011</xref>). While these programs depend on specific signaling and transcriptional activators, they may also be impacted by histone methylation and the production of SAM. For example, we found that <italic>C. elegans</italic> lacking <italic>sams-1</italic> die rapidly on pathogenic bacteria, have low global H3K4me3 and fail to upregulate immune response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, heat shocked animals survive better without <italic>sams-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>sams-1(RNAi</italic>) animals induced heat shock genes to normal levels and acquired additional changes in the transcriptome, including downregulation of many metabolic genes. However, the H3K4me3 methyltransferase <italic>set-16</italic>/MLL was essential for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that methylation was required. We hypothesized that other SAM synthases could play an important role in mediating survival during heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>In order to test these hypotheses, we first compared expression of each synthase, SAM levels and gene expression after RNAi in adult unstressed animals. ModEncode data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref> from young adult animals shows that in young adult levels, <italic>sams-1</italic> is expressed at the highest levels, comparable to the metabolic enzyme GAPDH (<italic>gpdh-1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>sams-3</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> are expressed at lower levels, but comparable to other enzymes of the 1-Carbon cycle such as <italic>metr-1</italic>, whereas <italic>sams-5</italic> is minimally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In order to determine the tissue-specific patterns of the SAM synthases expressed in adult animals, we obtained strains where each protein was tagged with RFP, GFP or mKate, via CRISPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B, C</xref>). RFP::<italic>sams-1</italic> and GFP::<italic>sams-4</italic> animals were also crossed to allow visualize expression of both synthases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). RFP::SAMS-1fluorescence was evident in much of the adult animal, including intestine, hypodermis and cells in the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), in line with mRNA expression patterns derived from tissue-specific RNA seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaletsky et al., 2018</xref>). However, RFP::SAMS-1was not present in the germline, which did express GFP::SAMS-4 and SAMS-3::mKate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). GFP::SAMS-4 and SAMS-3::mKate was also present in intestinal and hypodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), demonstrating that these tissues, which are major contributors to the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McGhee, 2007</xref>) contain each of these SAM synthases. <italic>sams-3</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> are expressed bidirectionally from the same promoter and share 95% sequence identity at the nucleotide level thus RNAi targeting is likely to affect both genes. Indeed SAMS-3::mKate and GFP::SAMS-4 were reduced after either RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we used mass spectrometry to compare SAM levels after <italic>sams-3</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> RNAi and found that like <italic>sams-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walker et al., 2011</xref>), reduction in any synthase significantly reduced but did not eliminate SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>In order to compare gene expression after RNA of each SAM synthase in basal conditions, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Principal component analysis showed that <italic>sams-1(RNAi</italic>) and <italic>sams-5</italic> formed distinct clusters on the first two principal components; however, <italic>sams-3</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> were overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: Tabs A-C).

Although <italic>sams-3</italic> may be co-targeted in RNAi experiments, we will refer solely to <italic>sams-4</italic> in our discussion because it has the most direct link to the heat shock phenotypes. Finally, <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) phenotypes in the heat stress response were not linked to a general failure to thrive, as <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) animals under basal conditions had modestly enhanced lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>: Tab A).</p><p>Next, we used immunostaining to compare global levels of H3K4me3 in <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> RNAi nuclei during heat shock.

These increases in H3K4me3 did not appear in heat shocked <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) intestinal nuclei <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, I</xref>, raising the possibility that <italic>sams-4</italic> contributed to the effects in <italic>sams-1(lof</italic>) animals.

Loss of multiple SAM synthases reduces viability in <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>. In order to circumvent this, we used dietary choline to rescue PC synthesis and growth of <italic>sams-1(RNAi</italic>) or (<italic>lof</italic>) animals during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walker et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>sams-1(lof); sams-4(RNAi</italic>) animals were raised on choline until the L4 stage, then moved to normal media for 16 hr before heat shock. Immunostaining of <italic>sams-1(lof); sams-4(RNAi</italic>) intestines showed that <italic>sams-4</italic> is required for the H3K4me3 in heat shocked <italic>sams-1(lof</italic>) nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and J</xref>).

We also asked if <italic>sams-4</italic> was necessary for the increased survival of <italic>sams-1</italic> animals after heat shock and found that the survival advantage in <italic>sams-1(RNAi</italic>) was decreased in <italic>sams-4(ok3315</italic>) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3E</xref>). These results suggest that H3K4me3 may be remodeled during heat shock with SAM from distinct synthases and that <italic>sams-4</italic>-dependent methylation is critical for survival. Previously, it was shown that H3K4me3 deposition is independent <italic>of sams-4</italic> in embryonic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>), however, our finding that it is broadly decreased in <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) intestinal nuclei suggests it may have important roles in H3K4 methylation in adults.</p><p>Increases in H3K4me3 have also been shown to occur in budding yeast when blocks in phospholipid synthesis relieve a drain on SAM and increase levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ye et al., 2017</xref>), which we have confirmed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2018</xref>). In order to determine if SAM levels could explain differences in H3K4me3 in <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> animals during heat shock, we used targeted LC/MS to compare SAM, itâs precursor methionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the product after methyl transfer, before and after heat shock. As in our previous assays, SAM decreased significantly after <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) in basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3F</xref>), whereas SAM levels increased in each population as <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic> animals were shifted to 37 Â°C for 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3F</xref>).

The increase in SAM in heat-shocked animals is consistent with our data showing the contribution of SAMS-4 to H3K4me3 and survival in heat-shocked <italic>sams-1</italic> animals; however, a reduction in demand for SAM if other metabolic processes are reduced after heat shock could also contribute. Finally, levels of SAM in heat-shocked <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) animals also rise to levels comparable to control animals at basal temperatures; however, H3K4me3 remains low in these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Histone methyltransferase and histone demethylation machinery have modest, separable effects on <italic>sams</italic> mutant heat shock phenotypes</title><p>SAM is necessary for histone methylation; however, histone methylation dynamics are also influenced by methyltransferase (KMT) or demethylase (KDMT) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>).

In order to identify loci that might link H3K4me3 to these phenotypes, we used CUT&amp;Tag, (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, C&amp;T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaya-Okur et al., 2019</xref>), to determine genome-wide H3K4me3 levels in Control RNAi, <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) in basal (15 Â°C) and after heat shock (37 Â°C/2 hr) from two biologically independent replicates along with no antibody controls.

Around 20â30% of peaks were specific to at either at basal (15 Â°C) vs. heat shock (37 Â°C) temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that H3K4me3 could be remodeled upon heat shock in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. TSS enrichment of H3K4me3 was sharply reduced in both <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> samples at 15 Â°C; however, this difference was less marked in heat-shocked animals, in line with lower TSS localization in Control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). While aggregate TSS enrichment for H3K4me3 was similar for <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> RNAi animals, this analysis could miss distinct sets of H3K4me3 marked genes in each condition. Indeed, Control, <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) animals each showed 500â1000 specific peaks in basal conditions, with moderate increases in these numbers after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). As H3K4me3 is a widely occurring modification, we hypothesized that we might better understand potential SAM synthase-specific requirements if we focused on peaks that change in the Control RNAi heat shock response and asked how they are affected by loss of <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic>. We used two different methods for comparing potential SAM synthase requirements for H3K4me3 in the heat shock response. First, we used differential peak calling ChIPPeakAnno <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu et al., 2010</xref> followed by WormCat category enrichment to determine the classes of genes which might be affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2AâF</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>; Tabs G-I). Peaks present in both basal and heat shocked conditions were enriched for genes in the METABOLISM category (including Lipid: phospholipid, sphingolipid, sterol and lipid binding, along with mitochondrial genes) as well as in core function categories such as those involved in trafficking, DNA or mRNA functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2DâE</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>: Tabs G-I). There was no significant category enrichment specific to 15 Â°C animals, but after heat shock, Control RNAi animals gain enrichment in peaks at the Category 1 level in PROTEOSOME PROTEOLYSIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This enrichment was driven by increases in H3K4me3 at E3: Fbox genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>:Tab A,B), which could be important for eliminating mis-folded proteins during heat shock. Comparison of peaks differentially present in <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> RNAi animals showed that only <italic>sams-1(RNAi</italic>) exhibited a similar enrichment to Control RNAi in the PROTEOLYSIS PROTEOSOME category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C, D</xref>), which could help explain the reduced survival of <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) animals relative to <italic>sams-1(RNAi</italic>) animals. <italic>sams-1</italic> RNAi animals also gained enriched peaks in a wide range of gene categories within METABOLISM, whereas <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) enriched peaks in these categories were more limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2CâF</xref>). Thus, loss of <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic> differentially affects H3K4me3 peaks within functional gene classes that also change in the heat shock response.</p><p>Next, we hypothesized that H3K4me3 at peaks in Control RNAi animals might reflect multiple differently regulated populations, some which are linked to SAM synthase function and others that are regulated at other levels. In order to test this, we divided peaks in Control animals at 15 Â°C or 37 Â°C into those that did not change after SAM synthase RNAi (<italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic> independent peaks) or those that were dependent on <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic> and examined aggregations around TSS regions. There was little difference between TSS plots of <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic>-independent genes at either temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H1</xref>). However, in basal conditions, Control peaks that depended on <italic>sams-1</italic> had more marked TSS localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic> dependent peaks have distinct TSS architectures. TSS localization was low in all 37 Â°C samples, following the general trend of decrease after heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). We next separated Control peaks into those that were generally SAM synthase-dependent and those that were specific to loss of <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic>. Aggregation of these peaks shows that peaks in Control 15 Â°C samples that were lost only in <italic>sams-4</italic> RNAi also had the lowest levels of H3K4me3 in TSS regions, whereas promoters that lost this modification only after <italic>sams-1</italic> RNAi had higher levels of H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2G</xref>). Control 37 Â°C samples exhibited a similar pattern, with a lower H3K4me3 level overall consistent with what we have observed in heat shock samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2H</xref>). Thus, genome wide H3K4me3 contain multiple populations with distinct TSS patterns. Peaks that are present even when <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic> are depleted have the highest levels, whereas <italic>sams-1</italic>-dependent peaks have moderate H3K4me3, and peaks that are lost after <italic>sams-4</italic> RNAi have the lowest levels. Taken together, this shows that individual SAM synthases are linked to distinct sets of H3K4me3 within the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RNAi of <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic> has similar effects on TSS peaks at tissue-specific genes</title><p>Our C&amp;T and RNA seq assays were performed on whole animals.

However, embryo production and development appear broadly normal in <italic>sams-4</italic> RNAi embryos (not shown). In order to determine how H3K4me3 might align with tissue-specific expression patterns, we aggregated peaks from tissue-specific RNA seq data published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Serizay et al., 2020</xref>. Serizay et al. separated nuclei based on tissue specific GFP expression and defined gene sets that were expressed that were ubiquitously, as well as those that were present only in a single tissue.

Therefore, we next focused on genes normally upregulated during heat shock and divided them according to SAM synthase dependence. Strikingly, isolating the <italic>sams-1</italic>-dependent genes revealed a strong peak 5â to the TSS, which was not evident in the larger subset of Control or <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>)-dependent upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>).

Use of ATP, AcetylCoA or SAM for phosphorylation, acetylation or methylation of histones is tightly regulated and many studies have focused on control of enzymes or enzyme-containing complexes. Acetylation and methylation may also be regulated by metabolite levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsieh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wellen et al., 2009</xref>). This allows the chromatin environment to sense and respond to changes in key metabolic pathways. However, effects of methylation on chromatin are multifaceted: DNA and H3K9me9 have strong repressive effects, whereas other modifications such as H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 are associated with active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>). These marks, especially H3K4me3, are most sensitive to SAM levels, most likely due to the kinetics of the H3K4me3 MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mentch and Locasale, 2016</xref>). SAM is an abundant metabolite that contributes to multiple biosynthetic pathways in addition to acting as the major donor for histone, DNA and RNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>). Reduction in SAM levels has major phenotypic consequences in animals, altering lipid levels in murine liver and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2001</xref>), altering differentiation potential in iPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shyh-Chang et al., 2013</xref>) and changing stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, 1 CC has been identified as a causal regulator of aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annibal et al., 2021</xref> and is important in cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sullivan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). However, the abundance of SAM and its targets have made it difficult to connect changes in methylation to molecular pathways regulating these physiological effects. In addition, studying effects of SAM is difficult in culture because SAM itself is labile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun and Locasale, 2022</xref>) and tissue culture media is replete with 1 CC metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sullivan et al., 2021</xref>). Important insights have been made into the impact of SAM on the breadth of H3K4me3 peaks using methionine depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mentch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2018</xref>); however, this approach could affect other pathways. In this study, we have taken the approach of limiting SAM synthase expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, then using genetic and molecular approaches to link methylation-dependent pathways to changes in stress responses. We found that individual SAM synthases could have distinct effects even on a single methylation target such as H3K4me3. This observation not only shows that examining how SAM is produced within the cells allows differentiation of phenotypic effects, but also supports the striking notion of âwhereâ SAM comes from affects its functional output. While mammalian cells express either one of two SAM synthases, MAT2A, which is present in non-liver cells, may be present in multiple regulatory isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murray et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the isoform-specific production and functional targets for SAM synthases we uncover could also be important in mammals. Hints of this exist in other cellular systems â 1 CC enzymes, for example, have been associated with chromatin modifying complex in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>) and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greco et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>H3K4me3 is clearly an important link between SAM levels, aging and stress phenotypes, as loss or reduction of H3K4 MT function phenocopy aspects of SAM depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2018</xref>). However, this modification is also wide-spread, and transcription may occur even when this mark is not present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">HÃ¶dl and Basler, 2012</xref>). By studying acute changes in gene expression during heat stress response in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we have found that H3K4me3 populations can also be separated based on SAM synthase requirements. The importance of H3K4me3 during heat shock is also reflected in the interactions between the SAM synthases and the KMTs/KDMTs as lowering levels of <italic>set-2</italic> or <italic>set-16</italic> increase survival. This suggests that the context of low SAM from SAMS-1, reducing H3K4me3 can have additional benefits. Future studies identifying genomic targets of H3K4me3 KMTs together with SAM synthases may be important for untangling these effects.</p><p>SAM synthase-specific effects may also vary according to the biological context, as loss of <italic>sams-1</italic> improves the ability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to survive heat stress, while limiting its ability to withstand bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2018</xref>). Our previous studies showed that the induction of bacterial pathogen induced genes was limited in the absence of <italic>sams-1</italic>, however, in this study, we find links between <italic>sams-1</italic>-dependent genes in basal conditions and effects on survival after heat shock. Thus, the altered methylation landscape in <italic>sams-1</italic> animals provides a context favorable to extended lifespan and survival in heat stress but which limits other stress responsive genes. This context may depend on systems level effects and not on a single âtargetâ gene, as our analysis of genes that lose peaks in <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>) animals have modest effects, but do not recapitulate the entire phenotype. It is also possible that there are genes or specific modules that drive enhanced survival in <italic>sams-1</italic> animal or responsible for viability after loss of <italic>sams-4(RNAi</italic>). Our approach dividing peaks into groups based on responsiveness to <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic> demonstrates the importance of identifying specific populations of H3K4me3; combining <italic>set-2</italic> or <italic>set-16</italic> sensitive loci may provide the resolution to identify these loci in future studies. Manipulation of the 1 CC is of interest as a modulator of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annibal et al., 2021</xref>) and affects multiple biological processes. Our studies demonstrate that lowering SAM, or reducing levels of a key methylation target such as H3K4me3, does not represent a single biological state and that it is important to consider that effects may depend on synthase-specific regulation or context. Future identification of these regulators will provide the mechanistic details key to understanding the role of the 1 CC in aging and stress.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>The genetic tools used in our study provide a method to reduce SAM from a specific enzymatic source. However, the roles for SAM in the cell are broad and can affect methylation of multiple targets. While our metabolomics assays show that SAM increases in heat shocked <italic>sams-1(RNAi</italic>) animals, we have not demonstrated that this SAM is derived from <italic>sams-4</italic>. In addition, survival benefits after heat shock occur across broad cellular functions including proteostasis and other methylation marks such as H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Das et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, there may be multiple additional methylation-dependent mechanisms that influence survival of <italic>sams-1</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic> animals during heat shock. In addition, we measured gene expression and H3K4me3 at 2 hr post heat shock, whereas the survival assay occurs over multiple days. Thus, there may be changes in gene expression or histone modifications occurring at later times that also affect survival.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>sams-1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wormbase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WBGene00008205</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>sams-4</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wormbase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WBRNAi00010322</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>set-2</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wormbase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WBGene00004782</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>set-16</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wormbase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WBGene00011729</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rbr-2</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wormbase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WBGene00004319</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>spr-5</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wormbase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WBRNAi00004611</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>lsd-1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wormbase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WBGene00011615</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Centre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild type</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>sams-1(ok3033)</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HA1975</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sams-1(ok3033) X</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>sams-4(ok3315)</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RB2420</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C06E7.3(ok3315) IV</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rfp::sams-1(ker5); sams-1(ok3033)</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WAL500</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WAL500.

External mass calibration was performed using the standard calibration mixture every 7 days. Dried extracts were reconstituted in enough water to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 Î¼g/ml protein per sample. Two Î¼L of this resuspended sample were injected onto a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC 150x2.1 mm analytical column equipped with a 2.1x20 mm guard column (both 5 mm particle size; Millipore Sigma). Buffer A was 20 mM ammonium carbonate, 0.1% ammonium hydroxide; Buffer B was acetonitrile. The autosampler tray was held at 4Â°C.

At the end of the heat stress, animals were washed off the plates with S-basal, then pellets frozen at â80 Â°C. Worm pellets were washed with S-Basal to remove bacteria, then resuspended in 750 Î¼L of chilled Nuclei Purification Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH = 7.5, 40 mM NaCl, 90 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.1% tween 20, and cOmplete proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). The suspension was then transferred to Potter-Elvehjem Tissue Grinder (3 mL). The worms were ground with 2â3 cycles consisting of ~45â50 strokes of the grinder. The samples were chilled on ice for ~5 min between consecutive cycles. The lysates were passed through 100 micron filter (X3) followed by 40 micron (X3) (Pluriselect). The lysates were then centrifuged at 4500 RPM for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The pellets were resuspended gently in wash buffer (1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 5 M NaCl, 2 M spermidine). Concanavalin bead slurry (10 Î¼L/sample) was added gently to the samples and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 15 min in an end-over-end rotator. The sample tubes were then transferred to a magnetic stand and liquid was gently removed.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please also refer to the full reviewers' comments for suggestions and questions regarding the interpretation of the results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) SAM levels were only measured in sams-4(RNAi), presumably not under the heat shock condition (which should be clearly stated in the manuscript). How were SAM levels altered by heat shock and the SAM synthetase mutants? The authors should thoroughly determine SAM levels in wild type, sams<sup>-1</sup>(lof), sams-4(RNAi), and sams1(lof)sams-4(RNAi) over their heat shock assay (e.g. before, during, and after the heat shock).</p><p>2) What is the survival phenotype for sams1(lof)sams-4(RNAi) to heat shock?</p><p>3) The authors make the point that sams-4 RNAi can also target sams-3, but for the most part, this is not addressed in the interpretation of the results of sams-4 RNAi data. It would be helpful for the authors to establish more firmly that the major target of sams-4 RNAi is really sams-4, not sams-3. The reviewers make several suggestions about possible experiments to do this but the authors may alternatively wish to address this point in a different fashion.</p><p>4) The authors report that gene expression changes are different for KD of sams<sup>-1</sup> and sams-4. A useful way to show such a differential effect would be a PCA of RNAseq count data comparing control, sams<sup>-1</sup>, and sams-4 (with separate repeats) in the same figure. Such a figure would allow a comparison of the changes and location relative to dispersion of global gene expression in response to KD of SAMS.</p><p>5) The authors demonstrate that peaks for fbxa-59 and T27F6.8 are still impacted by heat stress in sams<sup>-1</sup> but not in sams-4 RNAi animals and these targets are also differentially expressed. It would be interesting to confirm (RNAi?) if induction of either of these two genes is required e.g. for survival following heat shock?</p><p>6) Additional quality control analysis should be presented. E.g. H3K4me3 data should be compared with published ChIP-seq data. Also, if replicates were performed, the correlation between the replicates should be presented.</p><p>7) The reviewers noted favorably that the paper describes one of the first adaptations of CUT&amp;TAG in <italic>C. elegans</italic> but also noted a lack of experimental detail making it difficult to fully evaluate the CUT&amp;TAG data. The reviewers suggested a number of additions and controls in this context. Please address the points below:</p><p>a.

In particular, the authors show the heat stress phenotype of sam-4 mutants and make a note on page 9, line 168 that &quot;sams-4 depletion is the primary basis of the heat shock phenotypes and validate use of this RNAi strain to examine sams-4 function&quot;. However, the data for sams-4 RNAi is not shown for the heat shock phenotype, only the sams-4 mutant. It will be important for the authors to show both sams-4 RNAi and mutant data with a comparable phenotype in order to conclude that the two can be used interchangeably. Similarly, it would be helpful for the authors to include a heat shock assay of sams-3 RNAi alone so readers can assess whether sams-3 might really contribute to the heat shock phenotype or not. Since the authors at several times point out that the difference between sams<sup>-1</sup> and sams-4 individual proteins is of interest, it would be helpful for the authors to establish more firmly that the major target of sams-4 RNAi is really sams-4, not sams-3.</p><p>2) The results of the heat stress survival assays in Figure S2 are puzzling, especially taken together with the immunostaining experiments in Figure S2 B-E. Since the loss of set-2 and set-16 increases the survival of both sams<sup>-1</sup> and sams-4 mutants which have opposite heat stress survival phenotypes and opposite intestinal H3K4me3 staining phenotypes, it would almost seem more likely that the heat stress survival phenotype could be unrelated to H3K4me3. The authors should at a minimum discuss their interpretation of these results further in the text. Similarly, it is puzzling that neither set-2 or set-16 RNAi caused a decrease in H3K4me3 staining in sams<sup>-1</sup> mutants under heat stress at all. If the authors mean to suggest that the enzymes can compensate for each other, it would be helpful to show a double RNAi of set-2 and set-16 and add some explanation in the text. Given that sams<sup>-1</sup> mutants lack H3K4me3 in intestinal cells at 15C but gain it at 37C, they should require an H3K4 trimethylase enzyme, so if this is not the case, the authors will need to explain what they think the results indicate in more detail. Adding immunostaining experiments of sams-4 mutant could be helpful to interpret the overall results.</p><p>3) Overall, the results data from some of the experiments/methods (especially immunostaining, heat stress survival, and CUT&amp;TAG) do not always fit well together. The authors chose excellent experiments to perform and did well to not over-interpret their results to try to force the results experiments to fit together, however, the end of each Results section and the discussion would benefit from increased discussion to reconcile the results together. For instance, pointing out that the results are unexpected but discussing possible reasons for the results would be beneficial for readers to understand the authors' interpretation of the results.</p><p>4) In general, the methods section needs to be more detailed. This is true for most sections, but details need to be added particularly for the CUT&amp;TAG section, since the lack of detail here makes it difficult to interpret the data, and since CUT&amp;TAG has rarely been used in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and it is unclear whether the authors performed any biological replicates for the CUT&amp;TAG analysis. The following details in specific should be added:</p><p>CUT&amp;TAG:</p><p>Method of cell dissociation.</p><p>Antibody used for H3K4me3? (same as immunofluorescence?)</p><p>Any internal controls? IgG, H3, etc.?</p><p>Replicates?</p><p>What modifications were made to the Henik<sub>off</sub> Lab CUT&amp;TAG protocol?</p><p>Method of library preparation for CUT&amp;TAG?</p><p>What kind of peaks were called? Narrow? Broad? Combined?</p><p>Were true differential peaks called? I.e. peaks with a significant difference according to a statistical software in group A vs B? If so, include significance cutoffs and more details. If not, rephrase &quot;differential peaks&quot;.</p><p>How are the CUT&amp;TAG data that are displayed normalized? To library size?</p><p>How were peaks annotated to genes?</p><p>What is being displayed on the y axis of all metaplots centered around the TSS? (e.g. Figure 2B)</p><p>How is the overlapping peak analysis done (i.e. how many basepairs must overlap to indicate an overlap of peaks?).</p><p>Other sections that need expansion.</p><p>Method or company used for creating CRISPR-tagged strains.</p><p>RNAi (method of making RNAi plates and growing bacteria, how much IPTG was used, etc.).</p><p>Lifespan methods and temperature of lifespan experiment.</p><p>RNA-seq (generation of heatmaps, etc.).</p><p>Immunofluorescence (add DAPI).</p><p>Methods for wormcat analysis.</p><p>Methods for mass spec.</p><p>Methods section that needs removal.</p><p>qPCR methods â no qPCR data are shown.</p><p>5) Additional quality control analysis should be presented. E.g. H3K4me3 data should be compared with published ChIP-seq data. Also, if replicates were performed, the correlation between the replicates should be presented.</p><p>6) The author identified a few factors (fbxa-59, T27F6.8, nhr-68) that showed both distinct H3K4me3 peaks and differential RNA expression between sams<sup>-1</sup> and sams-4 mutants. The authors should test whether these factors could affect the physiological phenotypes (heat stress survival and H3K4me3 deposition in intestinal nuclei before and after heat shock).</p><p>7) Examining H3K4me3 levels only at TSS site may miss the potential difference between sams<sup>-1</sup> and sams-4 that occurred at other genomic regions which may provide important information to address the differential heat shock survival phenotypes. This is particularly true for sams-4 dependent peaks (for example, Figure 2J), which showed a decrease in signal at the TSS. It is possible that sams-4 dependent peaks could be present in regions other than the TSS, and repeating the peak distribution analysis (as in Figure 2A) for these subsets of peaks could result in important insight about those peaks which show less TSS enrichment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is unclear how SAMS<sup>-1</sup> and SAMS-4 differently affect the enrichment patterns of H3K4me3 during the heat stress response. Several key questions remain unresolved. First, SAM levels were only measured in sams-4(RNAi), presumably not under the heat shock condition (which should be clearly stated in the manuscript). How were SAM levels altered by heat shock and the SAM synthetase mutants? The authors should thoroughly determine SAM levels in wild type, sams<sup>-1</sup>(lof), sams-4(RNAi), and sams1(lof)sams-4(RNAi) over their heat shock assay (e.g. before, during, and after the heat shock). These results will be crucial for understanding whether SAM availability restricts H3K4 methylation under their experimental setting. Second, the author should test whether the response of H3K4me3 decrease was primary to SAM provision, but not due to a secondary effect like a result of the H3 deposition defect. H3 CUT&amp;tag should be done as a control. Last, the author should explain why two SAM synthetases affect H3K4me3 differently? One of the enzymes might form a complex as found in yeasts? Or having distinct compartmentalized cellular localizations? Experiments addressing this point will be nice, but at least discussions should be expanded on this.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>What is the survival phenotype for sams1(lof)sams-4(RNAi) to heat shock?</p><p>Describe how the absolute concentration of SAM was determined in the method.</p><p>Figure S2G-J. I found the epistasis analysis a bit confusing and very inconclusive. If the survival defect of sams-4(RNAi) was due to SAM provision deficiency for H3K4me3, particularly for a subpopulation of H3K4me3 installed by a SAM-sensitive methyltransferase (MTase), deletion of that MTase will likely cause a similar survival defect. This is seen in the set-16(RNAi) mutant. Isn't this suggesting SET-16 being a SAM-sensitive MTase functionally important in the heat shock response? Further, I would think that SAM produced from SAMS<sup>-1</sup> or SAMS-4 has broader usage in addition to histone methylation. It was thus unsurprising that the survival phenotype was worst in sams-4(RNAi).</p><p>It is not convincing that H3K4me3 alterations under heat shock were a direct response to the loss of SAMS-4. In addition to determining SAM levels as mentioned above, how about other modifications, and how H3K4me3 was temporally altered during this heat shock process?</p><p>For the pathways and genes that were differentially affected by sams<sup>-1</sup>(RNAi) and sams-4(RNAi), how did they functionally affect the heat shock response? None of these was tested or validated in this study.</p><p>Pg. 11, Line 208, missing a reference or a figure callout.</p><p>Pg. 12, Line 241, the figure callout here, Figure 2B, was not right.</p><p>Pg. 13, Line 255, missing a figure callout.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The method section appears somewhat light on detail in places:</p><p>a. As somebody who does not extensively work in this area, I found some of the technical aspects hard to follow and even harder to evaluate. Some more in-depth descriptions of the novel methods, e.g. the CUT&amp;TAG approach, potentially with a supplementary diagram and validation data would make this aspect easier to understand â and certainly evaluate â for a wider audience.</p><p>b. Given that key conclusions and claims are based on sophisticated bioinformatics analysis, it would be important that all raw data is made available in a format that would allow others to replicate the full analysis. Scripts and parameter files should also be made available for the same reason.</p><p>c. Some additional information regarding software and tools would be welcome. e.g. what tools/packages were used for each of the statistical analyses and visualization of data and to generate final figures?</p><p>2) The authors report that gene expression changes are different for KD of sams<sup>-1</sup> and sams-4. A useful way to show such a differential effect would be a PCA of RNAseq count data comparing control, sams<sup>-1</sup> and sams-4 (with separate repeats) in the same figure. Such a figure would allow a comparison of the changes and location relative to dispersion of global gene expression in response to KD of SAMS.</p><p>3) How did total levels of SAM change with each of the interventions (KD, mutation of either SAMS?). It would be helpful to have an idea of how dependent the SAM pool is on these enzymes.</p><p>4) The authors demonstrate that peaks for fbxa-59 and T27F6.8 are still impacted by heat stress in sams<sup>-1</sup> but not in sams-4 RNAi animals and these targets are also differentially expressed. I was excited to see the analysis of downstream targets pinpointing some specific targets. It would be interesting to confirm if induction of either of these two genes are required e.g. for survival following heat shock? Even if the impact of these targets was limited, such data would still be valuable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79511.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) SAM levels were only measured in sams-4(RNAi), presumably not under the heat shock condition (which should be clearly stated in the manuscript).

First, we asked if heat shock phenotypes were specific to <italic>sams-3</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic>. Using deletion alleles, we established that <italic>sams-4(ok3315)</italic> and not <italic>sams-3(2932)</italic> was required for survival after heat shock. Furthermore, the IF experiments described above, measuring H3K4me3 levels in <italic>sams<sup>-1</sup>(RNAi) sams-4(ok3315)</italic> animals demonstrate that loss of <italic>sams-4</italic> is sufficient to drive the phenotype. However, differences in growth timing of <italic>sams-1(lof)</italic> and wild type animals make it less desirable to use for large scale assays such as RNAseq or the Cut&amp;Tag assays. Therefore, we also sought to clarify co-targeting effects of <italic>sams-4</italic> RNAi to more accurately describe these assays. We used either RNAi to <italic>sams-3</italic> or <italic>sams-4</italic> to determine knockdown of endogenously tagged <italic>sams-3</italic>::mKate or <italic>sams-4</italic>::GFP animals (Figure 1 âfigure supplement1C) and noted that while RNAi to <italic>sams-3</italic> appeared to affect <italic>sams-3</italic>::mKate and <italic>sams-4</italic>::GFP at similar, robust levels, RNAi to <italic>sams-4</italic> had a greater effect on <italic>sams-4</italic>::GFP, although there were partial effects on <italic>sams-3</italic>::mKate (Figure 1 âfigure supplement1C).

We also appreciate the reviewerâs understanding that the strength of our study lies in the demonstration of genome-wide distinctions in <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>sams-4</italic>dependent H3K4me3 patterns and that phenotypes such as survival after heat shock may require multiple genes. We picked three genes with altered H3K4me3 peaks to test for effects on survival. First, as the reviewerâs suggested, we compared <italic>fbxa-59</italic> and T27F6.8 RNAi to control and found a slight, but statistically significant effect limiting survival with <italic>fbxa-59</italic>, suggesting it could be part of a broader program (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C). We found no effects after RNAi of T27F6.8 (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B). (Although it is preferred to name <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes discussed in publications, we did not request a name for T27F6.8, as it did not produce a phenotype.) Second, we noted that H3K4me3 peaks for <italic>nhr-68</italic> were lower in <italic>sams-1</italic> animals in basal conditions and that its expression was reduced after heat shock. We hypothesized that expression from an autologous promoter refractory to <italic>sams-1</italic> dependent effects on H3K4me3 might change survival. We obtained strain expressing <italic>nhr-68</italic> from a <italic>ges-1</italic> promoter from the Walhout lab (Blucha, et al. Cell Reports 2019). <italic>ges-1</italic> is expressed specifically in the intestine, and we noted no changes in H3K4me3 on its promoter (Figure 6 âfigure supplement 1A). Expression of <italic>nhr-68</italic> from an H3K4me3-indepent promoter diminished survival after heat shock, suggesting its regulation may be an important part of the pro-survival program (Fig6E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Additional quality control analysis should be presented.

Please indicate internal controls? IgG, H3, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>Cut&amp;Tag depends on antibody binding and localization of the transposase to release DNA for library production and sequencing. H3 controls may be less informative as cutting would occur at every histone. Therefore, we used a sample with no antibody as a control. Our library sizes for samples with H3K4me3 antibodies ranged from 5x10<sup>4</sup> to 7x10<sup>5</sup>. No antibody libraries ranged from 1x10<sup>3</sup>-1x10<sup>4</sup>, providing very low reads as expected for an internal negative control. We have added a browser track showing the no antibody control for <italic>pcaf-1</italic>, a positive control for promoter localized H3K4me3 used previously by our lab (Ding, et al. Cell Metab 2015) and others (Xiao, et al. PNAS 2011) as Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e.
