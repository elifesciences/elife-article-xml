parasites. During development in the sand fly vector, the eukaryotic parasite <italic>Leishmania</italic> adheres to the stomodeal valve, as the specialised haptomonad form. Dissection of haptomonad adhesion is a critical step for understanding the complete life cycle of <italic>Leishmania</italic>. Nevertheless, haptomonad studies are limited, as this is a technically challenging life cycle form to investigate. Here, we have combined three-dimensional electron microscopy approaches, including serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) and serial tomography to dissect the organisation and architecture of haptomonads in the sand fly. We showed that the attachment plaque contains distinct structural elements. Using time-lapse light microscopy of in vitro haptomonad-like cells, we identified five stages of haptomonad-like cell differentiation, and showed that calcium is necessary for <italic>Leishmania</italic> adhesion to the surface in vitro. This study provides the structural and regulatory foundations of <italic>Leishmania</italic> adhesion<italic>,</italic> which are critical for a holistic understanding of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> life cycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Leishmania</kwd><kwd>sand fly</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>serial block face scanning electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>serial section electron microscopy tomography</kwd><kwd>host-parasite interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yanase</surname><given-names>Ryuji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006324</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Basic Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20-515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yanase</surname><given-names>Ryuji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Infravec2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Volf</surname><given-names>Petr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>221944/Z20/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sunter</surname><given-names>Jack D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008530</institution-id><institution>European Regional Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CeRaViP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Volf</surname><given-names>Petr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GACR 21-15700S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Volf</surname><given-names>Petr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

It has especially been employed as a strategy for escape from host defences and for vector transmission to the host by pathogens including many eukaryotic unicellular parasites such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, <italic>Giardia</italic> and the kinetoplastids, including <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp., <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, and <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beattie and Gull, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dvorak et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friend, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Killick-Kendrick et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tetley and Vickerman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood, 1990</xref>). For example, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> constructs knobs for attachment to host tissues to avoid clearance. Knobs are organised multi-protein structural complexes with specificity defined by the PfEMP1 variant expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p><italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. are flagellated eukaryotic parasites that cause leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease with a range of different pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burza et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Leishmania</italic> has a complex life cycle with multiple developmental forms as it cycles between a sand fly vector and a mammalian host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sunter and Gull, 2017</xref>). During parasite development in the sand fly, the parasite adheres to and colonises the stomodeal valve at the anterior end of the midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dostálová and Volf, 2012</xref>). The attached form is called the haptomonad and is characterised by a reduced flagellum with an enlarged flagellar tip that contains a complex and poorly characterised set of cytoskeletal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Killick-Kendrick et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Killick-Kendrick et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Molyneux et al., 1975</xref>). These structures including the attachment plaque at the membrane-substrate interface form a strong connection between the parasite and the underlying cuticle of the stomodeal valve. The role of the haptomonad form is not fully understood but it is likely required to maintain a persistent infection in the sand fly vector, and contributes to the destruction and obstruction of the stomodeal valve by the secretion of chitinase and the formation of the gel-like plug and the haptomonad parasite sphere. These facilitate reflux and the transmission of parasites during the feeding on the vertebrate host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bates, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hall et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rogers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Serafim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Volf et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Haptomonads form a dense, multi-layered complex on the sand fly stomodeal valve.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of the sand fly digestive tract highlighting the position of the stomodeal valve, the site of differentiation of free-swimming <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes into haptomonads, which attach to the stomodeal valve surface via a shortened and expanded flagellum (Right black box).

Hemidesmosomes are formed by a set of transmembrane proteins (integrins and BP180), which connect the extracellular basal lamina to intracellular adaptor proteins (Plectin and BP230) that bind to intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borradori and Sonnenberg, 1999</xref>). The assembly mechanism of the related desmosome, which connects two adjacent cells, requires calcium; the removal of calcium results in the detachment of connected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garrod and Chidgey, 2008</xref>). However, desmosomes are able to reversibly switch to a hyper-adhesive state, which is more stable and remains assembled even when calcium is removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garrod et al., 2005</xref>). Previous studies suggest that trypanosomatid attachment in vitro is resistant to divalent cation depletion and it is strengthened, rather than weakened, by the removal of divalent cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hendry, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molyneux et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood, 1990</xref>).

Previous haptomonad analysis has been restricted to thin-section TEM of <italic>L. mexicana</italic> infected sand flies and in-vitro-derived haptomonad-like cells attached to surfaces, with haptomonads being defined by their morphology and the formation of an attachment plaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Killick-Kendrick et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Killick-Kendrick et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Molyneux et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wakid and Bates, 2004</xref>). In this study, we refer to in vitro generated attached cells that morphologically resemble in vivo haptomonads, have a short and wide cell body, and attaches to substrates through the flagellum with an attachment plaque as in vitro haptomonad-like cells. While those 2D TEM images in the previous studies afforded a basic description of the cytoskeletal architecture of the attachment plaque, they provided limited information on the 3D architecture of the flagellar pocket and flagellum at the attachment region, and on the relationship between individual haptomonads in the stomodeal valve.</p><p>Here, we have combined powerful 3D electron microscopy (volume EM - vEM) approaches to image haptomonad forms in the sand fly, enabling us to synthesise a unified view of <italic>Leishmania</italic> adhesion in the vector. Our data allowed us to describe the intracellular attachment architecture in unprecedented detail, while placing this architecture in the context of spatial organisation of haptomonad populations. Using time-lapse microscopy, we observed the adhesion process of in vitro haptomonad-like cells and determined that in vitro <italic>Leishmania</italic> adhesion occurs through a defined series of steps. Finally, we showed that calcium is necessary for in vitro adhesion.

At this stage, there was a dense infection around the stomodeal valve, with many haptomonads attached to the cuticle surface (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Around the stomodeal valve, the haptomonads were present on both sides, in a series of layers relative to the cuticle surface, with some cells very close to the surface and others further away; the flagellum length varied according to the distance to the surface (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—video 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In SBFSEM images, the attachment plaque within the flagellum appeared as an electron-dense layer overlaying the flagellar membrane and the flagellum of haptomonads attached exclusively to the cuticle surface, and no connections were observed between adjacent cells or flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Attached cells had a shorter and wider cell body (Average length = 8.7 ± 1.6 μm (s.d.); average width = 2.2 ± 0.6 μm (s.d.), n=50) compared to unattached cells (Average length = 10.5 ± 2.6 μm (s.d.); average width = 1.2 ± 0.4 μm (s.d.), n=39; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The majority (83/100) of cells were attached via a connection at the distal tip of the flagellum, with the rest (17/100) connected laterally through the side of the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In unattached cells, the microtubule axoneme extended to the tip of the flagellum (Average axoneme length = 14.2 ± 4.6 μm (s.d.), n=39), whereas in attached cells with a flagellar tip attachment, the axoneme only just extended beyond the end of the cell body (Average axoneme length = 3.3 ± 1.0 μm (s.d.), n=50), regardless of the length of the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Those attached cells with a relatively long flagellum and shortened axoneme may have completed differentiation into the haptomonad form, but due to the high cell density at the stomodeal valve, there may be insufficient space to allow them to fully disassemble their flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and F</xref>). In the cells with the laterally attached flagellum, the axoneme extended further along the flagellum (Average axoneme length = 10.0 ± 6.2 μm (s.d.), n=17) and their cell body length and width were intermediate between attached cells with a flagellar tip attachment and unattached cells (Average length = 9.1 ± 1.9 μm (s.d.); average width = 1.6 ± 0.4 μm (s.d.), n=17), suggesting that these parasites may be in the process of differentiating to or away from the haptomonad form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Most of unattached cells and cells with a laterally attached flagella had a metacyclic/leptomonad morphology, which is consistent with previous reports of the cell type in the sand fly cardia at late stages of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>We took advantage of the large numbers of cells visualised by our SBFSEM approach to determine the replication status of the cells. We examined over 1000 cells from two different stomodeal valves and defined those cells with either one or two nuclei and two dividing flagella as dividing (1N2F or 2N2F; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">Figure 1—video 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The vast majority of haptomonads were non-dividing with one nucleus and one flagellum (1N1F), matching previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gossage et al., 2003</xref>; however, we identified a small number of dividing (1N2F or 2N2F) haptomonad forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In those dividing cells with a long new flagellum, both the old and the new flagella were attached to the cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), but in dividing cells with a short new flagellum only the old flagellum was attached. In addition to the dividing and non-dividing cells, we identified four cells with either three nuclei or two nuclei and only one flagellum (≥2N1 F), which are likely abnormal, though they may represent rare examples of cell fusion events or gamete production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, we found a small number of haptomonads (6 cells in ~1000 cells) with a flagellum attachment plaque that had partially or completely detached from the stomodeal valve. While it is possible that these cells became detached from the stomodeal valve during tissue fixation, these partially detached forms may also represent haptomonads in the process of differentiating back into a free-swimming life cycle form, to continue the life cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In addition, as has been observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rogers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schlein et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Volf et al., 2004</xref>), we observed a detachment of the cuticular lining from the epithelial cells at the areas of the stomodeal valve where a large number of haptomonads were adhered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The haptomonad flagellum is a highly modified and specialised organelle</title><p>To obtain more detailed 3D information on the attachment structure of individual haptomonads, we stopped SBFSEM imaging half-way through the stomodeal valve area where haptomonad cells of comparable density to those observed in the heavily infected stomodeal valve of a previous study were seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rogers et al., 2008</xref>), and then semi-thin (~150 nm) serial sections were cut from the SBFSEM sample block face, for use in serial electron tomography (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). A 3D model was created from the reconstructed serial tomogram, and the detailed 3D configuration of the attached flagellum and the region around the flagellar pocket of the haptomonad cell was examined (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As observed in the SBFSEM data, the haptomonad was attached to the stomodeal valve through the distal tip of the shortened flagellum, and the attachment interface was covered with an electron-dense attachment plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). The anterior tip of the cell body in promastigotes is asymmetrical with the cell body extending along the side of the flagellum in which the flagellum attachment zone (FAZ) is found, with its typical electron-dense junctional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sunter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>). In the haptomonad cell, this asymmetric cell body extension is much shorter, with a wider anterior cell tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The haptomonad flagellar pocket consisted of a bulbous region at its base and a neck region more closely apposed to the flagellum, with the microtubule quartet running over the bulbous region and into the neck region. In comparison with the promastigote, the neck region was shorter, and as the flagellum exited the neck region there was an expansion of the flagellum, with a large number of junctional complexes connecting the flagellar membrane to the cell body membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). A 9+2 microtubule axoneme was present within the flagellum; however, the axoneme extended only just beyond the cell body and the central pair microtubules were not present in the final few hundred micrometres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). Markham rotational averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gadelha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Skalický et al., 2017</xref>) showed that the 9+2 axoneme was associated with accessory structures required for motility including radial spokes and inner and outer dynein arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, the tip of the shortened outer doublet microtubules and central pair microtubules were capped with amorphous material and a ring-like capping structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, in the haptomonad flagellum, we did not observe the paraflagellar rod (PFR), an extra-axonemal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Portman and Gull, 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The modified haptomonad flagellum has a highly organised ultrastructure, with multiple discrete elements.</title><p>Different serial tomograms of haptomonads in the sand fly, focusing on the attachment region (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>).

The adhesion process in our system took between 2 and 9 hr to complete and did not appear synchronous in the population. After examining 8 videos of cells adhering (showing a total of 10 adhering cells), we identified five distinct stages in the adhesion process (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the first stage of adhesion (stage 1), the cells appeared to explore the surface with their flagellum, making contact as shown by the distortion of the flagellar membrane and the release of membrane ‘streamers’ (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1 fig4video2">Figure 4—videos 1–2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellis et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood, 1990</xref>). In stage 2, a segment of the flagellum initiated adhesion to the substrate. The initial point of adhesion was not restricted to the tip of the flagellum, but could be any point along the flagellum length. Stage 3 was characterised by cells remaining more stably fixed to a specific point on the surface, with the cell being able to move relative to this point, while the attachment region appeared to slide along the length of the flagellum. In cells where the initial point of adhesion was away from the base of the flagellum, a flagellum loop often formed, ensuring that the cell body was in close proximity to the point of adhesion (in the videos examined, 7 out of 10 cells attempting to attach formed a flagellum loop). In stage 4, the flagellum began to shorten, and expansion of the flagellar membrane was observed, with fusion of the membrane in the looped area of the flagellum if present. Finally, in the last stage of adhesion (stage 5), there was maturation of the attachment region, with the presence of a clear attachment plaque and the cell body rotating from lying parallel to the surface to being upright. Throughout these steps, the cell body gradually became shorter and wider.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Adhesion of the in vitro haptomonad-like cell has a series of defined sequential steps.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequential frames (at 60 min intervals) from a time-lapse video (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>) of adhesion of a haptomonad-like cell, as viewed by bright field microscopy.

This suggests that the adhesion process of in vitro haptomonad-like cells occurs through a defined series of steps. In addition, we noted that some attempts to attach to the surface were unsuccessful. In the videos examined, 3 out of 10 cells observed attempting to attach to the surface formed an initial adhesion but then detached and swam away before flagellum disassembly (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that in vitro at least the initial stages (1-3) of adhesion are reversible.</p><p>Our electron microscopy showed that, despite being much reduced, the haptomonad axoneme still contained some of the canonical non-microtubule components such as the radial spokes, while the PFR was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To examine this at the molecular level in our in vitro system, we differentiated a cell line expressing a radial spoke protein (RSP4/6) tagged with mCherry (mCh) and a PFR protein (PFR2) tagged with mNeonGreen (mNG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), and examined them by fluorescence light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In promastigote cells, RSP4/6 and PFR2 had their expected localisations along the flagellum. As adhesion of the in vitro haptomonad-like cells progressed, the RSP4/6 and PFR2 signals shortened in parallel with the flagellum shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Eventually, in the very short flagellum of mature in vitro haptomonad-like cells, only a short line of RSP4/6 signal was consistently seen, with the PFR2 signal not seen in 30% (9/30) of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the PFR is disassembled during in vitro haptomonad-like cell adhesion.</p><p>The cells with lateral attachment and unattached cells around the stomodeal valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>) had a cell morphology similar to that of metacyclics or leptomonads.

To investigate the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the process of adhesion formation and maintenance, we examined adhesion in the presence of EGTA in M199 medium, which includes ~2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The addition of 1 or 2 mM EGTA to the medium had no effect on the growth of promastigotes in suspension culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the presence of EGTA during adhesion resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of attached cells after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>), with an increased effect at the higher concentration of EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Thus, our data indicate that there are different regulatory mechanisms for adhesion in different trypanosomatids. To examine whether the removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from cells that have already attached to the substrate disrupted their attachment, we incubated attached in vitro haptomonad-like cells (formed by differentiation for 24 hr in vitro) in the medium containing 2 mM EGTA for 30 min, and then counted the number of cells that remained attached to the glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

The ability to adhere and maintain position in a specific environment is important for the establishment and maintenance of an infection in the host and vector. The haptomonad form is an enigmatic stage in the life cycle of <italic>Leishmania</italic>, as its specific role is unclear and the adhesion mechanism has not been described in detail. Here, we have used a combination of volume electron microscopy approaches to define the 3D organisation and cytoskeletal architecture of haptomonad attachment connecting the parasite to the stomodeal valve. We have also analysed an in vitro system of adhesion, which has allowed us to define a discrete series of events leading to mature attachment.</p><p>Using SBFSEM, we examined the organisation of hundreds of haptomonad forms attached to a sand fly stomodeal valve. The parasites were densely packed on the stomodeal valve with several layers of haptomonads. As would be expected, those parasites in close proximity to the stomodeal valve had a shorter flagellum in comparison with those positioned further away from the surface of the valve. Haptomonads that cannot bring their cell bodies close to the stomodeal valve due to high cell density may position their cell bodies in the vacant space by adjusting their flagellum length. Alternatively, the positioning of the cells relative to the stomodeal valve may represent different stages along the haptomonad differentiation process, with those closest to the surface fully differentiated. This notion is in line with our time-lapse observations of the differentiation in which we saw a progressive disassembly of the flagellum, resulting in an in vitro haptomonad-like cell attached to the glass surface by a short, enlarged flagellum. For the majority of haptomonads examined the attachment interface was positioned at the enlarged distal tip of the flagellum; however, in a significant minority of cells the interface occurred along the side of the flagellum not the tip. Interestingly, the initial adhesion between the parasite and the glass surface occurred through the lateral face of the flagellum. These commonalities between the haptomonads in the sand fly and in vitro haptomonad-like cells further confirm the latter’s suitability for future studies of haptomonad biology. However, it should be noted that as there are no molecular markers defining a haptomonad, we were not able to confirm on the molecular level whether our in vitro haptomonad-like cells are comparable to haptomonads in the sand fly.</p><p>The SBFSEM observations emphasise the high-volume spatial organisation and context of the haptomonads on the stomodeal valve. To add further detailed ultrastructural information on the attachment structure, we used electron tomography. This highlighted important changes to the cellular architecture of the haptomonad in comparison to the promastigote. There was a reduction in the length of the flagellar pocket neck in the haptomonad and a widening of the anterior cell tip, with an expansion of the flagellum as it exits the neck. It therefore appears as if the flagellar pocket neck has been ‘unpeeled’ and spread out to create a larger interface between the cell body and flagellar membranes mediated by the junctional complexes of the FAZ.</p><p>The haptomonad flagellum has a shortened axoneme that only just extends beyond the end of the cell body. However, unlike the amastigote flagellum, which has also disassembled the central pair microtubules, the haptomonad flagellum has retained its central pair and other accessory structures associated with motility such as the outer and inner dynein arms. Moreover, the presence of a radial spoke protein, RSP4/6, in the in vitro haptomonad-like flagellum was confirmed by protein tagging, suggesting that the in vitro haptomonad-like flagellum is still capable of movement, and indeed we observed movement of the shortened attached flagellum of in vitro haptomonad-like cells. Such motility if it occurs in the sand fly may contribute to the uptake of material into the flagellar pocket or to the damage of the stomodeal valve that occurs during <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection, or potentially the rapid assembly of a long motile flagellum on differentiation into promastigotes.</p><p>The electron tomography observations also revealed that the structural architecture of the haptomonad attachment plaque consisted of discrete layers, with the inner and outer dense plaques overlaying the flagellar membrane connecting to a dense filament layer, summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. Interestingly, this is a similar arrangement to that of the hemidesmosome formed in mammalian epithelial cells when they attach to the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Todorović et al., 2004</xref>). This has been noted before and previously the attachment plaque has been termed a hemidesmosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Killick-Kendrick et al., 1974</xref>; however, as no orthologues of the constituent proteins of the hemidesmosome are found in the <italic>L. mexicana</italic> genome, we use the term attachment plaque.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Models of the haptomonad attachment plaque and adhesion process.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of the haptomonad attachment plaque. (<bold>B</bold>) Model of the haptomonad adhesion process based on the in vitro observations. A promastigote cell explores the surface of the substrate using the flagellum (1), and initiates adhesion through the flagellum (2). Subsequently, stable adhesion is established (3), which is often (but not always) associated with the formation of a flagellum loop. Then, the flagellum becomes shorter (partial flagellum disassembly; 4), and finally the adhesion matures, with the formation of an attachment plaque (5). Stage 3 is reversible, as cells can still detach from the substrate before flagellum shortening. Adhesion formation (but not maintenance) is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent. The box on the right in B shows three different hypotheses for generation of free-swimming promastigotes from haptomonads based on the in vivo observations, including asymmetric division (6), flagellum reassembly followed by detachment (6’), or detachment followed by flagellum reassembly (6”).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84552-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The thickness of the filaments in the haptomonad flagellum is 8–10 nm, which is similar to the thickness of intermediate filaments or septin filaments in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bridges et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coulombe and Wong, 2004</xref>). In addition, the thickness of the filament bundle is 16–20 nm and just as intermediate or septin filaments can form a bundle, the filament bundle in the haptomonad flagellum may be formed by bundling of these individual filaments. Negative staining of cytoskeletons of in vitro haptomonad-like cells also showed filaments bundled together near the FAZ and the attachment region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, again, no orthologues of intermediate filament and septin filament proteins, such as keratins or septins, are present in the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome. <italic>Leishmania</italic> may therefore have unique filament-forming proteins constituting the filamentous structures in the haptomonad flagellum. Connections were observed in the gap between the surface of the stomodeal valve and the flagellar membrane. These connections spanned gaps with a constant spacing of ~10 nm, and were not seen in the regions where the gap was wider. This suggests that they have a specific size and are therefore more likely to represent transmembrane protein(s), rather than flexible substances such as mucus material. Overall, there has been a dramatic remodelling of the flagellum in the haptomonad. The strong attachment of the cell to the cuticle of the valve is not just mediated by the attachment plaque but is buttressed by the numerous filaments and filament bundles, which connect the attachment interface to the junctional complexes of the FAZ.</p><p>Numerous vesicles and vesicular structures were seen within the flagellum. The disassembly of the flagellum during haptomonad differentiation requires a reduction in the amount of flagellar membrane and these vesicles may represent the mechanism by which this membrane is removed and transported back to the cell body, albeit recognising the potential impediment caused by basal body and associated structures. However, in addition to these larger vesicular structures there were smaller vesicles seen in close proximity to the attachment interface, with one in the process of fusing to or budding from the flagellar membrane at this point. The attachment plaque is a complex structure associated with a specialised membrane domain requiring many different components that need to be delivered to the attachment interface for assembly. It is entirely feasible that these components are packaged into vesicles before delivery to the interface and not without precedence as the assembly of desmosome connections between mammalian cells occurs through the delivery of vesicles loaded with desmosome proteins in a calcium dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burdett and Sullivan, 2002</xref>). Alternatively, while the flagellar pocket in <italic>Leishmania</italic> is generally thought of as the only site of exo/endocytosis, the attachment interface could potentially support these processes and may be important for the release of factors such as chitinase directly onto the cuticle surface of the stomodeal valve.</p><p>Previous work had suggested that the <italic>L. mexicana</italic> haptomonad form was non-replicative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gossage et al., 2003</xref>) and while the majority of haptomonads we examined only had one flagellum and one nucleus, we saw examples of cells dividing. The fate of the daughter cells from these divisions has yet to be determined; however, they could represent an asymmetric differentiation division as seen in other kinetoplastids in which one of the daughter cells differentiates to become a different life cycle stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peacock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rotureau and Van Den Abbeele, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Skalický et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, in a dividing cell with a long new flagellum both the old and new flagella were attached to the surface, suggesting that this is a proliferative division, with both daughter cells remaining attached. In addition, in those dividing cells with a short new flagellum there was no evidence of any attachment structures, suggesting that this is post-axonemal assembly modification and requires the flagellum to assemble to a length able to engage with the stomodeal valve before this process begins. Intriguingly, we also observed cells that contained two or three nuclei but in which flagellar division was not occurring and these may represent cells from fusion events, malformed divisions, or steps in gametogenesis. Sexual recombination in <italic>Leishmania</italic> has been shown to occur in the sand fly and the close positioning of attached haptomonads may facilitate the requisite cell fusion events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akopyants et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inbar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peacock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sadlova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serafim et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We have devised a model to summarise our current understanding of the process of <italic>Leishmania</italic> adhesion, by combining these observations from our volume electron microscopy from the sand fly derived haptomonads and light microscopy of the in vitro haptomonad-like cells, with the caveat that the in vitro processes may not perfectly replicate the sand fly situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). A free-swimming promastigote cell first starts to explore the surface of the substrate using its flagellum. If a suitable position is found the adhesion process is triggered — what this signal is remains unknown, but calcium potentially plays a role, as the removal of calcium inhibited cell adhesion. The cell then establishes the initial adhesion, which was often associated with the formation of a loop of flagellum. Currently, we do not know whether the promastigote to haptomonad differentiation is reversible or not. In our time-lapse videos, we saw promastigotes that would adhere to the surface but would not fully adhere and instead detach and swim off. This suggests that the initial stages of adhesion in vitro at least are reversible. Around this stage, however, a point of no return occurs and the parasites from our in vitro data were unable to detach from the surface. Adhesion continues with the disassembly of the axoneme and PFR, expansion of the flagellar membrane and the assembly of the attachment plaque with the cell body reducing in length and widening. The long axis of the mature in vitro haptomonad-like cell then becomes orthogonal to the surface, with the cell standing proud attached through its flagellum tip. From our SBFSEM data, the haptomonad form is then able to divide at a very slow rate, generating more attached forms and potentially unattached forms through an asymmetric division. Moreover, we saw examples of cells that had become detached from the stomodeal valve, with a clear attachment plaque density at their enlarged flagellum tip that was not in contact with the stomodeal valve surface. This may represent the first step of the differentiation process of haptomonads into free-swimming forms. Many cells with lateral flagellum attachment to the stomodeal valve and unattached cells were morphologically similar to leptomonads or metacyclics. Our analysis of in vitro purified metacyclics suggest they are not competent to adhere. If the metacyclics in the sand fly were also not adhesion competent then those cells attached to the valve laterally through their flagellum may represent leptomonad cells in the process of differentiating to the haptomonad form as suggested in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>) or haptomonads differentiating to metacyclics or leptomonads.</p><p>The detailed 3D organisation and architecture of the haptomonad attachment and its process of adhesion development revealed in this study will be of great help for future work on the identification of proteins involved in adhesion and understanding the mechanism of the haptomonad attachment and its role in the <italic>Leishmania</italic> life cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The degeneration of the valve tissue, including a detachment of the cuticle lining that was previously described in infected flies (Schlein et al., PNAS, 1992), was not observed in the current studies.

Would not large numbers of metacyclic promastigotes be expected to colonize the anterior midgut in close proximity to the valve?

We anticipate that this would involve time-resolved local release from local calcium stores and not a global requirement for calcium; therefore, we always felt the global chelation of calcium would be uninformative even if it had an effect. in vitro we can test the effect of calcium removal in a defined system of cells in culture medium attaching to glass; however, the effect of EGTA within a complex biological system such as the gut of an infected sand fly would be very difficult to interpret. For example, the sugar meal does not go directly into midgut, it is stored in crop and released to midgut in small quantities 1-2 days post-feeding. We have no idea about stability of EGTA in sand flies and it would be impossible to control the quantity imbibed by sand flies, so the concentration and bioavailability within the midgut would be unknown and variable. Moreover, calcium chelation will likely have effects upon the insect itself that might influence parasite attachment and there are other <italic>Leishmania</italic> proteins such as GP63 that require calcium and are important for parasite development in the sand fly. However, despite these concerns, we did do this experiment, just in case there was an effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response images 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">3</xref>).

However, the approaches we developed in this manuscript are not appropriate to test the importance of haptomonads for onwards transmission in a meaningful manner, as we have been unable to disrupt attachment in the sand fly. Moreover, the focus in this paper is on the three-dimensional structural information of haptomonads and the details of the adhesion formation. Thus, we think that transmission experiments are much beyond the scope of this study, which is the first of its kind to address how attachment can possibly happen. Moreover, it is important to understand the nature of attachment before interfering with it in vivo in complex biological contexts and we have now defined the plaque in vivo and in vitro facilitating future studies.</p><p>Methods: Females of Lutzomyia longipalpis were fed through a chick-skin membrane on heat-inactivated sheep blood containing Leishmania mexicana (SMP1::mCherry) promastigotes from log-phase cultures (day 3-4) at a concentration 106 cells/ml. Blood-engorged females were separated and maintained at 26°C with free access to sugar solution only or sugar solutions containing 5 mM or 20 mM EGTA; all sugar solution contained blue food colour to be sure that dissected females took the sugar solution. On days 6 and 9 post-infection (PI) females were dissected in drops of saline solution. In total we dissected 42 females fed on sugar only, 13 females fed on sugar with 5 mM EGTA and 41 females fed on sugar with 20 mM EGTA. The individual guts were checked for presence and localization of Leishmania promastigotes under the light and fluorescence microscope Olympus BX51. Special emphasis was given to the colonization of the stomodeal valve. Levels of Leishmania infections were graded into four categories: negative, light (&lt; 100 parasites/gut), moderate (100-1000 parasites/gut) and heavy (&gt;1000 parasites/gut).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Apart from sharing structural elements of the attachment plaque, there is no evidence that the forms that attach in vitro represent an authentic and unique life cycle stage in vivo. If by &quot;haptomonad&quot;, the authors are referring to any promastigote that attaches to a surface via the formation of a flagellar attachment plaque, then this should be explained and clarified in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>A number of the issues raised by the reviewers focus on the terminology used in this study. The in vitro cultured cells we use to initiate this process are widely regarded as promastigotes. During the process these cells clearly differentiate changing shape and morphology, forming an attachment plaque. in vivo cells exhibiting an attachment plaque were defined as haptomonads (Killick-Kendrick et al., 1974). In the intervening time since this term was coined, based solely on morphology and the formation of an attachment plaque, no molecular markers of haptomonads have been defined. Moreover, other aspects of the biology of these forms is not helpful as haptomonads in other species can occur in other places (e.g. <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> complex in the hindgut; Killick-Kendrick et al., 1977); therefore, the unifying feature of haptomonads is their morphology and the formation of an attachment plaque. It is for that reason we termed them haptomonad. Given the referees uncertainty and lack of molecular markers we have referred to them throughout the manuscript as in vitro haptomonad-like cells. We have revised the manuscript and added explanations to clarify the definition of the in vitro haptomonad-like cell (Line 84-89 and 509-511).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While the studies lend impressive details to a previously described aspect of promastigote colonization of the stomodeal valve, they do not further our understanding of the consequences of this colonization, if any, to the ability of infected flies to transmit infection by bite.

In the paper (Schlein et al., 1992) and our previous paper (Volf et al., 2004), a higher infection dose or a longer duration between blood meal and imaging was necessary to see the clear degeneration of the valve tissue. However, based on the reviewer’s comment, we revisited the SBF-SEM data of the stomodeal valve in detail and found clear detachment of the cuticle lining in the areas where a large number of parasites were attached. We have now included the data as “Figure1—figure supplement 3” and added a description (Line 187-190).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is 'haptomonad' a term used to describe any promastigote seen in attachment to the stomodeal valve, regardless of morphology?

This raises the question as to whether there is a dedicated stage that is pre-adapted to attachment. This could be addressed in part using the in vitro system. Will metacyclics purified from culture attach in vitro, and do they remodel their flagellum and assume a haptomonad morphology?</p></disp-quote><p>In this paper, cells are classified as ‘haptomonads’ if they have (i) a short, wide cell body, (ii) a shortened axoneme, and (iii) attached to the substrate through an electron-dense attachment plaque. We regard other attached cells with an elongated flagellum and axoneme with a small attachment plaque (e.g., yellow-colorized cell shown in Figure 1F) as promastigote cells either differentiating to or away from the haptomonad form.</p><p>According to the morphological criteria in the previous studies (Rogers et al., 2002), the cells we saw either attached to or near the stomodeal valve had either a metacyclic (Body length &lt;8 μm, body width &lt;1 μm, flagellum &gt; body length) or leptomonad (Body length 6.5 – 11.5 μm, width variable, flagellum &gt; body length) morphology (Figure 1E). In fact the majority of the cells attached to the valve laterally through the flagellum side or were unattached had a leptomonad morphology.</p><p>To address whether metacyclics are able to attach, we purified metacyclics <italic>Leishmania</italic> culture as described in Späth and Beverley, Exp. Parasitol., 2001, and conducted the in vitro attachment assay. From this experiment, we confirmed that in vitro purified metacyclics had little ability to attach. We have added this data as “Figure 4—figure supplement 3” and descriptions (Line 399-449 and 628-681). The lack of attachment by metacyclic forms suggests those attached cells with a long flagellum are likely leptomonad forms in the process of attachment, which is consistent with the suggestion of Rogers et al., 2002 who described the leptomonad as the precursor of the haptomonad.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The calcium2+ dependency of the attachment was confined to the in vitro model.

As highlighted by the reviewer we do show that the ultrastructural composition of the attachment plaque complex is almost identical between haptomonads in the sand fly and our in vitro haptomonad-like cells. In addition, other aspects of these cells are comparable such as (i) formation of filamentous structures within the flagellum, (ii) shortened axoneme with central pair microtubules, (iii) disassembled PFR, (iv) expanded FAZ structure, (v) cell body dimensions, and (iv) the formation of the extracellular filamentous gel-like matrix. We consider that these aspects support that the in vitro haptomonad-like cells mimic the haptomonads in vivo.</p><p>Moreover, given the similarities at the ultrastructural level it would be surprising to find that the proteins within the hemidesmosomes in the sand fly haptomonads differed significantly from those in the in vitro derived haptomonad-like cells and would suggest that the cell can form the same structure in two different ways. However, as the reviewer mentioned, these structural and morphological similarities are not sufficient to ensure that the in vitro haptomonad-like cells are the same as in vivo haptomonads. Therefore, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have adjusted the manuscript explicitly highlighting the caveats of our approach (Line 84-89, 509-511).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 87: Although haptomonads are predicted to have an important role in transmission, no data is available demonstrating its role.

Given the density of the attached haptomonads, we consider that the stomodeal valves used in this study are heavily infected (Figure 1—video 1 and Figure 1A). We have modified the manuscript to explain this (Line 194-196).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 145-147: Can this be due to sample prep/processing? The asymmetry?</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown that the anterior cell tip in the promastigote cell has an asymmetric extension along one side of the flagellum (Sunter et al., 2019) and can be seen in other papers as well (e.g. Wheeler et al., 2016).This asymmetry results in the anterior end of the cell body crossing the flagellum at an oblique angle when viewed in certain orientations (Figure 1 in Sunter et al., 2019). Given that this feature has been observed independently, it is unlikely an artefact due to sample preparation and/or processing. We consider this to be an intrinsic cell morphological feature of free-swimming promastigotes, and this asymmetric extension of the anterior cell body was much shorter in haptomonads (Figure 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 191: Vide comment for lines 74-75.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text as mentioned above (Line 264).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 196-200: How the authors are sure of the structure being a clump of haptomonads?
