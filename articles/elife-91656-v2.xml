shutters between ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) and numerous proteins involved in critical biological pathways. FDX1 is involved in biogenesis of steroids and bile acids, Vitamin A/D metabolism, and lipoylation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes. FDX1 has been extensively characterized biochemically but its role in physiology and lipid metabolism has not been explored. In this study, we generated <italic>Fdx1</italic>-deficient mice and showed that knockout of both alleles of the <italic>Fdx1</italic> gene led to embryonic lethality. We also showed that like <italic>Fdxr<sup>+/-</sup></italic>+/-, <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>+/- had a shorter life span and were prone to steatohepatitis. However, unlike <italic>Fdxr<sup>+/-</sup></italic>+/-, <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>+/- were not prone to spontaneous tumors. Additionally, we showed that FDX1 deficiency led to lipid droplet accumulation possibly via the ABCA1-SREBP1/2 pathway. Specifically, untargeted lipidomic analysis showed that FDX1 deficiency led to alterations in several classes of lipids, including cholesterol, triacylglycerides, acylcarnitines, ceramides, phospholipids and lysophospholipids. Taken together, our data indicate that FDX1 is essential for mammalian embryonic development and lipid homeostasis at both cellular and organismal levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ferredoxin 1</kwd><kwd>ferredoxin reductase</kwd><kwd>lipidomics</kwd><kwd>lipid homeostasis</kwd><kwd>steatohepatitis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA224433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xinbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The iron-sulfur cluster containing Ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), critical in steroidogenesis and TCA cycle, is required for mammalian embryonic development and maintenance of lipid homeostasis at cellular and organismal levels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ferredoxin (FDX) proteins are a family of redox proteins present in all branches of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schulz et al., 2023</xref>). They contain iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters that aid in their function of transferring electrons from NADPH via ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) to systems involved in various biological processes including iron sulfur (Fe-S) cluster synthesis, steroidogenesis, bile acid production and vitamin metabolism. Mammalian cells contain two ferredoxins, FDX1 and FDX2, both of which are localized to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sheftel et al., 2010</xref>). Although they have high homology in primary and three-dimensional structures, they differ significantly in their substrate identity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schulz et al., 2023</xref>). FDX2 is critical in the formation of Fe-S clusters in mitochondria by donating electrons to iron sulfur cluster assembly complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schulz et al., 2023</xref>). FDX1, on the other hand, donates its electrons to various cytochrome p450 systems present in mitochondria and is involved in production of steroid hormones from cholesterol (steroidogenesis), bile acid production, addition of heme α to Cytochrome c as well as Vitamin A/D metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schulz et al., 2023</xref>). Recently, FDX1 has been shown to regulate the process of lipoylation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, especially pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schulz et al., 2023</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsvetkov et al., 2022</xref>). Lipoylation is essential for the function of these enzymes. Moreover, FDX1 has emerged as the central player in the regulation of a new form of cell death, called cuproptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsvetkov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tsvetkov et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Lipids consist of a myriad group of biomolecules essential for various cellular processes, including membrane formation, energy storage and cellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Snaebjornsson et al., 2020</xref>). Some vital lipids, such as triaclyglycerides (TAGs), cholesterol, cardiolipins (CLs) and phospholipids, are essential for cell survival. Due to the essential role of lipids in maintaining normal physiology, aberrant lipid homeostasis has been involved in various disease pathologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Broadfield et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hoy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Snaebjornsson et al., 2020</xref>). Altered lipid metabolism is also linked with systemic inflammation and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carotti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hoy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Singla et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>SREBP1/2 are considered master regulators of lipid metabolism and often associated with altered lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Osborne and Espenshade, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shao and Espenshade, 2012</xref>). In physiological conditions, when intracellular cholesterol levels are depleted, SREBP1/2 are activated through the release of their N-terminal domains by proteolytic cleavage. The N-terminal domains are then translocated to nucleus where a set of genes involved in lipid metabolism are induced by SREBP1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Osborne and Espenshade, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shao and Espenshade, 2012</xref>). However, in diseased conditions, SREBP1/2 are constitutively activated via various mechanisms, resulting in abnormal lipid production and accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Osborne and Espenshade, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shao and Espenshade, 2012</xref>). SREBP1 is expressed as two isoforms, SREBP 1 a and 1 c, both of which are transcribed from the SREBF1 gene but through two separate promoters. SREBP-2 is encoded by the SREBF2 gene. SREBP-1c preferentially regulates genes for synthesis of fatty acids (FAs) and TAGs whereas SREBP-2 preferentially regulates genes for cholesterol synthetic pathway, including the mevalonate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</xref>). SREBP-1a has overlapping functions with both SREBP-1c and SREBP-2.</p><p>FDXR transfers electrons from NADPH to FDX1, which then delivers the electrons to either COX15, lipoyl synthase or seven different mitochondrial cytochromes, thus supporting the biosynthesis of heme α, lipoic acid, steroid hormones, bile acid, and Vitamin A/D metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schulz et al., 2023</xref>). We previously showed an essential role of FDXR in mammalian embryonic development and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). As FDX1 is a substrate of FDXR in regulating steroidogenesis, we asked whether FDX1 is necessary for mammalian embryonic development and lipid metabolism. We showed that mice homozygous for <italic>Fdx1</italic> deletion are embryonically lethal at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). We also showed that <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- have a short life span and are prone to steatohepatitis, but not to spontaneous tumors. Like FDXR, FDX1 was found to regulate lipid metabolism due to increased activation of the SREBP1/2 pathways. Moreover, untargeted lipidomic analysis showed that FDX1 loss leads to alterations in several classes of lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Fdx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos die between E10.5 and E13.5</title><p>Although FDX1 has been extensively studied biochemically, its role in development and physiology has been unexplored. To determine physiological function of FDX1, we generated <italic>Fdx1</italic> heterozygous mice using the knock-out first approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- developed normally and were fertile. However, inter-breeding of <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- to obtain <italic>Fdx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was unsuccessful. Out of the 67 pups obtained from the <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- inter-breeding, none were of the <italic>Fdx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting complete loss of <italic>Fdx1</italic> leads to embryonic lethality. To determine at what developmental stage the embryonic lethality occurs, we isolated embryos following timed pregnancies. We did not find any <italic>Fdx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) but found one at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting <italic>Fdx1</italic>-KO is lethal for embryos between E10.5-E13.5. Although, the size of WT and <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- at E10.5 was comparable, <italic>Fdx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos were small and abnormal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Interestingly, this embryonic lethality is commensurate with that observed with the embryonic lethality of <italic>Fdxr</italic>-KO at E8.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that Fdx1 and Fdxr regulate similar processes required for mammalian embryonic development and survival.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Fdx1</italic> knock-out mouse are embryonically lethal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the targeted Fdx1 gene locus and the cassette used to target the locus using a knock-out first approach.

Thus, to study the effect of Fdx1 loss on the long-term survival as well as predisposition to tumors and other abnormalities, we generated a cohort of <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/-. Since Fdxr catalyzes the transfer of an electron from NADPH to Fdx1, we compared the phenotypes between <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- and <italic>Fdxr<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- from our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). To minimize the number of animals used, the data for the <italic>WT</italic> mice were adapted from two previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), as all the mice were derived from the same C57BL/6 background and maintained in the same facility. Moreover, to avoid any influences from sex differences, all the mice cohorts were kept at close to equal ratio of male:female mice.</p><p>Previously, we found that <italic>Fdxr<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- had a short life span compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we found that the median lifespan for <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- (73 weeks) was significantly shorter than that for WT mice (117weeks) and even shorter than that for <italic>Fdxr<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- (102weeks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>). To examine if the <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- were tumor-prone, we performed histological analysis. <italic>Fdxr<sup>+/-</sup></italic> (26 out of 29) mice were tumor-prone as compared to WT mice (11 out of 51) (p&lt;0.00001 by Fisher’s exact test).

Moreover, Fdx1 deficiency led to lipid droplet accumulation in both murine and human cells, possibly via the ABCA1-SREBP1/2 pathways. Consistently, untargeted lipidomic analysis showed that FDX1 deficiency led to alterations in several classes of lipids, suggesting the role of FDX1 in lipid metabolism.</p><p>The embryonic lethality by complete loss of <italic>Fdx1</italic> is similar to what we previously showed by complete loss of <italic>Fdxr</italic>, the latter of which was attributed in part to iron overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, as FDX1 is not a major player in Fe-S cluster synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schulz et al., 2023</xref>), the lethality could be due to lack of progesterone production by placenta, which is required for the maintenance of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Miller and Auchus, 2011</xref>). Thus, <italic>Fdx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos would not be able to survive due to a miscarriage. However, since mice with complete deletion of Cyp11a1 (Cytochrome p450scc), which is essential for progesterone production, can survive till birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hu et al., 2002</xref>), we postulate that other pathways may be responsible for the lethality of <italic>Fdx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos. Additionally, since <italic>Fdx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos developed abnormally, we postulate that FDX1 may be required for proper embryo growth, consistent with a recent observation that loss of FDX1 would lead to defects in lipoylation of key TCA cycle enzymes and subsequent loss of oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schulz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsvetkov et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We observed that <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- were not prone to spontaneous tumors, which is different from tumor-prone <italic>Fdxr<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).

In order to identify specific classes of lipids altered upon loss of FDX1, lipidomic analysis was performed and showed that the levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerols, acylcarnities, phospholipids, and lysophospholipids were significantly altered by the loss of FDX1. Thus, altered lipid metabolism is likely responsible for steatohepatitis observed in Fdx1-deficient mice. Steatohepatis is a progressive disease that initiates with the accumulation of excessive fat in the liver (steatosis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vanni et al., 2010</xref>). The fat accumulation would induce liver inflammation, leading to steatohepatitis, referred to as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These data clearly indicate that FDX1 is involved in cellular and physiological lipid homeostasis and that loss of FDX1 leads to development of pathological impairment in mice. Although previous studies showed that FDX1 is involved in cholesterol metabolism, the observations in this study raise a critical question about how FDX1 regulates the metabolism of the various classes of lipids.

We have now provided quantifications of the western blots from old Figure 3F, 3G and 4B and also changed some of the blots with clear and convincing data (Please see revised Figures 3E, 3F, 3G, 3H, 4B and 4C). We hope that the reviewers and editors could find these data more convincing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Please provide a rationale to examine AFP mRNA expression.

As mentioned in the manuscript, increased expression of α-fetoprotein is associated with inflammation and cancers, including liver, kidney and lymphoma (Galle et al., 2019). The levels of α-fetoprotein in blood has been used as important screening, prognostic as well as recurrence marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (Galle et al., 2019). Additionally, the mRNA levels of α-fetoprotein in blood have been shown to correlate with HCC patient outcome and recurrence (Jeng et al., 2004; Matsumura et al., 1999; Morimoto et al., 2005). As <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice developed liver abnormalities, we tested the AFP mRNA levels in <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> MEFs. However, as the levels of AFP in MEFs may or may not correlate with AFP mRNA levels in blood of <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, we have decided to remove these data from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3, the statement of &quot;Fdx1+/- mice is not alive&quot; is not correct. (Figure 2) Theoretically, you can generate Fdx-/- MEF as you do have Fdx1-/- embryo at D10.5.

However, as we were only able to obtain and study <italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice for various phenotypes, we believe that MEFs with the same genotype (<italic>Fdx1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) were more suitable to study the mechanism of action leading to those phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1D, the white dots are misleading in the images.

If not, please explain the dots (light reflection?).</p></disp-quote><p>We understand reviewer’s concerns about the white dots and thank them for pointing this out. Those white dots are indeed light reflections that appeared while taking the pictures. Unfortunately, as we obtained only one <italic>Fdx1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> pup at E10.5, we don’t have another image to replace. Nonetheless, as suggested by the reviewer, we have now included an explanation for this in the figure legend.</p><p>References:</p><p>Galle, P.R., Foerster, F., Kudo, M., Chan, S.L., Llovet, J.M., Qin, S., Schelman, W.R., Chintharlapalli, S., Abada, P.B., Sherman, M., et al.
