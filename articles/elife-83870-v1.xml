How mannose exerts its anticancer activity, however, remains poorly understood. Here, using genetically engineered human cancer cells that permit the precise control of mannose metabolic flux, we demonstrate that the large influx of mannose exceeding its metabolic capacity induced metabolic remodeling, leading to the generation of slow-cycling cells with limited deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). This metabolic remodeling impaired dormant origin firing required to rescue stalled forks by cisplatin, thus exacerbating replication stress. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of de novo dNTP biosynthesis was sufficient to retard cell cycle progression, sensitize cells to cisplatin, and inhibit dormant origin firing, suggesting dNTP loss-induced genomic instability as a central mechanism for the anticancer activity of mannose.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In order to grow and divide, cells require a variety of sugars. Breaking down sugars provides energy for cells to proliferate and allows them to make more complex molecules, such as DNA. Although this principle also applies to cancer cells, a specific sugar called mannose not only inhibits cancer cell division but also makes them more sensitive to chemotherapy. These anticancer effects of mannose are particularly strong in cells lacking a protein known as MPI, which breaks down mannose.</p><p>Evidence from honeybees suggests that a combination of mannose and low levels of MPI leads to a build-up of a modified form of mannose, called mannose-6-phosphate, within cells. As a result, pathways required to release energy from glucose become disrupted, proving lethal to these insects. However, it was not clear whether the same processes were responsible for the anticancer effects of mannose.</p><p>To investigate, Harada et al. removed the gene that encodes the MPI protein in two types of human cancer cells. The experiments showed that mannose treatment was not lethal to these cells but overall slowed the cell cycle – a fundamental process for cell growth and division. More detailed biochemical experiments showed that cancer cells with excess mannose-6-phosphate could not produce the molecules required to make DNA. This prevented them from doubling their DNA – a necessary step for cell division – and responding to stress caused by chemotherapy.</p><p>Harada et al. also noticed that cancer cells lacking MPI did not all react to mannose treatment in exactly the same way. Therefore, future work will address these diverse reactions, potentially providing an opportunity to use the mannose pathway to search for new cancer treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>genomic instability</kwd><kwd>mannose</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>replication stress</kwd><kwd>dormant origins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>The Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harada</surname><given-names>Yoichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Rocket Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freeze</surname><given-names>Hudson H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK99551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freeze</surname><given-names>Hudson H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>KAKENHI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP23K06645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harada</surname><given-names>Yoichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteomic and metabolomic analyses reveal how mannose exerts its anticancer activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammals, mannose is a monosaccharide that is essential for life and is synthesized de novo from glucose through a glycolysis branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This process requires the action of mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI), the enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion between fructose-6-phosphate (Fruc-6-P) and mannose-6-phosphate (Man-6-P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alton et al., 1998</xref>). Man-6-P is further converted to GDP-mannose for the biosynthesis of asparagine-linked glycans (N-glycans) in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harada et al., 2013</xref>). In the secretory pathway, extensive trimming of N-glycans by mannosidases generates free mannose, which is secreted from cells and contributes to the extracellular pool of mannose (30–130 μM in blood) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharma and Freeze, 2011</xref>). The extracellular mannose can be taken up by cells and the salvaged mannose is directly converted to Man-6-P, the majority of which is efficiently directed into glycolysis by the action of MPI for unknown reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ichikawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharma and Freeze, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The large influx of mannose is known to suppress cell proliferation and enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, particularly in cancer cells that express low levels of MPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>), although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. It has been known for nearly a century that feeding mannose to honeybees, which are believed to express negligible amounts of MPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sols et al., 1960</xref>), is lethal to these insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Staudenmayer, 1939</xref>). This is because the intracellular levels of Man-6-P exceed the capacity to metabolize it, and the excess Man-6-P inhibits glucose metabolism and decreases the intracellular ATP pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeRossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sols et al., 1960</xref>). This metabolic deficiency is called honeybee syndrome; however, it is unknown whether this syndrome plays a key role in the anticancer activity of mannose, and if so, what metabolic checkpoints are targeted by mannose to trigger its anticancer activity. Moreover, it is enigmatic how mannose sensitizes poorly proliferating cancer cells to chemotherapy that is designed to target actively proliferating cells. In this study, we addressed these two fundamental questions by using <italic>MPI</italic>-knockout (MPI-KO) human cancer cells as a model system for honeybee syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Induction of honeybee syndrome suppresses cell proliferation and increases chemosensitivity</title><p>To establish MPI-KO human cancer cells using the CRISPR–Cas9 system, we exploited the mannose auxotrophy and sensitivity observed in MPI-KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MPI-KO MEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeRossi et al., 2006</xref>). The addition of a physiological concentration of mannose (50 μM, unchallenged) to culture medium supported the proliferation of MPI-KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, mannose starvation or the addition of a supraphysiological concentration of mannose (5 mM, challenged) suppressed the proliferation of MPI-KO MEFs, but not that of wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). On these bases, we knocked out the <italic>MPI</italic> gene in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells and screened the gene-edited clones under mannose-unchallenged conditions. Three MPI-KO HT1080 clones were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In one clone (#1), cell division stopped under mannose-unchallenged conditions, but the other two clones (#2 and #3) could proliferate. These two clones exhibited mannose auxotrophy and sensitivity as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), while the parental HT1080 cells showed marginal defects in cell proliferation at mannose concentrations higher than 15 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The effects of mannose starvation and mannose challenge on the proliferation of MPI-KO cells were almost fully rescued by reintroduction of the human <italic>MPI</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>), ruling out the potential off-target effects of gene editing. As expected, mannose challenge to MPI-KO HT1080 cells caused the dramatic accumulation of hexose-6-phosphate (the sum of glucose-6-phosphate and Man-6-P) compared with that under mannose-unchallenged conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Consistent with the essential role of exogenous mannose in the production of Man-6-P and therefore that of GDP-mannose for N-glycan biosynthesis in MPI-KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harada et al., 2013</xref>), mannose starvation severely decreased N-glycosylation in MPI-KO HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). However, mannose challenge showed negligible effects on N-glycosylation, indicating that mannose challenge suppresses cell proliferation through a mechanism distinct from N-glycosylation defects.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The induction of honeybee syndrome suppresses cell proliferation and increases chemosensitivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of HT1080 (parent) and mannose phosphate isomerase knockout (MPI-KO) HT1080 (KO, clone #1–3) cells.

To explore the mechanism behind the antiproliferative activity of mannose, we compared the cell cycle progression between mannose-challenged and -unchallenged MPI-KO HT1080 cells by using a two-color fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator [Fucci(CA)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017</xref>). In this reporter system, G<sub>1</sub> phase was defined by the exclusive expression of mCherry-hCdt1(1/100)Cy(−), which was rapidly turned off upon the onset of S phase where mVenus-hGem(1/110) gradually accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The mCherry-hCdt1(1/100)Cy(−) was re-expressed upon the onset of G<sub>2</sub> phase (the double-positive phase), followed by the termination of M phase where mVenus-hGem(1/110) was abruptly turned off. Under mannose-unchallenged conditions, MPI-KO HT1080 cells showed exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and a typical Fucci(CA) signal profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>), as reported in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, mannose challenge almost completely suppressed cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and significantly prolonged the cell cycle, showing a variety of atypical Fucci(CA) signal profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We classified these profiles based on the order of expression of Fucci(CA) reporters [mCherry-hCdt1(1/100)Cy(−) as R, mVenus-hGem(1/110) as G, and the double-negative phase as Dn, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>]. The classification analysis revealed that a small proportion of the mannose-challenged cells showed normal-like but strikingly extended Fucci(CA) signal profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, normal-like, 12% of the total). Notably, these normal-like cell populations frequently failed to undergo cytokinesis in M phase and re-entered G<sub>1</sub> phase without generating two equivalent daughter cells (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Other fractions included cells that were arrested in G<sub>1</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, RRR, 26.7%), that showed little to no double-positive phase (i.e., the G<sub>2</sub>-to-M phase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, RGR, 15.8% and GRG, 9.9%, GDn, 5.9%, RGG, 5.0%, RGDn, 4.0%; 40.6% of total), or that remained in the double-negative phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, Dn, 8.9%), which is normally seen only at the G<sub>1</sub>/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that mannose challenge severely impairs the entry of the cells into S phase and its progression to mitotic phase. Strikingly, however, switching of the mannose-challenge medium to the mannose-unchallenged medium after long-term mannose challenge (6 d) resulted in robust cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) with cell cycle progression indistinguishable from that of mannose-unchallenged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>), suggesting that some fraction of the mannose-challenged cells had entered a quiescent state upon mannose challenge. Supporting this assumption, mannose challenge induced early accumulation of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abukhdeir and Park, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). To directly measure DNA synthesis, mannose-challenged and -unchallenged cells were pulse-labeled with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and stained with Hoechst 33342 for DNA. BrdU was incorporated into DNA in both mannose-challenged and -unchallenged cells, but mannose challenge gradually decreased cell populations that were actively synthesizing DNA over the incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). Small proportions of the mannose-challenged cells exhibited DNA content greater than 4n after 2-day mannose challenge, which also exhibited BrdU incorporation, suggesting that these cell populations underwent endoreplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edgar and Orr-Weaver, 2001</xref>).

Strikingly, the amounts of ribonucleoside diphosphates and triphosphates, but not ribonucleoside monophosphates, were proportionally and moderately decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–K</xref>), whereas deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) were substantially decreased in the mannose-challenged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that mannose challenge generates a distinct metabolic landscape in MPI-KO HT1080 cells, which ultimately lead to the depletion of dNTP pools.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mannose challenge severely reduces the capacity for biosynthesizing nucleotides</title><p>dNTPs are the essential donor substrates for DNA synthesis, raising the possibility that the dNTP loss caused by mannose challenge may be a major mechanism linking the generation of slow-cycling cells and the failure to engage dormant origins in DNA synthesis during replication stress. To further elucidate the impacts of mannose challenge on the biosynthesis of dNTPs, we performed [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose tracer experiments that, unlike steady-state metabolomics, allow to estimate the activity of glucose-related metabolic pathways by analyzing the fractional enrichment of the metabolites in a dynamic labeling phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorkiewicz et al., 2019</xref>).

The <sup>13</sup>C-labeling of most metabolites detected in glycolysis, the PPP, and the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) already reached isotopic steady states within 30 min in both mannose-challenged and -unchallenged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), most likely due to their high metabolic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorkiewicz et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to these central metabolic pathways, metabolites in purine and pyrimidine metabolism showed a dynamic or sub-dynamic labeling in mannose-challenged cells. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is an essential ribose donor substrate for the biosynthesis of nucleotides in both purine and pyrimidine metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

This finding is supported by the accumulating evidence indicating that excess mannose inhibits glycolysis and retards cell proliferation in MPI-KO MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeRossi et al., 2006</xref>) and MPI<sup>low</sup> cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>), and that the temporal regulation of glycolysis and OXPHOS drives the G<sub>1</sub>/S transition and chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Icard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salazar-Roa and Malumbres, 2017</xref>). Moreover, the fact that HU treatment inhibits the progression of replication forks suggests that dNTP loss in honeybee syndrome impairs S phase progression. Taking these findings together, the massive changes in crosstalk between metabolic networks and cell cycle machinery in honeybee syndrome potentially contribute to cell cycle dysregulation, which may further complicate metabolic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fajas, 2013</xref>).</p><p>An examination of human cancer cell lines that express varying levels of MPI clearly indicated that the antiproliferative effect of mannose is largely dependent on the expression levels of MPI, while mannose-driven genomic instability is a unique phenotype observed in the absence of MPI. For this reason, the potential clinical use of mannose to induce genomic instability in cancer cells is currently unlikely. Here, we provide experimental evidence showing that pharmacological inhibition of de novo dNTP synthesis, which is critical for the recovery from replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Håkansson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2000</xref>), partly mimics the anticancer activity of mannose and chemosensitizes cells to cisplatin independently of the MPI expression and mannose dosing. Our finding that DNA synthesis from dormant origins during replication stress is highly sensitive to the dNTP pool size is in good agreement with the therapeutic advantages of RNR inhibition in enhancing the efficacy of radiochemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunos and Ivy, 2018</xref>). These findings strongly suggest dNTP loss as an important mechanism underlying the chemosensitizing effect of mannose in MPI-KO cancer cells.</p><p>What causes the loss of dNTPs in honeybee syndrome? The pool size of dNTPs is tightly regulated in order to meet and not to exceed cellular demands by cell cycle-dependent and DNA damage-dependent expression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franzolin et al., 2013</xref>), as well as their allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2013</xref>). This tight regulation of dNTP supply is vital to prevent cells from suffering the dNTP pool imbalance, which causes genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pajalunga et al., 2017</xref>). Our proteomic analysis revealed that mannose challenge rapidly increases the expression of RRM2B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>), which is a rate-limiting and TP53-inducible subunit of RNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Håkansson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2000</xref>), indicating that the equilibrium of dNTP metabolism shifted toward biosynthesis at the protein level. However, mannose challenge caused substantial reductions in the pool of ATP, which is a key allosteric regulator for the catalysis of RNR to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brignole et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, a recent in-depth metabolomic study revealed that a high concentration of mannose impairs glucose metabolism in MPI<sup>low</sup> cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>), while its impact on the downstream nucleotide metabolism was not clear. Our [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose tracer experiments clearly indicated that mannose challenge severely impairs the early stages of de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. Fueling the salvage pathway of purine and pyrimidine metabolism with hypoxanthine and thymidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>) or with deoxyribonucleoside mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>) was not sufficient to improve the defects in proliferation of mannose-challenged MPI-KO HT1080 cells. Thus, the inadequate de novo synthesis of nucleotides in honeybee syndrome may limit dNTP pools in this cell model. Notably, although dNTPs are essential for DNA repair, the chemosensitizing effect of mannose was rather modest when comparing it with that of deficiency in genes for DNA repair processes (e.g., <italic>BRCA2</italic>, <italic>FANCA,</italic> and <italic>FANCD2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sakai et al., 2008</xref>). This apparent discrepancy most likely arises from the fact that the suppression of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis in honeybee syndrome is incomplete. Taken together, our findings indicate that the insufficient metabolic activity of purine and pyrimidine metabolism in honeybee syndrome causes the loss of dNTPs.</p><p>Our proteomic analysis revealed the functional pathways affected by honeybee syndrome. The downregulation of MCM2-7 proteins in mannose-challenged cells supports our hypothesis that honeybee syndrome impairs dormant origins and causes genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ibarra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawabata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shima et al., 2007</xref>). Mannose challenge also decreased the expression of several large ribosomal subunit proteins. Ribosome biogenesis stress has been identified as a major mechanism by which oxaliplatin kills cancer cells in a DNA damage response-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruno et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, mannose challenge upregulated proteins involved in ferroptosis and necroptosis. These two programmed cell death mechanisms are considered as an effective approach to overcome chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) or to eradicate apoptosis-resistant cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to metabolic impacts, honeybee syndrome may also enhance cancer cell vulnerability at the proteomic level.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that honeybee syndrome triggers dNTP loss and genomic instability in MPI-KO human cancer cells. Ensuring appropriate amounts of dNTPs is essential for normal DNA replication, as well as for the recovery from replication stress, thus providing a plausible mechanism for how mannose sensitizes poorly proliferating cancer cells to chemotherapy. Elucidation of the precise molecular mechanism underlying dNTP loss in honeybee syndrome will be necessary to unambiguously identify the direct cause(s) of the chemosensitizing effects of mannose. Our findings also pointed to there being significant phenotypic diversity in honeybee syndrome. More extensive biochemical characterization of the metabolomic and proteomic alterations in this syndrome will be needed to further dissect the impact of mannose metabolic alterations in cancer cell homeostasis, which may provide an opportunity for mannose-based drug discovery and development for cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental models</title><p>The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 used in this study was our laboratory stock and validated by short tandem repeat profiling (Promega).

After washing the precipitates three times with acetone, they were dissolved with 7 M guanidine, 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mM EDTA, and 50 mM dithiothreitol. After alkylation with iodoacetic acid, samples were desalted using PAGE Clean Up Kit (06441-50, Nacalai Tesque). The resultant precipitates were dissolved with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside, and digested with trypsin (tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated; Worthington Biochemical) at 37°C for 18 hr. The concentration of the peptide mixture was quantified by amino acid analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masuda and Dohmae, 2011</xref>). 1 μg of each peptide mixture was subjected to liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) were used as eluents. Peptides were separated using an Easy nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nano-ESI spray column (NTCC-360, 0.075 mm internal diameter × 105 mm length, 3 μm, Nikkyo Technos) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min under linear gradient conditions over 250 min. The separated peptides were analyzed with an online coupled Q Exactive HF-X Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the data-dependent Top 10 method. The acquired data were processed using MASCOT 2.8 (Matrix Science) and Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The MASCOT search was conducted as follows: Database, NCBIprot; taxonomy, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (human) (438,061 sequences); type of search, MS/MS ion; enzyme, trypsin; fixed modification, none; variable modifications, acetyl (protein N-term), Gln-&gt;pyro-Glu (N-term Q), oxidation (M), carboxymethyl (C); mass values, monoisotopic; peptide mass tolerance, ±15 ppm; fragment mass tolerance,±30 mmu; max. missed cleavages, 3; and instrument type, ESI-TRAP. Label-free quantification was performed using the quantification method based on the ion intensity of peptides in Proteome Discoverer 2.4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Metabolomics</title><p>Approximately 8 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were washed two times with 5 mL of 5% (w/v) mannitol (133-00845, FUJIFILM Wako) and scraped in 1.3 mL of methanol (138-14521, FUJIFILM Wako) that was spiked with 10 μM external standards (Human Metabolome Technologies).

The metabolic findings from Gonzalez et al. are insufficiently discussed in the text. Their study already established, using sophisticated stable isotope tracing approaches, that mannose decreases the contribution of glucose to G6P and lactate, and results in lower levels of glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates, and the PPP intermediate ribose-5P. Although the authors cite this study in the context of suppression of proliferation and increased chemotherapeutic efficacy, what is already known about mannose metabolism in mammalian cells is understated in the manuscript and the focus on honeybees is overemphasized.</p><p>2. Gonzalez et al., found that mannose decreased ribose-5P but in this study no difference in ribose-5P was seen upon mannose treatment. Total measurement of PPP metabolites is not indicative of pathway flux and the authors should instead use 1,2-13C-glucose tracing to determine whether mannose influences PPP flux. Moreover, U-13C-glucose can be used to look at dNTP labeling.</p><p>3. The mechanistic connection between mannose metabolism and dNTP depletion is not established. If there is no effect of mannose on the PPP as claimed, how does mannose induce dNTP depletion to induce replication stress?</p><p>4. It is unclear whether dNTP depletion is a cause or consequence of reduced proliferation and cell cycle perturbation. Direct evidence is lacking. Can nucleosides rescue mannose toxicity, cell cycle progression, chemosensitivity and DNA synthesis?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Identification of cancer cell lines that may be susceptible to high mannose-induced toxicity, such as those with endogenous low expression levels of MPI, and demonstration of the same effects in those cell lines would strengthen the study.</p><p>2. Utilization of labeled isotope tracers such as 13C-glucose, 13C-mannose, or 13C-glutamine to trace metabolic flux would provide confidence in the conclusions about the changes to the metabolic landscape. Pool sizes decreased for both lower glycolysis and TCA cycle intermediates; this was interpreted as decreased activity for glycolysis but increased activity for the TCA cycle. How is the TCA cycle fueled if lower glycolytic intermediates are not feeding the TCA cycle? Is excess glutamine fueling the TCA cycle? Why are nucleoside monophosphates not depleted?</p><p>3. Evaluating the NAD/NADH ratio between mannose challenged and unchallenged cells would also strengthen the claims about increased oxidative phosphorylation.</p><p>4. For Seahorse experiments, data following oligomycin, rotenone, and antimycin A addition should be included.</p><p>5. Figure 1G: would removal of mannose further reduce hexose-6-phosphate levels?</p><p>6. When cell growth is restored after re-introduction of physiologic mannose as shown in Figure 2G, will these cells revert back to a normal cell cycle progression as shown in Figure 2B, or do they retain aberrant cell cycle progression patterns?</p><p>7. Figure 2I and J do not show BRdU incorporation into MPI-KO HT1080 cells under 50 μM mannose on day 6. Similarly, Figure 2H does not include p21 and p27 expression for day 6 in the 50 μM mannose condition. Please justify.</p><p>8. Inclusion of individual data points for each replicate within bar graphs would improve the reader's ability to interpret results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific Points:</p><p>The data in Figure 1. The induction of honeybee syndrome suppresses cell proliferation and increases chemosensitivity. Shows only modest changes in chemosensitivity and the discussion does not adequately express this. The authors should further discuss this.</p><p>Figure 3. These results are discussed almost exclusively in the context of DNA replication and cell cycle for the down regulated pathways. What about ribosomes?</p><p>The data are clear but it is hard to assess the variability in some of the assays since there is scant description of the variables particularly the cell sorting experiments to establish DNA replication and cell cycle.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Metabolic clogging of mannose triggers dNTP loss and genomic instability in human cancer cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard White (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The stable isotope tracing experiments have problems that leave this point unaddressed.

U-13C6-glucose is not suitable to assay the non-oxidative and oxidative branches of the PPP and thus the authors cannot conclude that mannose decreases flux into this pathway. The authors should use 1,2-C2-glucose tracing to draw these conclusions and also perform labeling with additional tracers (e.g. serine, glutamine, mannose) to parse where the defects in nucleotide synthesis are occurring.</p><p>3. The authors should address other issues raised in the comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done a good job addressing concerns about (1) extending their observations to a larger panel of MPI high and low cell lines, (2) further develop their characterization of the effects of mannose on the TCA cycle and dNTPs, and (3) examine the causality for dNTP depletion in genomic instability. However, the stable isotope tracing experiments have problems that leave this point unaddressed. The authors chose U-13C6-glucose instead of 1,2-C2-glucose, and this is suitable to assay the TCA cycle. However, it is unsuitable to assay the non-oxidative and oxidative branches of the PPP because these rapidly saturate and labeling in R5P from either branch cannot be distinguished. This is very evident in Figure 6—figure supplement 4, where both 6PG and S7P are completely labeled at all time points and both conditions, with only the total levels different. It is unclear why mannose decreases the fraction labeling in Ru5P + R5P specifically. Therefore, the authors cannot conclude that mannose decreases flux into the oxidative and non-oxidative branches of the PPP. Labeling in other pathways have problems. It is very difficult to distinguish the isotopologues because of the colors used and the legend, which has too many possibilities beyond the masses possible. G6P and F6P are not labeled downstream of 13C-glucose (even in low mannose conditions), but are labeled starting at the F1,6P stage, which is highly unlikely since downstream metabolite labeling cannot exceed upstream metabolite labeling. The tracing also does not provide insight into how mannose is impairing nucleotide synthesis – PRPP labeling is similar but IMP levels (but maybe not fraction labeling, it's unclear) dramatically decrease. Labeling with additional tracers (e.g. serine, glutamine, mannose) are really needed to parse where the defects in nucleotide synthesis are occurring, as suggested in the prior round of review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have somewhat addressed previous concerns. They evaluated additional cancer cell lines with high or low MPI expression, and the results are consistent with their overall conclusions. The authors have now shown that glutamine depletion reduces viability. However, it is surprising that the high mannose-challenged cells seem more resistant to glutamine starvation than unchallenged cells, given that mannose challenge severely blocks glucose flux into the TCA cycle. This needs to be resolved. Stable isotope tracing studies have not been performed in a satisfactory manner and do not support the manuscript's conclusions. The authors need to properly repeat tracing studies using 1,2-13C-glucose to determine glucose flux into oxidative vs. non-oxidative PPP as well as 13C-gluamine and 13C-mannose. Statistical analysis should be provided for Figure 6. Finally, the authors report that OCR is increased in mannose challenged cells, but there is no significant change in the NAD/NADH ratio. This should be resolved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83870.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should extend their observations to a larger panel of cell lines, including MPI high and low cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this insightful suggestion. With additional experiments carried out, we were able to highlight the phenotypic differences in mannose-caused genomic instability between MPI-KO and MPI<sup>low</sup> cancer cells.</p><p>We extended our observations regarding mannose-caused genomic instability to three human cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of MPI (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3A). These cell lines include one mannose-resistant MPI<sup>high</sup> cancer cell line (human ovarian cancer SK-OV-3 cells) and two mannose-sensitive MPI<sup>low</sup> cancer cell lines (human pancreatic cancer KP-4 cells and human non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cells), which were previously characterized by Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic> (Gonzalez et al., 2018). Consistent with the previous study, we found that mannose challenge (25 mM) significantly suppressed the proliferation of KP-4 and A549 cells, but not that of SK-OV-3 cells (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3B). Having confirmed mannose sensitivity in these cell lines, we analyzed the effects of mannose on the enhancement of cisplatin-induced genomic instability as the expression levels of γH2AX (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3C-F), revealing little enhancement of cisplatin-induced γH2AX by mannose challenge in all three cell lines. This indicates that mannose-caused genomic instability is a unique phenotype observed in the absence of MPI. According to these new findings, we have revised the text in the Result section (from page 12, lines 19-22) and the Discussion section (page 20, lines 4-8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should perform stable isotope tracing experiments to examine the activity of key metabolic pathways (e.g. the pentose phosphate pathway) instead of inferring activity from metabolite pool sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers for raising this important issue. As requested by reviewers 1 and 2, we performed stable isotope labeling experiments using [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose to examine the activity of key metabolic pathways in MPI-KO HT1080 cells. Reviewer 1 suggested the use of [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>1,2</sub>]-glucose for tracing the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) flux, but we decided to use [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose to unambiguously identify the labeled metabolites in both PPP and the downstream nucleotide metabolic pathways. Reviewer 2 suggested the use of stable isotope-labeled mannose and glutamine to strengthen our conclusion on mannose-mediated metabolic changes. However, we focused on the metabolic flux of [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose in this study because glucose metabolism is a primary target of mannose (Gonzalez et al., 2018). We will further dissect metabolic deficiency in honeybee syndrome by using [<sup>13</sup>C]-mannose and [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-glutamine in a future study.</p><p>We analyzed the metabolic flux of [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose into glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the mannose biosynthetic pathway (MBP), PPP and the purine and pyrimidine metabolic pathways. The MPI-KO HT1080 cells were preconditioned under mannose-challenged or unchallenged conditions before [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose labeling. In mannose-unchallenged cells, [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose was efficiently metabolized to [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>]-lactate and [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>]-pyruvate (Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Data S4), which progressively fueled the TCA cycle over the period of metabolic labeling (Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Data S4). In contrast, mannose challenge caused an incomplete, but substantial reduction in the flux of [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose into glycolysis (Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Data S4), and this glycolytic deficiency reduced the contribution of glucose to the TCA cycle (Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Data S4), as reported previously (Gonzalez et al., 2018). This result further suggested the importance of glutamine in fueling the TCA cycle in honeybee syndrome.</p><p>In MBP, GDP-mannose is produced from GTP and mannose-1-phosphate. In both mannose-challenged and unchallenged cells, GDP-mannose was progressively labeled with [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>], which was most likely derived from [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]-ribose (Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and Data S4). Interestingly, we found a significant increase in the steady-state pool of GDP-mannose in mannose-challenged cells, while this increase was not proportional to the increase in the pools of mannose-6-phosphate and mannose-1-phosphate (as the sum with glucose-1-phosphate) (Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and Data S4), implying that the formation of GDP-mannose is a rate-limiting step in MBP.</p><p>In PPP, mannose challenge reduced the flux of [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose to both oxidative and non-oxidative arms in MPI-KO HT1080 cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 4 and Data S4), as reported previously in MPI<sup>low</sup> cancer cells (Gonzalez et al., 2018). Unexpectedly, however, the levels of [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]-5-phosphoribosyl-1-diphosphate (PRPP), which is synthesized from ribose-5-phosphate, were almost comparable between mannose-challenged and unchallenged cells (Figure 6 and Data S4). More surprisingly, mannose-challenged cells showed very little flux of [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>]-PRPP into inosine-5’-phosphate and xanthosine-5’-phosphate in purine metabolism (Figure 6 and Data S4) and orotidine-5’-phosphate in pyrimidine metabolism (Figure 6—figure supplement 5 and Data S4), accompanying nearly the complete loss of newly synthesized pools of (deoxy)ribonucleotides (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 5 and Data S4). In accordance with these new findings, we have revised the text in the Result section (from page 15, line 19 to page 17, line 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should further develop their metabolic characterization of the consequences of the inability to metabolize mannose, including the effects on the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation and dNTP depletion as requested by reviewers #1 and #2.</p></disp-quote><p>This request is closely related to the issue raised in Essential revision 2. With additional experiments carried out, we have better characterized the impact of honeybee syndrome on the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and dNTP depletion as follows.</p><p>The impact of honeybee syndrome on the TCA cycle and OXPHOS</p><p>Our stable isotope labeling experiments clearly demonstrate that mannose challenge substantially reduces the contribution of glucose to fueling the TCA cycle in MPI-KO HT1080 cells (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2). However, the intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio remained relatively constant between mannose-challenged and unchallenged cells (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2C, D). Glutaminolysis can contribute to the TCA cycle and thus OXPHOS in cancer cells (Yang et al., 2017). As expected, glutamine depletion greatly reduced the cell viability of both mannose-challenged and mannose-unchallenged cells (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2E, F), suggesting an important role of glutamine in fueling the TCA cycle and OXPHOS in honeybee syndrome. In accordance with these new findings, we have revised the text in the Result section (page 15, lines 6-11).</p><p>Although we could not show a clear correlation between the activation states of OXPHOS and NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio in honeybee syndrome, our seahorse experiments demonstrated that honeybee syndrome increases OCR (Figure 5A, B), which could arise from compensatory activation of glutaminolysis for decreased glucose contribution to the TCA cycle. We will further investigate the impact of honeybee syndrome on mitochondrial functions in a future study. Irrespective of the mechanisms involved, we believe that this limitation will not affect the conclusion of this study, and hope that the reviewers will agree with our view.</p><p>The impact of honeybee syndrome on dNTP depletion</p><p>The pool size of dNTPs is tightly regulated in order to meet and not to exceed cellular demands by cell cycle-dependent and DNA damage-dependent expression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of dNTPs (Franzolin et al., 2013), as well as their allosteric regulation (Aye et al., 2015; Ji et al., 2013). This tight regulation of dNTP supply is vital to prevent cells from suffering the dNTP pool imbalance, which causes genomic instability (Kumar et al., 2010; Pajalunga et al., 2017). Our proteomic analysis revealed that mannose challenge rapidly increases the expression of RRM2B (Data S1), which is a rate-limiting and TP53-inducible subunit of RNR (Hakansson et al., 2006; Tanaka et al., 2000), indicating that the equilibrium of dNTP metabolism shifted toward biosynthesis at the protein level. However, mannose challenge caused substantial reductions in the pool of ATP, which is a key allosteric regulator for the catalysis of RNR to occur (Brignole et al., 2018). Moreover, mannose challenge impaired the early steps of purine and pyrimidine metabolism, which in turn limited the de novo pool of ribonucleoside diphosphates essential for RNR reaction. Little metabolic flux of PRPP into purine and pyrimidine metabolism in honeybee syndrome can explain why the pool of newly synthesized PRPP was preserved even in the absence of maximal metabolic activity of PPP. A recent in-depth metabolomic study revealed the mannose-mediated downregulation of metabolic activity of glycolysis and PPP in MPI<sup>low</sup> cancer cells (Gonzalez et al., 2018), although its impact on the downstream nucleotide metabolism remains to be explored. Fueling the salvage pathway of purine and pyrimidine metabolism with hypoxanthine and thymidine (new Figure 6—figure supplement 6A) or with deoxyribonucleoside mixture (new Figure 6—figure supplement 6B) was not sufficient to improve the defects in proliferation of mannose-challenged MPI-KO HT1080 cells, suggesting the critical role of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis in supporting cell proliferation in this cell model. Notably, although dNTPs are essential for DNA repair, the chemosensitizing effect of mannose was rather modest when comparing it with that of deficiency in genes for DNA repair processes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, <italic>FANCA</italic> and <italic>FANCD2</italic>) (Bruno et al., 2017; Sakai et al., 2008). This apparent discrepancy most likely arises from the fact that the suppression of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis by honeybee syndrome is incomplete. Taken together, our findings indicate that the insufficient metabolic activity of purine and pyrimidine metabolism in honeybee syndrome causes the loss of dNTPs. Accordingly, we have revised the text in the Discussion section (from page 20, line 17 to page 21, line 22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should demonstrate causality for dNTP depletion in the reduction of proliferation and cell cycle perturbation.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s comment. As discussed in our response to Essential revision 3, fueling the salvage pathway of purine and pyrimidine metabolism with hypoxanthine and thymidine (new Figure 6—figure supplement 6A) or with deoxyribonucleoside (dN) mixture (new Figure 6—figure supplement 6B) was not sufficient to improve the defects in proliferation of mannose-challenged cells, suggesting the critical role of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis in supporting cell proliferation in this cell model. Consistent with this, the supplementation of mannose-challenged or unchallenged MPI-KO HT1080 cells with dN mixture could not improve the incorporation of 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>) and chemosensitivity (Figure R1B, C), except for a slight improvement of the chemosensitivity by dN supplementation in unchallenged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Although we found that honeybee syndrome reduces the biosynthetic capacity of nucleotides, we do not currently understand the precise molecular mechanism behind this metabolic deficiency, making it difficult for us to further investigate the causality of dNTP depletion in the anti-cancer activity of mannose.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The effects of deoxyribonucleoside supplementation on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis and chemosensitivity in MPI-KO HT1080 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The percentage of MPI-KO HT1080 (#3) cells that were actively incorporating 2-bromo-5-deoxyuridine (BrdU<sup>+</sup>).

Mannose challenge also decreased the expression of several large ribosomal subunit proteins. Ribosome biogenesis stress has been identified as a major mechanism by which oxaliplatin kills cancer cells in a DNA damage response-independent manner (Bruno et al., 2017). Moreover, mannose challenge upregulated proteins involved in ferroptosis and necroptosis. These two programmed cell death mechanisms are considered as an effective approach to overcome chemoresistance (Zhang et al., 2022) or to eradicate apoptosis-resistant cancer cells (Su et al., 2016).

The results clearly indicate that mannose causes sever defects in the early stages of purine and pyrimidine metabolism as follows.</p><p>To further elucidate the impacts of mannose challenge on the biosynthesis of dNTPs, we performed [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose tracer experiments that, unlike steady-state metabolomics, allow to estimate the activity of glucose-related metabolic pathways by analyzing the fractional enrichment of the metabolites in a dynamic labeling phase (Lorkiewicz et al., 2019). The MPI-KO HT1080 cells were preconditioned under mannose-challenged or -unchallenged conditions before [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose labeling. The <sup>13</sup>C-labeling of most metabolites detected in glycolysis, the PPP and the TCA cycle (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A) already reached isotopic steady states within 30 min in both mannose-challenged and unchallenged cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B), most likely due to their high metabolic activity (Jang et al., 2018; Lorkiewicz et al., 2019). In contrast to these central metabolic pathways, metabolites in purine and pyrimidine metabolism showed a dynamic or sub-dynamic labeling in mannose-challenged cells.</p><p>Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is an essential ribose donor substrate for the biosynthesis of nucleotides in both purine and pyrimidine metabolism (Figure 6A, B and Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). Fractional enrichment of <sup>13</sup>C-PRPP (M+5) was saturated at 30 min in unchallenged cells, while it was still in a sub-dynamic labeling phase in mannose-challenged cells (Figure 6C). Despite this slower fractional enrichment, the pool size of <sup>13</sup>C-PRPP (M+5) in mannose-challenged cells was similar to that in unchallenged cells (Figure 6D), implying that mannose challenge reduced the utilization of PRPP for nucleotide biosynthesis. Consistent with this assumption, we found a marked reduction in both the fractional enrichment and the pool size of <sup>13</sup>C-purine metabolic intermediates (M+5) in mannose-challenged cells, which included inosine-5’-monophosphate (IMP; Figure 6 E, F), adenosine-5’-monophosphate (AMP; Figure 6 G, H) and guanosine-5’-monophosphate (GMP; Figure 6 I, J).</p><p>PRPP is utilized for both de novo and salvage synthesis of purine nucleotides (Figure 6A), and therefore the M+5 fraction of <sup>13</sup>C-IMP, <sup>13</sup>C-AMP and <sup>13</sup>C-GMP can be accounted for the sum of their de novo and salvage pools. In contrast, purine nucleotides with the labeled fractions greater than M+5 can originate from de novo synthesis (Figure 6A). We found a progressive increase in the M+6 fraction of <sup>13</sup>C-IMP, <sup>13</sup>C-AMP and <sup>13</sup>C-GMP in unchallenged cells (Figure 6E, G and I), suggesting that <sup>13</sup>C-10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (CHO-THF; M+1), which is produced de novo via the glycolysis-serine biosynthesis-folate cycle (GSF) axis (Figure 6A) (Yang and Vousden, 2016), contributed to the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides. Although we could not directly detect <sup>13</sup>C-labeling in serine and CHO-THF in our metabolomic analysis, the fractional enrichment and the pool size of <sup>13</sup>C-glycine (M+2), which is a signature metabolite produced in coupled with 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate via the GSF axis, progressively increased in unchallenged cells (Figure 6K, L). However, the fractional enrichment and the pool size of <sup>13</sup>C-glycine (M+2) largely decreased in mannose-challenged cells (Figure 6K, L), suggesting that the GSF axis is compromised in these cells. These results may partly explain why the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides is limited in honeybee syndrome.</p><p>In the early stage of pyrimidine metabolism, aspartate (Asp) is transferred to carbamoyl phosphate, giving rise to <italic>N</italic>-carbamoyl aspartate (carbamoyl Asp) (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). We found a progressive increase in the M+2, M+3 and M+4 fractions of both <sup>13</sup>C-Asp (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B, C) and <sup>13</sup>C-carbamoyl Asp (Figure 6—figure supplement 2D, E) at similar labeling rates in unchallenged cells. The <sup>13</sup>C-Asp (M+2, M+3 and M+4) could originate from [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose-derived oxaloacetate that is formed in the first, second and third rounds of the TCA cycle (Figure 6—figure supplement 2F), as indicated by the presence of the M+2, M+3 and M+4 fractions of <sup>13</sup>C-malate (Figure 6—figure supplement 2G, H). However, mannose challenge severely decreased the fractional enrichment of both <sup>13</sup>C-Asp (M+2, M+3 and M+4) and <sup>13</sup>C-carbamoyl Asp (M+2, M+3 and M+4) (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B, D). In contrast, the pool size of <sup>13</sup>C-Asp (M+2) remained relatively unchanged between mannose-challenged and -unchallenged cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 2C), while the pool size of <sup>13</sup>C-carbamoyl Asp (M+2) greatly decreased in mannose-challenged cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 2E), indicating that mannose challenge reduced the utilization of Asp in pyrimidine metabolism. In the immediate downstream metabolites of carbamoyl Asp, we could detect significant amounts of uridine-5’-monophosphate (UMP), and found that a large majority of <sup>13</sup>C-UMP formed in unchallenged cells was consisted of the M+5 fraction (Figure 6—figure supplement 2I, J). This fraction was most likely to originate from unlabeled carbamoyl Asp (Figure 6—figure supplement 2K) and <sup>13</sup>C-PRPP (M+5). Moreover, we identified the M+6, M+7 and M+8 fractions of <sup>13</sup>C-UMP in unchallenged cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 2I), indicating that both <sup>13</sup>C-carbamoyl Asp (M+2, M+3 and M+4) and <sup>13</sup>C-PRPP (M+5) contributed to forming <sup>13</sup>C-orotidine-5’-monophosphate (M+7, M+8 and M+9), which is decarboxylated to give <sup>13</sup>C-UMP (M+6, M+7 and M+8). However, mannose-challenged cells showed a substantial reduction of <sup>13</sup>C-UMP in both the fractional enrichment (M+5, M+6, M+7 and M+8) and the pool size (M+5) (Figure 6—figure supplement 2I, J), clearly indicating that mannose challenge impaired the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. As expected, dNTPs showed little <sup>13</sup>C enrichment (dATP and dGTP, Figure 6—figure supplement 3A−E) and a very low <sup>13</sup>C enrichment (dTTP and dCTP, Figure 6—figure supplement 3F−J) in mannose-challenged cells as compared with those in unchallenged cells. Taken all these findings together, mannose challenge impairs both purine and pyrimidine metabolism at the early stage, thereby potentially limiting the de novo synthesis of dNTPs.</p><p>Accordingly, we revised the Results section (from page 15, line 18 to page 18, line 17) and the Discussion section (page 22, lines 4-8 and page 22, lines 12-13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Labeling with additional tracers (e.g. serine, glutamine, mannose) are really needed to parse where the defects in nucleotide synthesis are occurring, as suggested in the prior round of review.</p></disp-quote><p>The results obtained from our [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-glucose tracing experiments have now indicated that mannose challenge impairs the early stages of the de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.
