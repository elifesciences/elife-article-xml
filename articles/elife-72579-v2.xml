The proatherogenic and atheroprotective effects of <italic>d-flow</italic> and <italic>s-flow</italic> are mediated in part by the global changes in endothelial cell (EC) gene expression, which regulates endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. Previously, we identified kallikrein-related peptidase 10 (<italic>Klk10</italic>, a secreted serine protease) as a flow-sensitive gene in mouse arterial ECs, but its role in endothelial biology and atherosclerosis was unknown. Here, we show that KLK10 is upregulated under <italic>s-flow</italic> conditions and downregulated under <italic>d-flow</italic> conditions using in vivo mouse models and in vitro studies with cultured ECs. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and scATAC sequencing (scATACseq) study using the partial carotid ligation mouse model showed flow-regulated <italic>Klk10</italic> expression at the epigenomic and transcription levels. Functionally, KLK10 protected against <italic>d-flow</italic>-induced permeability dysfunction and inflammation in human artery ECs, as determined by NFκB activation, expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intracellular adhesion molecule 1, and monocyte adhesion. Furthermore, treatment of mice in vivo with rKLK10 decreased arterial endothelial inflammation in <italic>d-flow</italic> regions. Additionally, rKLK10 injection or ultrasound-mediated transfection of <italic>Klk10</italic>-expressing plasmids inhibited atherosclerosis in <italic>Apoe</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Moreover, KLK10 expression was significantly reduced in human coronary arteries with advanced atherosclerotic plaques compared to those with less severe plaques. KLK10 is a flow-sensitive endothelial protein that serves as an anti-inflammatory, barrier-protective, and anti-atherogenic factor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>atherosclerosis</kwd><kwd>kallikreins</kwd><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd><kwd>shear stress</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL119798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jo</surname><given-names>Hanjoong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL145974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Darian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL139757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jo</surname><given-names>Hanjoong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001062</institution-id><institution>Wallace H Coulter Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jo</surname><given-names>Hanjoong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL104165 and HL142975</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mosnier</surname><given-names>Laurent O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C24523/A25192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tate</surname><given-names>Edward W</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Leran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000030</institution-id><institution>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LaSSI 201706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pohl</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>KLK10 is a flow-sensitive endothelial protein that serves as an anti-inflammatory, barrier-protective, and anti-atherogenic factor with therapeutic potential.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease that preferentially occurs in branched or curved arterial regions exposed to disturbed flow (<italic>d-flow),</italic> while areas of stable flow (<italic>s-flow</italic>) are protected from atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiu and Chien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tarbell et al., 2014</xref>).

The tissue KLKs are distinct from plasma kallikrein, which is encoded on a separate chromosome (4q35) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yousef and Diamandis, 2003</xref>). Despite the chromosomal clustering of the KLKs, each enzyme has a unique tissue expression pattern with different cellular functions. Typically, the KLKs are produced as inactive full-length prepropeptides, which are then secreted and activated by a complex process to yield active extracellular enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yousef and Diamandis, 2003</xref>). KLKs are involved in a wide variety of processes ranging from skin desquamation to tooth development, hypertension, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madeddu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clements et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yousef and Diamandis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pampalakis and Sotiropoulou, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Margolius, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell, 2001</xref>).</p><p>KLK10 was initially discovered as a potential tumor suppressor with its expression downregulated in breast, prostate, testicular, and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goyal et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).

For the scRNAseq and scATACseq study, single cells and nuclei obtained from the LCAs and RCAs, respectively, at 2 days or 2 weeks after the PCL were used. As described previously, the carotid artery wall cells were identified as EC clusters (E1–E8), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), fibroblasts (Fibro), monocytes/macrophages (Mo1–4), dendritic cells (DCs), and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andueza et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>). E1–E4 clusters consisted of ECs exposed to acute and chronic <italic>s-flow</italic> conditions (2 days and 2 weeks). E5–E7 clusters consisted of ECs exposed to acute <italic>d-flow</italic> (2 days). E8 cells were exclusively found in the chronic <italic>d-flow</italic> condition (2 weeks). As shown in the scRNAseq data analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), <italic>Klk10</italic> transcript expression is highest in <italic>s-flow</italic> (E2 and E3) and decreases in response to acute (E5 and E7) and chronic (E6 and E8) <italic>d-flow</italic>. It also shows <italic>Klk10</italic> expression is specific to ECs and not expressed in other cell types studied in the carotid artery. Similarly, scATACseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) showed that the <italic>Klk10</italic> promoter region is open and accessible (indicating active transcription status) only in ECs exposed to <italic>s-flow</italic> conditions but closed and inaccessible (indicating inactive transcription status) in ECs under <italic>d-flow</italic> conditions and all other non-EC types. Together, both the scRNAseq and scATACseq results demonstrate that <italic>Klk10</italic> expression is potently regulated by flow in ECs at the epigenomic and transcriptome level, supporting the in vitro and in vivo results shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–g</xref>). Importantly, all non-EC types in the carotid artery express nearly undetectable levels of <italic>Klk10</italic> mRNA transcript and also display closed chromatin accessibility in the <italic>Klk10</italic> promoter region, demonstrating that <italic>Klk10</italic> is primarily expressed by ECs. This suggests that KLK10 protein observed in nonendothelial layers, including the adventitia and subendothelial layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), is unlikely to be originated from cell types other than ECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>KLK10 inhibits endothelial inflammation and protects permeability barrier</title><p>We next tested if KLK10 regulates EC function by evaluating its role in endothelial inflammatory response, tube formation, migration, proliferation, and apoptosis, which play critical roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

They further show that Klk10 overexpression or recombinant Klk10 administration reduces monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, lessens endothelial permeability, and reduces inflammatory induction of ICAM1 and VCAM1 -- all of which are canonical indicators of endothelial activation. The authors then demonstrate in a mouse model of atherosclerosis that exogenous Klk10 reduces plaque development in a cholesterol and triglyceride independent manner, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the anti-atherosclerotic effect of Klk10 is mediated in/on the endothelium.</p><p>The investigators go on to show that the ability of overexpressed and recombinant Klk10 to reduce monocyte adhesion depends on PAR1 and PAR2, implicating these receptors as targets of Klk10; they further demonstrate that while Klk10 has serine protease activity, overexpressed/recombinant Klk10 does not induce the cleavage of PAR1 or PAR2.</p><p>The authors then determine through affinity pulldown and mass spectrometry that HTRA1, VEGFA, and VATB2 bind to Klk10. They further investigate HTRA1 and find that knockdown of HTRA1 results in increased endothelial activation. Additionally, they find that HTRA1 is upregulated by oscillatory shear (OS) relative to linear shear (LS), which is opposite the effect OS and LS have on Klk10.</p><p>Lastly, Williams et al., find that Klk10 levels are higher in advanced human atherosclerotic plaques that in early plaques.</p><p>These results demonstrate that Klk10 is an import regulator of endothelial activation and atherosclerotic plaque development.

However, the authors only assay monocyte adhesion, whereas in other sections of the paper, endothelial permeability and the expression of VCAM1 and ICAM1 are used as additional measures of endothelial activation. Do PAR1 and PAR2 not mediate the effect of Klk10 on these other phenotypes?</p><p>The effect of oscillatory shear on HTRA1 is demonstrated in vitro (Figure 7e, S12a) but not in vivo (Figure S13a). The expression of Klk10 and Htra1 appear to be largely concordant among the scRNA-seq endothelial clusters from Andueza et al., (except for E8). Additionally, endothelial activation appears to be increased by HTRA1 knockdown (Figure 7d-g) in OS conditions, which seemingly contradicts the results in Figure 7d-g. Lastly, the experiment in Figure 7h-i was performed under LS conditions, which is different than the conditions under which the other endothelial activation experiments were performed (Figure 7d-g).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors showed previously that the peptidase KLK10 is expressed by endothelial cells in response to stable laminar flow whereas its expression is suppressed under disturbed flow. They now report on an exploration of the potential function of KLK10 in endothelial cells and provide some evidence that KLK10 is involved in mediating the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effect of stable laminar flow. The study is of potential interest; however, some of the conclusions need to be better supported by experimental data, the underlying mechanism remains still rather unclear, and there are also some conceptual issues.</p><p>1. A large part of the experiments is based on the use of recombinant KLK10. It is not clear whether the employed concentrations are similar to those found under physiological conditions. It may be difficult to measure them in tissues, but a rough estimation would be helpful to understand this a little better. In Figure 2a, it looks as if KLK10 expression has an effect on the basal adhesion of monocytes (in the absence of TNFα). This should be tested directly. The effect of recombinant KLK10 appears to be smaller (Figure 2b). Is there an explanation for this difference?</p><p>2. When giving recombinant KLK10 systemically (e.g. Figure 2j and k, Figure 4), the authors gave injections (where?) every two days or twice per week. What is the plasma half-life of KLK10? It is important to know how long KLK10 is present at particular concentrations in the blood to interpret the effects of the chosen dosage scheme.</p><p>3. Data presented in Figure 2j and k are not clear. How was VCAM1 expression quantified? It would be good to have a counterstain to normalize expression. In any case, the subtle effect of recombinant KLK10 on endothelial VCAM1 expression in the greater curvature shown in the statistical analysis (Figure 2k) is not reflected by the image (Figure 2j), which shows a dramatic reduction in VCAM1 staining. Please explain how staining intensity was compared between different groups of animals. Also the graph in Figure 2k is unclear. The figure legend says that VCAM1 expression is presented as fold change normalized to control LC condition, but the numbering of the ordinate shows a value of about 125.</p><p>4. For the experiments shown in Figure 5 it is very important to prove expression of KLK10 in endothelial cells of the carotid artery. The data presented in Figure 5f are not clear, and the images are of rather poor quality. Higher magnified images should be shown. Why is there a strong signal for KLK10 in the adventitia in the test group but not in the Luc control?</p><p>5. The experiments shown in Figure 6a and b are key experiments testing an involvement of PAR1/2 in the effects of KLK10. While the authors used both, a knockdown and a pharmacological inhibitor approach, they only tested effects on monocyte adhesion. This needs to be extended to other readouts including downstream signaling (NFκB) and expression of inflammatory genes to rule out unspecific effects on one readout system. Do the authors have an explanation why inhibition of PAR2 in combination with recombinant KLK10 leads to an increase in monocyte adhesion whereas both alone have no effect?</p><p>6. The data indicating a role of HTRA1 in the effect of KLK10 are for various reasons still not clear and certainly not strong enough to support the conclusion. The authors show that HTRA1 can cleave KLK10, but it remains completely unclear what the consequences of this are. Somehow the authors seem to propose that cleavage of KLK10 is required for KLK10 to activate PAR receptors (at least, that is what Figure 9 and the corresponding figure legend suggests). However, no experiments have been performed to support this. It should be possible to test whether cleaved KLK10 fragments function as activators of PARs.</p><p>7. I also have a general conceptual problem: If it is true that the effect of KLK10 depends on HTRA1, it is difficult to understand how this would function under in vivo conditions, since the effect of KLK10 is in particular relevant under conditions of laminar stable flow when KLK10 is upregulated, whereas under these conditions HTRA1 expression is low or hardly measureable (e.g. blot in Figure 7e). Since the relationship of HTRA1 and KLK10 is studied using exogenously added recombinant KLK10, direct or indirect functional interactions can be seen, but it remains completely unclear whether they occur also when endogenously expressed proteins are studied.</p><p>8. Vascular PAR receptors seem to have complex mechanisms and roles in the progression of atherosclerosis and some studies show pro- as well as antiatherogenic/antiinflammatory effects (e.g. Minami et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 24:41 (2004); Kim et al., Sci. Rep. 8:15172 (2018); Seitz et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 27:769 (2007); Archiniegas et al., DNA Cell Biol. 23:815 (2004)). The authors argue solely on the basis of an anti-inflammatory antiatherogenic role of endothelial PAR1/2. This point needs to be discussed adequately.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72579.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More clarity supporting the claimed endothelial specific expression of KLK10 with better images and clearer explanations of VCAM1 quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important point about endothelial-specific KLK10 expression, we carried out a new co-immunostaining study using antibodies to CD31 (as an endothelial cell marker) and KLK10. As shown in Figures 1b and 6f, KLK10 protein is found in the luminal endothelial cells, but it was also found in the adventitia and occasionally observed in the subendothelial layer as well (Figures 1b and 6f). In addition, KLK10 is also found throughout the LCA plaques in mice overexpressing KLK10 plasmid (Figure 6f). It is important to note that our single-cell RNAseq and ATACseq analyses of KLK10 expression in the mouse carotid artery clearly demonstrate that KLK10 mRNA is highly expressed only in endothelial cells but not in other cell types including the smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells (Figures 1K and 1L; Figures S8a and S9a). In addition, KLK10 is a secreted protein, which could be released to the circulation to be found in other locations including the adventitia and diffuse to the sub-endothelial layer. Therefore, we conclude that KLK10 protein signals observed in the sub-endothelial and adventitial layers are most likely not to be originated from the residential (non-endothelial) cells, while KLK10 is directly produced in endothelial cells.</p><p>These changes have been made as follows:</p><p>Result for Figure 1</p><p>“Importantly, all non-endothelial cell types in the carotid artery express nearly undetectable levels of KLK10 mRNA transcript and also display closed chromatin accessibility in the KLK10 promoter region, demonstrating that KLK10 is primarily expressed by ECs. This suggests that KLK10 protein observed in non-endothelial layers, including the adventitia and sub-endothelial layer (Figure 1b), is unlikely to be originated from cell types other than ECs.”</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“The KLK10 mRNA transcript was primarily found in ECs, while KLK10 protein was found not only in ECs but also in the adventitia and subendothelial layer (Figure 1). It is important to note that our single-cell RNAseq and ATACseq analyses of KLK10 expression in the mouse carotid artery clearly demonstrate that KLK10 mRNA is highly expressed only in endothelial cells but not in other cell types including the smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, or immune cells (Figures 1K and 1L; Figures S8a and S9a). In addition, KLK10 is a secreted protein, which could be released to the circulation to be found in other locations including the adventitia and diffuse to the subendothelial layer. Therefore, we conclude that KLK10 protein signals observed in the subendothelial and adventitial layers are likely to be originated from ECs.”</p><p>To address the comment regarding the clearer explanations of the VCAM1 quantification, we reanalyzed the staining result and replaced the images with representative images (Figures 2j and S5a). We used three Z-sections showing the endothelial layer using the internal elastic laminar as a reference from each tissue samples to quantify VCAM1 expression in the intimal layer (Orthogonal image shown in Figure S6). The VCAM1 fluorescence intensity was quantified using the NIH Image J program as detailed in the Methods. We found that rKLK10 treatment showed a decreasing trend in the VCAM1 expression in the greater curvature region, but it did not reach statistical significance (Figure 2k). Thank you for pointing out an error in the Figure 2k label, which we corrected in the new Figure 2k.</p><p>These changes have been made in Figures 2j, 2k, S5a, and S6 and addressed in the accompanying Methods section as follows:</p><p>“We used three Z-sections showing the endothelial layer using the internal elastic laminar as a reference from each tissue samples to quantify VCAM1 or KLK10 expression in the ECs (Orthogonal image shown in Figure S6).

In response to this comment and Reviewer #1- C2, we carried out an additional study to compare the anti-inflammatory effect of rKLK10 to rKLK8 and rKLK11. We chose these two others since they are the only other KLK family members highly expressed in endothelial cells (Figure S10) and are also closely related to KLK10<sup>1</sup>. We found that rKLK10, but not rKLK8 and rKLK11, inhibited monocyte adhesion and VCAM1 expression in response to TNFa in HAECs (Figure S12).

Yet they did not completely establish how these elements come together to regulate inflammation and plaque progression.</p><p>Specific points are noted below:</p><p>In figure 1b, it is surprising that RCA imaging shows KLK10 expression in the sub-endothelial compartment, but authors comment that KLK10 is expressed uniquely in endothelium.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful and constructive comments. To address this important point about endothelial-specific KLK10 expression, we carried out a new co-immunostaining study using antibodies to CD31 (as an endothelial cell marker) and KLK10. As shown in Figures 1b and 6f, KLK10 expression is found in the luminal endothelial cells and in the adventitia. Also, KLK10 is occasionally observed in the subendothelial layer as well (Figures 1b and 6f). In addition, KLK10 is also found throughout the LCA plaques in mice overexpressing KLK10 plasmid (Figure 6f). It is important to note that our single-cell RNAseq and ATACseq analyses of KLK10 expression in the mouse carotid artery clearly demonstrate that KLK10 mRNA is highly expressed only in endothelial cells but not in other cell types including the smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells (Figures 1K and 1L; Figures S8a and S9a). In addition, KLK10 is a secreted protein, which could be released to the circulation to be found in other locations including the adventitia and diffuse to the sub-endothelial layer. Therefore, we conclude that KLK10 protein signals observed in the sub-endothelial and adventitial layers are most likely not to be originated from the residential cells, while KLK10 is directly produced in endothelial cells.</p><p>The new co-immunostaining study has been added as Figure 6f and addressed in the discussion and Results section as follows:</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Importantly, all non-endothelial cell types in the carotid artery express nearly undetectable levels of KLK10 mRNA transcript and also display closed chromatin accessibility in the KLK10 promoter region, demonstrating that KLK10 is primarily expressed by ECs.

Data presented in Figure 2j and k are not clear. How was VCAM1 expression quantified? It would be good to have a counterstain to normalize expression. In any case, the subtle effect of recombinant KLK10 on endothelial VCAM1 expression in the greater curvature shown in the statistical analysis (Figure 2k) is not reflected by the image (Figure 2j), which shows a dramatic reduction in VCAM1 staining.

For the experiments shown in Figure 5 it is very important to prove expression of KLK10 in endothelial cells of the carotid artery. The data presented in Figure 5f are not clear, and the images are of rather poor quality. Higher magnified images should be shown. Why is there a strong signal for KLK10 in the adventitia in the test group but not in the Luc control?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important point about endothelial-specific KLK10 expression, we carried out a new co-immunostaining study using antibodies to CD31 (as an endothelial cell marker) and KLK10.

Also, KLK10 is occasionally observed in the subendothelial layer as well (Figures 1b and 6f). In addition, KLK10 is also found throughout the LCA plaques in mice overexpressing KLK10 plasmid (Figure 6f). It is important to note that our single-cell RNAseq and ATACseq analyses of KLK10 expression in the mouse carotid artery clearly demonstrate that KLK10 mRNA is highly expressed only in endothelial cells but not in other cell types including the smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells (Figures 1K and 1L; Figures S8a and S9a). In addition, KLK10 is a secreted protein, which could be released to the circulation to be found in other locations including the adventitia and diffuse to the sub-endothelial layer.

The experiments shown in Figure 6a and b are key experiments testing an involvement of PAR1/2 in the effects of KLK10. While the authors used both, a knockdown and a pharmacological inhibitor approach, they only tested effects on monocyte adhesion. This needs to be extended to other readouts including downstream signaling (NFκB) and expression of inflammatory genes to rule out unspecific effects on one readout system. Do the authors have an explanation why inhibition of PAR2 in combination with recombinant KLK10 leads to an increase in monocyte adhesion whereas both alone have no effect?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Editor’s Comment #4, we have removed all data related to PAR1/2 and revised the Results and Discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The data indicating a role of HTRA1 in the effect of KLK10 are for various reasons still not clear and certainly not strong enough to support the conclusion. The authors show that HTRA1 can cleave KLK10, but it remains completely unclear what the consequences of this are. Somehow the authors seem to propose that cleavage of KLK10 is required for KLK10 to activate PAR receptors (at least, that is what Figure 9 and the corresponding figure legend suggests). However, no experiments have been performed to support this. It should be possible to test whether cleaved KLK10 fragments function as activators of PARs.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Editor’s Comment #4, we have removed all data related to PAR1/2 and HTRA1, and revised the Results and Discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I also have a general conceptual problem: If it is true that the effect of KLK10 depends on HTRA1, it is difficult to understand how this would function under in vivo conditions, since the effect of KLK10 is in particular relevant under conditions of laminar stable flow when KLK10 is upregulated, whereas under these conditions HTRA1 expression is low or hardly measureable (e.g. blot in Figure 7e). Since the relationship of HTRA1 and KLK10 is studied using exogenously added recombinant KLK10, direct or indirect functional interactions can be seen, but it remains completely unclear whether they occur also when endogenously expressed proteins are studied.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Editor’s Comment #4, we have removed all data related to PAR1/2 and HTRA1, and revised the Results and Discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.
