DCX lead to a spectrum of neurological disorders. The structural properties of MT-bound DCX that explain these disorders are incompletely determined. Here, we describe the molecular architecture of the DCX–MT complex through an integrative modeling approach that combines data from X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and a high-fidelity chemical crosslinking method. We demonstrate that DCX interacts with MTs through its N-terminal domain and induces a lattice-dependent self-association involving the C-terminal structured domain and its disordered tail, in a conformation that favors an open, domain-swapped state. The networked state can accommodate multiple different attachment points on the MT lattice, all of which orient the C-terminal tails away from the lattice. As numerous disease mutations cluster in the C-terminus, and regulatory phosphorylations cluster in its tail, our study shows that lattice-driven self-assembly is an important property of DCX.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Doublecortin</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>integrative modeling</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008313</institution-id><institution>Canarie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RS-326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schriemer</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2017-04879</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schriemer</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2020-04876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brouhard</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-148702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brouhard</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Doublecortin activates its C-terminal domain when its N-terminal domain engages the microtubule lattice, leading to self-associations that explain the stabilizing effect of Doublecortin in neuronal migration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The regulation of microtubule (MT) polymerization is central to the maintenance of cell polarity, intracellular transport, and cell division. Aside from the intrinsic dynamics of the MT itself, polymer nucleation, growth, and disassembly are coordinated by many different microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to establish and manage the wider cytoskeleton in a cell-type-dependent manner. One significant regulator of MT dynamics in developing neurons is the X-linked <italic>doublecortin</italic> gene. Doublecortin (DCX) is a 40-kDa MAP, essential for neuronal migration in embryonic and postnatal brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">des Portes et al., 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gleeson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Francis et al., 1999</xref>). DCX influences MT rigidity and curvature and selects for the canonical 13-protofilament geometry that is characteristic of most eukaryotic MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moores et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jean et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bechstedt and Brouhard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechstedt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ettinger et al., 2016</xref>). It also increases the nucleation rate and decreases the catastrophe rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moores et al., 2006</xref>), producing a net stabilization of MTs.</p><p>Mutations in the <italic>doublecortin</italic> gene result in lissencephaly (‘smooth brain’) or subcortical band heterotopia, both of which can generate a spectrum of intellectual disabilities and/or epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">des Portes et al., 1998b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gleeson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">des Portes et al., 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gleeson et al., 1999</xref>). These mutations impair binding of DCX to MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>) but the structural basis for this effect remains unclear. DCX consists of a tandem repeat of Doublecortin-like (DC) domains possessing 27% sequence identity, an N-terminal tail (N-tail), a linker region, and a long Serine/Proline-rich C-terminal tail (C-tail) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2016</xref>). Both of the DC domains and the linker region are necessary for the MT stabilization effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2003</xref>), whereas the C-terminal DC domain (CDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>) and the C-tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moores et al., 2004</xref>) help establish the preference for 13-protofilament MTs. The C-tail is also implicated in regulating MT–actin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jean et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsukada et al., 2005</xref>). Structures are only available for the isolated N-terminal DC domain (NDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cierpicki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2016</xref>) and the CDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rufer et al., 2018</xref>). For the most part, these structures share the same globular ubiquitin-like fold, although the CDC may adopt a substantially opened form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rufer et al., 2018</xref>). Disease mutations cluster in both of the structured domains, suggesting a functional conservation based upon a shared property, possibly a direct interaction with the MT lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) investigations of the DCX–MT interaction reveal that one of the two structured domain binds to MTs at the junction of four α/β-tubulin dimers, stabilizing the longitudinal protofilament and its lateral contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fourniol et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Given the modest resolution of the cryo-EM maps and the structural similarity of DC domains, there is still some uncertainty over the identification of the actual interacting DC domain. NDC was designated as the primary contact at the junction, but evidence also suggests that CDC could occupy this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2016</xref>). The binding mode is clouded further by observations that DCX has a propensity to dimerize in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caspi et al., 2000</xref>), although analytical ultracentrifugation showed that isolated DCX is monomeric even at relatively high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moores et al., 2006</xref>). However, CDC may adopt an open conformation, allowing it to dimerize through a ‘domain swapping’ event in some MT-assisted fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rufer et al., 2018</xref>). A recent study describes a dynamic interaction model in which DCX interacts with the MT through the CDC domain first, then transitions to an NDC–MT-binding mode in the fully assembled MT lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>). The various models presented are incompatible. It is difficult to rationalize how a dimerizing DCX could interact with the MT lattice in a manner that allows for both NDC and CDC binding and explain the density observed in the cryo-EM measurements.</p><p>Greater clarity on the primary modes of MT engagement would help address the structural basis for the observed mutational effects, as well as help resolve additional structure–function problems. For example, DCX manifests a higher affinity to MT ends compared to the MT lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechstedt et al., 2014</xref>) and appears sensitive to MT lateral curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bechstedt and Brouhard, 2012</xref>) and longitudinal curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechstedt et al., 2014</xref>). These observations are difficult to explain through a simple binding mode, particularly given that binding is strongly cooperative and significantly reduces the rate of DCX–MT dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bechstedt and Brouhard, 2012</xref>). Further, understanding how DCX is functionally altered by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shmueli et al., 2006</xref>) and engages coregulatory proteins like Neurabin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsukada et al., 2005</xref>) and kinesin-3 motor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lipka et al., 2016</xref>) requires a complete structure of the full-length protein on the MT lattice. Here, we develop a unifying model of the DCX–MT interaction through an integrative structure-building approach, using data from an improved crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ziemianowicz et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rafiei and Schriemer, 2019</xref>), together with available cryo-EM and X-ray crystallographic structures. Our results support a DCX–MT interaction model in which NDC binds to MTs at the junction of the four α/β-tubulin dimers, and induces DCX self-association through its CDC and C-tail domains, creating an extended structure capable of capturing different lateral and longitudinal MT interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Preparation of the DCX–MT construct</title><p>DCX possesses two structured domains, each flanked by regions of disorder, which could allow it to adopt various mechanisms of MT lattice engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).

The inherent flexibility of DCX renders it susceptible to ‘kinetic trapping’ on the MT lattice when using conventional long-lived reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ziemianowicz et al., 2019</xref>), thus potentially scrambling the sites of interaction. That is, conformations not representative of the structural ensemble can be selected based simply on higher reaction rates.

Given the multiplicity of binding modes that are possible between DCX and the MT lattice, we reasoned that an incremental approach to modeling focused on determining the major interaction modes would be necessary for computational efficiency. Thus, we formulated the modeling exercise into four stages: (1) identify the primary binding domain using only crosslink restraints between MT and structured DCX domains, (2) evaluate if MT engagement induces DCX dimerization using inter-DCX crosslink restraints, (3) determine if CDC can adopt a domain-swappable (open state) conformation using only DCX crosslinks, and finally (4) determine the orientation(s) of DCX on the MT lattice, constrained by major modes determined in 1–3 and the full set of crosslinking data.

For NDC–MT, the top cluster contained 48% of all models (cluster precision of 23.4 Å) and identified a site at the junction of the four tubulin dimers resembling the site identified by cryo-EM, albeit with a slightly altered orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, E</xref>). The most accurate models, as measured by RMSD from the expected site also had the highest crosslink utilization rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

A single distinct cluster was generated that contained 80% of all models (with a cluster precision 6.0 Å) and it corrected the orientation of the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Conversely, the addition of the EM data forced the relocation of CDC to the major binding site, well removed from the one generated by crosslinking alone. Although 58% of all models clustered with a precision 5.9 Å, the crosslink utilization rate dropped considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, the high congruency between crosslinking and cryo-EM data confirms the location of NDC at the junction, whereas the variable localization of the CDC and a weaker restraint set suggests, at best, a secondary binding site. Thus, for successive stages of modeling, the NDC was located at the primary binding site and the CDC was left free to move. We note that our modeling used PDB 5IP4 for the CDC domain. A recent CDC structure (PDB 6RF2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>) is structurally very similar (RMSD of 5.1 Å). As this value is lower than the precision of our integrative method, we used 5IP4 throughout.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DCX self-associates on the MT lattice through CDC and C-tail domains</title><p>We next evaluated if DCX could form higher-order assemblies, and if so, which subunits are involved. To differentiate intersubunit crosslinks from intrasubunit crosslinks, we used heavy isotopes (<sup>15</sup>N) installed metabolically during DCX expression. The incorporation of <sup>15</sup>N was assessed by LC–MS/MS, demonstrating &gt;99% incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then, a 1:1 mixture of light and heavy labeled DCX (<sup>14</sup>N:<sup>15</sup>N) was used in place of light DCX in sample preparation, followed by crosslinking. Intra- and interprotein crosslinks were differentiated based on the characteristic MS1 pattern of crosslinked peptides. We identified three types of crosslinking signatures reflective of intraprotein crosslinks, interprotein crosslinks, or a mixed state where both types can exist simultaneously although at different levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This latter category is identifiable through a variable intensity pattern of the ‘inner doublet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Melchior et al., 2016</xref>). We then explored if the interprotein labeling patterns could be generated without the addition of tubulin, which would indicate some measure of self-interaction in the free form, possibly dimerization or higher-order associations. We found that only under extreme cases (i.e., DCX denaturation, refolding, and concentrating) could we induce a small amount of interprotein crosslinking, and only at two sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, DCX self-association is a MT-dependent phenomenon, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moores et al., 2006</xref>). In total, we obtained 32 unique intra-DCX crosslink sites, 5 unique inter-DCX crosslink sites as well as 45 unique crosslink sites in the mixed group, both inter-DCX and intra-DCX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Interestingly, &gt;80% of the inter-DCX crosslinks identified involve the CDC domain and the C-tail, which indicates that DCX self-associates on the MT lattice through its C-terminal regions.

In other words, the C-tail contributes slightly to cooperativity between neighboring DCX molecules on the MT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The function of DCX in MT regulation and brain development is dependent on the full-length protein and we propose that this function is strongly dependent upon its self-association. Our findings support a binding mode that presents DCX primarily as an intralattice dimer, oriented through NDC interactions at the junctional sites, and linked through the CDC domain. Based on the data-directed models that we generated in this study and the high fraction of crosslinking data that was satisfied, a lattice-induced dimerization event is the dominant state at the stoichiometry we explored. However, the association could adopt a variety of orientations on the stabilized MT lattice, consistent with an initial contact complex that involves just a monomer. That is, the flexibility of the interdomain region could support the precession of the monomer, allowing it to capture a suitably positioned additional monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>A primary binding mode involving the CDC at the junctional sites is unlikely in the MT polymerization state that was studied here. Although we observed some crosslinks between the CDC and the MT lattice, most of these tend to locate the CDC away from the canonical site and may simply indicate couplings to the dimer as it transiently lays down on the MT lattice. The interaction involving the C-tail domains is particularly intriguing and may indicate that self-association is more extensive than dimerization of the structured domains. An earlier observation highlighted strong binding cooperativity, revealing a Hill coefficient approaching 3 for DCX binding to 13-protofilament MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bechstedt and Brouhard, 2012</xref>). This remarkable degree of cooperativity suggests that associations beyond dimeric are indeed possible and could involve the long C-tails. At high-density occupation, it is easy to imagine that these tails can associate across dimers to further stabilize the MT lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Our observation that the clinical truncation at R303, removing most of the tail, leads to a slight drop in cooperative binding suggests the tail has only a minor role in maintaining associations between DCX molecules on the MT lattice. The tail is not the sole source of cooperativity, as mutations in the structured CDC itself lead to rapid dissociation from the lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bechstedt and Brouhard, 2012</xref>). Disease specific mutations in both of these regions provide strong evidence for the functional significance of lattice-driven self-association. The binding mode we describe in this study can unify interaction models that appear at first glance to be contradictory. Crystallographic evidence suggests that the CDC can dimerize under mildly denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rufer et al., 2018</xref>) whereas cryo-EM data indicate that both NDC and CDC can bind to the lattice. A recent cryo-EM study by the Moores lab confirms that the CDC domain participates in MT nucleation at the junctional site but as the lattice grows, the sites become mostly occupied with NDC domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>). The key to resolving this discrepancy is the conformational flexibility of the CDC. We propose a model where interactions between NDC and the MT lattice induce an opening of the CDC, leading to a binding event that favors the published crystallographic structure of the dimerized CDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rufer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The dimerization must be induced as it does not exist in solution without the MT interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moores et al., 2006</xref>). The cryo-EM data seem to support this, as the conformational state of the CDC in the lattice-bound form is quite distinct from the X-ray structure of the free domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of Doublecortin (DCX)-mediated microtubule (MT) nucleation and stabilization.</title><p>DCX stabilizes early GTP-tubulin oligomers through the CDC domain, which is then replaced with the NDC domain at the canonical binding site as during full MT assembly. NDC binding triggers a conformational change in CDC domain, which facilitates DCX self-association and prevents CDC from rebinding. The inserts illustrate the role of C-tail domain in the formation of either intermonomer interactions, interdimer interactions, or both.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66975-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Induced dimerization provides an explanation for the transition from an early CDC–MT interaction to an NDC–MT interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It was proposed that CDC participates in nucleating MT growth when centrosomal γTURC complexes are not available, as is the case in the distal ends of migrating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>). The deformable CDC domain creates junctional sites that may be somewhat different than the sites in the mature MT lattice because of the curved nature of the nucleated tubulin oligomers. As the lattice fully assembles and regular junctional sites are formed, the more rigid NDC domain can now bind. It is important to note that neither of the two structured domains bind to the lattice particularly strongly on their own, thus a transition to NDC binding could readily occur upon lattice maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>). The CDC interactions would diminish over time, provided that the structural features of the lattice prevent their rebinding, or a mechanism exists for their sequestering (or both). Our model suggests that sequestering is very likely to occur. Induced unfolding of CDC followed by its capture in a dimeric state would explain how DCX binds to the lattice so avidly and such an association would certainly prevent CDC from rebinding. At the same time, dimerization would stabilize the MT lattice and offer a compelling reason for favoring MTs with a well-defined number of protofilaments. That is, the more rigid NDC coupled with its larger footprint on the lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>) is better positioned than the CDC to set the angle of curvature, and dimerization increases the local concentrations of these domains on the lattice through avidity.</p><p>There are several functional observations that support the idea that dimerization helps define the overall MT architecture. A double NDC construct induces much more MT bundling than the WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>), very likely through cross-lattice interactions, suggesting that dimerization minimizes these interactions. This is consistent with the conformation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. A monomeric form may allow for bridging events leading to bundling, but our dimerization model would sterically hinder them. Dimerization is also supported through an inspection of patient mutations. These mutations cluster in both the NDC and CDC domains and lead to loss of MT binding and stabilization. It was suggested to be evidence that both domains interact with MTs directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taylor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). Mutations in the NDC could certainly lead to reduced binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>), but the mutations in the CDC region would more likely interfere with dimerization, reduce the avidity of DCX on the lattice, and diminish MT stabilization overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bechstedt and Brouhard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechstedt et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Extended self-association involves the C-tail and additional observations support a role for this domain in regulating the MT architecture. Removing the C-tail reduces the preference for 13-protofilament MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moores et al., 2004</xref>). Although its removal slightly increases DCX affinity to MTs, it also reduces the rate of DCX accumulation on the lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moslehi et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that the C-tail influences either the span of the dimer or the stability of the dimerization event. The depth of crosslinking we observed in this region suggests an induced structure, perhaps a coiled-coil as observed with other dimerized MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slep et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kon et al., 2009</xref>). However, DeepCoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ludwiczak et al., 2019</xref>) shows a very low probability of such a domain. A more extensive multi-DCX network backed by a dynamically interacting set of C-tails would contribute to the high cooperativity of binding and help stabilize DCX on the lattice (see insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is possible that the C-tails may influence the NDC–MT interaction in a more direct fashion but either way, the self-association of the C-tails influence the properties of DCX on the lattice. This effect can be regulated by C-tail phosphorylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shmueli et al., 2006</xref>). For example, phosphorylation of S297 by Cdk5 reduces DCX affinity to MTs in cultured neurons and any mutations (phosphomimics or dephosphomimics) similarly reduce affinity and alter neuronal migration patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>). Conversely, spinophilin-induced dephosphorylation of S297 by PP1 causes an increase MT bundling in the axonal shaft of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bielas et al., 2007</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicate that higher-order self-association and its regulation are important to DCX function on the MT lattice.</p><p>At this point, it is unclear if the precise orientation of the dimer on the MT lattice is important or not. DCX recognizes a specific tubulin spacing in the lattice, favoring longitudinal curvatures that result in shorter interdimer distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ettinger et al., 2016</xref>). It suggests that a longitudinal orientation is possible, but this particular property may be a function of direct CDC binding at curvatures (in monomeric form, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which is consistent with a role in sensing MT plus-end geometries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechstedt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>). Missense mutations in the CDC region (and not NDC) disrupt the longitudinal curvature detection properties of DCX, but this could influence dimerization as well. Our integrative modeling is not sufficiently precise to identify a dominant orientation (if one truly exists), but a lateral interaction seems the most likely given the orientation of the NDC–CDC linker in cryo-EM models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manka and Moores, 2020</xref>). A dimer with an ability to engage the lattice in a lateral manner could reinforce a preference for a 13-protofilament lattice, if the ‘bite length’ of the dimer is complementary to protofilament spacing.</p><p>Finally, the success of this integrative modeling technique relies heavily upon an improved crosslinking methodology that samples the equilibrated state more faithfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ziemianowicz et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of nominally disordered regions in MAPs like DCX renders proteins prone to ‘kinetic trapping’ on the lattice, where conventional long-lived crosslinking reagents can trap interactions in non-native states. We conducted a modeling analysis of the DCX–MT interaction using typical DSS (disuccinimidyl suberate) and EDC(1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) crosslinkers and while the data are abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), the outcome of the integrative modeling using conventional crosslinking chemistries was poor, both in terms of the percent crosslink satisfaction (&lt;50%) and the location of the primary binding site. The full modeling exercise with these data provided no interpretable results. While a small number of studies have applied crosslinking to MAP–MT interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Legal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zelter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kadavath, 2015</xref>), many more could be profiled with an improved crosslinking method such as we illustrate here.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

MTs were imaged using an AxioObserver epifluorescence microscope with an oil immersion objective (EC Plan Apo ×100/1.3, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany) equipped with CCD camera Zeiss AxioCam MRm Rev. 3 FireWire. Images were taken using 100% light source intensity and 4-s exposure time. Microscopy images were processed to adjust for contrast using Zen Blue software (version 2.3). MT length measurement was performed using standard measurement tools in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Turbidity assay</title><p>Tubulin (10 µM) and different concentrations of DCX (0–20 µM) were premixed in BRB80 + GTP (1 mM) on ice and transferred to a 396-well plate. The plate was transferred to the temperature controlled (37°C) spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices FilterMax F5 spectrophotometer equipped with a 340-nm filter). Turbidity measurements were taken every 13 s for over 70 min. Data were normalized to a preliminary time point and the pathlength was corrected to 1 cm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cooperativity assay</title><p>Taxol MTs were prepared from bovine tubulin as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechstedt et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, on the day of each experiment, taxol MTs were prepared by polymerizing a 1:30 molar ratio of Atto 633 NHS-ester (ATTO-Tec, AD 633-35) labeled:unlabeled tubulin. The cover glass was cleaned in acetone, 50% methanol, and 0.5 M KOH, then exposed to air plasma for 3 min at 30–40 cc/min, finally silanized by soaking in 0.1% Dichlorodimethylsilane (Sigma-Aldrich, 440272) in <italic>n</italic>-heptane for at least 3 hr. Sample chambers were assembled to create flow channels for solution exchange as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gell et al., 2010</xref>). Channels were prepared by flowing in anti-β-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T4026) followed by blocking with 1% Pluronic F-127. Channels were rinsed with 10 channel volumes of BRB80 before flowing in taxol MTs and placing the chamber on the microscope stage, where the objective was heated to 32°C with a CU-501 Chamlide lens warmer (Live Cell Instruments). DCX-mCherry and DCX-GFP were mixed on ice in imaging buffer (BRB80, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 250 nM glucose oxidase, 64 nM catalase, 40 mM <sc>D</sc>-glucose, 0.01% (wt/vol) methylcellulose, and 10 µM paclitaxel) before flowing into the channel and sealing with nail polish. For each field of view, all three signals (GFP, mCherry, and Atto 633) were imaged at an exposure time of 1 s and with wavelength-specific filter cubes (Chroma). At least three fields of view were imaged for each concentration of DCX-mCherry. Images were recorded on a Prime 95B CMOS camera (Photometrics) with a pixel size of 107 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of DCX cooperativity</title><p>To correct for chromatic aberations, images were processed in FIJI by applying a 0.5 px median and subtracting their 10 px Gaussian-filtered form. The three images of a single field of view (DCX-GFP, DCX-mCherry, and Atto-633 taxol MTs) were aligned using the positions of fiducial particles detected in TrackMate. For each field of view, the Atto-633 taxol MT signal was used to generate mask by Otsu thresholding in FIJI, ignoring pixels outside of the MT region defined by the mask. We quantified the colocalization of DCX-mCherry and DCX-GFP by measuring the Pearson correlation coefficient of the mCherry and GFP signal along the MTs, using the scipy.stats.pearsonr function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Crosslinking</title><p>Porcine Tubulin was reconstituted to 4.0 mg/ml in cold BRB80 polymerization buffer supplemented with 1 mM GTP. Centrifugation was performed at 16,800 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C to pellet any aggregates. The supernatant was diluted to 1.0 mg/ml (10 µM) in the presence of 10 µM DCX and incubated at 37°C for 90 min to induce polymerization. Succinimidyl 6-(4,4′-azipentanamido)hexanoate (LC-SDA; Thermo Scientific) crosslinking was performed by adding the reagent to final 1 mM concentration. The sample was incubated for 10 min at 37°C, followed by 5 s of photolysis at 355 nm (50 × 100 mJ laser pulse of a 10-ns pulse width using an Nd:YAG laser, YG 980; Quantel, Les Ulis, France) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ziemianowicz et al., 2019</xref>). DSS crosslinking was performed using 1 mM crosslinker concentration followed by 30-min incubation at 37°C. EDC crosslinking was performed with the same crosslinker concentration and incubation time, in the presence of 2 mM Sulfo-NHS. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless mentioned otherwise. The crosslinking experiment was repeated several times for the purpose of optimization. Final results are the accumulated identifications across two replicate analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>Crosslinked DCX–MT was separated from free protein by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet washed once with warm BRB80 (37°C) and then dissolved in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Cysteines were reduced by adding DTT to a final concentration of 10 mM with heating to 90°C for 10 min, and then alkylation by addition of chloroacetamide to a final concentration of 50 mM at 37°C for 30 min. Trypsin (Thermo Scientific) was added to an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50 and incubated overnight at 37°C with nutation (150 rpm). Digestion was quenched by adding formic acid to a final concentration of 2%. Samples were aliquoted and either lyophilized for size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) or desalted using ZipTip C18 pipette tips (Merck Millipore Ltd, Ireland) for LC–MS/MS analysis. For SEC, samples were reconstituted in SEC buffer consisting of 30% acetonitrile (LC–MS grade, Thermo Scientific) and 0.1% FA (Fluka) and crosslinked peptides were enriched by separation on a Superdex Peptide PC 3.2/30 column (GE Healthcare), using an Agilent 1100 chromatography system at 95 μl/min with fraction collection. Fractions were lyophilized. SEC fractions and unenriched samples were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid and based on the UV absorbance trace, approximately 1 pmol injected onto an Acclaim PepMap 100 guard column (75 μm × 2 cm C18, 3 μm particles, 100 Å; Thermo Scientific) and separated on a 50 cm PepMap RSLC C18 (75 μm × 50 cm, 2 μm particles, 100 Å; Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated with a gradient consisting of 56 min at 5–28% B, 17 min at 28–40% B, followed by 10 min 40–95% B and regenerated at 95% B for 10 min. Mobile phase A was 0.1% FA in water, and mobile phase B was 0.1% FA in 80% I. The flow rate was 300 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode, in OT/OT mode with MS resolution set at 120,000 (350–1300 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) and MS2 resolution at 15,000. The max injection time was set at 50 and 100 ms for MS1 and MS2 scans, respectively. The AGC target was set at 400,000 and 100,000 for MS1 and MS2, respectively. Higher-energy collisional dissociation was used to generate MS2 spectra, for charge states 4+ and higher. A normalized collision energy of 32% was used with an isolation width of 1.2 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>DCX dimerization analysis</title><p><sup>14</sup>N-DCX (light) and <sup>15</sup>N-DCX (heavy) were mixed in 1:1 ratio and then applied to tubulin as above. To explore dimerization and/or aggregation, the light–heavy mixture was processed using a few different approaches: (1) mixture incubated at 10 µM for 2 hr at 37°C with tubulin, (2) mixture incubated at 10 µM for 2 hr at 37°C without tubulin, (3) mixture diluted to 2 µM followed by concentration to ≥10 µM and incubation at 37°C for 2 hr without tubulin, (4) mixture denatured in 3 M guanidyl-HCl in phosphate-buffered saline overnight followed by buffer exchange into BRB80 and concentration to ≥10 µM and incubation at 37°C for 2 hr without tubulin. A negative control sample was also prepared by crosslinking heavy and light DCX separately and mixing them immediately prior to LC–MS/MS analysis. All samples were crosslinked by LC-SDA and processed as above, using only the nonenriched samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>XL-MS data analysis</title><p>Raw LC–MS/MS data were imported into CRIMP v2 (the crosslinking plugin in the Mass Spec Studio, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.msstudio.ca">https://www.msstudio.ca</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sarpe et al., 2016</xref>) along with the Fasta files of the Tubulin isoforms identified previously (TB-α–1A, TB-α–1B, TB-α–1C, TB-α–1D, TB-α–4A, and TB-β, TB-β–2B, TB-β–4A, TB-β–4B, TB-β–3, TB-β–5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rafiei and Schriemer, 2019</xref>). The minor impurities in the recombinantly purified DCX did not have an impact on crosslinking results. For crosslinked peptide searching, methionine oxidation and carbamidomethylation of cysteines were selected as variable and fixed modifications, respectively. Crosslinked peptides were searched using the following parameters: MS accuracy, 5 ppm; MS/MS accuracy, 10 ppm; E-threshold, 70; enzyme, trypsin (K/R only); <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> range: 350 and 1300; peptide length range: 3–50 residues. All crosslinking results filtered at an estimated 1% FDR(false discovery rate) level were manually validated. Monoisotopic ion identification in MS1 was confirmed in all hits and only crosslinked peptides with a good fit of the measured isotopic envelope to the theoretical isotopic pattern were accepted. Crosslinking data were exported as CSV files and data from all SEC fractions combined. For isotopically labeled proteins, CRIMP was customized to search all heavy–light peptide combinations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>DCX–MT integrative structure modeling</title><p>We used integrative structure modeling (ISM) to assess how our generated crosslinking data, along with the previously computed EM map, prior structural information and physical principles, could model the interaction between the domains of DCX and the MT lattice. Briefly, data and information were transformed into spatial restraints used to construct a scoring function and then we searched for model configurations that satisfy all restraints. To assess whether NDC or CDC binds to MT, we performed ISM using the MT lattice and either CDC or NDC along with intermolecular crosslinks between each domain and MT. The convergence of each of the DCX domains to the observed binding site in the EM map using only the crosslinking data was analyzed. In addition, the satisfaction of the crosslinking restraint was computed while enforcing a restraint using the EM density of the domain of DCX bound to MT to guide the domain to this observed site, with the better models identified by those that better satisfy the crosslinks.</p><p>We assessed the nature of the DCX dimerization event by performing ISM using two DCX molecules and a 3–4 repeat (lateral) and 3–4 repeat (longitudinal) MT domain constructed using tubulin and symmetry operations. The position of NDC (NDC structure of PDB: 4ATU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) was fixed on the MT lattice in the site observed by EM. CDC was modeled in both the open (domain-swappable, PDB 6FNZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rufer et al., 2018</xref>) and closed (globular structure, PDB: 5IP4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2016</xref>) forms. Models were scored via the set of all DCX–DCX crosslinks and models were assessed using crosslink satisfaction. Finally, we evaluated the ability of DCX dimers to be formed using four spatial arrangements of DCX dimers on the MT lattice. Two copies of NDC were fixed in adjacent binding sites lateral, longitudinal, diagonal-1, and diagonal-2. Models were generated using restraints based on all crosslinking data (DCX–DCX and DCX–MT).</p><p>ISM protocols were built using the Python Modeling Interface (PMI) package of the open-source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webb et al., 2018</xref>) version 2.10 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://integrativemodeling.org">https://integrativemodeling.org</ext-link>). Specifically, ISM proceeds through four stages: (1) gathering data, (2) representing subunits and translating data into spatial restraints, (3) sampling configurations of the system representations to produce an ensemble of models that satisfies the restraints, and (4) analyzing and validations the ensemble structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Stage 1: gathering data</title><p>The 124 unique crosslinks identified between DCX and α−β-tubulin, along with 74 unique inter- and intra- DCX crosslinks identified in this study informed the spatial proximities of the CDC and NDC with respect to MT lattice and each other. An EM map containing MT and DCX (EMDB 2095; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) at 8.0 Å resolution was used to inform the binding mode of DCX with respect to the MT lattice. The map was prepared as follows. First, the cryo-EM structure for MT polymerized in the presence of DCX (6EVZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manka and Moores, 2018</xref>) was fitted into the EM map using UCSF Chimera tools. Second, the EM volumes corresponding to the MT structure were erased using Erase tool in Chimera, leaving only the DCX density. The representation of the MT lattice was derived from the high-resolution structure built based on the cryo-EM structure for MT polymerized in the presence of DCX (PDB: 6EVZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manka and Moores, 2018</xref>). The representation of the NDC globular domain was informed by the PDB structure 4ATU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) and the representation of the globular domain of CDC informed by either the crystal structures of the globular (PDB 5IP4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 2016</xref>) and domain-swapped (PDB 6FNZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rufer et al., 2018</xref>) configurations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Stage 2: system representation and translation of data into spatial restraints</title><p>The information above was used to define the representation of the system, the scoring function that guides the search for configurations that satisfy the information, filtering of models and validation of the final ensembles. One representation of the MT lattice was constructed based on the coordinates of the PDB structure (6EVZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manka and Moores, 2018</xref>), with components simultaneously represented as beads of a single residue each and up-to-10 residues-per-bead. An additional 4-dimer width MT lattice representation was made using the same PBD structure (6EVZ) of MT lattice and symmetry replication tools in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Residues of NDC (51–140) and CDC (174–251 for globular and 174–253 for open form) contained in the crystal structure (structured domains) were represented simultaneously as beads of up-to-10 residues-per-bead. Residues not contained in the crystal structures (terminal tails and the linker region between NDC and CDC) were modeled solely as beads of up-to-10 residues each. Both the NDC and CDC structured domains were constrained as rigid bodies: the intermolecular distances between these beads were kept fixed. All other beads were unconstrained. The N-terminal (1–50) and C-terminal (331–360) tails of DCX were not modeled, as these regions were less represented in inter-and/or intra-DCX XL sites. For different modeling protocols, either one of the NDC/CDC was modeled, or two copies of DCX modeled.</p><p>The information was then encoded into spatial restraints computable on the system representation. Our scoring function consisted of the sum of four component restraints. (1) The <italic>chemical crosslink restraint</italic> utilized the identified chemical crosslinks to construct a Bayesian scoring function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutierrez et al., 2020</xref>) that restrained distances between crosslinked residues. Restraint distances of 30 Å for LC-SDA and DSS, and 25 Å for EDC were used. The ambiguity of crosslink sites due to the presence of multiple copies of the same protein was considered. In these cases, the joint probability of satisfying the restraint over all possible combinations is computed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molnar et al., 2014</xref>). (2) The <italic>EM restraint</italic> utilized a Bayesian scoring function based on the cross-correlation of the overlap of the model and experimental density. Densities of the model components and experimental data were approximated using a Gaussian Mixture Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonomi et al., 2019</xref>). (3) The <italic>excluded volume restraint</italic> prevents parts of the system from occupying the same space. This restraint is applied to the low-resolution representation of the system (10 residues per bead). (4) The <italic>sequence connectivity restraint</italic> was used to restraint chemical components known to be covalently linked. The restraint was applied as a harmonic upperdistance bound on the distance between adjoining beads in sequence. The center of the harmonic was defined as twice the sum of the radii of the two beads, the radii computed from the excluded volume of the bead.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Stage 3: configurational sampling</title><p>The search for model configurations that satisfy the restraints used Gibbs sampling, based on the Metropolis Monte-Carlo algorithm and accelerated via replica exchange. Initial positions of system components were randomized with exception of MT being fixed for all cases, and NDCs being fixed for dimeric-DCX modeling scenarios. The set of Monte-Carlo moves consisted of random rotation and translation of rigid bodies (up to 4.0 Å and 0.5 radians, respectively) and random translations of the individual beads not in rigid bodies of up to 4 Å. Model configurations were saved every 10 steps. For each modeling protocol, 8–10 independent sampling runs were initiated using 20–40 replicas and run for 100,000–500,000 steps each, resulting in 100,000–500,000 models for each protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Stage 4: analyzing and validating model ensembles</title><p>The resulting ensemble of model configurations were analyzed to estimate the structural precision, ensure appropriate consistency with the input data and suggest more informative future experiments. The models were first filtered for those that satisfy the input data. After filtering, we used analysis and validation protocols published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishida and Kinoshita, 2007</xref>). Briefly, analysis began by assessing the thoroughness of structural sampling and computation of the sampling precision, the RMSD threshold at which clustering produces indistinguishable results for two independent sets of computed models (e.g., the output of runs 1–5 and 6–10), using protocols previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Viswanath et al., 2017</xref>). Upon computation of the sampling precision, the entire set of models was clustered at this precision or higher to ensure that resulting model clusters reflect the uncertainty in sampling in input information. The centroid models of clusters were then filtered to remove the models where NDC/CDC is located on the MT edges (where another tubulin monomer will fit in a full MT structure). These model clusters were further assessed by computing their precision (structural variability – average RMSD to the centroid model) and quantifying their fit to the input information.</p><p>These final models were validated by ensuring that the models satisfied the crosslinking data used to compute it. Crosslink satisfaction was also used to determine which modeling configurations were more plausible than others. The fraction crosslink satisfaction was computed both for each individual model configuration in a cluster and the entire cluster. A crosslink was deemed to be satisfied if the crosslink distance in an individual model configuration was less than 35 Å for LC-SDA and DSS and 30 Å for EDC. A crosslink was deemed to be satisfied in a model cluster (called cluster crosslink satisfaction in Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) if at least one configuration in the cluster has a crosslink distance less than the distance thresholds described above. Also, RMSD calculation was performed between each individual model present in the clusters and the NDC component of PDB structure 4ATU. RMSD calculation for CDC–MT models was performed using an aligned globular CDC structure (PDB 5IP4) into the NDC component of cryo-EM based structure (PDB 4ATU). The full details of sampling precision, clustering threshold, cluster’s population, etc. for all modeling scenarios are presented in Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Data availability</title><p>The DCX–MT integrative models, including final structures, modeling details, and input experimental data, were deposited into the PDB-dev repository for integrative models (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pdb-dev.com">https://www.pdb-dev.com</ext-link>) accession number PDBDEV_00000071, PDBDEV_00000072, PDBDEV_00000073, and PDBDEV_00000074.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article “Doublecortin engages the microtubule lattice through a cooperative binding mode involving its C- terminal domain” for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Carolyn A Moores (Reviewer #2); Alexander Leitner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How accessible are the well-buried DCX-tubulin interfaces at the primary binding site to the chemical cross-linkers on which the analysis depends? As one reviewer points out, accessibility issues could explain the results depicted in Figure 3A, B, in which modelling that relies strictly on cross-links places NDC towards the outer edge of the protofilament, whereas inclusion of cryo-EM data in the integrated model places NDC in the inter-protofilament valley. The authors should discuss this further in the text and/or provide additional details about the measures they took to address accessibility issues.</p><p>2) It is important to repeat this analysis using the microtubule-bound structure of CDC (6RF2), given that this structure is conformationally distinct from PDB:5IP4. Based on analysis using the nanobody-bound CDC structure (5IP4), CDC appears to behave distinctly compared to NDC, such that CDC-derived cross-linking data are not consistent with the canonical inter-protofilament binding site. The authors should address if this depends on the particular PDB used.</p><p>3) Two reviewers noted that additional experiments would help support the observation and model that DCX oligomerises between the CDC domain and the C-terminal tail of the protein. The authors could either perform the crosslinking experiments with a previously published NDC-NDC chimera (Manka and Moores, 2020), which binds microtubules at the same inter-protofilament site but which lacks the CDC domain, or a DCX construct that lacks the C-terminal tail domain to examine if or how the interactions change.</p><p>4) Certain technical details and quantification must be clarified or reported within the manuscript:</p><p>The authors should indicate how many times were the crosslinking experiments repeated, and if they used more than one protein purification, which is ideal. It is clear in the methods that the authors do not perform column chromatography to ensure homogeneity of the protein. It is important to provide evidence that the protein is well-behaved using size-exclusion chromatography, for example. SEC-MALS would be ideal to ensure there are not multiple oligomeric populations of DCX in their preps, but if the authors do not have access to this equipment, normal SEC is adequate.</p><p>The authors should provide quantification of S1C, especially if they are assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry. Please report how many times was this binding assay repeated. Please also report the average lengths +/- s.d. for S1D. In addition, please provide zoom-in pictures of S1E for clear visualization of the microtubules. Finally, do the authors think that varying salt concentration in their buffer during their crosslinking studies would affect oligomerisation of DCX? The authors should provide an explanation for why they chose to perform these studies in BRB80 and indicate whether they think varying the ionic strength would affect the inter-molecular interactions.</p><p>5) The authors should discuss the results from Bechstedt and Brouhard 2012, which show that mutations in the C-DC disrupt cooperative interactions of DCX on the microtubule lattice. This study supports the authors’ current model greatly, yet it’s not discussed at all.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors should provide quantification of S1C, especially if they are assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry. How many times was this binding assay repeated? The average lengths are not reported in the manuscript for S1D. Provide zoom-in pictures of S1E, since it is impossible to see the microtubules in this image.</p><p>2) How many times were the crosslinking experiments repeated? Did the authors use more than one protein purification?</p><p>3) In Figure S6, the authors show that only under extreme conditions, such as denaturation, can DCX self-associate in the absence of tubulin. It appears as if the authors performed their crosslinking studies in BRB80 without additional salt. Are the authors able to perform the crosslinking studies at a more physiological salt concentration? Or could the authors provide an explanation as to why they do not think this would affect the inter-molecular interactions?</p><p>4) It would be useful to test the model generated in this study by performing certain experiments with a DCX construct that lacks the C-terminal tail. It is obviously difficult to evaluate microtubule binding without either DC domain, but if a tail-less DCX is still able to bind to microtubules, then it could be very useful in providing support for this model. Would a tail-less DCX exhibit less cooperative binding? Would removing the tail abolish the inter-molecular interactions? Or would the C-DC domains still be able to self-associate?</p><p>5) It would behoove the authors to discuss the results from Bechstedt and Brouhard 2012, which show that mutations in the C-DC disrupt cooperative interactions of DCX on the microtubule lattice.

As one reviewer points out, accessibility issues could explain the results depicted in Figure 3A, B, in which modelling that relies strictly on cross-links places NDC towards the outer edge of the protofilament, whereas inclusion of cryo-EM data in the integrated model places NDC in the inter-protofilament valley. The authors should discuss this further in the text and/or provide additional details about the measures they took to address accessibility issues.</p></disp-quote><p>There are no accessibility issues related to the crosslinks. In fact, we observe crosslinks to sites that are well buried in the cleft, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>. This is in line with data from a previous paper on MT crosslinking (Legal et al., 2016). The appearance of the models sitting near the outer edge of the protofilament is due to how we chose to represent the system, and is an expected edge effect (we added text to the top of page 10, indicating that it can be ignored). It is approximately half of the actual binding site and so expected to compete. To illustrate that accessibility is not an issue, we re-clustered the models with a lower threshold (2 Å) to generate smaller major cluster (22% of the total) where the NDC is positioned even more deeply within the inter-protofilament valley, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>. Clustering at higher threshold is preferred because it represents modelling uncertainty more faithfully by including the majority of the models generated during sampling.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(A) Crosslink sites on the MT lattice repeat unit highlighted in blue, showing that some are indeed buried within the interprotofilament groove.</title><p>(B) Alternative representation showing the buried nature of NDC on the lattice.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66975-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is important to repeat this analysis using the microtubule-bound structure of CDC (6RF2), given that this structure is conformationally distinct from PDB:5IP4. Based on analysis using the nanobody-bound CDC structure (5IP4), CDC appears to behave distinctly compared to NDC, such that CDC-derived cross-linking data are not consistent with the canonical inter-protofilament binding site. The authors should address if this depends on the particular PDB used.</p></disp-quote><p>We calculate the RMSD between 5IP4 and 6RF2 to be 5.1 Å, and show the alignment of the structures, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. This is a small difference when considering the precision of our integrative method, and thus would not change the results/conclusions presented in our paper. (Note that crosslinks are contrained with a distance of ~25 Å or less.)

The authors could either perform the crosslinking experiments with a previously published NDC-NDC chimera (Manka and Moores, 2020), which binds microtubules at the same inter-protofilament site but which lacks the CDC domain, or a DCX construct that lacks the C-terminal tail domain to examine if or how the interactions change.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent idea. We elected to explore a disease-relevant truncation mutant, R303X (see des Portes V et al., 1998, Human Molecular Genetics, 7, 1063-70), which removes most of the tail and a large fraction of the crosslinked sites between the tails. We expressed both an mCherry-tagged wild type DCX and a GFP-tagged R303X mutant and explored the difference between the two in a flow-based TIRF experiment designed to highlight differences in cooperative binding to pre-formed microtubules. Interestingly, removal of the tail slightly reduces cooperative binding to the lattice. These observations indicate that the tail contributes to the self-assembly event and cooperativity, as the crosslinking data suggests. We have added considerable text to this effect in the manuscript on pp 16-18, provided a figure in the main text (new Figure 7), and added the appropriate methodological descriptions on pp 28, 30 and 31.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Certain technical details and quantification must be clarified or reported within the manuscript:</p><p>The authors should indicate how many times were the crosslinking experiments repeated, and if they used more than one protein purification, which is ideal.</p></disp-quote><p>The crosslinking experiment was repeated several times during optimization. Then, the final results used in this work are the accumulated identifications across two technical replicates. The light-DCX protein used in this study was prepared in two separate batches, one to support optimization and one for final data analysis. For the final data, the heavy-DCX was also used from one batch, analyzed twice. Clarifying text is added to the manuscript on pages 29 and 32.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is clear in the methods that the authors do not perform column chromatography to ensure homogeneity of the protein. It is important to provide evidence that the protein is well-behaved using size-exclusion chromatography, for example. SEC-MALS would be ideal to ensure there are not multiple oligomeric populations of DCX in their preps, but if the authors do not have access to this equipment, normal SEC is adequate.</p></disp-quote><p>If by homogeneity the reviewer means a lack of aggregation, we filtered our preps through spin cartridges but did not collect SEC data. Aggregates were not in evidence as shown by the lack of inter-DCX crosslinks in our prep. See Figure 2 —figure supplement 2 that extensively explores the possibility of aggregation explaining our XL-MS results. We are confident that none of our crosslinks reflect nonspecific aggregation of DCX.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should provide quantification of S1C, especially if they are assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry.

It is obviously difficult to evaluate microtubule binding without either DC domain, but if a tail-less DCX is still able to bind to microtubules, then it could be very useful in providing support for this model.
