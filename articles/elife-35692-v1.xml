Here, we investigate molecular mechanisms by which these divergent connections are generated, using dyadic synapses in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model. We report that <italic>C. elegans nrx-1</italic>/neurexin directs divergent connectivity through differential actions at synapses with partnering neurons and muscles. We show that cholinergic outputs onto neurons are, unexpectedly, located at previously undefined spine-like protrusions from GABAergic dendrites. Both these spine-like features and cholinergic receptor clustering are strikingly disrupted in the absence of <italic>nrx-1</italic>. Excitatory transmission onto GABAergic neurons, but not neuromuscular transmission, is also disrupted. Our data indicate that NRX-1 located at presynaptic sites specifically directs postsynaptic development in GABAergic neurons. Our findings provide evidence that individual neurons can direct differential patterns of connectivity with their post-synaptic partners through partner-specific utilization of synaptic organizers, offering a novel view into molecular control of divergent connectivity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35692.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nervous systems are complex networks of interconnected cells called neurons. These networks vary in size from a few hundred cells in worms, to tens of billions in the human brain. Within these networks, each individual neuron forms connections – called synapses – with many others. But these partner neurons are not necessarily alike. In fact, they may be different cell types. How neurons form distinct connections with different partner cells remains unclear.</p><p>Part of the answer may lie in specialized proteins called cell adhesion molecules. These proteins occur on the cell surface and enable neurons to recognize one another. This helps ensure that the cells form appropriate connections via synapses. Cell adhesion molecules are therefore also known as synaptic organizers. Philbrook et al. have now examined the role of synaptic organizers in wiring up the nervous system of the nematode worm and model organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</p><p>Motor neurons form connections with two types of partner cell: muscle cells and neurons. Philbrook et al. screened <italic>C. elegans</italic> that have mutations in genes encoding various synaptic organizers. This revealed that a protein called neurexin must be present for motor neurons to form synapses with other neurons. By contrast, neurexin is not required for the same neurons to establish synapses with muscles. Philbrook et al. found that neuron-to-neuron synapses arise at specialized finger-like projections. These resemble the dendritic spines at which synapses form in the brains of mammals, and had not been previously identified in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In worms that lack neurexin, these spine-like structures do not form correctly, disrupting the formation of neuron-to-neuron connections.</p><p>Previous work has implicated neurexin in synapse formation in the mammalian brain. But this is the first study to reveal a role for neurexin in establishing partner-specific synaptic connections. Mutations in synaptic organizers, including neurexin, contribute to disorders of brain development. These include schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. Learning more about how neurexin helps establish specific synaptic connections may help us understand how these disorders arise.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>neurotransmission</kwd><kwd>AChR</kwd><kwd>nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</kwd><kwd>dendritic spine</kwd><kwd>synaptic divergence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS064263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francis</surname><given-names>Michael M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DA038399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philbrook</surname><given-names>Alison</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM084491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alkema</surname><given-names>Mark J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Investigation of synapse development using a single neuron system illuminates how individual neurons specify connectivity with their postsynaptic partners and the central role of the synaptic organizer neurexin in this process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are typically wired into discrete circuits through stereotyped patterns of synaptic connections geared to perform specific functions. Individual neurons within circuits may receive convergent synaptic inputs from multiple classes of presynaptic partnering neurons, and likewise, make divergent synaptic outputs onto distinct postsynaptic targets. We have gained an understanding of some of the core mechanisms that sculpt convergent connectivity through studies of developmental processes such as activity-dependent synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell and Shatz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Okawa et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shatz and Kirkwood, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Walsh and Lichtman, 2003</xref>). In contrast, the molecular processes controlling the establishment of divergent synaptic connections (between a single presynaptic partner and multiple postsynaptic target cells) are not clearly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Okawa et al., 2014b</xref>). Neural circuit models often represent divergent connections as a means for enabling the same signal from an individual presynaptic neuron to reach many different postsynaptic target cells. However, the strength of connections with postsynaptic partners can vary widely, strongly suggesting that presynaptic neurons have the capacity to establish and regulate connections with each postsynaptic target independently. While molecular guidance cues directing axon outgrowth have been well-studied, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for directing target-specific connectivity has remained elusive.</p><p>A primary mechanism for establishing nascent synapses is through the actions of synaptic adhesion molecules, also known as synaptic organizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Wit and Ghosh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Missler et al., 2012</xref>). These organizers are often anchored to the pre- and post-synaptic membranes (e.g. neurexins, neuroligins, leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins/LRRTMs) and promote synapse formation through trans-synaptic adhesion and signaling. The importance of these processes in establishing proper neural circuit connectivity is highlighted by the links between mutations in genes encoding these synaptic adhesion/organizing molecules and neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Reichelt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rujescu et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, synaptic organizers are capable of acting in a cell-specific manner to promote synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, an exciting possibility is that individual neurons could encode connections with alternate synaptic partners through differential deployment of synaptic organizers.</p><p>We have investigated this possibility in the motor circuit of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> where individual excitatory cholinergic motor neurons form synapses with both body wall muscles and GABAergic motor neurons. Through a screen for genes that govern the formation of these divergent synaptic connections, we demonstrate that the synaptic organizer <italic>nrx-1</italic>/neurexin directs the outgrowth of previously uncharacterized dendritic spine-like structures and the formation of synaptic connections with GABAergic neurons, but is not required for synaptic connectivity with muscles. Conversely, genes previously shown to be required for cholinergic connectivity with muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Francis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gally et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pinan-Lucarré et al., 2014</xref>) are not required for the formation of synapses onto GABAergic neurons. Our findings demonstrate that cholinergic neurons utilize distinct molecular signals to establish synapses with GABAergic motor neurons versus body wall muscles, thus revealing that a single presynaptic neuron establishes divergent connections by employing parallel molecular strategies for the formation of connections with each postsynaptic partner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clusters of the GFP-tagged acetylcholine receptor subunit ACR-12 are localized to spine-like dendritic protrusions on DD GABAergic neurons</title><p>To establish a system to investigate mechanisms instructing synaptic connectivity, we labeled post-synaptic specializations on dorsally directed GABAergic DD neurons using cell-specific expression (<italic>flp-13</italic> promoter) of the GFP-tagged acetylcholine receptor subunit ACR-12. Prior work showed that ACR-12 receptors in GABAergic motor neurons are clustered opposite cholinergic terminals and GABAergic expression of ACR-12::GFP rescues <italic>acr-12</italic> mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbagallo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Petrash et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, postsynaptic ACR-12::GFP clusters relocate appropriately during developmental synaptic remodeling of the DD neurons, suggesting these clusters faithfully report synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Howell et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The morphology of DD neurons is highly polarized, facilitating clear visualization of the axonal and dendritic neuronal compartments. In the present work, we focus much of our analysis on the spatially isolated neurites of the DD1 neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In adults, the anterior DD1 process extends from the soma to enter the ventral nerve cord fascicle (the dendritic compartment), where prior EM studies show that approximately 26 synaptic inputs from cholinergic neurons are concentrated (the synaptic region, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White et al., 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">1976</xref>). The process then crosses the longitudinal midline of the worm via a commissural connection and enters the dorsal nerve cord where it forms <italic>en passant</italic> synaptic outputs onto body wall muscles (the axonal compartment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">White et al., 1976</xref>). We find that ACR-12::GFP receptor clusters in DD1 are confined to the synaptic region of the ventral dendritic process in the mature animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As <italic>C. elegans</italic> synapses are formed <italic>en passant</italic>, pre- and post-synaptic specializations typically appear, at the light level, to be localized along the main shafts of neuronal processes. Surprisingly, we noted that the majority of ACR-12::GFP clusters do not appear localized to the shaft of the primary DD1 dendritic process, instead appearing to protrude from the primary DD1 dendrite shaft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To investigate this finding in more detail, we examined morphological features in the synaptic region of the DD1 dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Intriguingly, we noted finger-like structures (~0.3–1 μm in length) projecting outward from the DD1 dendrite in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, these structures are not present in the asynaptic region of the process immediately adjacent to the cell soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These protrusions are obscured by the processes of other ventral cord neurons when using promoters that provide for more broad expression (e.g. <italic>unc-47</italic>), and are therefore most clearly identifiable with specific labeling of DD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Spine-like protrusions are also clearly identifiable in the dendrites of more posterior DD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but are not apparent in a related class of post-embryonic born, ventrally directed GABAergic (VD) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), although the density of VD processes may complicate their detection. The dendritic protrusions concentrate clusters of ACR-12 receptors at their tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and over 60% of ACR-12::GFP clusters appear localized to protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The dendritic protrusions increase in abundance through larval development, and this increase correlates well with a similar developmental increase in ACR-12::GFP receptor clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, our results provide evidence that cholinergic receptors cluster at morphologically distinct finger-like structures present on DD neuron dendrites, raising the interesting possibility that these structures serve similar roles to dendritic spines in the mammalian nervous system.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35692.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of post-synaptic specializations in the DD neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagrams of <italic>C. elegans</italic> showing the six DD GABAergic neurons in the ventral nerve cord and expanded view of DD1.

We found that dendritic protrusions and ACR-12 receptor clusters are both located opposite clusters of cholinergic synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), indicating that these likely represent mature synapses. We therefore next investigated whether these clusters indicate post-synaptic receptors residing at the cell surface. To address this question, we inserted an HA epitope tag into the extracellular C-terminus of ACR-12::GFP (diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gottschalk and Schafer, 2006</xref>). Injection of Alexa594 conjugated anti-HA antibody into live transgenic animals expressing this construct produces specific labeling in the DD1 synaptic region, and is also evident in coelomocytes (scavenger cells that take up excess antibody), confirming successful injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The anti-HA signal colocalizes with ACR-12::GFP clusters in the synaptic region of DD1, but is not evident in the cell soma. In contrast, the intracellular GFP moiety produces fluorescence that is evident in both the soma and the synaptic region of the dendrite, representing both synaptic and internal receptor pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Most acetylcholine receptors are formed as heteromeric combinations of five subunits. Prior work has demonstrated that partially or improperly assembled acetylcholine receptor intermediates are not transported out of the ER and are instead targeted for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blount and Merlie, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Merlie and Lindstrom, 1983</xref>). We therefore reasoned that genetic ablation of obligate ACR-12 partnering subunits, by interfering with assembly, transport, and synaptic targeting of ACR-12 receptor complexes, could provide an efficient strategy for identifying subunit partners. We found that single mutations in the acetylcholine receptor subunit genes <italic>unc-38, unc-63, lev-1</italic> or <italic>unc-29</italic> strongly decrease ACR-12::GFP clustering. In wild type, we observe approximately 15 receptor clusters within the DD1 synaptic region. These clusters are eliminated almost completely with mutation of these subunit genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). In contrast, mutations in other nAChR subunit genes with previously reported neuronal expression, such as <italic>acr-9</italic> and <italic>acr-14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cinar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fox et al., 2005</xref>), do not disrupt synaptic ACR-12 clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

GABA neuron-specific expression of wild type cDNAs encoding individual AChR subunits (UNC-63 or UNC-38) or accessory proteins in the respective mutants is sufficient to restore ACR-12 clustering to wild type levels, providing support that both gene classes act cell-autonomously in GABA neurons to promote receptor assembly, maturation and synaptic delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Cell-specific expression of either UNC-29::GFP or UNC-63::GFP in DD neurons produces punctate labeling in the DD1 synaptic region that closely resembles ACR-12::GFP clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Neurexin has been well documented to play roles in mammalian synapse formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dean et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Graf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Missler et al., 2003</xref>).

Importantly, we do not observe appreciable alterations in the clustering of muscle AChRs in <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), similar to previously reported findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). The profound alterations in ACR-12 localization described above, coupled with the lack of effect on muscle AChRs, therefore warranted an in-depth analysis of cholinergic synapses with GABAergic neurons in <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants.</p><p>We first sought to distinguish whether <italic>nrx-1</italic> performs a specific role in synapse formation or serves more generalized functions in the developmental maturation of DD neurons. We studied the developmental remodeling of DD neurons, characterized by the dorsoventral repositioning of synaptic markers, which occurs at the L1/L2 transition in wild type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jin and Qi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White et al., 1978</xref>). In particular, we examined the repositioning of pre- and post-synaptic markers expressed specifically in DD motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Presynaptic remodeling, as measured using the synaptic vesicle marker mCherry::RAB-3, proceeds normally in <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants, indicating that this process does not require neurexin expression. The clustering of ACR-12 receptors, however, is impaired both prior to and following remodeling in <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants, suggesting that NRX-1 is required for receptor clustering in each of these developmental stages.</p><p>As is the case for mammals, the <italic>C. elegans nrx-1</italic> locus encodes both long (<italic>nrx-1<sub>L</sub></italic>) and short (<italic>nrx-1<sub>S</sub></italic>) neurexin isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The long isoform encodes a single pass transmembrane protein harboring intracellular PDZ binding and interleaved extracellular LNS (laminin-neurexin-sex hormone-binding globulin) and EGF-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The <italic>ok1649</italic> allele generates an in-frame deletion, eliminating 861 bp predicted to encode an extracellular LNS domain, raising the possibility that partial NRX-1 function may still be present in this strain. We therefore expanded our analysis to include additional <italic>nrx-1</italic> deletions, three of which (<italic>ds1, tm1961,</italic> and <italic>nu485</italic>) are predicted to primarily impact the long isoform, while another (<italic>wy778</italic>) removes the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains shared by all NRX-1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calahorro and Ruiz-Rubio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tong et al., 2015</xref>).

Strikingly, we also observe significant disruption of ACR-12 receptor clustering in the VD GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>) of <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants, indicating a requirement for <italic>nrx-1</italic> at synapses onto both GABAergic neuron classes.</p><p>In some instances (14 of 34 animals for <italic>nrx-1(wy778)</italic>), we noted that a few ACR-12 receptor clusters remain detectable. We investigated whether these residual ACR-12 receptors are localized to the cell surface by injecting Alexa594 conjugated anti-HA antibody into <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants expressing ACR-12::GFP::3xHA. Antibody fluorescent signal clearly colocalizes with ACR-12::GFP fluorescence, providing evidence that the few remaining receptor clusters in <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants are present at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>).

As noted above, ACR-12 receptors are formed as heteromeric complexes in GABAergic neurons that likely incorporate the UNC-29 and UNC-63 AChR subunits. Neurexin deletion (<italic>wy778</italic>) reduces UNC-29::GFP and UNC-63::GFP clusters in DD1 by 60%, consistent with a requirement for neurexin in the proper localization of mature, heteromeric receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>).

Additionally, we do not observe an appreciable decrease in cholinergic synaptic vesicle clusters (<italic>acr-2</italic>::SNB-1::GFP), although this analysis does not rule out all potential presynaptic defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate mechanisms by which <italic>nrx-1</italic> may instruct the formation of synapses between cholinergic and GABAergic motor neurons, we evaluated mutations in the <italic>nlg-1</italic> gene. <italic>nlg-1</italic> encodes the sole <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of neuroligin, a well characterized binding partner of neurexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ichtchenko et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ichtchenko et al., 1996</xref>).

Thus, our results suggest that presynaptic NRX-1 acts non-autonomously to direct post-synaptic assembly in GABAergic neurons. To investigate this possibility in more detail, we examined the subcellular localization of NRX-1 by expressing GFP-tagged NRX-1<sub>L</sub> (NRX-1<sub>L</sub>::GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maro et al., 2015</xref>) in a subset of cholinergic neurons (DA/DB). Expression of <italic>unc-129</italic>::NRX-1<sub>L</sub>::GFP produces discrete puncta along the dorsal nerve cord where the synaptic outputs of DA/DB neurons are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

In this study, we use dyadic <italic>C. elegans</italic> synapses between cholinergic motor neurons and their muscle and GABAergic motor neuron postsynaptic partners as a model to define novel molecular mechanisms controlling divergent connectivity. First, we identify spine-like dendritic specializations on GABAergic DD neurons. We find that heteromeric post-synaptic AChR complexes composed of the ACR-12, UNC-63, UNC-38, UNC-29 and LEV-1 subunits are localized to these structures. Second, we identify a novel neurexin signaling pathway required both for the formation of post-synaptic specializations and for AChR clustering. In contrast, <italic>nrx-1</italic>/neurexin is not required for the development of cholinergic synapses onto muscles, which instead require molecularly distinct pathways that have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Francis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gally et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gendrel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pinan-Lucarré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rapti et al., 2011</xref>). Third, we find that presynaptic <italic>nrx-1</italic> expression in cholinergic neurons is required for the establishment of synapses with GABAergic neurons, and transcriptional regulation of <italic>nrx-1</italic> is achieved through actions of the COE transcription factor <italic>unc-3</italic>. These findings suggest a model where cholinergic expression of <italic>nrx-1</italic> initiates synapse formation with GABAergic neurons via NRX-1 mediated trans-synaptic signaling. Finally, the ACh-GABA connectivity defects that we observe in <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants are paralleled by significant impairment of evoked cholinergic transmission onto GABAergic neurons, and altered sinusoidal movement. In contrast, functional connectivity with muscles is unaffected. Together, our findings provide evidence that distinct molecular signaling pathways act in parallel to establish divergent connections at dyadic synapses in the motor circuit, raising the interesting possibility that differential use of synaptic organizers may be similarly utilized in the brain to provide a molecular code directing divergent connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Heteromeric ACR-12 receptor complexes cluster in specialized post-synaptic domains of GABAergic DD dendrites</title><p>Using candidate deletion analysis and cell-specific rescue, we identified AChR subunits and accessory proteins required for the assembly and localization of ACR-12 receptors in GABAergic neurons, defining the subunit composition of this neuronal receptor. Our findings implicate four additional receptor subunits (UNC-38, UNC-63, UNC-29, LEV-1) that co-assemble with ACR-12 to form pentameric receptor complexes in GABAergic neurons, and demonstrate that three accessory proteins (UNC-74, UNC-50, RIC-3) with more generalized roles in AChR assembly and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boulin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Halevi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jospin et al., 2009</xref>) are also required. These findings provide evidence that ACR-12 receptors in GABA neurons are similar in subunit composition to muscle L-AChRs, differing only in the inclusion of the ACR-12 subunit in GABA neurons, whereas muscle L-AChRs incorporate the LEV-8 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boulin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Towers et al., 2005</xref>).

We find that these AChR-containing dendritic protrusions are apposed by presynaptic clusters of cholinergic vesicles and increase in number during the course of larval development, perhaps representing new synaptic connections formed with post-embryonic born cholinergic neurons that are integrated into the circuit following the L1/L2 transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">White et al., 1978</xref>). While further investigation of these structures will undoubtedly reveal additional insights, the characteristics we define here raise the interesting possibility that these dendritic protrusions are structural specializations for housing neurotransmitter receptors and other proteins required for post-synaptic signaling, perhaps representing an evolutionary precursor to mammalian dendritic spines.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The synaptic organizer neurexin directs post-synaptic development in a partner-specific manner</title><p><italic>nrx-1</italic> deletion impairs both AChR localization and spiny outgrowths in DD neurons, creating a gap between the pre- and post-synaptic neurons.

These findings may point toward the idea that NRX-1 is not solely involved in directing spine development, but serves an additional role in receptor clustering. Further, we show that dendritic protrusions form independently of a requirement for AChRs containing either ACR-12 or UNC-63, offering additional support that spine outgrowth and receptor clustering may be independently regulated by NRX-1.

Conversely, loss of <italic>nrx-1</italic> function specifically affects GABAergic, but not muscle, AChR clustering, and cholinergic transmission onto muscles appears largely unaffected. Our cell-specific rescue experiments indicate <italic>nrx-1</italic> acts in cholinergic neurons to coordinate post-synaptic development in GABAergic neurons via trans-synaptic signaling.</p><p>Numerous studies support neuroligin as a primary trans-synaptic binding partner with neurexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Comoletti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ichtchenko et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ichtchenko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nguyen and Südhof, 1997</xref>). Indeed, <italic>C. elegans</italic> NRX-1/neurexin function has been characterized almost exclusively in the context of its partnership with NLG-1/neuroligin. A retrograde neurexin-neuroligin signaling pathway that regulates neurotransmitter release has been described, involving signaling through the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel auxiliary subunit UNC-36/α2δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this representing a distinct mechanism from that described in our work, mutation of <italic>unc-36</italic> has no appreciable effect on post-synaptic development in our experiments. Postsynaptic expression of NLG-1/neuroligin is required at GABAergic synapses. However, MADD-4/Punctin likely acts as a major presynaptic partner for NLG-1 in this case, with NRX-1 playing a comparatively minor role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tu et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, recent work also implicates neurexin-neuroligin signaling in sexually dimorphic neurite plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hart and Hobert, 2018</xref>). In contrast to these studies, we find that NRX-1 operates independently of NLG-1 to direct the formation of cholinergic synapses with GABAergic neurons. How therefore might presynaptic neurexin direct postsynaptic maturation? Our analysis shows that presynaptic NRX-1 localizes properly in the absence of <italic>acr-12,</italic> arguing against a requirement for direct binding of neurexin to the postsynaptic receptor. Prior studies offer strong evidence for alternate neurexin binding partners that support trans-synaptic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boucard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Missler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Petrenko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pettem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sugita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Uemura et al., 2010</xref>).

Our work suggests synaptic target-specific utilization of organizers such as neurexin may specify divergent connectivity, and provide a molecular mechanism for target-specific regulation of synapse development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained at room temperature (22–24°C) on nematode growth media plates (NGM) seeded with the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain OP50.

Images were obtained using either a 3i (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) Everest spinning-disk confocal microscope or Olympus BX51WI spinning disk confocal equipped with a 63x objective. All DD1 confocal images were obtained by imaging L4 hermaphrodites of similar size in the region near the pharynx using identical image and laser settings for each marker, and receptor clusters were quantified in a region from the DD1 cell body to connecting commissure (i.e. the synaptic region).</p><p>Analysis of synapse number/fluorescence intensity was conducted using either Volocity 6.3 or ImageJ software (open source) using defined intensity threshold values acquired from control experiments for each fluorescent marker. Specifically, the ‘find objects’ function in Volocity was used, excluding objects &gt; 10 μm<sup>2</sup> and &lt;0.2 μm<sup>2</sup>. Alternatively, the ‘analyze particles’ function of ImageJ was used.

Optogenetic stimulation experiments employed a 625 nm (40 W) LED (Mightex Systems). Optical output through the objective was 0.3 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at the focal plane of the specimen. Simultaneous GCaMP excitation (488 nm) and emission (525 nm) acquisition and Chrimson activation were achieved using a 556 nm edge BrightLine single-edge short-pass dichroic beam splitter positioned in the light path (Semrock).</p><p>Data were acquired using Volocity software. Images were binned at 4 × 4 during acquisition and sampled at 10 Hz. GABA motor neuron and muscle ROIs in respective experiments were identified by mCherry fluorescence. Recordings from motor neuron cell bodies were obtained systematically, beginning at the anterior end of the ventral nerve cord and moving in a posterior direction. Each field typically contained 1–5 GABA motor neurons. Only recordings of neurons located anterior to the vulva were included in the analysis. Muscle recordings were obtained either directly anterior or posterior to the vulva.</p><p>Photobleaching correction was carried out by fitting an exponential function to the data (CorrectBleach plugin, ImageJ). A linear fit (Igor Pro, Wavemetrics) of the background fluorescence was subtracted from the cell body fluorescence across all time points. Pre-stimulus baseline fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub>) was calculated as the average of the corrected background-subtracted data points in the first 4 s of the recording and the corrected fluorescence data was normalized to prestimulus baseline as ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>, where ∆F = F – F<sub>0</sub>. Peak ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> was determined by fitting a Gaussian function to the ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> time sequence using Multi peak 2.0 (Igor Pro, WaveMetrics). All data collected were analyzed, including failures (no response to stimulation). Peak ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> values were calculated from recordings of &gt;10 animals per genotype. Mean peaks ± SEM were calculated from all peak ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> data values and normalized to the wild type mean. Latency was calculated as the time required from stimulus onset for fluorescence (∆F/F<sub>0</sub>) to reach two times the pre-stimulus baseline standard deviation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Larsch et al., 2015</xref>). Duration was measured as the time between the onset of the transient and the completion of the decay back to the baseline. Rise and decay time constants were determined from the time constant of exponential fits between the baseline and peak fluorescence as appropriate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dori Schafer, Vivian Budnik, Alexandra Byrne and members of the Francis lab for critical reading of the manuscript, Claire Bénard, Kang Shen, and David Miller for sharing reagents, and Michael Gorczyca, Will Joyce, and the UMMS Model Organism CRISPR Core for technical assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Oliver Hobert) and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>As you will see below, the overall importance of the manuscript was appreciated by the reviewers, but each of the reviewers identified a number of points that need to be addressed. Some of these points require experimentation, while many others can be addressed through editorial changes.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper features a genetically regulated pathway that functions in presynaptic cholinergic neurons to control morphogenesis and receptor clustering at post synaptic domains in a mechanism that depends on the conserved cell surface protein, Neurexin. Interestingly, the function of this synaptogenic pathway is limited to only one of the two types of postsynaptic cells receiving cholinergic innervation. The authors emphasize the selectivity of this effect on &quot;divergent&quot; synapses which will no doubt stimulate future studies to reveal the cell biological mechanism of this example of synaptic discrimination. This work exploits the power of live cell imaging and genetics in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to good effect. Experiments are comprehensive, and the paper is well written. As noted below, however, additional experiments are needed to validate key findings.</p><p>1) CRISPR-induced mutations that are predicted to disrupt translation of the C-terminal PDZ domain are used in structure-function experiments to argue that the PDZ domain is required for NRX-1 function. This approach does not rule out the alternative explanation, however, that expression of the entire NRX-1 protein is also disrupted. Indeed, this possibility seems very likely for the nrx-1(uf181) allele which introduces a premature stop codon and thus is predicted to result in nonsense mediated decay (NMD) of the entire nrx-1 transcript, and hence, a mutant phenotype equivalent to that of nrx-1 null alleles. To remedy this ambiguity, the authors need to show either that the truncated NRX-1 protein is expressed in the CRISPR alleles or demonstrate that a NRX-1 protein lacking the PDZ domain fails to rescue the nrx-1 mutant.</p><p>2) The nrx-1 mutation results in fewer ACR-12 clusters which the authors interpret to mean that NRX-1 is required for ACR-12 clustering. This result could also arise, however, from reduced acr-12 expression. This alternative possibility should be addressed.</p><p>3) Are spine-like protrusions unique to the DD1 neuron or are they also visible in other members of the DD class? This point seems important since ACR-12 receptor clustering is disrupted in other DD neurons.</p><p>4) In subsection “The synaptic organizer neurexin directs post-synaptic development in a partner-specific manner”. The authors state &quot;…we find that nrx-1 is required for ACR-12 receptor localization in GABAergic DD and VD neurons, although we observe spine-like protrusions only in DD neurons. These findings argue that NRX-1 is not solely involved in directing spine development but serves an additional role in receptor clustering.&quot; Did this work rule out the existence of post synaptic spines in VDs or was it simply not possible to resolve them due to overlapping GFP signal from DDs in the dorsal cord? This point needs to be addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Philbrook et al., examine the role of the cell adhesion molecule neurexin in synapse assembly, and find that <italic>C. elegans</italic> presynaptic neurexin drives the development of one but not the other postsynaptic partner in a dyadic synapse. They show that nrx is responsible for the development of dendritic &quot;spines&quot; on postsynaptic GABAergic neurons as well as the clustering/stabilization of acetylcholine receptors opposite sites of presynaptic release. Loss of nrx leads to a loss of spines, AChR clusters, and functional connectivity between these two classes of neurons, while leaving intact the development and connectivity onto muscle cells. The authors go on to demonstrate the transcriptional control over nrx expression in these neurons. This is a technically impressive study that lends some insight into how individual neurons might form molecularly distinct synapses onto multiple partners, and perhaps also identifies a new model system for studying dendritic &quot;spine&quot; development.</p><p>The weakness of the paper is that the molecular conclusions are not novel (neurexin is well known to be involved in trans-synaptic receptor clustering). In addition, the effect of neurexin in regulating postsynaptic development could be indirect, possibly due to the presynaptic deficits. Lastly, the main conceptual conclusions regarding dyadic synapse development and/or the establishment of a model for spine development in the worm are not adequately fleshed out.</p><p>1) The authors fail to show that the effect of nrx is mediated by a direct interaction with a postsynaptic partner, as opposed to through disruption of presynaptic assembly. This is especially salient given the lack of phenotype in neuroligin mutants or any other putative postsynaptic partner. Their evidence for a direct role in postsynaptic development relies on the fact that they can disrupt nrx function with mutations in the extracellular domain, but these could still have an effect on the protein as a whole. In fact, in their candidate screen they found that syd-1 mutants, which are known to play a role in presynaptic assembly and to bind nrx in other organisms, also exhibit a defect in postsynaptic receptor clustering. The authors should determine whether other (stronger) presynaptic assembly mutants such as syd-2/liprin-α also exhibit defects in postsynaptic receptor clustering. If so, this could indicate a more indirect role for nrx. Their analysis of presynaptic development is cursory (they look at one synaptic vesicle marker expressed in all cholinergic neurons), so their conclusions that presynaptic development is normal should be much more tempered.</p><p>2) A major conclusion of the paper is that neurexin is responsible for the proper development and function of one half of a dyadic synapse. This is a novel and intriguing conclusion, but the idea that these specific synapses are functionally dyadic rests primarily on the EM connectomics data. The functional assays performed here were not performed at the same synapses that were developmentally characterized in the first part of the paper: according to the methods section, muscle function was assessed near the vulva, and GABAergic function was assessed in many different GABAergic neurons. Moreover, presynaptic stimulation was targeted quite broadly to all cholinergic neurons. To properly conclude that the DD1 synapses, whose development is dependent on nrx, are functionally part of a dyadic synapse, the authors should record calcium transients from the muscles that are in the same region as DD1, and from DD1 itself rather than all GABAergic neurons. Moreover, to exclude the possibility that different classes of presynaptic neurons exert preferentially control of different postsynaptic partners, they should express their Chrimson in as small a subset of presynaptic neurons as possible (for example, VAs, for which there is a specific promoter, unc-4). Showing that a functional readout from the same location is differentially controlled by nrx would greatly strengthen their main conclusion.</p><p>3) Another interesting facet of the current study is the possibility to establish this as a system in which to study dendritic spine development in such a genetically tractable organism. If the authors choose to emphasize this aspect of the work though, they should demonstrate that these structures indeed behave like spines, for example, by showing that there is some intracellular signaling component that is restricted to the spines. Perhaps more importantly, it is unclear how neurexin acts non-cell-autonomously to promote initial spine outgrowth, which the authors suggest, due to the lack of spines even early in development. Given the significant gap between the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, it seems unlikely that presynaptic nrx could directly induce the initial outgrowth of these spines. More likely, if the interaction is indeed direct, nrx stabilizes spines that have already grown out. To determine whether this is the case, and strengthen their model of spine development, the authors could conduct live imaging of the spines during their development, to see whether initial spine outgrowth is coupled with retraction.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this study the authors make use of cell biology, molecular genetics, behavior and calcium imaging to determine the mechanisms that specify formation of postsynaptic sites in GABA neurons. They discover that transcription factor unc-3 directs expression in presynaptic cholinergic cells of Neurexin, and that Neurexin acts non-cell autonomously to specify both the formation of dendritic spine-like structures, and clustering of cholinergic postsynaptic receptors. Their studies also demonstrate that the molecular mechanisms used by Neurexin to instruct formation of postsynaptic sites are independent of the canonical interacting partner, Neuroligin. This suggests that the newly identified, in vivo mechanisms are different from those that have been previously reported. Importantly, the mechanisms used by cholinergic neurons to connect to GABAergic neurons are distinct from the mechanisms used by the same cholinergic neurons to form neuromuscular junctions. The study is elegant, rigorous and a significant contribution to the field.</p><p>1) This work has a number of interesting contributions, including the one that the authors chose to emphasize, the concept of genetically separable molecular mechanism specifying partner choice in dyadic synapses (which they refer to as divergent synapses, a term that should be defined early in the Introduction). If the framing remains on dyadic synapses, the paper would benefit from the authors reproducing and showing the muscle phenotypes they refer to throughout the text.</p><p>2) Have the authors validated ACR-12:GFP construct as functional with phenotypic rescue in acr-12 mutants?</p><p>3) In Figure 1F, the authors observed 60%-70% of the cholinergic receptor clusters are located on the spine-like structure and 30-40% are located on the main dendrites. Do nrx-1 mutants reduce ACR-12 clustering to the same level in both pools?</p><p>4) In VD GABAergic neurons there are no spiny protrusions, but the ACR-12 clustering is still reduced in nrx-1 mutants. Could the authors comment on these differences between DD neurons and VD neurons (in terms of the spine-like structures)?</p><p>5) Mutations in the acetylcholine receptor subunit genes, such as unc-63 and acr-12, reduce cholinergic receptor clustering without affecting spiny protrusions. Are there any mutants that abolish spiny protrusion without affecting receptor clustering in the DD neurons?</p><p>6) In Figure 3E, what does the allele tm1961 do to nrx-1? Does it not cause decrease in ACR-12 cluster numbers?</p><p>7) In Figure 2D, UNC-29::GFP or UNC-63::GFP were expressed in DD neurons and their pattern resembles ACR-12::GFP clustering. Were the three subunits co-expressed with different fluorophores? Was their relative localization to each other (or co-localization) examined?</p><p>8) In Figure 6G (left), it seems there is a significant difference between wild-type and unc-3(e151)+Ach:nrx-1L. If so, does lacking NRX-1L alone explain the reduced cluster number in unc-3(e151)?</p><p>9) Was unc-3 rescued in cholinergic neurons?</p><p>10) The authors demonstrate that the intracellular domain of Neurexin is required for its function, yet Neurexin plays a non-cell autonomous role in postsynaptic vesicle clustering. Can the authors integrate their observations of the intracellular domain requirement to the model/discussion?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35692.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper features a genetically regulated pathway that functions in presynaptic cholinergic neurons to control morphogenesis and receptor clustering at post synaptic domains in a mechanism that depends on the conserved cell surface protein, Neurexin.

Lastly, the main conceptual conclusions regarding dyadic synapse development and/or the establishment of a model for spine development in the worm are not adequately fleshed out.</p></disp-quote><p>We reply to the reviewer’s specific points below and hope the reviewer will agree that these additional analyses address their concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors fail to show that the effect of nrx is mediated by a direct interaction with a postsynaptic partner, as opposed to through disruption of presynaptic assembly. This is especially salient given the lack of phenotype in neuroligin mutants or any other putative postsynaptic partner. Their evidence for a direct role in postsynaptic development relies on the fact that they can disrupt nrx function with mutations in the extracellular domain, but these could still have an effect on the protein as a whole. In fact, in their candidate screen they found that syd-1 mutants, which are known to play a role in presynaptic assembly and to bind nrx in other organisms, also exhibit a defect in postsynaptic receptor clustering. The authors should determine whether other (stronger) presynaptic assembly mutants such as syd-2/liprin-α also exhibit defects in postsynaptic receptor clustering. If so, this could indicate a more indirect role for nrx.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insights and agree that this is an important point to address. We now include new analysis of a syd-2 deletion allele in the revised version of the manuscript. The effects of syd-2 deletion on ACR-12 receptor clustering are substantially less severe than observed for mutation of nrx-1, and comparable to mutation of syd-1 (Figure 3A). As the reviewer notes, our findings related to syd-1 and syd-2 may point to an interesting link between presynaptic organization and postsynaptic assembly, and we plan to pursue these questions in future work. Based on the severity of the nrx-1 deletion phenotype compared with mutation of syd-1 or syd-2, and the specific alterations in GABAergic post-synaptic specializations that we observe (muscle receptors are normally clustered in nrx-1 mutants), we propose a specific requirement for neurexin in guiding post-synaptic assembly in GABA neurons independent of contributions to presynaptic organization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Their analysis of presynaptic development is cursory (they look at one synaptic vesicle marker expressed in all cholinergic neurons), so their conclusions that presynaptic development is normal should be much more tempered.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point. Our analysis of the SNB-1::GFP synaptic vesicle marker in cholinergic neurons suggests that synaptic vesicles are grossly normally in <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants, but does not exclude all potential defects in presynaptic development. Based on our observation that evoked stimulation of cholinergic motor neurons produces normal muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants, we suggest that presynaptic organization is sufficiently preserved to support evoked cholinergic transmission, consistent with prior electrophysiology studies of <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants from the Kaplan lab. We now clarify our discussion of these findings as suggested by the reviewer (subsection “Neurexin directs cholinergic connectivity with GABAergic neurons”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major conclusion of the paper is that neurexin is responsible for the proper development and function of one half of a dyadic synapse. This is a novel and intriguing conclusion, but the idea that these specific synapses are functionally dyadic rests primarily on the EM connectomics data. The functional assays performed here were not performed at the same synapses that were developmentally characterized in the first part of the paper: according to the methods section, muscle function was assessed near the vulva, and GABAergic function was assessed in many different GABAergic neurons. Moreover, presynaptic stimulation was targeted quite broadly to all cholinergic neurons. To properly conclude that the DD1 synapses, whose development is dependent on nrx, are functionally part of a dyadic synapse, the authors should record calcium transients from the muscles that are in the same region as DD1, and from DD1 itself rather than all GABAergic neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We now realize that we did not provide a clear explanation of the rationale underlying our Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging studies. Our initial light microscopy studies focused on DD1 as an experimentally tractable model, but we note that our findings for DD1 are generalizable to other GABAergic neurons. In the revised version we include new data to make this point more clearly. In particular, we show that more posterior DD neurons also have spines, and that both spine outgrowth and receptor clustering in these neurons require <italic>nrx-1</italic> (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). Similarly, we show that acetylcholine receptor clusters in VD neurons are disrupted by mutation of <italic>nrx-1</italic> (Figure 3E-G). We have recorded evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients directly from DD1 neurons, but, due to the close proximity of DD1 to the pharynx, these recordings are challenging. We therefore included GABAergic neurons posterior to DD1 in our analysis. We clarify our rationale in subsection “<italic>nrx-1</italic> deletion impairs cholinergic neurotransmission onto GABAergic neurons” of the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, to exclude the possibility that different classes of presynaptic neurons exert preferentially control of different postsynaptic partners, they should express their Chrimson in as small a subset of presynaptic neurons as possible (for example, VAs, for which there is a specific promoter, unc-4). Showing that a functional readout from the same location is differentially controlled by nrx would greatly strengthen their main conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>For our studies, we elected for broad presynaptic cholinergic stimulation in order to minimize any potential difficulties arising from preferential connectivity. The available connectivity data suggest that individual GABAergic neurons receive inputs from multiple classes of cholinergic neurons. Thus, we reasoned that stimulation of all presynaptic cholinergic neurons would offer the best opportunity for an unbiased investigation of post-synaptic responses. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer that the question of preferential connectivity is intriguing. As the reviewer suggests, we generated strains expressing <italic>unc-4</italic>::Chrimson, but, in our initial attempts, have been unable to record Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from either GABAergic neurons or muscles following light stimulation. This may be due to low expression of the <italic>unc-4</italic>::Chrimson transgene in A motor neurons, as we observe measurable expression in only a small number of ventral cord neurons (we think these are VC neurons) by the age at which we record (young adult). We hope the reviewer will agree that additional exploration of this interesting question is more suitable for a future study following the optimization of these tools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another interesting facet of the current study is the possibility to establish this as a system in which to study dendritic spine development in such a genetically tractable organism. If the authors choose to emphasize this aspect of the work though, they should demonstrate that these structures indeed behave like spines, for example, by showing that there is some intracellular signaling component that is restricted to the spines. Perhaps more importantly, it is unclear how neurexin acts non-cell-autonomously to promote initial spine outgrowth, which the authors suggest, due to the lack of spines even early in development. Given the significant gap between the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, it seems unlikely that presynaptic nrx could directly induce the initial outgrowth of these spines. More likely, if the interaction is indeed direct, nrx stabilizes spines that have already grown out. To determine whether this is the case, and strengthen their model of spine development, the authors could conduct live imaging of the spines during their development, to see whether initial spine outgrowth is coupled with retraction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our study poses some intriguing questions about dendritic spine development in worms. By L4 stage, we note an appreciable gap between the pre- and postsynaptic domains in <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants, due to the absence of spine-like protrusions contacting the presynaptic axon (Figure 7A). As the size of this gap is expected to be significantly smaller in younger animals, we envision that NRX-1 promotes spine outgrowth early in development. We have not been able to detect these structures prior to the L2 stage, and we therefore suggest that they form coincident with, or shortly after, DD neuron remodeling, when the post-embryonic ventral cholinergic neurons are integrated into the circuit. To directly address temporal requirements for <italic>nrx-1</italic> expression, we have attempted to delay neurexin expression using an inducible (heat-shock) promoter, but, to date, our attempts have been unsuccessful (due to leaky expression of <italic>nrx-1</italic>). We agree with the reviewer that live imaging of the spines during their outgrowth is likely to be informative, and we are currently pursuing this approach. Nonetheless, these experiments are technically challenging given the small size of these structures in L2 animals and will likely require considerable time for optimization. While we favor the idea that neurexin is required for spine outgrowth, at this point we do not rule out a potential maintenance role. We now include this possibility in the text (subsection “Post-synaptic morphological development requires NRX-1”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this study the authors make use of cell biology, molecular genetics, behavior and calcium imaging to determine the mechanisms that specify formation of postsynaptic sites in GABA neurons. They discover that transcription factor unc-3 directs expression in presynaptic cholinergic cells of Neurexin, and that Neurexin acts non-cell autonomously to specify both the formation of dendritic spine-like structures, and clustering of cholinergic postsynaptic receptors. Their studies also demonstrate that the molecular mechanisms used by Neurexin to instruct formation of postsynaptic sites are independent of the canonical interacting partner, Neuroligin. This suggests that the newly identified, in vivo mechanisms are different from those that have been previously reported. Importantly, the mechanisms used by cholinergic neurons to connect to GABAergic neurons are distinct from the mechanisms used by the same cholinergic neurons to form neuromuscular junctions. The study is elegant, rigorous and a significant contribution to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) This work has a number of interesting contributions, including the one that the authors chose to emphasize, the concept of genetically separable molecular mechanism specifying partner choice in dyadic synapses (which they refer to as divergent synapses, a term that should be defined early in the Introduction). If the framing remains on dyadic synapses, the paper would benefit from the authors reproducing and showing the muscle phenotypes they refer to throughout the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have more clearly defined divergent connectivity in the Introduction as the reviewer suggested, and have reproduced the muscle phenotypes referred to in the text, now included in Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Have the authors validated ACR-12:GFP construct as functional with phenotypic rescue in acr-12 mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown that GABAergic expression of ACR-12::GFP rescues <italic>acr-12</italic> mutant phenotypes, demonstrating that this construct is functional (Petrash et al., 2013).

Do nrx-1 mutants reduce ACR-12 clustering to the same level in both pools?</p></disp-quote><p>In wild type, 67% of receptor clusters are associated with spines, while just 14.7% of receptor clusters are associated with remaining spines in <italic>nrx-1(ok1649)</italic> mutants. In contrast, the number of receptor clusters associated with the main dendritic shaft is not appreciably altered by mutation of <italic>nrx-1 (p</italic>=0.67, student’s t test). This point is now clarified in the text (subsection “Post-synaptic morphological development requires NRX-1”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In VD GABAergic neurons there are no spiny protrusions, but the ACR-12 clustering is still reduced in nrx-1 mutants. Could the authors comment on these differences between DD neurons and VD neurons (in terms of the spine-like structures)?</p></disp-quote><p>Using a reporter that labels VD and DD processes, we did not find postsynaptic spines in VD neurons (representative image now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). This suggests either neurexin promotes receptor clustering independently of spines in VD neurons, or spines are present, but we are unable to detect them due to the number of GABAergic processes. Please also see the response to reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Mutations in the acetylcholine receptor subunit genes, such as unc-63 and acr-12, reduce cholinergic receptor clustering without affecting spiny protrusions. Are there any mutants that abolish spiny protrusion without affecting receptor clustering in the DD neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>Independent of this study, we have isolated several mutants from a forward genetic screen in which spine-like protrusions are significantly decreased, but receptor clustering is less strongly affected, perhaps indicating a redistribution of receptor clusters to the main dendritic shaft. We are currently in the process of identifying and characterizing the genes affected by these mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 3E, what does the allele tm1961 do to nrx-1?

Were the three subunits co-expressed with different fluorophores? Was their relative localization to each other (or co-localization) examined?</p></disp-quote><p>Great idea. We are still working on creating constructs to co-express subunits with different fluorophores. To date, we have not identified additional fluorophores that provide sufficient fluorescent signal for analysis, and also accommodate proper receptor assembly and trafficking. We hope to re-examine the relative co-localization of the three subunits in the future as we develop new reagents to address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 6G (left), it seems there is a significant difference between wild-type and unc-3(e151)+Ach:nrx-1L. If so, does lacking NRX-1L alone explain the reduced cluster number in unc-3(e151)?</p></disp-quote><p>Expression of <italic>unc-3</italic>::NRX-1<sub>L</sub>::GFP in <italic>unc-3</italic> mutants does not restore ACR-12::GFP receptor clustering fully to wild type levels. However, in this analysis we are using a different promoter (<italic>unc-3</italic> promoter compared to the <italic>unc-17β</italic> promoter used in Figure 5C-D for rescue) so the levels of expression likely differ across these two strains. We suggest that decreased <italic>nrx-1<sub>L</sub></italic> expression in <italic>unc-3</italic> mutants is a major contributor to decreased receptor clustering. However, reduced <italic>nrx-1<sub>L</sub></italic> expression is unlikely to account for all of the defects. For example, mutation of <italic>unc-3</italic> produces variable changes in process outgrowth and nerve cord fasciculation, which do not occur with disruption of <italic>nrx-1</italic>, and therefore may influence our analysis of receptor clustering in <italic>unc-3</italic> mutants and rescue animals.

Can the authors integrate their observations of the intracellular domain requirement to the model/discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised this model in response to comments from reviewer 1. Specifically, we have removed the CRISPR alleles from the revised manuscript, and instead show that cholinergic expression of a <italic>nrx-1<sub>L</sub></italic>rescuing construct lacking the PDZ binding domain rescues ACR-12 clustering defects in <italic>nrx-1</italic> mutants. Based on these findings, we propose that NRX-1 can promote post-synaptic assembly in GABAergic neurons without a requirement for protein interactions via the PDZ binding motif.
