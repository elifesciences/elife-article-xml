(conditioned stimulus, CS). Nevertheless, the circuits underlying such balancing are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the role of the ventral tail striatum (vTS) in auditory-cued fear learning of male mice. In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging showed that sizable sub-populations of direct (D1R+) and indirect pathway neurons (Adora+) in the vTS responded to footshocks, and to the initiation of movements after freezing; moreover, a sub-population of D1R+ neurons increased its responsiveness to an auditory CS during fear learning. In-vivo optogenetic silencing shows that footshock-driven activity of D1R+ neurons contributes to fear memory formation, whereas Adora+ neurons modulate freezing in the absence of a learned CS. Circuit tracing identified the posterior insular cortex (pInsCx) as an important cortical input to the vTS, and recording of optogenetically evoked EPSCs revealed long-term plasticity with opposite outcomes at the pInsCx synapses onto D1R+ - and Adora+ neurons. Thus, direct- and indirect pathways neurons of the vTS show differential signs of plasticity after fear learning, and balance defensive behaviors in the presence and absence of learned sensory cues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fear memory</kwd><kwd>neuronal circuits</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>freezing behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 224-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kintscher</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_176332 / 1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneggenburger</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NCCR Synapsy - The Synaptic Bases of Mental Disease</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project P28</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schneggenburger</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Direct- and indirect pathway neurons of the posterior striatum display divergent in vivo and ex vivo plasticity after fear learning, and differentially modulate defensive behaviors displayed in the presence, and absence of threat-predicting sensory cues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fear learning is an evolutionary conserved behavior, critically important for animals to detect signs of danger in an ever-changing environment. As such, fear learning is necessary for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Phelps and LeDoux, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, learned defensive behaviors need to be finely regulated, so that animals can return to their normal behaviors after the cessation of threat -predicting sensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zanette et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, a pathological overexpression of defensive behaviors is a hallmark of several anxiety-related disorders in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunsmoor et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand the neuronal circuits that balance the expression of learned defensive behaviors during and after the presence of threat-predicting sensory cues.</p><p>The study of the neuronal mechanisms of fear learning has been strongly facilitated by employing auditory-cued fear learning in model animals like rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LeDoux, 2000</xref>). In fear learning, subjects learn to associate an initially neutral sensory cue, the conditioned stimulus (CS; often an auditory stimulus), with an aversive or painful outcome like a footshock (the unconditioned stimulus, US). After associative learning, subjects will develop a defensive behavior when the CS is later presented alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanselow, 2018</xref>). The defensive behavior that is mostly studied in the context of fear learning in rodents is behavioral arrest, also called freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanselow, 1994</xref>). Studies spanning several decades have firmly established that the amygdala has an important role in fear learning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duvarci and Pare, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>, for reviews). The lateral amygdala (LA) is viewed as an input structure to the amygdalar complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">LeDoux et al., 1990</xref>), which connects to both the basal amygdala (BA) and the central amygdala, where further integration and processing takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Romanski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Quirk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grewe et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, the execution of learned freezing depends on a central amygdala to midbrain (periaqueductal gray) projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeDoux et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, it is likely that further neuronal circuits beyond these amygdalar circuits are involved in fear learning.</p><p>The striatum is part of the basal ganglia motor system, a neuronal system with important roles in the control of movement, action selection, and reward-based learning (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hikosaka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graybiel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grillner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Redgrave et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>). The principal neurons of the striatum are inhibitory projection neurons of two types. First, striato-nigral neurons project in a direct pathway to basal ganglia output structures like the Substantia nigra pars reticularis and others; these neurons selectively express D1-dopamine receptors (D1R). Second, striato-pallidal neurons project in a more indirect pathway towards the basal ganglia output structures; these neurons selectively express D2-dopamine receptors, and also adenosine-2A receptors (Adora) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schiffmann and Vanderhaeghen, 1993</xref>). Different sub-areas of the striatum have different roles in motor control and motor learning. The dorsal striatum is involved in the learning of motor sequences and in the selection of appropriate actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>), as well as in habit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Redgrave et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burguière et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the ventral striatum is important for reward-based learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Humphries and Prescott, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox and Witten, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Recently, based on brain-wide studies of the cortical inputs to the mouse striatum, a further sub-area of the striatum was identified; a posterior area called tail striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Valjent and Gangarossa, 2021</xref> for review). Interestingly, early in vivo recordings in the LA have found CS- and US-responsive neurons in the tail striatum adjacent to the LA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Romanski et al., 1993</xref>). Recent work has shown that the tail striatum is, similarly as other striatal areas, composed of D1R-expressing (D1R+) and D2R- and Adora-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gangarossa et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, in vivo imaging studies have shown that dopaminergic axons in the tail striatum code for salient sensory stimuli, but not for rewarding stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of the tail striatum in fear learning has not been studied.</p><p>Here, we use in vivo miniature microscope Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, as well as in vivo and ex vivo optogenetic approaches and circuit tracing, to investigate the role of D1R+, and Adora+ neurons located in the ventral part of the tail striatum (vTS) in auditory-cued fear learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Coding for footshocks, tones and movement by D1R+ vTS neurons</title><p>We started by imaging the activity of vTS neurons during a 3-day fear learning paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To access the vTS, a deep brain area close to the basolateral - and central nuclei of the amygdala, we used miniature-microscope Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>).

In addition, a histogram of the movement - ON events during these times was computed (third panel, black histograms). This revealed that on the training day (<bold>B</bold>) and on the recall day (<bold>C</bold>), about 10–15% of the tones were followed at 0–400ms by a movement (see arrows), indicating that under these conditions, some tones induced movement initiation of the mice. Because movement - ON transitions can by themselves induce an activity of D1R+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M-O</xref>), we removed those events that were followed by a movement (around 85–90% of all events were <italic>retained</italic>; see exact values at the bottom, averaged across the N=8 imaged <italic>Drd1a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice).

In addition, histograms of the CS events relative to the movement-ON events were computed (third panel, black histograms). This revealed that many movement-ON transitions were preceded by a tone event (by ~200–400ms; arrows), again suggesting that tones likely cause movement-ON events with a certain probability, a phenomenon especially visible during the training-recall sessions (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because tones can themselves cause activity in D1R+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we removed those events which were preceded at 0–400ms by a tone. Despite the relatively high number of coinciding events, there were no marked changes between the corrected - and non-corrected Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (second panel from top, compared red [corrected] and black [non-corrected] traces).

On the first day, mice experienced a habituation session during which six 30 s CS stimulation blocks consisting of 7 kHz tone beeps were applied (see Materials and methods). During this session, only a small sub-population of D1R+ neurons (6/176) showed a response to the tone beeps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, I</xref>). One day later, each of the six CS blocks was followed by a 1 s footshock, to which 45/163 imaged D1R+ neurons responded with robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and H</xref>). During this training session, an increased number of D1R+ neurons responded to tone beeps (CS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and L</xref>; Chi-square test, p=0.018, Χ<sup>2</sup><sub>df=2</sub> = 8.004); the average Ca<sup>2+</sup> response of the neurons that responded was similar to the one observed during the habituation session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). During the training- and recall session, we also observed that tone beeps were in 10–15% of the cases followed by movement transitions; for the calculation of the number of CS - responders, these trials were removed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, during a fear memory recall session on day 3, the CS was presented alone in a different context. During this session, the number of tone-responsive neurons was comparable to the one during the training session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>); the average Z-scored Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was increased above the response amplitude on the training session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>; 0.366±0.071 vs 0.093±0.034 for n=19 and 17 responders, respectively; 95% CI: [0.2164; 0.516]; [0.0212; 0.1649]; p=0.001, U=61, Mann-Whitney test). Thus, in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging showed that a significant fraction of D1R+ neurons in the vTS responds to footshocks, and furthermore, that D1R+ neurons increase their responsiveness to the CS.</p><p>During fear learning, rodents acquire a defensive behavior in response to a CS, in the form of freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanselow, 2018</xref>). The freezing bouts of mice typically lasted a few seconds, and were interrupted by movement re-initiation (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). We asked whether transitions from freezing to movement would drive activity in D1R+ vTS neurons; we first restricted this analysis to times when no tones (CS) were presented. Aligning GCaMP6m fluorescence traces to the movement onset revealed Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in a sub- population of D1R+ neurons; we call these ‘movement-ON’ responses. The number of responding neurons decreased across the 3-day fear learning protocol, although this trend did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–O</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S</xref>, open symbols; p=0.117; Χ<sup>2</sup><sub>df=2</sub> = 4.292, Chi-square test). We next analyzed movement-ON responses during the 30 s CS presentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P–R</xref>). We found that a substantial number of movement-ON transitions were preceded by a tone; for the calculation of the percentage of movement-ON responders, these events were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The analysis showed that the number of D1R+ neurons that responded to a movement-ON transition during the time of the CS presentations increased during the training session, and was maintained at an elevated level during the recall session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S</xref>, filled symbols; p=0.0155, Χ<sup>2</sup><sub>df=2</sub> = 8.340, Chi-square test). Furthermore, the number of neurons responding to a movement-ON transition was always higher during the CS, as compared to no - CS periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S</xref>). Taken together, this data suggests that subpopulations of D1R+ neurons, in addition to responding to footshocks- and to tone stimulation, also code for movement onset.</p><p>We next analyzed more comprehensively how the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-event frequency depends on the movement state of the animal <italic>and</italic> on the presence or absence of a CS. For this, we first deconvolved the fluorescence traces to obtain times of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events and their amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T</xref>; Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giovannucci et al., 2019</xref>). This allowed us to compute the amplitude-weighted frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events during the four combinations of movement states / tone presentations, for each day of the fear learning protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1U</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The data was significantly different across conditions (p&lt;0.0001, KW = 138.33, Kruskal-Wallis test). Pairwise comparisons of these conditional Ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequencies within each session showed that on most sessions, the activity of D1R+ neurons was significantly higher when the mice moved, than when they froze, with the exception of the no-CS times on the training day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1U</xref>; Dunn’s multiple comparisons test; for p-values, see legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). On the training day, given that mice moved, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequency was significantly increased by the CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1U</xref>; p=0.0163, Mean rank difference = 241.9, Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test). Thus, in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging during a 3-day fear learning protocol shows that the activity of the D1R+ neurons in the vTS is higher during movement than during the freezing state of the mice. Moreover, fear learning increases the number of neurons with a phasic response to tones (CS), as well as the number of neurons with a movement-ON response during the CS presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L and S</xref>).</p><p>To determine the location of the imaged neurons and to compare them across mice, we aligned the center of the GRIN lens to a mouse brain atlas in each mouse, and generated a common cell map based on the cell coordinates relative to the lens center (Materials and methods). This revealed a hotspot of footshock- and tone-responding D1R+ neurons in the posterior-ventral region of the tail striatum medial to the LA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). D1R+ neurons with movement-ON responses during the recall sessions were located in a similar area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Venn plots of the overlay of the various response types showed that during the habituation session, neurons with responses to the CS and movement did not strongly overlap, and represented a small proportion of the imaged neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). During the training session, the neurons with tone- and movement-ON responses increased in numbers (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L and S</xref>), and about half of each sub-population also showed a footshock response. During the recall session, the populations of both tone - and movement responders stayed constant with respect to the training day, and these response types now overlapped substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging shows that a subpopulation of D1R+ vTS neurons, located in a posterior-ventral hotspot of the tail striatum, responds to footshocks. During the course of fear learning, these neurons increasingly code for an aversively motivated CS and for movement-ON transitions, suggesting that these representations in populations of D1R+ vTS neurons undergo plasticity driven by fear learning.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spatial localization of the imaged D1R+ vTS neurons, and overlap of neurons coding for sensory events and movement state.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Maps with the position of all imaged D1R+ vTS neurons, plotted as projection on the horizontal plane.

A Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the amplitude-weighted frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events differed across categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R</xref>; p&lt;0.0001, KW = 184.6). During all three behavior sessions, and irrespective of the presence or absence of a CS, the activity of Adora+ neurons was larger during movement than during freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R</xref>; see legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> for the corresponding p-values; post-hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test).

This analysis thus corroborates our finding that the activity of Adora+ neurons is only little modulated by tones and that it is more strongly modulated by movement, but that neither of the two representations are modulated in a plastic fashion by fear learning. The spatial distribution of Adora+ neurons responding to footshocks, tones and movement-ON transitions was overall similar to the one of D1R+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

However, Adora+ neurons do not change their responses to tones and movement-ON transitions during fear learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>D1R+ and Adora+ vTS neurons do not instruct freezing or movement</title><p>In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging showed that sub-populations of neurons within the two main types of principal neurons in the vTS code for footshocks, for the CS and for movement-ON transitions; furthermore, D1R+ neurons increased their representation of tones and movements with fear learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). We next wished to investigate how D1R+ and Adora+ vTS neurons might contribute to fear learning. A classical model of basal ganglia function postulates that D1R+ neurons in the direct pathway initiate movement, whereas Adora+ (or D2R+) neurons in the indirect pathway suppress movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, one possible straightforward hypothesis is that activity of Adora+ neurons of the vTS instructs an arrest of movement, or freezing, and vice-versa, that D1R+ neurons instruct movement re-initiation. We wished to test this hypothesis by optogenetic activation of either D1R+ - or Adora+ vTS neurons, at times when naive mice (that had not undergone fear learning) are engaged in regular exploratory behavior. For this, the channelrhodopsin variant Chronos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) was expressed bi-laterally and Cre-dependently in D1R+, or Adora+ neurons of the vTS, using AAV1:hSyn:FLEX:Chronos-eGFP in the respective Cre-mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Three to 4 weeks later, the mice were allowed to explore the fear conditioning chamber, and trains of optogenetic stimuli were applied at pre-determined intervals, irrespective of whether the mice moved or paused from movement (pulse duration 1ms, repeated at 25 Hz for 2 s; each train given six times for each mouse).

In additional experiments with Adora+ neurons, we employed longer light pulses (2 and 5 ms), but we similarly did not observe effects on the movement state of the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>).

This baseline level of freezing has been observed before (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cummings and Clem, 2020</xref>), and likely represents a residual contextual fear memory, despite the change of the context between the training day and the recall day. The 30 s tone blocks (CS) caused a vigorous increase in freezing in eGFP-expressing control mice, whereas in the Arch-expressing mice, the CS was less efficient in driving freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, black- and green average traces, N=10 eGFP- and N=12 Arch-expressing <italic>Drd1a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice).

Thus, optogenetic inhibition of D1R+ neurons in the vTS during the footshocks on the training day causes a diminished auditory-cued recall of fear memory 1 day later.

Three weeks later, a pseudotyped delta-G rabies vector driving the expression of dsRed was injected at the same coordinates; control experiments confirmed the specificity of the Cre-dependent expression of TVA-expressing vector, and the absence of ectopic expression of the rabies vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this way, starter cells at the injection site in the vTS could be identified by GFP- and dsRed co-labeling (red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, cells appearing yellow in the overlay). Trans-synaptically labeled neurons outside of the striatum were analyzed based on their expression of dsRed. We placed all presynaptic neurons found in N=2 <italic>Drd1a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and N=2 <italic>Adora2a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice into brain-wide models, with cells from the two mice arbitrarily positioned on different brain sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>; red and blue dots, respectively). In both <italic>Drd1a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Adora2a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice, we found the highest number and density of backlabeled cells in the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), and in the dorsal (granular and dysgranular) part of the insular cortex (InsCx; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref> for a list of all brain structures with detected presynaptic neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D, G and H</xref>).

Although the brain-wide distribution of presynaptic input neurons to D1R+ and Adora+ neurons in the vTS was overall similar, we detected differences on a finer scale. Thus, we found that structures known to process auditory- and multimodal sensory information, like the auditory cortex (AUD), the temporal association cortex (TeA), the posterior triangular thalamic nucleus (PoT), the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus (PiL) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), were more strongly back-labeled in <italic>Adora2a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice than in <italic>Drd1a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weinberger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sacco and Sacchetti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalmay et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barsy et al., 2020</xref>).

Taken together, rabies-virus mediated circuit tracing shows that the vTS receives its main cortical input from the S2 and the InsCx, followed by primary somatosensory areas.

Blue light pulses (1ms) at maximal light intensity evoked robust optogenetically-evoked EPSCs of 8.8±1.6 nA in D1R+ vTS neurons (95% CI: [5.28 nA; 12.2 nA]; n=12 cells), and of 2.5±0.5 nA in Adora+ vTS neurons (95% CI: [1.49 nA; 3.58 nA], n=19 cells); the EPSC amplitudes were significantly different between the two types of principal neurons (p=0.002, U=40, Mann-Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–E</xref>). At both connections, gradually increasing the stimulus light intensity led to a smooth increase of the EPSC amplitude, which shows that many axons from pInsCx neurons converge onto each type of principal neuron in the vTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). At high light intensities, the optogenetically-evoked EPSC amplitudes saturated, suggesting that a maximal number of input axons was activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>).

Here, we have investigated the role of the tail striatum in auditory-cued fear learning, in part motivated by earlier studies which showed a convergence of US - and CS signaling in the tail striatum located close to the LA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Romanski et al., 1993</xref>). We have targeted the ventral half of the tail striatum close to the amygdala, an area which we refer to as ‘ventral tail striatum’, vTS. This region might include the amygdala-striatum transition zone (‘AStria’; located immediately adjacent to the amygdala), but our targeting was not limited to the AStria.</p><p>Using Cre-driver mouse lines to target D1R-expressing and Adora-expressing neurons of the direct and indirect pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>), we studied the role of each type of vTS principal neuron in auditory-cued fear learning. We found that both classes of vTS principal neurons were strongly activated by footshock stimuli, and coded for the movement state of the mice; smaller sub-populations of both neuron types also responded to tones in naive mice. Interestingly, the number of tone-responsive D1R+ neurons, but not of Adora+ neurons, increased during auditory-cued fear learning, not dis-similar to the acquisition of tone responsiveness of amygdalar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Quirk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grewe et al., 2017</xref>). To investigate the role of footshock-driven activity in vTS principal neuron, which most likely drives plasticity in these neurons, we optogenetically silenced neuronal activity at the time of footshock delivery. In <italic>Drd1a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice, this manipulation caused decreased auditory-cue driven freezing 1 day later, which leads us to conclude that footshock-driven plasticity in vTS D1R+ neurons contributes to the formation of a cue-driven fear memory. This conclusion is corroborated by our finding that fear learning induces a postsynaptic form of LTP at a major cortical input to D1R+ neurons in the vTS. On the other hand, silencing Adora+ neurons during the footshock led to a trend towards increased freezing in the absence of a learned CS, which suggests that indirect pathway neurons of the vTS have access to learned contextual freezing. Interestingly, the finding that the vTS Adora+ subsystem acts to suppress freezing in the <italic>absence</italic> of a danger-signaling CS, is reminiscent to aspects of safety learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christianson et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, a previous study has correlated the in-vivo activity of vTS neurons with safety learning, albeit without distinguishing between direct- and indirect pathway neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rogan et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, we find that direct and indirect pathway neurons of the vTS have different roles in fear learning.

Movement-correlated activity has been observed in striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Markowitz et al., 2018</xref>), as well as in several types of sensory cortices and in a more brain-wide fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). At present, the role of the movement-related activity in the vTS remains unknown. Our optogenetic activation experiments did not reveal significant acute effects on the movement - or freezing behavior of mice, in line with previous findings in the posterior striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2018</xref>), but different from results in the dorsomedial striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>) - the latter striatal area seems to have a more immediate role in movement control than the tail striatum. Therefore, it is unlikely that the movement-ON driven activity that we found here in D1R+ or Adora+ neurons of the vTS contributes to the control of movement. Rather, one could speculate that the movement-related activity in the vTS represents a signal related to the bodily state of the animal. In this regard, the strong excitatory input from the pInsCx to the vTS which we uncovered here seems relevant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the pInsCx displays state-dependent signaling relating to physiological needs, or to the aversive state of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Livneh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gehrlach et al., 2019</xref>); it is possible that the activity of the pInsCx is additionally modulated by movement-ON transitions of the animal. Thus, future work might investigate the origins, and functions of the movement-related signals in the vTS.</p><p>Previous studies in mice analyzed anterograde tracer experiments from cortex to striatum in a brain-wide fashion; this data has also revealed specific cortical input structures to the tail striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>). We have used rabies-virus-mediated back-labeling from genetically identified neurons in the vTS, to identify presynaptic input neurons to the vTS more focally, and specifically for direct- and indirect pathway neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wall et al., 2013</xref> for a similar approach in the more anterior dorsal striatum). Our results confirm previous studies regarding the innervation of the vTS by auditory cortical areas, and by amygdalar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>). Beyond this, our data identifies the InsCx and the S2 as major cortical input structures to the vTS, both for D1R+ and Adora+ neurons. We confirmed the functional relevance of the putative connections by optogenetically assisted circuit mapping, which revealed unusually large EPSCs at the input from the pInsCx to the vTS (note that the S2 was not covered in our ex vivo optogenetic experiments). Based on the graded input-output curves when varying the light intensity, these EPSCs likely reflect converging inputs from many pInsCx neurons (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Litvina and Chen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gjoni et al., 2018</xref>). The strong inputs from the pInsCx, and presumably from the S2, suggest that in addition to auditory- and visual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamamoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>), somatosensory signals are processed in the vTS. For example, it is possible that the pInsCx transmits somatosensory or nociceptive information about a footshock during aversively motivated learning to the vTS; similarly, movement-related signals might be transferred at this connection, as discussed above. Moreover, it was shown that a subarea of the pInsCx processes auditory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rodgers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sawatari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gogolla et al., 2014</xref>), thus tone information might additionally be transmitted at this connection. Indeed, our finding of an enhanced AMPA/NMDA ratio following fear learning at the connection from the pInsCx to D1R+ vTS neurons gives rise to the hypothesis that learned auditory signals, or movement-related signals, are transmitted at this connection, a hypothesis which could be tested in future work.</p><p>Subtle, but functionally important differences in the brain areas that project to D1R+ versus Adora+ vTS neurons might determine their different in-vivo responses, and, in conjunction with the different output projections of direct- and indirect pathway neurons, their differential roles during fear learning. Recent work has shown that a separate set of midbrain dopamine neurons innervates the tail striatum, and that these dopamine projections are activated by salient, but not by rewarding stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the differential roles of vTS D1R+ versus Adora+ neurons in fear learning are likely additionally shaped by the differential effects of dopamine on the two types of striatal principal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hjorth et al., 2020</xref>). Classical studies showed that dopamine release in the amygdala contributes to fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lamont and Kokkinidis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guarraci et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nader and LeDoux, 1999</xref>), and a recent study showed that footshock-driven activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons that project to the basal amygdala (BA), contributes to fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, dopamine signaling in the vTS, likely from a different source than dopamine release in the BA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tang et al., 2020</xref>), might contribute to diversifying the roles of vTS direct- and indirect pathway neurons in fear learning.</p><p>Fear learning shows sex-specific differences in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maren et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pryce et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lebron-Milad and Milad, 2012</xref> for review). Thus, it was not possible to investigate female and male mice without differentiating between them; rather, we limited our study to male mice (see Materials and methods). In rodents, males in general show higher freezing than females, whereas females show a higher degree of fast bouts of escape reactions (called ‘darting’), which can also take the form of learned responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>). Future work might investigate whether the direct- or indirect pathway neurons in the vTS contribute to sex-specific defensive behaviors like darting in females, and whether sex-specific differences exist in the circuit wiring and plasticity mechanisms of the vTS.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions and outlook</title><p>In summary, we find that direct and indirect pathway neurons differentially modulate the degree of learned defensive behaviors in the presence, and absence of learned sensory cues. This uncovers a role of the vTS in balancing cue-specific reaction on the one hand, with a more generalized fear response on the other hand. Adaptive fear discrimination is critically important for animal survival, but is dys-regulated in anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sangha et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, it was found that during fear generalization, PTSD patients exhibited stronger responses in the striatum, amygdala and insular cortex amongst other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morey et al., 2020</xref>). Because fear expression in the absence of aversive sensory cues is downregulated by Adora+ neurons in the vTS, it is an intriguing possibility to harness the differential pharmacology of direct and indirect pathway neurons together with in vivo manipulations of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Creed et al., 2015</xref>), in an attempt to mitigate the effects of fear generalization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

of male sex. The rationale for investigating exclusively male mice was as follows. The aims of the study were to investigate with optogenetic methods whether the vTS has a role in fear learning; to image the in-vivo responses of D1R+ and Adora+ neurons of the vTS during fear learning; to identify the main cortical inputs to both types of vTS principal neurons; and to study signs of long-term plasticity at cortical input synapses to both D1R+ and Adora+ neurons after fear learning. It has been shown, mainly using rats, that sex-specific differences exist in the strength and types of learned defensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maren et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pryce et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, including mice of both sexes in the study without differentiating between them would have most likely increased the variability of the results. Thus, it would have been necessary to include male <italic>and</italic> female mice in <italic>separate</italic> groups, which would have doubled the number of experimental groups, and experimental animals used in the study. We therefore decided to perform the initial study in male mice (see also Discussion).</p><p>The experiments were performed under authorizations for animal experimentation by the veterinary office of the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland (authorizations VD3274 and VD3518).

All mice strains were back-crossed for at least five generations to a C57BL/6J background. Mice were weaned at 21 days postnatally (P21), and groups of male mice were housed together under a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle (7:00 am, light on), with food and water ad libitum. Surgery was performed at P42 - P56; mice were separated into single cages one day before surgery. For behavioral experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), mice from 1 to 2 litters were randomly assigned to control - (GFP-expressing) or effect group (Arch- expressing).

In short, a mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane (induction with 3%, maintained at 1%) and the head was fixed in a Model 940 stereotactic injection frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) using non-rupture ear bars (Zygoma Ear cups, Kopf Instruments Model 921). Local anesthesia was applied subcutaneously using a mix (50 µl) of lidocaine (1 mg/ml), bupivacaine (1.25 mg/ml) and epinephrine (0.625 µg/ml). After the skull was exposed, small craniotomies were drilled above the indicated coordinates for injection and fiber insertion. For fiber implantation, an additional craniotomy was made close to Lambda to insert an anchoring micro screw. Virus suspension was injected using pulled glass pipettes and an oil hydraulic micromanipulator (MO-10, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) with an injection speed of ~60 nl/min. For in-vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), a GRIN lens (600 µm / 7.3 mm ProView integrated lenses; cat. 1050–004413; Inscopix Inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was implanted 350 µm above the virus injection site. Prior to GRIN lens implantation, a 25 G medical injection needle was slowly inserted and retracted to facilitate the later insertion of the blunt-ended lens. To reduce deformation of brain tissue due to continuous vertical pressure, we lowered the GRIN lens with alternating down (150 µm) and up (50 µm) movements until the last 200 µm before the final position. For in-vivo optogenetic experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), optical fiber implants were implanted bilaterally above the virus injection sites. The fiber implants were custom-made of a 200 µm core / 0.39 NA / 230 µm outer diameter optic fiber (FT200EMT; Thorlabs Inc, Newton, NJ, USA) secured inside 1.25 mm outer diameter ceramic ferrules (CFLC230; Thorlabs) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sparta et al., 2012</xref>. The surface of skull, and the GRIN lens (or optical fiber implants) were treated with a light curing adhesive iBond Total Etch (Kulzer GmbH, Hanau, Germany). Blue light curing dental cement (Tetric EvoFlow, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) was then applied to the skull to hold the GRIN lens (or optical fiber implants) in place. The open end of the GRIN lens at the integrated docking platform was sealed using a Kwik-Sil silicone compound (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA). After stitching, the skin was covered with Bepanthen Plus cream (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany), the drinking water was supplemented with 1 mg/ml paracetamol and the animals were monitored for the following 6 days to ensure proper post-surgical recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavior</title><p>Auditory-cued fear learning was tested three to four weeks after the surgery. Mice were handled by the experimenter and habituated to the procedure of attaching a dummy miniature-microscope (Inscopix Inc) to the GRIN lens platform (in case of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging experiments), or optical patch cords (in case of optogenetic experiments), for 10–15 min on five consecutive days. An auditory-cued fear learning paradigm was performed in a conditioning chamber of a Video Fear Conditioning Optogenetics Package for Mouse (MED-VFC-OPTO-M, Med Associates Inc, Fairfax, VT, USA) under control of VideoFreeze software (Med Associates Inc). On day 1 (habituation), a mouse at a time was connected to the nVista3.0 mini-microscope (Inscopix Inc) or to the optic fiber patch cords, and the animal was placed in the conditioning chamber. The latter was a rectangular chamber with a metal grid floor, cleaned with 70% ethanol. During the ensuing habituation session, six tone blocks (CS), each consisting of 30 tone beeps (7 kHz, 80 dB, 100 ms duration, repeated at 1 Hz for 30 s), were applied 90 s apart. During a training session on day 2, the mouse was placed in the same chamber and presented with six CS blocks pseudo-randomly spaced 60–120 s apart, each followed by a 1 s foot shock US (0.6 mA, AC) delivered by a stimulator (ENV-414S, Med Associates Inc). During a fear memory recall session on day 3, the mouse was placed in a conditioning chamber within a different context, consisting of a curved wall and a smooth acrylic floor, cleaned with perfumed general-purpose soap, and four CS blocks were applied.</p><p>For optogenetic silencing experiments with Arch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), light was delivered during 3 s starting 1 s before the footshock via 200 μm core / 0.22 NA optic fiber patch cords (Doric Lenses, Canada) from a 561 nm solid state laser (MGL-FN-561-AOM, 100 mW, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology, Changchun, China). The laser was equipped with an AOM and an additional mechanical shutter (SHB05T; Thorlabs). For optogenetic activation experiments with Chronos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), 1 ms light pulses were delivered at 25 Hz, 2 s duration from a 473 nm solid-state laser (MBL-FN-473–150 mW, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology). The intensity of each laser was adjusted before the experiment to deliver 10 mW light power at the fiber tip.</p><p>The behavior of animals was recorded at video rate (30 Hz) by the VideoFreeze software (Med Associates Inc). Based on the behavioral videos, a movement trace was generated using ezTrack software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pennington et al., 2019</xref>; see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>, red trace). The experimenter, and the person analyzing the data were blinded to the assignment of each mouse to the control - or test group. The movement index trace from ezTrack was used to compute a binary freezing trace using custom procedures in IgorPro 7 (WaveMetrics Inc, Lake Oswego, OR, USA). The animal was considered to be immobile (freezing state) if the movement index was below a threshold of 40 arbitrary units (without cable attachment) or 120 a.u. (with cable attachment), for a minimum duration of 0.5 s. The binned trace of percent time spent freezing (10 s bin size; see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>) was calculated as a time-average of the freezing state from the binary trace, and then averaged across mice in each group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Microendoscopic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging data acquisition and analysis</title><p>We used the nVista 3.0 system (Inscopix Inc) for imaging the activity of neurons expressing GCaMP6m in the vTS over the three-day fear conditioning paradigm. Fluorescent images were acquired at 30 Hz sequentially from three focal planes, resulting in an effective sampling rate of 10 Hz per plane. The intensity of the excitation LED in the nVista3.0 miniature microscope was set to 1–1.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, and the gain was adjusted to achieve pixel values within the dynamic range of the camera. The TTL pulses delivered from the behavioral setup (Med Associates) were digitized by the nVista 3.0 system to obtain synchronization between the mouse behavior and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging data.</p><p>The initial processing of in-vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging data was done using the Inscopix Data Processing Software (IDPS; Inscopix Inc). This included: (1) deinterleaving of the videos into the frames taken at individual focal planes; (2) spatial filtering; (3) motion correction; (4) export of the processed videos as TIFF image stacks; (5) export of the timestamps for each acquired frame, and for the experimental events such as CS and US timing. Next, the TIFF stacks were processed (except a movement correction step that was done by IDPS) using a Python-based package CaImAn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giovannucci et al., 2019</xref>). The package is specifically optimized for the analysis of wide-field microendoscopic fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging data using CNMF-E, an adaptation of constrained nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Detection of ROIs for each focal plane was performed by CaImAn in an unsupervised manner, using the same set of analysis parameters across the three experimental days. This resulted in a set of background-corrected fluorescence traces for each automatically detected neuron, and also included a deconvolution step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>). The deconvolution returned the times, and amplitude values of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T</xref>, gray vertical bars). The amplitudes of the deconvolved events were cumulated for each imaged neuron and each time epoch, to derive the amplitude-weighted frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in one of four defined time epochs (during freezing, and in the absence of a CS [Frz_noCS]; during movement, and in the absence of a CS [Mov_noCS]; during freezing, and in the presence of a 30 s CS block [Frz_CS]; and during movement, and in the presence of a 30 s CS block [Mov_CS], e.g. see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Following the CaImAn analysis, the data were analyzed using custom routines in IgorPro 7 (WaveMetrics) as follows.

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed with an extracellular solution containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 glucose, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, 3 Myo-Inositol, 2 Na-pyruvate, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4, saturated with carbogen gas. The set-up was equipped with an EPC10/2 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany), and an upright microscope (BX51WI; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a 60 x / 0.9 NA water-immersion objective (LUMPlanFl, Olympus).</p><p>Patch-clamp experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) were performed using a Cs<sup>+</sup>-based intracellular solution (in mM): 140 Cs<sup>+</sup>-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 8 TEA-Cl, 5 Na-phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 5 EGTA, pH 7.2 adjusted with CsOH. AMPA/NMDA-ratio experiments were done in the presence of 5 µM GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist gabazine (SR-95531; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Experiments to test the archaerhodopsin (Arch) properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) were performed using a K<sup>+</sup>-based solution with (in mM): 8 KCl, 145 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 3 Na-phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 5 EGTA, pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH. All electrophysiological experiments were conducted at near-physiological temperature (34 °C) using an inlet heater SHM-6, a heated recording chamber RC-26GL/PM-1 and a thermostatic control unit TC-344B (all from Warner Instruments, Holliston, MA, USA). All chemicals, unless indicated, were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).</p><p>For activation of the excitatory and inhibitory opsins in slice experiments, and for visualization of fluorophores in brain slices, high-power LEDs (CREE XP-E2, 460 nm and 530 nm; Cree Inc, Durham, NC, USA) were custom-coupled into the epifluorescence port of the microscope. Illumination was controlled by the EPC 10/2 amplifier DAC board connected to the LED driver (BLS-1000–2, Mightex Systems, Toronto, Canada). Irradiance was measured by a photodiode (DET36A/M, Thorlabs) coupled into the illumination light path, whose readings were calibrated by the light power measured under the 60 x objective using a power-meter model 1918-R equipped with a 818-UV detector (NewPort, Irvine, CA, USA). Electrophysiological recordings were analyzed in IgorPro (WaveMetrics) using the NeuroMatic plug-in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rothman and Silver, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology</title><p>For anatomical analysis of optic fiber- or GRIN lens positions, mice were transcardially perfused with a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution. The brains were post-fixed in PFA overnight and then transferred to 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered solution for dehydration. Coronal brain sections of 40 µm thickness were prepared using a HM450 sliding microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Slices were mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and embedded in Fluoroshield mounting medium containing DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) to stain cell nuclei. Slices were imaged with a slide scanning fluorescent microscope VS120-L100 (Olympus) with a 10 x /0.4 NA objective, or with a confocal microscope (Leica SP8). Brain atlas overlays are taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franklin and Paxinos, 2016</xref> and were fit to the brain section image using scaling and rotations in Adobe Illustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA).

Before choosing the main statistical test, the distribution of the data was tested for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test. When normality was confirmed, we used a paired or unpaired version of the two-tailed Student’s t-tests for two-sample datasets, as indicated. For the comparison of relative datasets, we used a one-sample two-tailed t-test. When the data was not normally distributed, we used two-tailed non-parametric tests: a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test for paired comparisons, or Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired comparisons of two-sample datasets, as indicated.</p><p>For datasets with more than two samples (in-vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), the data showed skewed distributions which did not pass the normality test, therefore we used a non-parametric version of a one-way ANOVA, a Kruskal-Wallis test. If this test detected significant differences, it was followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test for multiple comparisons (called Dunn’s MC test). For datasets influenced by two factors such as the optogenetic silencing/control group and the time of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), we used a repeated-measures two-way ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) separately for the training and fear retrieval days. If RM-ANOVA reported significance, it was followed by Šidák’s post-hoc tests for the respective factor.</p><p>The change in number of neurons responding in-vivo to different events across training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L, S</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I, P</xref>) was statistically assessed using a Chi-square test. For the optogenetic silencing experiments, we determined the sample size a priori using a G*Power software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faul et al., 2007</xref>) for an RM-ANOVA test (two groups, 4 replicate measurements for the fear retrieval day) assuming an average change in freezing of 20% (from 60 to 40%) and a standard deviation of 15% (resulting in an effect size of 0.667), significance level <italic>α</italic>=0.05, power 1-β=0.85, and the correlation between repeated measures of 0.5. The resulting total sample size was N=16 (N=8 mice per group), with a critical F<sub>crit</sub> = 4.6. There was no sample size estimation made for other experiments.</p><p>Each specific statistical test is mentioned in the Results text, and the input data along with statistical test summary (such as p-values, values of test statistics, degrees of freedom, etc.) and the main descriptive statistics are given in the statistics Tables for each relevant figure.

Romanski and Ledoux (1993) showed strong TeA-Astr connectivity, and Ledoux et al. (1990) as well as Barsy et al., (2020) highlighted a strong thalamo-Astr projection from the area of PIL and SG. Furthermore, the latter study also investigated the CS, US and CS/US responsiveness of Astr neurons which were found to be (at least, partially) mediated by the thalamic inputs.</p><p>The LA-Astr projection seems to be also underestimated in the view of the earlier publications (eg. Jolkkonen et al., 2001).</p><p>One of the reasons causing these connectivity differences could arise from the targeting of Astr. Identification of Astr territory is not trivial, since no marker is available which could differentiate AStr from the rest of the caudal (tail) striatum. Still, as earlier studies showed that these two striatal regions may receive distinct inputs (eg. MGN to the tail, while PIN/PIL to the Astr; LA mostly targets Astr and not the other parts of the caudal striatum), it is important to investigate the same and consistent striatal region. Paxinos mouse brain atlas indicates AStr from bregma ~-0.9 (AP) between LA and LGP (and more caudal, the stria terminalis) and right above the CeA. The dorsal border is uncertain, but mostly indicated ventral to the top 'corner' of the LA (like in a recent review by Valjent and Gangarossa, 2020). However, many representative images and schematic drawing highlight more dorsal and anterior regions to be targeted which resemble the ventral part of the striatal tail, rather than Astr. While most of the foot shock and CS responsive cells were located in the posterior part of the examined regions (more posterior from bregma -1; Figure 1-3), some injection sites (AAV, RV) and fiber optic locations were more anterior. Indeed, the authors also use the tail of the striatum term. As no comprehensive functional study is present (to my best knowledge) which simultaneously investigate the tail of the striatum and Astr, it could cause many discrepancies if the two regions are mixed.</p><p>Thus, some of the discrepancies could have arisen from targeting the tail of the striatum rather than Astr.</p><p>Several recent (Barsy et al., 2020, Gilad et al., 2020; Talyor et al., 2021) and earlier studies (Bordi and Ledoux et al., 1994a,b; Apergis-Schoute et al., 2005; Han et al., 2008; Weinberger, 2011, etc) suggested that CS-US association and thus, neuronal plasticity can occur prior to the amygdala, in non-sensory (higher-order) thalamic regions, like PIN/PIL. Therefore, the following statement is only partially correct. &quot;In the lateral (LA)- and basal amygdala (LA and BA respectively), auditory (CS) and somatosensory (US) information are integrated..&quot;</p><p>Was there any level of dorsoventral topography found in the location of the Cs and/or US responsive cells (striatal tail vs. Astr)?</p><p>Is it possible that the examined and responded D1 and Adora+ cells are actually located in two distinct striatal regions? It is discussed that these are rather topographically non-overlapping populations.</p><p>Is it possible to follow the Ca-activity of individual cells throughout the entire learning paradigm? If yes, plasticity of a single cell could be analysed (like in the thalamus, Taylor et al., 2021).</p><p>As Figure 7 showed some level of topography in the InsCx-Astr connectivity, were different sectors of InsCx targeted in the D1 and Adore-Cre animals used for patch clamp recordings in Figure 8?</p><p>Pg 17. Between the AAV and RV, three weeks is indicated in the text, but 4 weeks in the figure.</p><p>Figure 8, Figure suppl. 4 B and C. It seems that distinct parts of striatum are targeted.</p><p>As there is very little data about Astr, it would be interesting to examine the basic anatomical organization of Astr. For example, the proportion of D1+ and Adora+ cells, the presence of other types of neurons (cholinergic, PV cells, etc). But, these may be far beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is disappointing that the presentation and some of the analyses do not do justice to the work. Please see my points below. In particular, the heavy handed analyses of the fluorescence transients is too much and fraught with potential for error. More importantly, it obscures what appear to be large differences that could be extracted more easily (and convincingly). Please see the &quot;approach section below&quot;. Lastly, at times the authors interpret their data and results too optimistically.</p><p>Specifically, the authors should:</p><p>1. Reanalyze the data using only z-score F(t).</p><p>2. Show more primary data – images of cells, etc…</p><p>3. Refrain from reaching conclusions too early in the results especially that it is the contribution of plasticity of the neurons that is being studied in the silencing experiments (as opposed to the need for activity).</p><p>4. Improve the presentation of the methods</p><p>Please read the detailed comments below.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>1. Imprecise wording. The notion of &quot;balancing&quot; is unclear in &quot;defensive behaviors need to be finely balance&quot; which makes it hard to understand exactly what is being studied.</p><p>2. &quot;In-vivo optogenetic silencing during the training day showed that plasticity in D1R+ AStria neurons contributes to auditory-cued fear memories&quot;</p><p>Please see my comments on the interpretation of the silencing experiments.</p><p>Results:</p><p>1. Show some images of neurons with corresponding fluorescence transients to understand the quality of the data. I can't find them anywhere in the figures.</p><p>2. Line 111 – &quot;Seemed to increase&quot;. What does this mean?</p><p>3. Line 114 – Claim to have derived APs by deconvolution.</p><p>4. Line 127 – &quot;Similarly suggested an increased&quot;.</p><p>5. See comments on methods – by the time we get to summary data as I Figures IJ-L it is very hard to understand what these mean. They are in au units x 10e-4. What does this mean? If they are au then they can be remapped.</p><p>6. Line 154 &quot;These experiments thus show that D1R+ AStria neurons increase their AP firing activity during the onset of movements after a period of immobility. &quot;</p><p>The analysis in this section is potentially problematic as tones are being played and the animal is starting and stopping movement. It is not clear that the response is to the movement change as opposed to the tone. Please show the histogram of tone start and stop times relative to the movement onsets.</p><p>A better analysis is one that models the contributions tones, movement starts, stops, and US. This can be done with a GLM and will alone one to disambiguate these confounds.</p><p>I am especially worried because of the follow-up sentence &quot;Line 155 were more pronounced during the CS than in the absence of a tone&quot; which suggests that these are not movement cells.</p><p>7. Line 159 – The conclusion in this sentence cannot be justified based on the data shown so far.</p><p>8. Line 168 – One cannot make these conclusions by comparison of event-triggered averaging.</p><p>9. Overall Figure 1 is very hard to follow. The number of panels should be reduced, labels should be placed to show which analyses are relative to movement, CS, etc…</p><p>10. Figure 2 is very nice.</p><p>11. The paragraph starting on line 252 is confusing. Are the authors saying that the # of cells responding goes up (i.e. response fidelity) but that the response per active cell (estimated AP content) does not? Both the positive and negative conclusion refer to Figure 3R. I can't find a definition of response fidelity, which is used several times.</p><p>12. The analysis of Figure 3S says that significance was judged by a KS-test, which is usually used for comparisons of unbinned cdfs. The graph is an average +/- error bar. How was the KS test used?</p><p>13. If the freezing habituation data in 1S and 3S cannot be analyzed statistically, it should be removed from the panels as one cannot help but interpret the data shown quantitatively.</p><p>14. The Venn diagrams in 3V and 2D would benefit by labeling the numbers in the main intersection areas.</p><p>15. In figure 4, the baseline movement of the Adora2a and D1R groups is very different. Are the two genotypes equivalent? These are BACs so it would not be too surprising.</p><p>16. For Figure 4, what in vivo proof is there that the cells are being activated? Given the negative conclusion, such a control is important.</p><p>17. The experiments motivated by the paragraph starting at Line 325 are very nice. However, the paragraph is troubling. The manipulation is to reduce activity and it should be phrased in that way. Instead, a hypothesis based on plasticity is presented, from which the experimental manipulation of activity is indirectly motivated.</p><p>18. There are differences in baseline freezing (5F) before the light is turned on that are of similar magnitude (relative to the low level of freezing) as seen in 5H. Similarly, the comparison between no effect in 5G right to less effect in 5I left may not be fair given that the latter is in &quot;steady state&quot; and the former not. Is an RM-ANOVA the right way to go?</p><p>19. Similar concerns exist for the data in Figure 6.</p><p>Can the differences in Figure 5 or 6 be used to identify individual mice as ones that received silencing and ones that did not? It seems unlikely, especially for Figure H. It might have been better to run cohorts of mice in which the silencing was only applied in the retrieval portion. Otherwise, it is unclear if the relatively modest effects are due to a difference during training that is not reflected in freezing rates.</p><p>20. The main text does not reference controls for the rabies experiments which generally should include (1) TVA dependence of rabies infection, (2) G dependence of spread, (3) Cre-dependence of the DIO/floxed constructs. It is important to do these with the same batch of viruses used for the experiments (ideally in parallel!).</p><p>21. I hesitate to make too much of the differences shown in 7I/J given N=2, especially without a careful analysis of all the starter cells to show that the number and distribution of these were the same across genotypes.</p><p>22. The currents in Figures 8G-H are huge and loss of voltage clamp must have occurred, especially when measuring NMDA receptor currents.</p><p>Approach:</p><p>1. Large lesions even for optogenetics because of use of 1.25 mm cannula.</p><p>2. Line 763 -- &quot;If mice from any experimental group showed low freezing, they were excluded from the analysis; we used a threshold of 20% time spent freezing</p><p>during the fifth and sixth CS-blocks on day 2 (7 out of 59 mice for the behavioral experiments were excluded).&quot;</p><p>It is good of the authors to give the exclusion criteria. However, this is worrisome. Some of the loss of function experiments are based on the hypothesis that activity is necessary for learning. Therefore, this discards the poor learners, right?</p><p>What is the breakdown of exclusion across the different experimental and genetic conditions? Why not simply include all animals to capture the natural variability?</p><p>3. The deconvolution approach is worrisome for a few reasons.</p><p>a. Ca entry into these neurons is highly non-linear with single AP, burst AP, up-state APs, and GPRC-mediated influx. It is unclear that one can use a linear model of # of APs to [Ca] (to F(Gcamp6m)). It does not seem that this step is necessary (especially given the heavy filtering).</p><p>b. Data is acquired at 10Hz but then a band-pass filter at 2-4 Hz (If I read it correctly although the methods are not very clear). This is much less than the Nyquist limit. Why? Also why place a low-frequency limit (i.e. why use a band pass as opposed to a low-pass to simply get rid of shot and electronic noise?).</p><p>c. The deconvolution kernel is arbitrary and uses a rise time that cannot be captured with the 2-4 Hz band pass. The authors need to show that 0.5 s tau(decay) is justified. There is no justification for choosing an amplitude of 2.</p><p>d. Line 793 – The phrase &quot;deconvolution yielded a… proportional to AP firing rate&quot; must be removed as it cannot be justified.</p><p>e. The deconvolved signal (R) is further filtered with a box car – Why? The filtering is done upstream on the fluorescence. It should not be done again.</p><p>f. &quot;local peaks&quot; exceeding a threshold (arbitrarily set to 2) were detected using a &quot;first-derivative&quot; method. Why add a threshold here? It seems unjustified. Second, how does one detect a peak with a first-derivative? Shouldn't it be a second derivative? Or are they detecting fast-rate of rise, in which case why set a peak amplitude threshold?</p><p>4. All of these concerns are acknowledged later (line 801) in &quot;we did not aim to infer exact AP spiking rates of cells&quot;. Then why do this and present it in this way?</p><p>5. They should simply get rid of all these steps and analyze the z-score raw F (calculating a DF/F and then z-scoring is no different than just z-scored the Z).</p><p>6. y comparing the</p><p>7. The section starting on line 809 indicates that different baselines were chosen for comparison for different types of cells. This introduces a circular bias. One needs to be able to statistically show that a cell is a &quot;move-on&quot; or CS responder without changing a baseline. Why not use the Z-score values in the time-bin without picking a base-line – i.e. compare activity in that window to all activity?</p><p>8. Line 798 – The amplitudes of the events from deconvolution (referred to as estimated AP content, EAC [a.u./s]) were proportional to the amplitude of the ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients (e.g. see Figure 1 —figure supplement 1E).</p><p>a. I can't find the referenced data in a figure. The sentence suggests a scatter plot with some kind of regression analysis?</p><p>b. If this is true, why do it all? Just use the F as suggested above and save all these potentially problematic analysis steps.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The study used only male mice. There is no basis for excluding females.</p><p>2. The authors did not verify specificity of D1R and Adora lines (tdTomato + RNAscope for D1R and Adora). Without this verification, it is unclear if the fluorescent patterns reported actually reflect patterns of D1R and Adora neurons.</p><p>3. Inspection of the heat plots shown in figures 1 and 3 indicate the fluorescent data contains repeating 'neurons'. For example in Figure 3, the two signals in rows 10 and 11 are identical. This is particularly notable because the repeating 'neuron' shows the largest change in fluorescence. In addition, rows ~17 and ~34 appear virtually identical as well. This is a major problem and indicates the authors have an issue in their analysis pipeline. Greater care needs to be taken to ensure repeating neuron's are not reported and analyzed.</p><p>Same issue occurs in Figure 1. Rows 3 and 4 are identical signals. Repeating 'neurons' appears to be a problem throughout.</p><p>4. GCaMP6m is a fluorescent calcium indicator. While calcium entry into neurons is required for AP-driven vesicular release, calcium entry into a neuron can reflect many other processes. In this manuscript, the authors wish to examine single unit activity by acquiring and deconvolving fluorescent signals. In fact, there are known issues relating fluorescent signals to action potentials in the striatum:</p><p>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.20.427525v2.full</p><p>If the authors wish to analyze spiking activity of the striatal neurons, they need to use techniques that directly record action potentials. These techniques are readily available. If the authors wish to record fluorescent changes resulting from calcium influx, they need to embrace this decision and only analyze changes in fluorescence data.</p><p>5. I found it very difficult to track the logical flow of the analyses. The authors start off by showing 'neurons' are responsive to cues. But then almost immediately pivot to showing they do not in fact respond to cues, but movement during cues. A lot of figure space and analysis is devoted to this, such that the big picture is lost. I would find it more convincing to develop analyses that directly compare cue vs. movement vs. cue x movement responding from the outset. A regression approach may be useful. Take the 30 s prior to cue and 30 s cue. Have one regressor be cue on vs cue off, another be movement on vs movement off and the last be the intersection of cue on/off and movement on/off. This would simultaneously compare each regressor to each 'neurons' activity pattern, determining which best captures change in fluorescence.</p><p>6. Do not show hypothetical behavior data (as in Figure 1A). Only show real behavior data.</p><p>In its present form, I do not feel that the authors achieved their aims or that the results support their conclusions. Addressing the points above is more likely to produce such results. Although even then, it appears that the contribution of these two cell types to tone-shock learning appears limited. If these neurons are contributing to aversive behavior, perhaps their contribution would be better captured by procedures in which movement is a more central element to behavior.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A striatal circuit balances learned fear in the presence and absence of sensory cues&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

(&quot;One of the reasons causing these connectivity differences could arise from the targeting of Astr. …&quot;). Because of the additional concern whether the Cre mouse lines used here are well-suited to drive Cre-expression in the AStria / vTS (&quot;Essential revision point #7, below, and reviewer 3, point 2), we performed further anatomical experiments. For this, we crossed both D1R<sup>Cre</sup> and Adora<sup>Cre</sup> mice with a tdTomato reporter mouse (Ai9), and made coronal sections across the entire extent of the striatum and posteriorly including the amygdala complex (see new data in Figure 1D; Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 for D1R<sup>Cre</sup>, and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 for Adora<sup>Cre</sup>). These images show, together with a re-analysis of our fiber positions, that we have targeted neurons in the broader area of the ventral tail striatum (vTS), but not in the more narrowly defined, and more ventrally located &quot;AStria&quot;, as suspected by reviewer 1.

For the vTS and including the AStria, a recent study has documented in detail the distribution of D1R+ and D2R+ neurons (Gangarossa et al., 2019; cited in our paper). We have added new anatomical data which shows the spatial distribution of Cre-expressing neurons in the D1R<sup>Cre</sup> mice (Figure 1D; Figure 1 —figure supplement 1), and in the Adora<sup>Cre</sup> mice (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1) in the vTS and AStria. This data is in line with the previous findings of Gangarossa et al. 2019 regarding the spatial distribution of D1R+ and D2R+ (in our case, Adora+) MSNs in the vTS and AStria. The data furthermore shows that there are very few neurons in adjacent cortical- and amygdala areas that would give rise to Cre-dependent expression in the Cre mouse lines. On the other hand, this data has revealed that Cre – expression in the D1R+ mice does not fully reach the ventrally located AStria (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C). This finding supports our decision to now name the targeted brain area ventral tail striatum (vTS) and no longer &quot;AStria&quot; (see above, point 2). Please also note that the new data in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 show that D1R+ – and Adora+ neurons project to the entopeduncular nucleus / GPi and to the GPe, respectively, hallmarks of the connectivity of direct- and indirect pathway neurons in the Striatum. Taken together, with these additional experiments, we are confident that the Cre mouse lines used here allow selective access to D1R+ and Adora+ neurons of the direct and indirect pathway in the vTS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please ensure your manuscript complies with the eLife policies for statistical reporting: https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full &quot;Report exact p-values wherever possible alongside the summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals.

Romanski and Ledoux (1993) showed strong TeA-Astr connectivity, and Ledoux et al. (1990) as well as Barsy et al., (2020) highlighted a strong thalamo-Astr projection from the area of PIL and SG. Furthermore, the latter study also investigated the CS, US and CS/US responsiveness of Astr neurons which were found to be (at least, partially) mediated by the thalamic inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer refers to previous studies which showed evidence largely from anterograde labeling studies, for auditory-related inputs to the AStria / vTS, e.g. from the temporal association areas (Romanski and LeDoux 1993) and from higher-order auditory thalamic nuclei (LeDoux et al. 1990 and Barsy et al. 2020). We, on the other hand, have investigated the presynaptic inputs to the vTS in a different approach, using rabies-mediated backlabelling techniques specific for D1R+ – and Adora+ neurons in the vTS. We find many brain areas presynaptic to either D1R+ or to Adora+ vTS neurons (Figure 7G and 7H, respectively). Of note, the temporal association area (&quot;TeA&quot;), and the auditory cortex (&quot;AUD&quot;) were also revealed in our dataset (Figure 7G, H).</p><p>Furthermore, we have looked again at the data, and found that back-labelling was indeed also present both in the PiL and in the PoT, two thalamic structures located close to the auditory thalamus, and which have been shown to process auditory- and multimodal sensory information (see references in the Results). We have now removed this data from the previous &quot;Others&quot; categories, and have added them separately under &quot;PoT&quot; and &quot;PiL&quot; in Figure 7G, H (see also corresponding changes in the Results text; p. 15 bottom, p. 16 top).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The LA-Astr projection seems to be also underestimated in the view of the earlier publications (eg. Jolkkonen et al., 2001).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response above for the general reasoning of whether data from the rabies approach is directly comparable with previous studies largely based on anterograde labelling.</p><p>More specifically, neurons in the BLA are present in high density in our analysis (see Figure 7G, H; black bars), especially for Adora+ neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the reasons causing these connectivity differences could arise from the targeting of Astr. Identification of Astr territory is not trivial, since no marker is available which could differentiate AStr from the rest of the caudal (tail) striatum. Still, as earlier studies showed that these two striatal regions may receive distinct inputs (eg. MGN to the tail, while PIN/PIL to the Astr; LA mostly targets Astr and not the other parts of the caudal striatum), it is important to investigate the same and consistent striatal region. Paxinos mouse brain atlas indicates AStr from bregma ~-0.9 (AP) between LA and LGP (and more caudal, the stria terminalis) and right above the CeA. The dorsal border is uncertain, but mostly indicated ventral to the top 'corner' of the LA (like in a recent review by Valjent and Gangarossa, 2020). However, many representative images and schematic drawing highlight more dorsal and anterior regions to be targeted which resemble the ventral part of the striatal tail, rather than Astr. While most of the foot shock and CS responsive cells were located in the posterior part of the examined regions (more posterior from bregma -1; Figure 1-3), some injection sites (AAV, RV) and fiber optic locations were more anterior. Indeed, the authors also use the tail of the striatum term. As no comprehensive functional study is present (to my best knowledge) which simultaneously investigate the tail of the striatum and Astr, it could cause many discrepancies if the two regions are mixed.</p><p>Thus, some of the discrepancies could have arisen from targeting the tail of the striatum rather than Astr.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, who points out the difficulty in demarcating the AStria / ventral tail striatum (vTS). Because of the additional concern whether the Cre mouse lines used here are well-suited to drive Cre-expression in the AStria / vTS (&quot;Essential revision point #7, above, and reviewer 3, point 2), we performed further anatomical experiments. For this, we crossed both D1R<sup>Cre</sup> and Adora<sup>Cre</sup> mice with a tdTomato reporter mouse (Ai9), and made coronal sections across the entire extent of the striatum and posteriorly including the amygdala complex (see new data in Figure 1D; Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 for D1R<sup>Cre</sup>, and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 for Adora<sup>Cre</sup>). These images show, together with a reanalysis of our fiber positions, that we have targeted neurons in the broader area of the ventral tail striatum (vTS), but not in the more narrowly defined, and more ventrally located &quot;AStria&quot;, as suspected by the reviewer. Therefore, in the revised version, we do not refer any more to the &quot;AStria&quot;, but rather, name the brain area studied here the more broadly defined &quot;ventral tail striatum&quot; (vTS).</p><p>We hope that the additional anatomical data, and the re-naming of the brain area targeted in our study (vTS), have solved this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several recent (Barsy et al., 2020, Gilad et al., 2020; Talyor et al., 2021) and earlier studies (Bordi and Ledoux et al., 1994a,b; Apergis-Schoute et al., 2005; Han et al., 2008; Weinberger, 2011, etc) suggested that CS-US association and thus, neuronal plasticity can occur prior to the amygdala, in non-sensory (higher-order) thalamic regions, like PIN/PIL. Therefore, the following statement is only partially correct. &quot;In the lateral (LA)- and basal amygdala (LA and BA respectively), auditory (CS) and somatosensory (US) information are integrated..&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. This part of the Introduction has been re-written, to make the statements about the LA and BA more general (see p. 3, bottom).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was there any level of dorsoventral topography found in the location of the Cs and/or US responsive cells (striatal tail vs. Astr)?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this question, we now show the reconstruction of imaged neurons also in coronal planes (see Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 for <italic>in-vivo</italic> ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of D1R+ neurons, and Figure 3 —figure supplement 3, bottom, for Adora+). For the US- and CS-responses in D1R+ neurons (but not for the movement-ON responses), it appears that neurons located more ventrally have smaller responses. Nevertheless, such a topography would have to be investigated in more detail, and with a larger sample size. Please note that the neurons which are localized more ventrally in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1, are actually <italic>also</italic> located more anteriorly (see the &quot;horizontal&quot; view in Figure 2A), thus precluding a simply analysis merely in the dorso-ventral plane. Furthermore, please note that the apparent localization of these cells in the &quot;BLA&quot; as suggested in the coronal view (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1), is actually an artefact of the projection (compare with the &quot;horizontal&quot; view in Figure 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible that the examined and responded D1 and Adora+ cells are actually located in two distinct striatal regions?

The analysis is now based on a CNMF-E based approach to detect ROIs (in &quot;Caiman&quot;; see Methods and response to reviewers 2 and 3), and with this approach it should in principle be possible to register cells over various days. Unfortunately, the number of cells that can be registered successfully across days is quite low.

First, we analyze the movement – ON responses for the &quot;no – CS&quot; periods, when no tones were given (Figure 1 M-O for D1R+ neurons, and Figure 3J-L for Adora+). This analysis unambiguously shows the presence of movement – ON responses. Second, we have then aligned the z-scored Ca traces to the onset of movements <italic>during the CS</italic>. As requested by the reviewer, we have now computed the histograms of the times of CS occurrence relative to the movement – ON transition (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3 for D1R+). This indeed shows, as the reviewer suspected, that part of the movement – ON responses were preceded by tones.</p><p>In order to correct for these responses, which might have been caused by tones rather than by movement – ON transitions, we removed all Ca – traces that were preceded by 0 – 400 ms by a tone, leading to the removal of about half of all traces (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 3, numbers given at the bottom). The corrected traces are shown in red in Figure 1 —figure supplement 3. The corrected traces still show a substantial increase of Ca in D1R+ neurons during movement – ON transitions <italic>during the CS</italic> (Figure 1—figure supplement 3, red traces). For the analysis of the number of neurons responding to movement – ON transitions during the CS (Figure 1S, filled data points), we used the corresponding tone-event-corrected traces.</p><p>In summary, responses to movement – ON transitions are clearly present in D1R+ neurons, and in Adora+ neurons (see the analogous analysis for Adora+ neurons in Figure 3M-O, and Figure 3P). Our new analysis furthermore shows that the number of neurons that respond to movement – ON transitions is larger in the presence of a CS than in its absence (Figure 1S, and Figure 3P). However, because of the caveat that part of the movement – ON responses are possibly caused by preceding tones, we have removed the statements which described a positive interaction between &quot;CS&quot; and movement – ON responses (see Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

The paragraph starting on line 252 is confusing. Are the authors saying that the # of cells responding goes up (i.e. response fidelity) but that the response per active cell (estimated AP content) does not?

As detailed in Materials and methods, the Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric version of a one-way ANOVA. This test was used to test the &quot;general&quot; significance of changes according to time (three days) and class of events (four combinations of movement / freezing and CS / no-CS), before using post-hoc comparison (Dunn's test).

In figure 4, the baseline movement of the Adora2a and D1R groups is very different. Are the two genotypes equivalent? These are BACs so it would not be too surprising.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the absolute movement indices, which are analyzed by the &quot;ezTrack&quot; software from the videos of the mice (see Methods, p. 31, middle), should not be compared directly. For example, the movement of the Adora<sup>Cre</sup> mice, in the newly added data (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1), shows much higher apparent levels of movement index. Indeed, the exact values depend on the calibration of the system, the camera used, and possibly on the size of mice. Thus, we refrain from deriving conclusions regarding possible differences between absolute movement indices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. For Figure 4, what in vivo proof is there that the cells are being activated? Given the negative conclusion, such a control is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted optrode recordings to show that optogenetic stimulation of D1R+ neurons by blue light pulses <italic>in-vivo</italic> can drive AP-firing. Unfortunately, we were unable to record light-evoked activity with sufficiently high throughput, due to direct light -evoked artefacts in the recordings, and/or misplacements of the optrode (N = 4 mice, data not shown).</p><p>We therefore turned to a simpler approach, at least for Adora+ mice. In fact, in the original data set, we had used very brief light pulses (1 ms; 10 mW at the fiber tip), motivated by the fact that the kinetics of Chronos is fast (Klapoetke et al., 2014). We therefore validated in additional experiments, with N = 5 available Adora+ mice, whether optogenetic stimulation of Adora+ neurons in the vTS with longer light pulses (2 ms, and 5 ms; 10 mW), would produce comparable results to the ones in Figure 4. Indeed, these new experiments similarly did not show an effect on the movement of the mice (see new Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). The new experiments further corroborate our findings that optogenetic stimulation of Adora+ and D1R+ neurons in the vTS do not have a direct effect on the movement of mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. The experiments motivated by the paragraph starting at Line 325 are very nice. However, the paragraph is troubling. The manipulation is to reduce activity and it should be phrased in that way. Instead, a hypothesis based on plasticity is presented, from which the experimental manipulation of activity is indirectly motivated.</p></disp-quote><p>The paragraph has been re-written, using the notion of &quot;footshock-driven activity&quot; instead of &quot;aversively – motivated plasticity&quot; of D1R+ neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. There are differences in baseline freezing (5F) before the light is turned on that are of similar magnitude (relative to the low level of freezing) as seen in 5H. Similarly, the comparison between no effect in 5G right to less effect in 5I left may not be fair given that the latter is in &quot;steady state&quot; and the former not. Is an RM-ANOVA the right way to go?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your detailed observation of the data in Figure 5F. In Figure 5F (now Figure 5D in the revised version), and Figure 5H (5F in the revised version – note that below we only used the &quot;new&quot; Figure numbers), we show averaged freezing percentages across all mice in each group, at a time resolution of 10 s. The reviewer refers to &quot;<italic>differences in baseline freezing (5F) before the light is turned on</italic>&quot;. In these experiments, 30s trains of tones (each 0.1 s, given at 1 Hz) are given (blue – shaded area), and then a final footshock is given immediately <italic>after</italic> each CS (Figure 5F, yellow vertical lines). The yellow light, to activate Arch, is given 1s before each footshock, for a duration of 3s. Thus, one would have to look at the last 1-2 freezing values before each yellow vertical line, to check for &quot;differences in baselines freezing before the light is turned on&quot;. This would be at times when the CS is on (blue – shaded areas). Indeed, in the time-binned analysis, the freezing levels differ between the two groups especially during CS 4 and CS 5, but not in a consistent manner – once the eGFP (control) mice show higher freezing (CS5), and once the Arch mice show higher freezing (CS 4)(Figure 5E, left).</p><p>It should be noted that currently, there seems to be no consensus in the fear learning field whether the CS applied on the training day (during pairing with the US), already has acquired the properties of a CS for the animals. Thus, it is possible that freezing during the CS, on the training day, can be seen as a &quot;prolongation&quot; of an ongoing contextual freezing, that buildups over longer times during the training session (Figure 5D, green and black traces).</p><p>In the previous, and revised version we have analyzed the freezing in 30s time bins <italic>preceding</italic> each CS (lower grey bars in Figure 5E; 5F, <italic>right</italic>), and the freezing during each CS (Figure 5E, <italic>left</italic>). This data shows that both within the control- and the Arch mice, freezing is similar during the CS, and during the no-CS times (Figure 5F, compare data between <italic>left</italic> and <italic>right</italic> panel), which supports the view that during the training day, mice freeze in an increasing manner in response to the general context, but not specifically in response to the tones.</p><p>In summary, we think small fluctuations in freezing levels between the groups on the training day, and within CS4 and CS5 in this case, are not of biological relevance.</p><p>Please also note that, because we re-included N = 2 eGFP mice, and N = 3 Arch mice that had been previously excluded because they froze less than 20% at the end of the training day (see reviewer 2, point 26), the exact form of the traces and positions of datapoints in this Figure has slightly changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. Similar concerns exist for the data in Figure 6.</p><p>Can the differences in Figure 5 or 6 be used to identify individual mice as ones that received silencing and ones that did not? It seems unlikely, especially for Figure H. It might have been better to run cohorts of mice in which the silencing was only applied in the retrieval portion. Otherwise, it is unclear if the relatively modest effects are due to a difference during training that is not reflected in freezing rates.</p></disp-quote><p>For a general answer regarding to the &quot;similar concerns&quot; in Figure 6, please see our answer above for Figure 5.</p><p>The experimental approach here was to suppress footshock-driven activity in either D1R+ or Adora+ neurons of the vTS, and then observe whether this manipulation would impair fear learning. This experiment has revealed opposite effects when applied to neurons in the direct</p><p>(D1R+) and indirect pathways (Adora+)(a contribution to auditory-cued fear memory for D1R+ neurons), as opposed to an increased contextual fear memory component for the Adora+ mice (but see also comment below on the changed statistical significance in the Adora+ dataset). The reviewer proposes that &quot;it might have been better&quot; to silence the activity of the neurons during the recall day. We feel, however, that the experiment as run by us makes sense, and has produced interesting results, whereas silencing during the recall day will require further considerations as to when best to silence (since the effects of D1R+ and Adora+ neurons are produced at different times: CS versus no-CS times). Thus, we think that silencing the activity of D1R+ and Adora+ neurons during the tones / context phases of the memory recall day is beyond the scope of the present paper.</p><p>Regarding the point that it is &quot;unclear if the relatively modest effects are due to a difference during training that is not reflected in freezing rates&quot;: The rationale of these experiments was to suppress footshock – driven activity in a specific neuronal subsystem, and by this to most likely reduce plasticity in this sub-system (we express this view in the motivation paragraph to the silencing experiments; see p. 11, middle – bottom). We find it encouraging that this manipulation, which presumably impaired plasticity in the vTS, leads to selective changes in memory recall one day later, which indicates that the vTS contributes to the formation of an auditory-cued fear memory. We don't think it is problematic that the manipulations on the training day did <italic>not</italic> impair the increasing wave of &quot;contextual&quot; or &quot;anticipatory&quot; freezing observed on that same day, because other brain areas might drive the contextual, or anticipatory freezing observed on the training day.</p><p>Changed statistical significance in the Adora+ data set:</p><p>As requested by this reviewer below (point <italic>[26]</italic>), we have now re-introduced the previously excluded mice (which were excluded based on the criterium that they showed less than 20% freezing at the end of the training session, spanning the times of the fifth and sixth CS-US pairing). While the statistical significance in the D1R+ dataset was maintained (see Results), the statistical significance in the Adora+ dataset was lost, while there was still a trend in the data showing an increase in the freezing at no – CS times on the fear memory recall day (p = 0.0512; two-way repeated measures ANOVA; previously, p = 0.041). Therefore, we have now toned down our conclusions regarding the Adora+ mouse, and merely speak about a &quot;trend&quot; in the data towards an increased freezing during no – CS times after suppressing footshock-evoked activity in Adora+ vTS neurons (see e.g. changed text in p. 14, l. 327).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20.

Also, at the MNTB – LSO inhibitory connection, we more recently reported optogenetically-evoked IPSCs of up to 20 nA (Gjoni et al., 2018 J. Physiology). This requires to minimize the series resistance (Rs).

The deconvolution approach is worrisome for a few reasons.</p><p>a. Ca entry into these neurons is highly non-linear with single AP, burst AP, up-state APs, and GPRC-mediated influx.

The authors did not verify specificity of D1R and Adora lines (tdTomato + RNAscope for D1R and Adora). Without this verification, it is unclear if the fluorescent patterns reported actually reflect patterns of D1R and Adora neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used a D1R<sup>Cre</sup> mouse line (EY217 line from the GenSAT initiative), and an Adora<sup>Cre</sup> mouse line (KG139 line from the GenSAT initiative), which both have been used widely by previous studies in the striatum. These mouse lines have been well characterized in the GENSAT project (see expression profiles of these two lines on the GENSAT website; http://www.gensat.org/cre.jsp). We see no obvious reason that any of the two lines should express outside of its previously documented expression domain.</p><p>In response to this question, and to Reviewer 1 point <italic>[3]</italic>, we have performed additional anatomical control experiments. We have crossed the D1R<sup>Cre</sup> and the Adora<sup>Cre</sup> mouse line with a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line (Ai14), and we have then analyzed the location of tdTomato-positive cells throughout the striatum and the amygdalar complex (N = 3 mice each). Representative images on three different a-p levels, after aligning with the Paxinos mouse brain atlas, are shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1.</p><p>For the D1R<sup>Cre</sup> x tdT mice, it can be seen that tdTomato-positive cells are present widely within the striatum (&quot;CPu / CP in Paxinos), and that tdTomato-positive axons project to the entopeduncular nucleus / GPi (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B, C), a hallmark for neurons of the direct pathway. Interestingly, as was also noted in the original paper describing these lines (Gerfen et al., 2013), tdTomato expression was sparse in the cortex and in the claustrum; moreover, we did <italic>not</italic> observe tdTomato expression in the intercalated cell masses that surround the BLA. This feature of the D1R<sup>Cre</sup> (EY217) line is advantageous for our purpose, because it ensures that we did not inadvertently image, or silence D1R-expressing neurons in adjacent structures to the vTS (like deep layers of cortex, claustrum, intercalated cell masses surrounding the BLA). Indeed, in another D1R<sup>Cre</sup> line from GENSAT, expression that matches more accurately &quot;the full pattern of endogenous expression of the Drd1a gene&quot; was observed (line FK150; citation from Gerfen et al. 2013). In that line, expression is also seen in cortex, claustrum, and the intercalated cell masses (see images on the GENSAT website; http://www.gensat.org/cre.jsp). One possible dis-advantage resulting from the choice of the D1R<sup>Cre</sup> (EY217) line is that expression more posteriorly and ventrally becomes weak in this mouse (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C). In this respect, it also seems more cautious that we now refer to the neurons targeted in our study as ventral tail striatum (vTS), but no longer as &quot;AStria&quot; (see also Reviewer 1, point <italic>[3]</italic>).</p><p>For the Adora<sup>Cre</sup> x tdT mice, it is again seen that tdTomato-positive neurons are contained throughout the striatum as expected, and axonal projections target the GPe (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1A, B, C), a hallmark of the indirect pathway. TdTomato-positive neurons are found in the CPu/CP extending partially into the AStria. Only few Cre- positive cells are found in structures adjacent to the CP/CPu and AStria. These data show that this mouse is well-suited to target neurons of the indirect pathway (D2R+ or as here, Adora+) in the vTS.</p><p>Taken together, the present and previous characterization of the two Cre mouse lines used here is quite extensive, and we do not expect that the proposed control experiment (RNAscope for D1R, Adora, and tdTomato in each mouse line) would reveal significant weaknesses of the used lines. Moreover, our slice electrophysiology data shows that input EPSCs from the pInsCx/S2 received by D1R+ and Adora+ neurons are of different amplitudes, different E/I ratios, and show different AMPA/NMDA ratios after fear learning (Figures 8, 9). This again confirms that we are dealing with two separate neuronal populations. All this evidence suggests that the DR1<sup>Cre</sup> and Adora<sup>Cre</sup> mouse lines used here are valid tools to target neurons of the striatal direct- and indirect pathways.</p><p>In response to this criticism, we now show images of the D1R<sup>Cre</sup> x tdT and Adora<sup>Cre</sup> x tdT mice in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 and Figure 3 —figure supplement 1, to introduce the expression pattern of each Cre mouse line in the vTS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Inspection of the heat plots shown in figures 1 and 3 indicate the fluorescent data contains repeating 'neurons'. For example in Figure 3, the two signals in rows 10 and 11 are identical. This is particularly notable because the repeating 'neuron' shows the largest change in fluorescence. In addition, rows ~17 and ~34 appear virtually identical as well. This is a major problem and indicates the authors have an issue in their analysis pipeline.

With the re-analysis of all imaging data in Figure 1-4, this problem should be solved. For the previous analysis, we had hand-drawn ROIs around active cells.

For the new analysis, we used a CNMF – E based approach in the &quot;Caiman&quot; software to identify active cells, and this software makes a co-variance test between cells and then excludes &quot;repeating neurons&quot;, so the problem should not persist in the new data set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. GCaMP6m is a fluorescent calcium indicator. While calcium entry into neurons is required for AP-driven vesicular release, calcium entry into a neuron can reflect many other processes.

Neuroscience). In it, the authors show that measuring global Ca averaged over potentially many 100s of neurons in fiber photometry, correlates only marginally with the AP-firing activity of striatal neurons. The authors then additionally use miniature microscope Ca imaging with similar methods as used here (their Figure 3), to differentiate between the soma- and non-somatic Ca signals. Thus, it is clear that miniature microscopy has a big advantage (=cellular resolution) over fiber photometry.</p><p>This said, we have followed the advice of this reviewer and reviewer 2 and have completely re-analyzed the Ca – imaging data. We now have used CNMFE-based methods for ROI (cell body) detection as implemented in Caiman, and we have expressed most results in terms of zscored Ca traces (see new panels of Figure 1G-Q, and Figure 3E-O). We still use deconvolution of Ca-traces for the final analysis of &quot;conditional Ca-event frequency&quot; (see Figures 1T, 3R), because for this analysis it was necessary to count events. We now use a deconvolution analysis in the Caiman package, based on previously described methods and shared analysis programs (Pnevmatikakis et al. 2016 <italic>Neuron</italic>; Giovannucci et al. 2019 <italic>eLife</italic>).</p><p>Taken together, we hope that the new analysis of fluorescence (Ca) data in Figures 1 – 3 has improved the logical flow of the presentation of the Results. We have also dropped all statements in the text in which we had suggested that Ca-deconvolution can derive &quot;APfiring&quot;.</p><p>Please also see our answer to &quot;Essential revision points 3, and 4&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I found it very difficult to track the logical flow of the analyses. The authors start off by showing 'neurons' are responsive to cues. But then almost immediately pivot to showing they do not in fact respond to cues, but movement during cues. A lot of figure space and analysis is devoted to this, such that the big picture is lost. I would find it more convincing to develop analyses that directly compare cue vs. movement vs. cue x movement responding from the outset. A regression approach may be useful. Take the 30 s prior to cue and 30 s cue. Have one regressor be cue on vs cue off, another be movement on vs movement off and the last be the intersection of cue on/off and movement on/off. This would simultaneously compare each regressor to each 'neurons' activity pattern, determining which best captures change in fluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We admit that the previous version of Figure 1 was dense, and the data as presented following the deconvolution analysis was difficult to grasp. We have attempted to improve these issues of data presentation by the new analysis of the data (largely based on Z-scored fluorescence traces, see above), and by using improved organization and labels in Figures 1, and 3.</p><p>Nevertheless, the fundamental properties of the data remain the same as before; i.e. there are both responses to sensory cues (US, and CS – driven responses), as well as responses to behavioral state variables, like movement – ON transitions of the animals. We have tried to improve the logical flow, by now clearly showing movement – ON responses in the absence of tone (CS) stimulation <italic>first</italic> (Figure 1M-O; Figure 3J-L). Nevertheless, within the CS blocks (tone stimuli every s), the issue persists that movement – ON transitions can occur superimposed with tones. Indeed, a re-analysis of the occurrence of the CS (tone) events relative to movement – ON transitions shows that in a significant number of movement – ON transitions during the CS (~ 50% for D1R<sup>Cre</sup> mice; see Figure 1 —figure supplement 2), the movement – ON transitions were, in fact, preceded by 0 – 400 ms by a tone (see also our answer to reviewer 2, point [8]). This phenomenon was more pronounced in the D1R<sup>Cre</sup> mice, and likely indicates that tones can sometimes induce the onset of movements, with a delay of ~ 200 – 400 ms. We feel that in this situation, a generalized linear model (GLM) would be of limited usefulness, because tone- and movement – driven events can sometimes occur with essentially similar delays, and in a similar periodicity (the periodicity is imposed by the periodic tones during the CS block). Thus, we applied a timing – based analysis, in which we removed the Ca responses for those events in which the movement – ON transition happened to be preceded, by 0 – 400 ms, by a tone. The resulting &quot;corrected&quot; average Ca transients showed a similar overall trend as the non-corrected traces (Figure 1O-Q, compare red and black traces; similar for Figure 3 M-O for Adora<sup>Cre</sup> mice).</p><p>Therefore, we feel that have fully addressed the possible concern of the overlay of movement – ON responses, and tone responses. Because of the possible triggering of a part of the movement – ON responses by tones (see above), we now removed all statements which had claimed a non-linear interaction between movement – ON and tone responses (see Results, and Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Indeed, the display of the ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequency data in Figure 3 —figure supplement 3 allows the conclusion that the main condition which changes the ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequency is &quot;movement&quot; as compared to &quot;freezing&quot; (compare &quot;red&quot; data points with &quot;blue&quot; data points over all three days – all these comparisons are statistically significant as indicated by the &quot;star&quot; symbols above the comparisons).</p><p>Thus, we feel that our conclusion statement is justified.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have added a side sentence after the above conclusion sentence; the entire sentence now reads (l. 199 – 202):</p><p>&quot;These experiments show that a substantial sub-population of Adora+ neurons in the vTS codes for movement onset, but this representation was unchanged by fear learning (Figure 3M – P), except for a decrease in the number of neurons showing a movement – ON response in the absence of a CS (Figure 3P, open symbols).&quot;</p><p>The newly added sentence refers to our observation that the number of Adora+ neurons with a movement – ON responses outside the CS decreases with fear learning (data in Figure 3P, open symbols; p = 0.0229; Chi-square test, as reported on l. 196).</p></body></sub-article></article>
