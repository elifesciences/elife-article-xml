Most chemokine receptors contain features associated with the ability to stimulate G protein signaling during β-arrestin-mediated receptor internalization into endosomes. As endosomal signaling of certain non-GPCR receptors plays a major role in cell migration, we chose to investigate the potential role of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling on mechanisms governing this function. Applying a combination of pharmacological and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate that the model chemokine receptor CCR7 recruits G protein and β-arrestin simultaneously upon chemokine stimulation, which enables internalized receptors to activate G protein from endosomes. Furthermore, spatiotemporal-resolved APEX2 proteome profiling shows that endosomal CCR7 uniquely enriches specific Rho GTPase regulators as compared to plasma membrane CCR7, which is directly associated with enhanced activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 and chemotaxis of immune T cells. As Rac1 drives the formation of membrane protrusions during chemotaxis, our findings suggest an important integrated function of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling in cell migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chemokine receptor</kwd><kwd>CCR7</kwd><kwd>endosomal signaling</kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>spatiotemporal-resolved

From these locations a gradient of chemokines is generated that attracts immune cells by activating their cell surface chemokine receptors, triggering cell migration and differentiation to combat the pathophysiological state. The chemokine system is also taken advantage of by certain cancer cells including melanoma, glioblastoma, prostate, gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, ovarian, lung, colorectal, and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sarvaiya et al., 2013</xref>). In malignant cells, upregulation of chemokine receptors allows them to invade and metastasize to locations distinct from their origin and from where specific chemokines are secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sarvaiya et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>There exist 23 chemokine receptors that belong to the highly druggable superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Canonically, GPCRs activate heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) at the cell surface, causing downstream signaling throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilman, 1987</xref>). This initial phase of G protein signaling is terminated via a specialized desensitization mechanism that includes phosphorylation of receptors by GPCR kinases and subsequent recruitment of β-arrestins (βarrs) to the phosphorylated receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2007</xref>). βarrs engage receptors at an overlapping transmembrane core region to where G proteins bind, and thus βarr recruitment to the receptor sterically blocks further G protein activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lohse et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, βarrs promote the internalization of GPCRs into endosomes, thereby removing them from the source of the activating ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodman et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In more recent times work has shown that some GPCRs continue to activate G proteins following βarr-mediated internalization into endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thomsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irannejad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calebiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wehbi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferrandon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mullershausen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores-Espinoza and Thomsen, 2024</xref>). As G protein and βarr association to GPCRs have historically been considered mutually exclusive events, endosomal G protein signaling is difficult to reconcile within the general understanding of GPCR signaling. However, our recent work showed that certain GPCRs containing serine/threonine phosphorylation site clusters in their carboxy-terminal tail bind to βarrs in a specific conformation termed ‘tail conformation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cahill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumari et al., 2017</xref>). In this conformation, βarr only interacts with the receptor carboxy-terminal tail thereby permitting the receptor transmembrane core to bind to G proteins simultaneously to form a GPCR–G protein–βarr complex or ‘megaplex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cahill et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). The formation of these megaplexes highlights how certain receptors that form strong associations with βarrs can continue to stimulate G protein signaling over prolonged periods of time after they have been internalized into endosomes by βarrs. Despite having established a mechanistic understanding underlying endosomal G protein signaling by internalized GPCRs, knowledge about its functional role remains minimal.</p><p>Most chemokine receptors couple to similar G protein subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hughes and Nibbs, 2018</xref>) and contain serine/threonine clusters in their carboxy-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which raises the possibility that the formation of megaplexes and endosomal G protein signaling are general mechanisms applied by these receptors to influence physiological responses such as cell migration. Interestingly, endosomal signaling by other non-GPCR receptor systems such as receptor tyrosine kinases have a profound role in cell migration and control transport of various signaling complexes and other proteins between the cell surface and endosomal compartments during this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palamidessi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schiefermeier et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, our work here tests the hypothesis that chemokine receptors can stimulate G proteins from endosomes to regulate common signaling networks or ‘signalosomes’ that direct cell migration.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the C-terminal tail region of common chemokine receptors.</title><p>Potential

unaffected by βarr recruitment and βarr-mediated receptor endocytosis</title><p>To study the potential role of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling we used the model receptor CCR7, which is expressed by several subsets of immune cells and regulates their homing to the lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Förster et al., 2008</xref>). This receptor is an ideal model receptor to study endosomal G protein signaling as it is known to be active at endomembranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laufer et al., 2019</xref>) and is stimulated by two endogenous chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 equally effective at 100 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kohout et al., 2004</xref>). Compared with the full agonist CCL19 that robustly stimulates G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling, receptor phosphorylation, βarr recruitment, and CCR7 internalization, the agonist CCL21 promotes full G<sub>i/o</sub> protein activation but only partial receptor phosphorylation, βarr recruitment, and internalization of CCR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kohout et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zidar et al., 2009</xref>). Using the enhanced bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (EbBRET)-based biosensors RlucII-βarr1/2 and cell surface-anchored rGFP-CAAX to monitor βarr1/2 recruitment to plasma membrane upon chemokine-stimulation in CCR7-expressing HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Namkung et al., 2016</xref>), we confirmed that activating CCR7 by CCL19 leads to robust βarr1/2-recruitment, whereas CCL21 only promotes partial βarr1/2-recruitment responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Co-expressing RlucII-βarr1/2 and the endosomally-located rGFP-Rab5 in HEK293-CCR7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Namkung et al., 2016</xref>), CCL19 stimulation leads to similar strong βarr1/2 trafficking to endosomes whereas CCL21 stimulation of CCR7 only causes a minor translocation of βarr1/2 to the endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). No enhanced EbBRET between RlucII-βarr1/2 and rGFP-CAAX/Rab5 was detected upon chemokine stimulation in HEK293 cells that do not express CCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). These results suggest that CCR7 recruits and is internalized by βarrs robustly when stimulated with CCL19, but only to a modest degree by CCL21. Similar results were found when using β-galactosidase enzyme complementation-based DiscoverX assay to monitor direct βarr2 recruitment to CCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CCR7-stimulated β-arrestin (βarr) recruitment, receptor internalization, and G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental design used to monitor enhanced bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (EbBRET) between RlucII-βarr1/2 and rGFP-CAAX or RlucII-βarr1/2 and rGFP-Rab5 upon chemokine stimulation of CCR7.

In resting state, the CCR7-SmBiT and LgBiT-CAAX are in subcellular proximity at the plasma membrane and form functional nanoluciferase enzymes, which catalyzes the conversion of coelenterazine h resulting in the emission of a bright luminescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Upon activation and internalization of CCR7, the CCR7-SmBiT is removed from the cell surface-located LgBiT-CAAX which results in a decrease in the luminescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Strong and immediate reduction in this signal was observed when the cells were stimulated with CCL19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). In contrast, CCL21-stimulated CCR7 only led to a modest decrease in signal suggesting that CCL19-stimulation leads to robust CCR7 internalization whereas most CCR7 stays at the plasma membrane upon CCL21 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). In addition to this approach, we also measured the chemokine-stimulated trafficking of CCR7-SmBiT to the early endosomal FYVE-LgBiT marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In this case, CCL19 stimulation led to a robust increase in luminescence whereas CCL21 activation only led to a partial increase in the signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). Interestingly, the kinetic patterns of the signals indicate that the trafficking of CCR7 to endosomes was slower and more transient as compared to its removal from the cell surface, which could be a result of further trafficking of the receptor to late or recycling endosomes as well as the trans-Golgi network (TGN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). Moreover, CCL19/CCL21-stimulation did not promote internalization or trafficking to endosomes of the vasopressin type 2 receptor (V<sub>2</sub>R)-SmBiT construct validating that these chemokines act specifically via the CCR7-SmBiT system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to investigate how βarrs recruitment and receptor internalization affect G protein signaling in real-time, we applied the cAMP sensor CAMYEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>) to monitor G<sub>i/o</sub> activity in HEK293-CCR7 cells. In contrast to βarrs recruitment and receptor internalization, CCL19 and CCL21 challenge inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP production to a similar extent in HEK293-CCR7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>), but had no effect on the cAMP response in mock-transfected HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>). This supports previous observations, which suggest that both CCL19 and CCL21 act as full agonists in stimulating G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kohout et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zidar et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, this G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling was sustained throughout the experiment and not acutely desensitized by βarrs recruitment and/or receptor internalization as other receptor systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Violin et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CCR7 engages with βarr1 and G<sub>i/o</sub> protein simultaneously upon chemokine stimulation</title><p>Surprisingly, neither the degree of βarr recruitment nor receptor internalization appears to affect CCR7-mediated G protein signaling as expected for most GPCRs. As we recently found a correlation between the presence of phosphorylation site clusters in GPCRs and their ability to form GPCR–G protein–βarr megaplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>), here we hypothesized that CCL19-CCR7 stimulates G<sub>i/o</sub> while being internalized into endosomes by βarrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As numerous G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled GPCRs recently were demonstrated to co-couple with G protein and βarrs, this hypothesis seems plausible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, since the CCL21 challenge only leads to minor CCR7 internalization, most of the CCL21-CCR7-mediated G<sub>i/o</sub> activation takes place at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Chemokine-induced CCR7–G<sub>i/o</sub>–β-arrestin (βarr) complex formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the working hypothesis. CCR7-mediated G protein signaling does not appear to be affected by βarr recruitment or receptor internalization. Therefore, we hypothesized that CCR7 associates and internalizes with βarr in the ‘tail’ conformation where βarr does not block the G protein-binding site within CCR7. As this site is available, CCR7 can interact simultaneously with G protein and βarr to form a CCR7–G<sub>i/o</sub>–βarr megaplex, which enables the receptor to stimulate G proteins while being internalized into endosomes.

We have previously demonstrated that other GPCRs with carboxy-terminal phosphorylation site clusters bind to βarrs in this tail conformation, and thus, it seemed likely that CCR7 could form them as well. To test this, we used a βarr1 mutant where the region of βarr1 that interacts with GPCR transmembrane cores, the fingerloop (FL), is deleted (βarr1-ΔFL). We showed previously using negative stain electron microscopy and single-particle averaging that βarr1-ΔFL almost entirely forms tail conformation complexes with GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cahill et al., 2017</xref>). Using the EbBRET pair RlucII-βarr1-ΔFL and rGFP-CAAX (plasma membrane-anchored rGFP) in CCR7-expressing HEK293 cells, we probed the degree of βarr1-ΔFL recruitment to CCR7 in response to CCL19, CCL21, or vehicle. In addition, we tested how well βarr1-ΔFL internalizes with CCR7 into endosomes using the EbBRET pair RlucII-βarr1-ΔFL and rGFP-Rab5 (early endosome-anchored rGFP). Interestingly, both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation led to the recruitment of βarr1-ΔFL to CCR7 at the membrane although CCL19 promoted this recruitment to a significantly higher degree than CCL21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation promotes βarr1-ΔFL translocation to endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). No response to chemokine stimulation was observed in mock-transfected HEK293 cells that do not express CCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results indicate that CCR7 can form tail conformation complexes with βarr1 in cells and that the stability of this complex is sufficiently strong for βarr1 to internalize the receptor into endosomes.</p><p>Since CCR7 forms tail conformation complexes with βarr1 upon agonist stimulation where the G protein binding site is available, we next sought to interrogate whether the receptor binds to βarrs and G<sub>i/o</sub> simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To do this, we used a NanoBiT approach where SmBiT is fused to βarr1 and LgBiT is fused to the Gα subunit. If CCR7 recruits G protein and βarr1 simultaneously, the SmBiT-βarr1 and LgBiT-G will come into close proximity resulting in a luminescence signal. Instead of using the full-length Gα subunit for this approach as done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>), we used a truncated surrogate version commonly referred to as miniGi. MiniG proteins are engineered Gα subunits that have been developed for the major Gα subunit families (G<sub>s</sub>, G<sub>i/o</sub>, G<sub>q/11</sub>, and G<sub>12/13</sub>). Key modifications of these Gα subunits include: (1) a truncated N-terminal that deletes membrane anchors and Gβγ-binding surface; (2) deletion of the α-helical domain; (3) mutations that improve protein stability in vitro; and (4) a mutation in the C-terminal α5 helix that uncouples GPCR binding from nucleotide release, therefore, stabilizing receptor–miniG protein complexes in the presence of guanine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nehmé et al., 2017</xref>). These alterations also enable miniG proteins to report active receptor conformations in living cells by measuring their recruitment from the cytosol to GPCRs at different membrane compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2018</xref>). As most membranes involved in GPCR trafficking contain endogenous G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jang et al., 2024</xref>), the presence of active miniG-coupling receptors at these subcellular compartments suggests that G proteins are stimulated from these sites.</p><p>The properties of miniG proteins are also beneficial when monitoring the simultaneous recruitment of SmBiT-βarr1 and LgBiT-miniG to GPCRs. Since both probes are expressed in the cytosol where they randomly collide, simultaneous translocation to the receptor in cell membranes will lead to a very specific increase in luminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, using a wild-type full-length Gα subunit and βarr NanoBiT probes, which are located at membranes and cytosol, respectively, recruitment of βarrs to the receptor could lead to potential bystander effects as a result of βarrs-translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane.</p><p>In HEK293-CCR7 cells expressing SmBiT-βarr1 and LgBiT-miniGi, CCL19-stimulation leads to a robust increase in luminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). This signal was specific for miniGi as stimulation of CCR7 in cells expressing SmBiT-βarr1 and LgBiT-miniGs led to a small decrease in luminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). This reduction in basal luminescence might be caused by a reduction of random collision between SmBiT-βarr1 and LgBiT-miniGs upon CCR7 stimulation where SmBiT-βarr1, but not LgBiT-miniGs, translocates to the plasma membrane. These results indicate that CCL19-stimulated CCR7 recruits G<sub>i/o</sub> and βarrs simultaneously. Next, we compared the ability of CCL19 and CCL21 to provoke co-coupling of G<sub>i/o</sub> and βarrs to CCR7. Interestingly, both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulated co-coupling of G<sub>i/o</sub> and βarrs to CCR7, although CCL19 promoted the formation of these complexes to a significantly larger degree than CCL21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). The response to chemokine stimulation was not observed in mock-transfected HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>GPCR–G protein–βarr megaplexes have been described as a mechanism by which GPCRs that bind βarrs exceptionally well via the phosphorylated C-terminal tail can promote endosomal G protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether G<sub>i/o</sub> and βarrs are recruited simultaneously to internalized CCR7 in endosomes using confocal microscopy. For this purpose, CCR7-expressing HEK293 cells co-expressing βarr2-Strawberry and Halo-miniGi were stimulated with either CCL19 or CCL21 for 30 min whereafter the subcellular location of these two probes was assessed by confocal microscopy. In this setup, CCL19-CCR7 recruited βarr2-Strawberry and Halo-miniGi to endosomal-shaped intracellular locations whereas this co-localization was minor for CCL21-CCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that CCL19 stimulation leads to robust endosomal and CCR7-mediated recruitment of G<sub>i/o</sub> and βarr1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Stimulation of CCR7 by CCL19 leads to robust activation of G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling from endosomes</title><p>To test whether the internalized CCR7 stimulates G<sub>i/o</sub> from endosomal compartments, we used the NanoBiT biosensor pair Rap1GAP-SmBiT and LgBiT-FYVE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Rap1GAP is an effector protein that specifically binds to active G<sub>i/o</sub>, but not to inactive G<sub>i/o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avet et al., 2022</xref>), and thus, endosomal G<sub>i/o</sub> activation can be detected by measuring the recruitment of Rap1GAP-SmBiT to the endosomal marker LgBiT-FYVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Latorre et al., 2022</xref>).

Using this approach, CCL19 stimulation led to a strong and significant increase in EbBRET signaling between RlucII-miniGi and rGFP-Rab5a indicating that CCL19-bound CCR7 indeed activates G<sub>i/o</sub> robustly from endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Thus, to examine the impact of compartmentalized CCR7 signaling on downstream effectors, we performed unbiased mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteome profiling using APEX2. APEX2 is an engineered ascorbate peroxidase enzyme that we fused to the CCR7 carboxy-terminal and uses H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an oxidant to catalyze a one-electron oxidation of various small molecule substrates including biotin-tyramide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Oxidation of biotin-tyramide leads to the generation of a highly reactive and short-lived (&lt;1 ms) biotin-phenoxyl radical that conjugates to endogenous proteins that are in close proximity to the APEX2 enzyme (~20 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tan et al., 2020</xref>).

For the last 1 min of chemokine-stimulation hydrogen peroxide is added, which initiates the APEX2-mediated oxidation of biotin-tyramide into highly reactive and short-lived radicals.

Most of these proteins were more enriched by CCL19 stimulation as compared to the CCL21 challenge. In addition, we observed enrichment of endosomal proteins such as STX7, STX12, SNX3, and VTI1B for both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, proteins involved in lysosomal trafficking including LAMP1, VPS16, VAMP7, WDR91, and PP4P1 were enriched by CCL19 and to a lesser degree by CCL21 after 25 min of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Proteins involved in receptor trafficking via recycling endosomes or the trans-Golgi network such as SNX6, RAB7L, and GGA3 were also enriched at the later stages of CCR7 activation particularly when stimulated with CCL21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition to these, proteins associated with the Golgi network (SNX3, COG5, YIF1A, SC22B, and AP3S1) were enriched by either CCL19 or CCL21 suggesting general CCR7 trafficking to this subcellular compartment as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laufer et al., 2019</xref>). These results indicate that the trafficking pattern of CCR7 upon chemokine stimulation is tightly regulated between lysosomal degradation and recycling.</p><p>Among enriched signaling proteins, we observed robust enrichment of proteins regulating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate signaling (ERLN1/2, IP3KA), diacylglycerol signaling (DGKQ), calcium mobilization at the endoplasmic reticulum (TMCO1), and activity of the Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and E–G</xref>). These are all involved in signaling events downstream of heterotrimeric G protein activation. Another interesting signaling protein enriched by CCR7 activation includes a member of the eyes absent (EYA) subfamily of protein, EYA2. This protein has been shown to interact with and regulate Gα<sub>i/o</sub> and Gα<sub>z</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Embry et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan et al., 2000</xref>), and EYA4, a member of the same family, was recently identified in a similar APEX2-based study of the μ-opioid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polacco et al., 2024</xref>). We also detected three novel interaction partners GRIP2, MARK4, and EI24 as being among the highest levels regardless of the activation ligand or time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Endosomal G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling is important for Rac1 activation and chemotaxis</title><p>Rho GTPases such as RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42 regulate important aspects of chemotactic cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schiefermeier et al., 2011</xref>). Activity of these effectors are regulated by other proteins such as Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and Rho GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Our APEX2-based proteomics results demonstrate that a number of these Rho GTPase regulators are enriched by chemokine-stimulation of CCR7, and thus, potentially form part of larger CCR7 signalosomes that control downstream Rho GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>). Interestingly, some of these regulators, including RHG26, ARG28, RHG29, ACK1, and BORG5, were differentially enriched upon CCL19 or CCL21 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that CCR7 signaling modulates the activity of cell migratory Rho GTPases specifically at distinct cellular locations. To test this hypothesis, we focused on RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Upon activation of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, protein kinase N1 (PKN1), p21 activated kinase 1 (PAK1), and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein 1 (WAS1), are respectively recruited. We assessed the proximity of these biosensor pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>) in real-time upon chemokine stimulation by the NanoBiT approach in HEK293-CCR7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Using this setup, we found that both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulated RhoA and Cdc42 activation to a similar extent, which indicates that the spatial aspect of G protein activation does not appear to influence RhoA and Cdc42 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C , and F–G</xref>). In contrast, CCL19 promoted Rac1 signaling to a significantly greater extent than CCL21 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). No change in RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 activity upon CCL19/CCL21 challenge was detected HEK293 cells that do not express CCR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). However, CXCL12 stimulation led to enhanced activity of RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 in HEK293 cells, which express CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Pre-incubating the HEK293-CCR7 cells with the G<sub>i/o</sub> inhibitor PTX, virtually eliminated the chemokine-induced activation of Rac1, indicating that CCR7-stimulateted Rac1 signaling is mediated via a G<sub>i/o</sub>-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–I</xref>). Interestingly, pre-treatment of the HEK293-CCR7 cells with the endocytosis inhibitor Dyngo-4a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>) reduced chemokine-stimulated CCR7 internalization and Rac1 activation robustly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J-K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G-H</xref>). This reduction was significantly smaller as compared to cells pre-incubated with an inactive Dyngo compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J-K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G-H</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of the hemagglutinin-tagged dominant negative dynamin 1 K44A mutant (HA-Dyn-K44A) diminished chemokine-activated CCR7 internalization and Rac1 activity suggesting that CCR7-mediated Rac1 activation depends on receptor internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L-M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I-K</xref>). Also, pre-incubating the cells with the endocytosis inhibitor PitStop2, which acts on clathrin rather than dynamin, led to a severe reduction in chemokine-stimulated CCR7 internalization and Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N-O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1L-M</xref>). Finally, we mutated all potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in the carboxy-terminal tail of CCR7 and found that this CCR7-ΔST construct expresses well at the cell surface, but does not internalize upon CCL19 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1N-P</xref>). When expressed in HEK293 cells, the ability of CCR7-ΔST to activate Rac1 in response to chemokine-stimulation is severely reduced as compared to wild-type CCR7.

As in HEK293-CCR7 cells, CCL19, and CCL21 stimulation led to similar inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in Jurkat T cells confirming that CCR7 activation by either chemokine results in comparable stimulation of G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Interestingly, Jurkat T cells migrated more efficiently towards a gradient of CCL19 as compared with CCL21, which was assessed by the transwell chemotaxis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

This G protein signaling has been characterized as short-lived due to a specialized desensitization mechanism that includes receptor phosphorylation by GPCR kinases and subsequent recruitment of βarrs to the phosphorylated receptor. The GPCR–βarr interaction both uncouples G protein from the receptor and promotes receptor endocytosis, which are hallmarks of receptor desensitization.</p><p>This paradigm, however, has been challenged by multiple observations, which show GPCRs that continue to activate G proteins from internalized compartments, such as from endosomes. Paradoxically, GPCRs that promote endosomal G protein signaling most substantially include receptors such as the V<sub>2</sub>R, parathyroid hormone receptor 1, protease-activated receptor type 2, and neurokinin 1 receptor that all associate strongly with βarrs via phosphorylation site clusters located at their carboxy-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wehbi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feinstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jimenez-Vargas et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that GPCRs with these carboxy-terminal clusters associate with βarrs exclusively through this region to form tail conformation GPCR–βarr complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cahill et al., 2017</xref>). Since βarrs do not block the G protein-binding site in this tail conformation, the receptor can associate with βarrs and G proteins simultaneously to form GPCR–G protein–βarr megaplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). The assembly of these megaplexes allows the receptor to continue to stimulate G protein signaling while being internalized into endosomes by βarrs.</p><p>The chemokine receptor CCR7 contains serine/threonine phosphorylation site clusters on its carboxy-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which have been shown to be fully phosphorylated upon CCL19 stimulation, but not CCL21 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kohout et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zidar et al., 2009</xref>). In the present study, we also found a correlation between this reported CCR7 phosphorylation pattern, formation of tail conformation CCR7–βarr1 complexes, simultaneous recruitment of G protein and βarr to CCR7, robust endosomal G protein signaling, Rac1 signaling, and cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D-E, H-Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A-F</xref>). As most chemokine receptors also contain serine/threonine clusters in their carboxy-terminal tails similar to CCR7, it not only raises the possibility that these receptors can promote endosomal G protein signaling, but also that this mode of signaling regulates important aspects of the physiological functions associated with these receptors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In fact, removing the carboxy-terminal tail or mutating its phosphorylation sites in the chemokine receptors CXCR1-4 reduces their ability to internalize and promote cellular chemotaxis towards a chemokine-gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roland et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richardson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colvin et al., 2004</xref>). Similar reduction in Akt signaling and chemotaxis of immune cells towards gradients of different chemokines were observed upon pharmacological inhibition of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacques et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">English et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, removal of intracellular loops in CXCR4 reduces G protein activation and is associated with decreased capacity of CXCR4 to promote cell migration indicating a co-dependency of G protein signaling and receptor internalization on this cell physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roland et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, the chemokine receptor CCR1 displays constitutive G protein activation and internalization in HEK293 cells by a mechanism where Gα<sub>i/o</sub> and βarr complex with the receptor simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilliland et al., 2013</xref>). This constitutive CCR1-mediated G protein activation from internalized compartment was reported to stimulate cell migration. Finally, sustained G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling by internalized sphingosine-1-phophate type 1 receptor has been shown to promote cell migration in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mullershausen et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, previous observations together with our results are supportive of certain aspects of cell migration being regulated by internalized chemokine receptor signaling.</p><p>To obtain a greater understanding of the impact of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling on cell physiological responses, we applied an unbiased MS-based proteome profiling approach using CCR7-APEX2 expressing HEK293 cells. We found that CCR7 activation leads to enrichment of multiple proteins of key functions including vesicle trafficking, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal dynamics/cell migratory, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The proteins GRIP2 and EI24 were among the most enriched following CCR7 activation. GRIP2 and EI24 have not previously been reported as having roles in GPCR biology. GRIP2 has been shown to bind AMPA ionotropic glutamate receptors via PDZ-domains to regulate their intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dong et al., 1999</xref>). Whether GRIP2 plays similar role in the trafficking of chemokine receptors remains to be tested. EI24 is a protein whose expression is enhanced by p53 activation, and plays a role in growth suppression and apoptosis as well as in autophagy through formation of degradative autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tian et al., 2010</xref>). As with GRIP2, the potential role of EI24 in chemokine receptor biology is unknown. Another highly enriched protein was cytosolic EYA2, which interacts with members of the <italic>Sine oculis</italic> (Six) family of homeodomain transcription factors. This interaction facilitates the translocation of EYA proteins into the nucleus, where the EYA/Six complex regulates transcription of a number of genes involved in development and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tadjuidje and Hegde, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, EYA2 can interact directly with Gα<sub>i/o</sub> and Gαz subunits and regulate their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Embry et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan et al., 2000</xref>). This interaction prevents their translocation to the nucleus, and thus, block their role as transcription co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Embry et al., 2004</xref>). Coincidently, EYA4 was recently identified in a similar APEX2-based study of the μ-opioid receptor, and thus, might be more involved in downstream signaling responses of G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled receptors such as chemokine receptors than currently appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polacco et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Another protein that was robustly enriched upon CCR7-APEX2 activation was the Rho GTPase GAP RHG26. Notably, this enrichment was exclusively observed when HEK293-CCR7-APEX2 cells were stimulated by CCL19, but much less by CCL21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and F</xref>). Other regulators of Rho GTPases were also enriched by CCR7 activation and some of them were differentially enriched by either CCL19 or CCL21 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results raise the possibility that CCR7 assembles compartment-specific signalosomes that could play an important role in downstream Rho GTPase activity. In fact, we discovered that the Rho GTPase Rac1 was specifically activated by G protein signaling by internalized CCR7 whereas the Rho GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 were stimulated equally by plasma membrane and endosomal CCR7 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Rac1 plays a key role in cell migration, which we further demonstrated in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), and can be activated in endosomes by RhoGEFs such as Tiam1 and Vav1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palamidessi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laufer et al., 2019</xref>). Previously, a chemokine-stimulated association between CCR7 and Vav1 at endomembranes was reported, which depends on recruitment of βarrs and Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laufer et al., 2019</xref>). The formation of this signaling complex was shown to directly activate Rac1. In contrast to our findings, the formation of this signaling complex did not depend on G<sub>i/o</sub> protein and occurred mostly at the Golgi network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laufer et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed an enrichment of Golgi network proteins upon CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation of the CCR7-APEX2 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which raises the possibility that Rac1 can be activated by distinct CCR7-mediated mechanisms at different subcellular compartments.</p><p>Activation of Rac1 leads to its translocation to the cell surface via recycling endosomes, a process reported to occur in response to stimulation of CCR7 as well as several receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palamidessi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laufer et al., 2019</xref>). From this subcellular region, Rac1 activates the major effector PAK1, which phosphorylates LIM kinase and cortactin, among others, to coordinate actin polymerization at the plasma membrane region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tebar et al., 2018</xref>). This polymerization leads to formation of cytoskeletal actin filaments that serve as underlying stabilizing structures of newly formed filopodia and lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tebar et al., 2018</xref>). As these membrane protrusions constitute a major mechanistic step during cell migration, endosomal Rac1 activation plays a central role in this cell physiological process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schiefermeier et al., 2011</xref>). To this end, we found that CCL19 triggers chemotaxis of Jurkat T cells more robustly as compared to CCL21 despite both chemokines activating CCR7-mediated G protein signaling to the same extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Similar findings that demonstrate CCL19’s superior ability to promote chemotaxis of other CCR7-expressing cells as compared to CCL21 have previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kohout et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hjortø et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ricart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jørgensen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bardi et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, using pharmacological intervention we demonstrated that G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling from internalized compartments play a significant role in the chemotaxis response to CCR7 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). Thus, the findings from our study highlight endosomal G protein signaling by some chemokine receptors as a potential mechanism that regulates key aspects of cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), forskolin, G418, HEPES, NaCl, phosphate saline buffer (PBS) tablets, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), KCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, glucose, sodium ascorbate, sodium azide, biotin-tyamide, sodium deoxycholate, Tris-HCl, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), ethanol, chloroacetamide (CAA), Tween-20, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), CaCl<sub>2</sub>, rabbit anti-β-tubulin antibody (cat. no.

Pairwise differential expression analysis was performed by comparing the stimulated datasets (2, 10, and 25 min) to the unstimulated (0 min) dataset using t-test model, assuming equal variance for each protein being compared. For each stimulated time point, proteins with p-value &lt;0.05 and log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) &gt;1 were considered significant. Significance score for the proteins were calculated by taking the absolute value of the log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) and adding -log<sub>10</sub>(p-value) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Proteins with relevance to Rho, Rac, or CDC42 were selected manually from the list and subjected to further analysis for the role of CCR7 in cell motility. These proteins were searched on the STRING database to build a network functional relevance.</p><p>For spatial references PM-APEX2, ENDO-APEX2, and CYTO-APEX2, global median normalization was also performed. Pairwise differential expression analysis between each pair (ENDO against PM, ENDO against CYTO, and PM against CYTO) were performed as above. For each comparison pair, proteins with p-value &lt;0.05 and log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) &gt;1 were considered significant. Then, proteins commonly appear significant for ENDO and PM from the <italic>t</italic>-tests were chosen as spatial references.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>a founding scientist of Unco Therapeutics LLC</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-99373-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The mass spectrometry raw files are accessible under MassIVE ID: MSV000090362 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://massive.ucsd.edu">https://massive.ucsd.edu</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Hahn et al.</collab></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2025">2025</year><data-title>Endosomal Chemokine Receptor Signalosomes Regulate Central Mechanisms Underlying Cell Migration</data-title><source>MaasIVE</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?accession=MSV000090362">MSV000090362</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. Nigel Bunnett for fruitful discussions and generous gift of the plasmid encoding the CAMYEL cAMP biosensor.

The authors suggest that CCR7 signals from early endosomes following internalisation. They use spatial proteomics to try to identify novel interacting partners that may facilitate this signaling and use this data to specifically enhance a Rac1 signaling pathway. Many of the results in the first few figures showing simultaneous recruitment of Barr and G proteins by CCR7 have been shown previously (Laufer et al, 2019, Cell Reports), as has signaling from endomembranes, and Rac1 activation at intracellular sites. The new findings are the APEX2 proteomics studies, which could be useful to the scientific community. Unfortunately, the authors only follow up on a single finding, and the expansion of this section would improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, we would like to thank the reviewer for helping with the manuscript. The summary is mostly accurate except for the statement that simultaneous recruitment of barr and G protein to CCR7 has been shown before. It should also be noted that it has not been demonstrated that CCR7 activates G proteins from endosomes previously nor has the functional role of this signaling mechanism. However, that CCR7 activity at endomembranes is associated with Rac1 signaling was demonstrated in the Laufer et al. study as the reviewer correctly points out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The APEX2 resource will be valuable to the GPCR and immunology community. It offers many opportunities to follow up on findings and discover new biology. The resource could also be used to validate earlier findings in the current manuscript and in previous manuscripts. Was there enrichment of early endosomal markers, Barr and Gi as this would provide further evidence for their earlier claims regarding endosomal signaling? Previous studies have suggested signaling from the TGN, so it is possible that the different ligands also direct to different sites. This could easily be investigated using the APEX2 data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We do in fact observe enrichment of TGN/Golgi markers in response to chemokine stimulation, which we now have highlighted in the manuscript (fourth paragraph on page 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The results section is well written and can be followed very easily by the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewer found the results section very readable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Some findings verify previous studies (e.g. endomembrane signalling). This should be acknowledged as this shows the validity of the findings of both studies.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct. We have now included more discussion of previous work related to CCR7 signaling at endomembranes (thirdparagraph on page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The findings are interesting although the studies are almost all performed in HEK293 cells. I understand that these are commonly used in GPCR biology and are easy to transfect and don't express many GPCRs at high concentrations, but their use is still odd when there are many cell-lines available that express CCR7 and are more reflective of the endogenous state (e.g. they are polarised, they can perform chemotaxis/ migration). Some of the findings within the study should also be verified in more physiologically relevant cells. At the moment only the final figure looks at this, but findings need to be verified elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and giving us an opportunity to elaborate in further detail. The major goal of our study was to investigate whether CCR7 activates G protein from endosomes, the underlying mechanism, and functions of this potential signaling mechanism. The reason we chose CCR7 as our model receptor was that it belongs to a group of GPCRs, the chemokine receptors, that most often have features associated with the ability to promote endosomal G protein activation (phosphorylation site clusters in the C-terminal region).</p><p>Specific detection of G protein activation at distinct subcellular compartments is currently very challenging in truly endogenous systems despite new innovative biosensors that are available (not just related to CCR7, but GPCRs in general). To our knowledge, most if not all studies that detect direct activation of G protein at a specific compartment whether at the plasma membrane, endosome, Golgi, or other compartments, have overexpressed either the receptor, G protein, or both. This is why we choose the HEK293 cell system for most of our experiments, which are easy to manipulate. That being said, we did confirm major findings in an indirect manner using Jurkat T-cells, which express CCR7 endogenously and are physiological relevant. Our hope is that in the future we will be able to use highly sensitive biosensors to directly confirm our findings in such a cell system as the reviewer wisely suggests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors acknowledge that the kinetic patterns of the signals at the early endosome are not consistent with the rates of internalisation. They mention that this could be due to trafficking elsewhere. This could be easily looked at in their APEX2 data. Is there evidence of proximity to markers of other membranes? Perhaps this could be added to the discussion. Similarly, previous studies have shown that CCR7 signaling may involve the TGN. Was there enrichment of these markers? If not, this could also be an interesting finding and should be discussed. It is also possible that the Rab5 reporter is just not as efficient as the trafficking one, especially as in later figures the very convincing differences in the two ligands are not as robust as the differences in trafficking.</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent point. We have now highlighted the possibility of CCR7 being further trafficked to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) as possible explanation for the transient translocation of activated CCR7 to the early endosome in Fig. 1G-H (second paragraph on page 3).</p><p>Furthermore, in the APEX2 experiment we observe enrichment of proteins involved in lysosomal trafficking (LAMP1, VPS16, VAMP7, WDR91, and PP4P1) by CCL19 stimulation at 25 min, and recycling endosomes/TGN markers (SNX6, RAB7L, and GGA) by CCL21 stimulation at 25 min. In addition to this, several markers of TGN/Golgi (SNX3, COG5, YIF1A, SC22B, and AP3S1) were enriched as well in response to both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation. We have now included a statement in the manuscript, which describes the likely trafficking of CCR7 to the TGN/Golgi in response to CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation (fourth paragraph on page 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the final sentence of paragraph 2 of the results the authors state that the internalisation is specific to CCR7 as there isn't recruitment to V2R. I'm not sure this is the best control. The authors can only really say it doesn't recruit to unrelated receptors. The authors could have used a different chemokine receptor which does not respond to these ligands to show this.</p></disp-quote><p>The point with this control experiment was to demonstrate that the loss of NanoBiT signal in response to CCL19 in CCR7-SmBiT/LgBiT-CAAX expressing cells, but not in V2R-SmBiT/LgBiT-CAAX expressing cells, was a result of bona fide CCR7 internalization rather than potential artifactual effects of CCL19 on the NanoBiT system. Our intent was not to demonstrate specificity of CCL19 among chemokine receptors, which already has been thoroughly tested in previous studies. We have now modified the sentence (second paragraph on page 3) “Moreover, CCL19/CCL21-stimulation of receptor internalization to endosomes is specific to CCR7 as none of the chemokines promote internalization or trafficking to endosomes of the vasopressin type 2 receptor (V<sub>2</sub>R)-SmBiT construct (Fig. S1E-F)” to “Moreover, CCL19/CCL21-stimulation did not promote internalization or trafficking to endosomes of the vasopressin type 2 receptor (V<sub>2</sub>R)-SmBiT construct, which validates that these chemokines act specifically via the CCR7-SmBiT system (Fig. S1E-F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The miniGi-Barr1 and imaging showing co-localisation could be more convincing if it was also repeated in a more physiological cell line as in the final figure. Imaging of CCR7, miniGi, and Barr1 would also provide further evidence that the receptor is also present within the complex.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s assessment. However, as mentioned above it is currently extremely challenging to detect endogenous G protein coupling/activation to endogenous receptors. In addition, we are not sure if overexpressing fluorophore-tagged receptor, miniG, and barr1 in a physiological-relevant cell line would provide truly physiological conditions as the expression of these proteins still would be artificially high. This is why we chose to conduct these mechanistic experiments in HEK293 cells and then indirectly verify key findings in an endogenous and physiological-relevant cell line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The findings regarding Rac1 are interesting, although an earlier paper found similar results (Laufer et al, 2019, Cell Reports), so perhaps following up on another APEX2-identified protein pathway would have been more interesting. The authors' statement that Rac1 is specifically activated, and RhoA and Cdc42 are not, is unconvincing from the current data. Only a single NanoBiT assay was used, and as raw values are not reported it is difficult for the reader to glean some essential information. The authors should show evidence that these reporters work well for other receptors (or cite previous studies) and also need evidence from an independent (i.e. non-NanoBiT or BRET) assay.</p></disp-quote><p>The major focus of the study was to investigate whether CCR7 can activate G protein after having been internalized into endosomes via formation of CCR7-Gi/o-barr megaplexes, and to dissect out potential functions of said endosomal G protein signaling. To do this, we used CCL19 and CCL21 which stimulate G protein to the same extent but differ in their ability of promote barr recruitment and receptor internalization with CCL19 being superior to CCL21. To this end, we found that CCL19 also promote endosomal G protein activation to a greater extent than CCL21, and therefore, we specifically looked for proteins enriched by CCL19 in our APEX experiment. This led us to some Rho GTPase regulators that were differentially enriched by CCL19 and CCL21. We agree that there were other interesting effectors related to CCR7 biology identified in the APEX experiment such as EYA2, GRIP2, and EI24. However, those proteins were enriched similar by CCL19 and CCL21 challenge, and thus, do not seem to be activated specifically at endosomes. Following the same argument, we also did not observe any difference in the activity of RhoA or Cdc42 when stimulated with CCL19 or CCL21, so we cannot conclude that these signaling proteins are activated specifically in endosomes. On the other hand, Rac1 was stimulated to a larger degree by CCL19 than CCL21, its activity was inhibited by the Gi/o inhibitor PTX and endocytosis inhibitors Dyngo-4a and PitStop2. CCR7-mediated Rac1 signaling was also inhibited by expression of a dominant negative dynamin mutant that inhibits receptor internalization, and Rac1 was not activated by an internalization-deficient CCR7-DS/T mutant. Finally, the involvement of Rac1 in CCR7 mediated chemotaxis of Jurkat T cells was also demonstrated. We believe that these findings together provide strong basis for the claim that endosomal Gi/o protein signaling by CCR7 activates Rac1.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now included experiments to show that the activation of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 by CXCR4 also can be detected by the NanoBiT biosensors (Fig. S7D-F). We have also added the appropriate references to the original studies where these biosensors were developed in the results section (first paragraph on page 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) At present, the studies in Figure 7 do not go beyond those in the previous Laufer et al study in which they showed blocking endocytosis affected Rac1 signalling. The authors could show that Rac1 signalling is from early endosomes to improve this, otherwise, it could be from the TGN as previously reported.</p></disp-quote><p>The major purpose of Figure 7 was to indirectly confirm findings from HEK293 cells experiments and to tie them to physiological functions. Our experiments using Jurkat T-cells show that CCL19 promote stronger chemotactic response than CCL21 despite similar Gi/o response. In addition, we showed that CCR7-mediated Gi/o activation, receptor endocytosis, as well as Rac1 activity, are required to drive chemotaxis. The Laufer et al. study did not investigate whether CCR7 activates G protein after having been internalized into endosomes via formation of CCR7-Gi/o-barr megaplexes, and thus, did not focus on functional outcomes of this signaling mechanism. Based on this, we believe our work provides new and valuable knowledge to the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a comprehensive analysis of signalling downstream of the chemokine receptor CCR7.

Currently, the authors only show data for CCL19 signalling, which leaves the potential for a false negative finding in terms of CCL21 signalling being selectively impaired. This should be relatively easy to do and should strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have now included experiments to show that both CCL19- and CCL21-mediated CCR7-APEX2 stimulation leads to Gi/o activation (Fig. S4C). In addition, our proteomics experiments show strong effects of both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation, which suggest that the receptor is activated by both ligands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors conclude the discussion by suggesting that their findings highlight endosomal signalling as a general mechanism for chemokine receptors in cell migration. I think this is an overreach. The authors chose several studies of CXC chemokine receptors to support their argument that C-terminal truncation or mutation of the C-terminal phosphorylation sites impairs endocytosis and chemotaxis (refs 40-42). However, in some instances e.g. at the related chemokine receptor CCR4, C-terminal removal of these sites impairs endocytosis but promotes chemotaxis (Nakagawa et al, 2014; Anderson et al, 2020). I therefore think that either the final statement needs to be tempered down or the counterargument discussed a little.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer highlighting this point. We have now modified the concluding sentence from “Thus, the findings from our study highlight endosomal G protein signaling by chemokine receptors as a potential general mechanism that regulates key aspects of cell migration” to “Thus, the findings from our study highlight endosomal G protein signaling by some chemokine receptors as a potential mechanism that regulates key aspects of cell migration.” We hope that the temper level of this sentence is more appropriate.</p><p>References:</p><p>Anderson, C.

I understand this is because the authors wanted to focus on GPCR signaling, but the study will equally be of interest to researchers in the immunology and chemokine fields, and therefore more CCR7-focussed discussion in the introduction would be useful. Similarly, the discussion would benefit from more discussion of previous studies of CCR7 trafficking and endomembrane signaling (in particular the Laufer et al paper) to acknowledge that many of the findings within this paper verify previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included additional immunology/endomembrane background information about CCR7 at the place where the receptor is introduced (first paragraph on page 3). We have also expanded our discussion of our work in relation to the Laufer et al. study (third paragraph on page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) On page 5, the authors state that 'The response to chemokine stimulation was not observed in mock transfected HEK293 cells'. Figure S4D does not have a legend so it is difficult to see what they mean by mock transfected. Do they mean not transfecting with anything or not with the receptor? The better control would be transfecting the reporters but not the receptor. This may have been done, but the wording needs clarifying and S4D needs a legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We believe the reviewer refers to Figure S2D and we have now highlighted/clarified the legend better. Mock transfected conditions refer to HEK293 cells transfected with the reporter, but not the receptor. This is written in the legend as “(D) Change in luminescence signal generated between SmBiT-barr1 and LgBiT-miniGi in response to 100 nM CCL19 or 100 nM CCL21 in mock transfected HEK293 cells (no CCR7)”, which we believe should be clear to the audience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The validation of the APEX2 receptor construct relies on a single assay with one ligand. The authors should show that the receptor expresses at the cell surface, is internalised normally, and that both ligands activate the receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included additional data to show that (1) the receptor is expressed at the cell surface, (2) that the CCR7-APEX2 recruits barr1 to the plasma membrane, (3) that this association leads to barr1 translocation to the early endosomes as an indirect measurement of receptor internalization, and (4) that both CCL19- and CCL21-stimulation inhibit forskolin induced cAMP production (Fig.S4A-C, and described in fifth paragraph on page 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The APEX2 section is very short, especially as this is novel data. It lacks some important information, e.g. when the authors state that 'we identified a total of 579 proteins', is this in total for both ligands, separately or were some shared? More information on each ligand separately and combined would make this clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now specified that the identified total proteins enriched from our APEX2 approach is when the cells are stimulated with either CCL19 or CCL21 (third paragraph on page 7). Furthermore, we have included a Venn diagram in Fig. S5C to show how many proteins were enriched by CCL19 or CCL21 stimulation and how many of those were shared at different time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The discussion would benefit from some further work. The current first two paragraphs just reiterate the introduction and don't discuss the current paper so could be removed completely. The Laufer et al study needs much more discussion as they report many of the findings of the current paper (signaling following endocytosis, Rac1 endomembrane signaling) five years ago. The APEX2 findings that are discussed, though interesting, are not followed up by further experimental evidence and there is little discussion of why the two ligands have different responses or what the physiological effects could be.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s effort in helping with the discussion. To this end, we have now expanded our discussion of the mentioned paper further as suggested (third paragraph on page 10). We agree that the findings from our APEX experiment are interesting, but the focus of this study relates to proteins enriched specifically at endosomes. Several of the most enriched proteins did not show this localization bias, which is why these proteins were not further investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor changes:</p><p>(1) The authors should remove the word 'recent' at the start of the first sentence of the third paragraph. Endosomal signaling by GPCRs was described 15 years ago so cannot really be seen as recent anymore.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now adjusted the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Tukey defaulted to Turkey in some places.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these typos, which now have been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor Points:</p><p>(1) ACKRs do not couple to G proteins so it is peculiar to see them in this table. I would limit the table to the conventional CCR1-10, CXCR1-6 and XCR1. The ligand for XCR1 is XCL1 which is absent from the table.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the table accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) CCL19 (formerly known as ELC) has been long known to be a more efficacious and potent ligand in chemotaxis assays (Bardi et al, 2001). This earlier reference should be added to the citations in the preceding statement on page 10.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important study showing that CCL19 is more efficacious than CCL21 in promoting chemotaxis and that this has been known for decades. We have now included the reference accordingly (reference 59 in second paragraph on page 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 6, Panel Q. I think the legends for CCR7 and CCR7 delta ST might be flipped.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this error. We have now corrected the figure panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure S5 (or 5) might benefit from simple Venn diagrams showing the numbers of differentially enriched proteins following treatment with the two ligands at different time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a Venn diagram in Fig. S5C to show how many proteins were enriched by CCL19 or CCL21 stimulation and how many of those where shared.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Bardi, G., Lipp, M., Baggiolini, M. &amp; Loetscher, P.
