regeneration and osseointegration in a postmenopausal osteoporosis model using beagle dogs. Twelve osteoporotic female beagles were subjected to implant surgeries and assigned to one of three groups: control, rhPTH(1-34), or dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34). Bone regeneration and osseointegration were evaluated after 10 weeks using micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT), histological analyses, and serum biochemical assays. Results showed that the rhPTH(1-34) group demonstrated superior improvements in bone mineral density, trabecular architecture, and osseointegration compared to controls, while the dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) group exhibited similar, though slightly less pronounced, anabolic effects. Histological and TRAP assays indicated both PTH analogs significantly enhanced bone regeneration, especially in artificially created bone defects. The findings suggest that both rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) hold potential as therapeutic agents for promoting bone regeneration and improving osseointegration around implants in osteoporotic conditions, with implications for their use in bone-related pathologies and reconstructive surgeries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parathyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd><kwd>teriparatide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003710</institution-id><institution>Korea Health Industry Development Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI22C1377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jin-Woo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RS-2024-00339519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jin-Woo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022R1A2C3006002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sihoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018R1D1A1B07041400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jong-Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006107</institution-id><institution>Gachon University Gil Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRD2023-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sihoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002560</institution-id><institution>Soonchunhyang University Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20220446</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Jeong-Oh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) significantly promoted bone regeneration and titanium implant osseointegration in an osteoporotic beagle model.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone regeneration is a complex physiological process that is essential for the successful integration of dental implants into the jawbone. Osseointegration, the direct structural and functional connection between living bone and an implant’s surface, is a critical determinant of implant stability and long-term viability in dental reconstructive therapy. Since excessive levels of circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) increase osteoclastic activity and accelerate bone resorption, it might seem paradoxical that PTH can also be used as a treatment modality for diseases with bone loss, such as osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jilka, 2007</xref>). Administration of PTH analogs can be categorized into two distinct protocols: intermittent and continuous. Intermittent rhPTH(1-34) therapy, typically characterized by daily injections, is clinically used to enhance bone formation and strength. This method leverages the anabolic effects of rhPTH(1-34) without significant bone resorption, which can occur with more frequent or continuous exposure. On the other hand, continuous rhPTH(1-34) exposure, often modeled in research as constant infusion, tends to accelerate bone resorption activities, potentially leading to bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Silva and Bilezikian, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jilka, 2007</xref>). Understanding these differences is crucial for interpreting the therapeutic implications of rhPTH(1-34) in bone health. Intermittent administration of PTH unlikely continuous exposure showed anabolic effects, indicating different responses relating to bone microarchitecture depending on the dose and frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Silva and Bilezikian, 2015</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, although it was shown that PTH binds through PTH type 1 receptor (PTH1R) and that G-protein-coupled receptors are associated with the protein kinase A-dependent pathway, thereby demonstrating primary anabolic action on bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheloha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jilka, 2007</xref>). The anabolic effect of intermittent PTH administration is mediated by the downregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which upregulates the transcriptional expression of growth factors, such as IGF1, FGF2, and Runx2, which are essential for the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, leading to an increased number of osteoblasts and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krishnan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee and Partridge, 2009</xref>).</p><p>A PTH analog, teriparatide (recombinant human PTH(1-34)), demonstrated its promising anabolic effects in a fracture prevention trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neer et al., 2001</xref>), leading to its approval by the United States Food and Drugs Administration, making it the first anabolic agent for postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Additionally, its unique anabolic features, which are contrasted with antiresorptive, lead to an increased application of rhPTH(1-34), whereby it was used in both metabolic and pathological bone diseases alongside various other conditions where bone formation occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Uusi-Rasi et al., 2005</xref>). Conversely, recent concerns regarding the development of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) have appeared in association with the use of antiresorptive, meaning rhPTH(1-34) has gained attention for its potential to reduce the risk of ONJ and its therapeutic effects in treating ONJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kakehashi et al., 2015</xref>). Although in vivo studies on fracture healing, bone augmentation, and titanium osseointegration effects of rhPTH(1-34) have been attempted, they have generally been limited to pilot studies in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gomes-Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu and Su, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, only nine mutations have been discovered since the PTH amino acid and nucleotide sequences were confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schipani, 1999</xref>). Among them, the PTH R25C mutation was discovered in three siblings with familial idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, which consisted of a homozygous arginine to cysteine mutation at residue 25 (R25C) in the mature PTH(1-84) polypeptide and exhibited distinct characteristics from the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Lee, 2022</xref>). The other mutations located in the prepro-leader region of the hormone resulted in defective synthesis and secretion; however, the PTH R25C mutation is located within the mature bioactive domain of PTH and does not affect synthesis or secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Lee, 2022</xref>). Although the capacity of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) to bind to the PTH1R and stimulate cAMP production was slightly lower in the human osteoblast-derived SaOS-2 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Lee, 2022</xref>), yet it showed comparable anabolic activity in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the dimeric formation of the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) peptide, presumably through disulfide bonding of the cysteine residues, has implied that dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) might partake in unique biological actions, which potentiate its clinical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Park et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the limited effectiveness toward certain types of fractures, such as non-vertebral fractures, and the disadvantage of its limited duration of use, the administration of rhPTH(1-34) for osteoporosis has raised concerns about its potential to induce cortical porosity, despite showing favorable results in the treatment of trabecular microarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindsay et al., 2016</xref>). This has led to concerns regarding the widespread use of PTH. However, recent notable studies have indicated that cortical porosity is not induced when PTH is administered weekly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mosekilde et al., 1995</xref>), which is in contrast to daily administrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zebaze et al., 2017</xref>). These studies suggest that the frequency and dosage of PTH administration can significantly affect the bone response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hock and Gera, 1992</xref>), while different forms of PTH might also induce different biological responses, which means deeper investigations into the therapeutic effects of PTH are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellido et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, in this study, the authors used a large animal model that mimics postmenopausal osteoporosis to investigate the therapeutic effects of two PTH analogs, rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34), on bone regeneration and osseointegration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microarchitectural and histological analysis of titanium osseointegration</title><p>&quot;Our study aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy of rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric R25CPTH(1-34) in promoting bone regeneration and healing using a clinically relevant animal model.

The group administered rhPTH(1-34) presented consistently higher values of BMD, BV, Tb.N, and Tb.Th, and lower value of Tb.Sp compared to the control and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) groups, indicating that rhPTH(1-34) administration enhanced titanium osseointegration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, this was consistent for all three titanium implants, irrespective of artificial bone defects (second implant) or bone grafting (third implant). Interestingly, the dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) group showed similar trends for the anabolic effects related to the titanium implants. Morphometric analysis indicated that dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) administration enhanced the BMD, BV, and other trabecular indices, resulting in a higher degree of osseointegration than in the control group (p&lt;0.05), although lower than in the rhPTH(1-34) group (p&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall Study Design and MicroCT Analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Experimental design for the controlled delivery of rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) in ovariectomized beagle model.

The implants in the control group showed physiological bone osseointegration around the titanium implant; however, insufficient bone–implant contact and exposure of implant threads were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was especially evident on the buccal side of the implant, which was more vulnerable due to the bundle bone structure. Alternatively, the titanium implants in the rhPTH(1-34) group were in full contact with the green-stained mineralized bone. The dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) group showed a better pattern of osseointegration compared to the control group, although the bone–implant contact was lower than in the rhPTH(1-34) group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Notably, both the rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) groups presented evidence of bone regeneration for the second implant, whereby a bone defect was created prior to placing the implant. The measured bone–implant contact ratio was 18.32 ± 16.19% for the control group, 48.13 ± 29.81% for the rhPTH(1-34) group, and 39.53 ± 26.17% for the dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) group, illustrating the significant improvement in osseointegration.

Although there have been a few studies investigating their effects on bone regeneration in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>), we aimed to investigate these effects using a large animal model. We chose this model because it more accurately mimics osteoporotic humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jee and Yao, 2001</xref>). In the evaluation of titanium osseointegration, the rhPTH(1-34) group consistently exhibited enhanced BMD, BV, and other key parameters, thereby indicating superior titanium osseointegration compared to the control and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Histological analyses confirmed these results, emphasizing the stronger bone–implant contact observed in the rhPTH(1-34) group. Furthermore, both PTH analogs significantly promoted bone regeneration in artificially created defects, with the rhPTH(1-34) group displaying a more mature trabecular architecture, as evidenced by a notable increase in the TRAP+ cell count during the bone remodeling assessments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and N</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the results on the effect of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) in the ovariectomy (OVX) mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noh et al., 2024</xref>), bone formation markers were increased in the dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) group compared to the rhPTH(1-34) group. Additionally, bone resorption markers were decreased in the rhPTH(1-34) group compared to the control group. However, no significant differences were observed in the dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) group. This suggests that the mechanism of action of the dimeric peptide differs from that of the wildtype peptide. Furthermore, based on unpublished data comparing mRNA expression in bone and kidney tissues between the dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) and rhPTH(1-34)-treated groups, we strongly believe that dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) exhibits distinct biological activity from rhPTH(1-34). These differences may arise from variations in PTH receptor binding, involvement of different G protein subtypes, or downstream intracellular signaling pathways.</p><p>The distinct effects of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) and rhPTH(1-34) on osteoblasts and osteoclasts could indicate that while remodeling-based osteogenesis has a limited clinical use period, the dimeric form might promote sustained bone formation and increased bone density over a longer duration. Given that patients with this mutation, who have been exposed to the mutant dimer throughout their lives, exhibit high bone density, this suggests significant potential for dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) as a novel therapeutic option alongside wildtype PTH.</p><p>Both PTH analogs demonstrated anabolic effects, particularly in the mandible. The distinct pharmacological profile of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) suggests potential for more targeted, long-term applications, especially in conditions requiring sustained bone regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae et al., 2016</xref>). This biological difference is thought to be due to dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) exhibiting a more preferential binding affinity for the RG versus R0 PTH1R conformation, despite having a diminished affinity for either conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Lee, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Park et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, the potency of cAMP production in cells was lower for dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) compared to monomeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34), consistent with its lower PTH1R-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noh et al., 2024</xref>). One of the potential clinical advantages of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) is its partial agonistic effect in pharmacodynamics. This property may allow for a more fine-tuned regulation of bone metabolism, potentially reducing the risk of adverse effects associated with full agonism, such as hypercalcemia and bone resorption by osteolcast activity. Moreover, the dimeric form may offer a more sustained anabolic response, which could be beneficial in the context of long-term treatment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noh et al., 2024</xref>). Also, the impact of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) was notable, as we observed a noticeable improvement in bone formation when compared to the control group. However, these effects were not as strong as those of rhPTH(1-34). Both PTH analogs demonstrated enhanced anabolic effects around the titanium implants, promoting bone regeneration and remodeling.</p><p>In addition to the effect of systemic bone mineral gain, the unique anabolic feature of PTH has received clinical attention as an emerging strategy due to the increased risk of ONJ following the use of antiresorptive and the rising need for implantation and bone augmentation in the field of orthopedics and maxillofacial surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ruggiero et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, site-specific differential effects of teriparatide have not been clarified, although it represents an issue often associated with selective concentrations of teriparatide that cause anabolic effects on the central skeleton and possible bone mineral decrease on the peripheral skeleton, including the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McClung et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, it can be inferred that facial and jawbones, which have the same developmental origin as the skull through membranous ossification, will show the same bone response as the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Setiawati and Rahardjo, 2019</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that the central skeleton, including the lumbar and thoracic spine and pelvis regions, showed an increase in areal BMD, while the arms, legs, and skull showed a decrease in bone minerals, suggesting an effect of rhPTH(1-34) on the redistribution of bone minerals from the peripheral to the central skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paggiosi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>However, the results of this study demonstrated that rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) significantly improved the osseointegration of bone and titanium, as well as jawbone regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The anabolic effects of both PTH analogs in this specific region may have been enhanced by the unique anatomical characteristics of the mandible, which we attribute to these improvements. The authors have attributed this phenomenon to the unique anatomical characteristics observed in the jawbone. The jawbone in the human body undergoes the most rapid bone remodeling and has excellent blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huja et al., 2006</xref>). Since the jawbone is continuously exposed to mechanical stress from mastication and swallowing, this suggests that the net anabolic effect of rhPTH(1-34) in the jawbone, which is not part of the central skeleton, is achieved through mechanical loading. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson et al., 2021</xref> demonstrated that rhPTH(1-34) and mechanical loading additively stimulate anabolic modeling and synergistically stimulate remodeling in trabecular bone, findings that further support this notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson et al., 2021</xref>). However, further investigation is needed to fully understand this relationship.</p><p>The anabolic effects of rhPTH(1-34) have been demonstrated through several large randomized controlled trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the FDA’s decision to remove the 2-year treatment limit in 2021, which opens possibilities for broader clinical applications, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed. There are ongoing concerns about the potential long-term effects of extended use, including accelerated bone remodeling, possible hypercalcemic conditions, and heightened bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burr et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fox et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fox et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Neer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>). However, recent studies have shown that the frequency and dosing of rhPTH(1-34) administration can lead to different bone responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamane et al., 2017</xref>). An in vivo study by Yamamoto et al. reported that lower doses of rhPTH(1-34) with high-frequency administration resulted in the formation of thin trabeculae, osteoclastogenesis, and accelerated bone remodeling, while low-frequency rhPTH(1-34) administration showed a phenomenon of modeling-based formation through thicker trabeculae, mature osteoblasts, and new bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamane et al., 2017</xref>). This supports the notion that modeling-based bone gain can be an important axis in PTH anabolism and the primary principle of PTH as bone remodeling-driven bone anabolism.</p><p>The use of daily injections in this study was intended to simulate intermittent PTH therapy, a well-established clinical approach for managing osteoporosis and enhancing bone regeneration. Intermittent administration of PTH, as opposed to continuous exposure, is critical for maximizing the anabolic response while minimizing the catabolic effects that are associated with higher frequency or continuous hormone levels. Our findings support the notion that even with daily administration, both rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) promote bone formation and osseointegration, consistent with the outcomes expected from intermittent therapy. It’s important for future research to consider the dosage and timing of administration to further optimize the therapeutic benefits of PTH analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dempster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hodsman et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The limitation of this study is that the therapeutic responses of rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) were focused on local surgical interventions, meaning that we could not investigate the central skeletal responses, such as in the femur and lumbar. Therefore, further research is needed to investigate these different responses by administering the PTH analogs at various frequencies and doses. Additionally, although this study was conducted on large animals, using a larger number of subjects would have yielded more robust results. Implementing randomization of the surgical sites and using guided surgery for implant insertion should also be considered in future studies to achieve more precise results.</p><p>Overall, the study demonstrated the therapeutic effects of rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) on bone regeneration and titanium osseointegration using a beagle model with osteoporosis. Validation of the anabolic effects of rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) in large animals has resulted in a broader understanding of their physiological and therapeutic functions and further expands their potential applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>This study was conducted in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines and approved by the Animal Research Committee of Cronex Co., Ltd., Hwaseong, South Korea (CRONEX-IACUC 201801002).

In this article, the authors tried to address this, using a beagle model, and assessed the osseointegrative effect of recombinant PTH analogues.

In addition, the implants were surgically inserted following a &quot;conventional implant surgery&quot;, implying that no precise/guided insertion was utilized. This weakness is, in my opinion, particularly significant since the amount of bone osteointegration may greatly depend on the bucco-lingual positioning of each implant at the time of the surgical insertion (which should, therefore, be precisely standardized across all animals and for all surgical procedures).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93830.5.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Jeong-Oh</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Soon Chun Hyang University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cheonan</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jong-Bin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Gangneung-Wonju National University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gangneung</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sihoon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Gachon University Gil Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Incheon</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jin-Woo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ewha Womans University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The revised manuscripts and rebuttal sufficiently answered all the questions raised by three Reviewers. Overall, the manuscript is well written and the results are clear based on a straightforward experiment in a pursuit of comparing dimeric PTH analog to 1-34 PTH analog, which has established clinical efficacy. The study's results are valuable as it utilized large animal models, specifically examined the local bone integration effects, and demonstrated the comparable therapeutic efficacy of the new PTH analog to 1-34 PTH. However, the data did not convincingly show how the dimeric PTH analog overcomes the limitations of 1-34 PTH. I suggest that the discussion should focus more on the differences between the two analogs.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate your thorough review and valuable feedback. We have carefully considered your comments and would like to address them as follows:</p><p>“Regarding the results on the effect of dimeric R25CPTH(1-34) in the OVX mouse model (Noh et al., 2024), bone formation markers were increased in the dimeric R25CPTH(1-34) group compared to the rhPTH (1-34) group. Additionally, bone resorption markers were decreased in the rhPTH (1-34) group compared to the control group. However, no significant differences were observed in the dimeric R25CPTH(1-34) group. This suggests that the mechanism of action of the dimeric peptide differs from that of the wildtype peptide. Furthermore, based on unpublished data comparing mRNA expression in bone and kidney tissues between the dimeric R25CPTH(1-34) and rhPTH (1-34) treated groups, we strongly believe that dimeric R25CPTH(1-34) exhibits distinct biological activity from rhPTH (1-34). These differences may arise from variations in PTH receptor binding, involvement of different G protein subtypes, or downstream intracellular signaling pathways.</p><p>The distinct effects of dimeric R25CPTH(1-34) and rhPTH (1-34) on osteoblasts and osteoclasts could indicate that while remodeling-based osteogenesis has a limited clinical use period, the dimeric form might promote sustained bone formation and increased bone density over a longer duration.
