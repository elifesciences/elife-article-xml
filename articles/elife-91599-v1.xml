development. Changes occurring during a CP often become ‘locked in’ so that they affect the mature network. Indeed, several neurodevelopmental disorders have been linked to excessive activity during such periods. It is, therefore, important to identify those aspects of neural circuit development that are influenced by neural activity during a CP. In this study, we take advantage of the genetic tractability of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to show that activity perturbation during an embryonic CP permanently alters properties of the locomotor circuit. Specific changes we identify include increased synchronicity of motoneuron activity and greater strengthening of excitatory over inhibitory synaptic drive to motoneurons. These changes are sufficient to reduce network robustness, evidenced by increased sensitivity to induced seizure. We also show that we can rescue these changes when increased activity is mitigated by inhibition provided by mechanosensory neurons. Similarly, we demonstrate a dose-dependent relationship between inhibition experienced during the CP and the extent to which it is possible to rescue the hyperexcitable phenotype characteristic of the <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> mutation. This suggests that developing circuits must be exposed to a properly balanced sum of excitation and inhibition during the CP to achieve normal mature network function. Our results, therefore, provide novel insight into how activity during a CP shapes specific elements of a circuit, and how activity during this period is integrated to tune neural circuits to the environment in which they will likely function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>critical period</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>motor system</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 217099/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Iain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

These include extrinsic and intrinsic factors, such as temperature, light, mechanical stress, and/or genetic mutations. Multiple studies have revealed that developing neural networks are most sensitive to neuronal activity during critical periods (CPs) – defined periods in developmental time during which plasticity peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hensch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wong-Riley, 2021</xref>). Indeed, work in several model organisms has shown that activity perturbation during a CP often becomes ‘locked in’ so that once the CP is closed the mature nervous system remains changed. This was first demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubel and Wiesel, 1970</xref>, who showed that blocking visual input in kittens, but not in adult cats, caused significant, lasting change in ocular dominance. Thus, visual activity during early life is necessary for normal development of vision. Since these pioneering experiments, CPs have been identified in other networks and across species, which indicates that they are a common phenomenon in the development of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marley and Baines, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giachello and Baines, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golovin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Styr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hensch and Bilimoria, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies posit that aberrant activity during CPs contributes to, and may even cause, neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">LeBlanc and Fagiolini, 2011</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Selemon and Zecevic, 2015</xref>), and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lybrand et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, this growing body of work suggests that excessive activity experienced during a CP may lead to increased excitability in a mature network. Research in several model organisms, including mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, supports this view by showing that mature neurons are more excitable when they experience greater activity during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marley and Baines, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giachello et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Styr et al., 2019</xref>). Despite this progress, however, the specifics of how activity experienced during a CP influences a nervous system remains unclear. Key questions that remain unanswered include the following: ‘How does activity perturbation affect the relative contribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurons within a network?’ ‘Is it the extremes, or the sum of activity, experienced during a CP that is critical for mature circuit function?’ It is difficult to answer these questions when conducting experiments in complex mammalian sensory networks, such as the visual and auditory networks, which have been extensively used to explore CPs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hooks and Chen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakamura et al., 2020</xref>). In this respect, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval network may provide a powerful alternative.</p><p>The larval nervous system is an experimentally tractable and numerically simple model that is very well suited to studying CPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunter et al., 2021</xref>). Larvae are amenable to a range of different assays to demonstrate the impact of manipulating activity during development on a mature nervous system. For example, the electroshock assay enables assessment of ‘network robustness’ by measuring the ability of the nervous system to withstand or recover from strong electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marley and Baines, 2011a</xref>). Similarly, functional imaging can be used to visualise locomotor network dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Streit et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval connectome project (which is near completion) has led to the mapping of individual neurons, neural circuits, and development of Gal4 lines (genetic driver lines) that enable cellular-level precision in experimental manipulation of the nervous system (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunter et al., 2021</xref>). It is also possible to perform electrophysiology on certain cells, such as the anterior corner cell motoneuron (aCC, a.k.a MN-1b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baines and Bate, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marley and Baines, 2011b</xref>). Together, these techniques and tools can be applied to study and attempt to answer questions including those posed above by probing processes associated with an embryonic locomotor CP that was first described in previous work by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giachello and Baines, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our earlier work showed that manipulating activity during 17–19 hr after egg laying (AEL) is sufficient to induce significant and permanent change to locomotor network stability. It also established that the range of manipulation that causes this change is broad; it extends from increased excitation during this CP being sufficient to induce a seizure-like phenotype in mature larvae subjected to electroshock, to a rescue of a genetic seizure mutation by reduction of network activity during the same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giachello and Baines, 2015</xref>). However, the effects of activity perturbation on the specific cellular components of the locomotor network have not been identified. Here, we make use of the output of the connectome project to focus attention on excitatory cholinergic A18a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasegawa et al., 2016</xref>) and inhibitory GABAergic A31k (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>) interneurons, as well as the aCC motoneuron which these interneurons are monosynaptically connected to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giachello et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, we perform patch-clamp experiments on aCC to show how synaptic connectivity of these single-cell types (A18a or A31k) is influenced following activity perturbation during the embryonic CP. We show that excessive activity during the CP permanently increases the strength of the input of A18a relative to A31k, which is consistent with a significant change in the excitation:inhibition (E:I) balance of the network. Next, we show that restoring E:I balance rescues the network, thus providing evidence that the CP integrates the ‘averaged’ activity that occurs while it is open. Our data suggest that ‘average’ activity must be balanced, so that the intrinsic properties that dictate the function of the mature locomotor network are set within normal ranges.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increasing neural activity during embryogenesis permanently alters network function and synchronicity</title><p>To manipulate neural activity in developing embryos, we fed gravid (i.e. egg-laying) female flies picrotoxin (PTX), which increases neural activity by non-competitive antagonism of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). This procedure is sufficient to expose embryos and the resulting young larvae to PTX. Larval metabolism and excretion during early to mid-developmental stages removes PTX, so that it is no longer detectable when assaying for effect in wall-climbing third-instar larvae (L3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marley and Baines, 2011a</xref>). Crucially, our previous work has shown that permanent changes in network function observed as a result of embryonic exposure to PTX occur due to the change in activity during the CP, which lasts from 17 to 19 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giachello and Baines, 2015</xref>). Similar activity manipulation during larval stages is without effect (Sarah Doran and RAB, unpublished data). We measured the effect of PTX-linked activity manipulation during the CP on two independent parameters at L3: recovery from electroshock (which is longer in other models of CP activity manipulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giachello and Baines, 2015</xref>]) and crawling velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Videos of seizure activity can be viewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marley and Baines, 2011b</xref>. Embryonic exposure to PTX significantly increased the duration of electroshock-induced seizures compared to controls (61.11 ± 3.94 s, EtOH; 96.49 ± 6.81 s, PTX; n = 36, 35; p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). PTX exposure did not, however, influence crawling velocity (1.06 ± 0.04 mm/s, EtOH; 0.98 ± 0.04 mm/s, PTX; n = 56, 58; p=0.14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests that changes caused by PTX exposure during the CP were not significant enough to alter circuit function under ‘normal’ conditions (i.e. crawling) but clearly altered network robustness: the ability of the network to respond to strong stimulation (electroshock).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Increased excitation during the embryonic critical period (CP) alters network stability and motoneuron network synchrony.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic demonstrating timeline for picrotoxin (PTX) exposure and assay of network function.

In larvae, normal locomotor function is characterised by stereotyped activity that is regulated by a central pattern generator (CPG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>). This pattern is formed by activity waves that pass between successive segments in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) to support peristaltic locomotion. The timing (or synchronicity) of waves crossing adjacent segments is characteristic and can be measured as the time lag between peaks of activity observed in adjacent aCC motoneurons. Previous work has shown that synchronicity increases (i.e. time lag reduces) in the presence of mutations that predispose animals to seizure (e.g. <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic>) or following acute exposure to proconvulsants (e.g. 4-aminopyridine or PTX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Streit et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore quantified synchronicity of activity between aCC motoneurons at L3 to investigate how embryonic exposure to PTX alters activity in the mature locomotor network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>).</p><p>Increasing neural activity during embryogenesis (PTX) significantly increased synchronicity across segments A6-A4 compared to vehicle control (0.9 ± 0.09 s, EtOH; 0.67 ± 0.06 s, PTX; n = 18, 18; p=0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This increased synchronicity of activity between adjacent segments is consistent with, and may contribute to, the seizure phenotype observed. It likely reflects significant changes in CPG properties that make it harder for larvae to recover from electroshock.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Increased activity during the CP alters the E:I balance within the locomotor network</title><p>Motoneuron activity reflects the integration of the excitatory and inhibitory premotor synaptic drive to which the cell is exposed. We therefore tested the effect of embryonic exposure to PTX on the synaptic drive provided by two identified premotor interneurons – one exciter and one inhibitor – which are monosynaptically connected to aCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giachello et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, we quantified the strength of cholinergic excitor A18a (a.k.a.

To achieve this, premotor interneurons were activated using optogenetics, while whole-cell patch recordings were made from aCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Increased excitation during the critical period (CP) preferentially increases the strength of excitatory inputs to anterior corner cell (aCC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: schematic demonstrating the use of optogenetics for testing strength of A18a or A31k synaptic drive on evoked action potential firing in aCC.

(<bold>B, C</bold>) Current-clamp recordings wherein current (~10 pA) was injected to evoke action potential firing in aCC, prior to optogenetic stimulation of premotor input. Amplitude of inputs was quantified as change in frequency of action potential firing (ΔAP Freq. (Hz)) following optogenetic stimulation of A18a or A31k. Change in action potential firing frequency in A18a (p=0.04), but not A31k (p=0.15), was significantly potentiated by embryonic exposure to PTX vs. vehicle controls (EtOH).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91599-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Larval motoneurons do not generate action potentials (APs) without synaptic drive. Thus, to determine how synaptic inputs may have changed following embryonic CP manipulation, current was injected into aCC to evoke stable firing before premotors were stimulated. Evoked firing before optogenetic stimulation, in larvae expressing A18a-Gal4, was different between control L3 (EtoH) and those exposed to PTX (6.87 ± 0.46 Hz, EtOH; 10.41 ± 1.44 Hz, PTX; n = 8, 8; p=0.03). While this difference may reflect a change in excitability due to PTX exposure, it may also have been due to the requirement for injecting differing amounts of current to maintain spiking at a constant rate. Regardless, optogenetic activation of excitatory A18a increased AP frequency in aCC in control L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right), and this increase was significantly larger in L3 derived from embryos exposed to PTX (7.24 ± 2.04 Hz, EtOH; 15.81 ± 3.14 Hz, PTX; n = 8, 8; p=0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Evoked firing before optogenetic stimulation, in larvae expressing A31k-Gal4, was not significantly different between control L3 (EtOH) and those exposed to PTX (7 ± 0.94 Hz, EtOH; 7.36 ± 1 Hz, PTX; n = 8, 9; p=0.8). Activation of inhibitory A31k decreased AP firing in control L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); however, this decrease was not significantly different in L3 derived from embryos exposed to PTX (23.71 ± 6.76 Hz, EtOH; 28.24 ± 2.4 Hz, PTX; n = 8, 9; p=0.15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Comparing the magnitude of the changes in A18a or A31k input using an effect size calculation (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details) corroborates that excitation increased more than inhibition, as Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.14 (large effect size) for A18a and 0.78 (medium effect size) for A31k.

Our data suggests that embryonic exposure to PTX induced a shift in the E:I balance of the larval locomotor circuit to favour excitation, which is consistent with the network-level phenotypes observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

A change in the frequency of mini excitatory postsynaptic potentials (mEPSPs, a.k.a. minis) would suggest the adaptation is primarily presynaptic (e.g. increased probability of release), whilst a change in distribution and/or amplitude of minis is more consistent with a mechanism acting postsynaptically (e.g. increased or altered receptor subunits). We quantified the mean amplitude, cumulative distribution, and frequency of minis.

Thus, our recordings of minis in aCC are consistent with a change in the postsynaptic response to excitatory quantal release. However, this conclusion is based on measuring all excitatory quantal inputs to aCC, and not specifically from A18a. It was, therefore, important to refine this result by restricting it to the specific excitatory quantal input from this premotor interneuron.</p><p>It is technically challenging to record minis elicited in response to quantal release from a defined neuron because doing so requires isolating minis from a single neuron (e.g. A18a) from those released by other excitatory premotors (there are many which synapse with aCC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zarin et al., 2019</xref>). To maximise our ability to do so, we adapted a technique developed in mammals, which substitutes extracellular Sr<sup>2+</sup> (8 mM) for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekkers and Clements, 1999</xref>). This substitution promotes asynchronous vesicular release (i.e. occurrence of single quantal events) following firing of an evoked AP by a presynaptic neuron, which can be recorded in a postsynaptic neuron as a series of minis. Thus, we replaced Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2 mM) with Sr<sup>2+</sup> (6 mM, which better supported survival of larval neurons than 8 mM) and used optogenetics to stimulate A18a, while recording from aCC. We validated this approach by showing that optogenetic activation of A18a, in the presence of Sr<sup>2+</sup>, greatly reduced evoked synaptic current but increased the frequency of minis recorded in aCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with asynchronous release.

CPs often reflect a change from spontaneous to patterned activity within neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coulson et al., 2022</xref>). Early spontaneous activity that occurs prior to CP opening is predominantly excitatory and notably includes excitatory GABAergic signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>). Thus, the E:I balance is strongly biased towards excitation prior to the opening of a CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allène et al., 2008</xref>). This early developmental phase seemingly facilitates the development of neuronal electrical properties and synaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baines and Pym, 2006</xref>). However, as sensory input becomes active, inhibitory signalling increases (with GABA now assuming its mature inhibitory signalling mode).

However, we recognise that other elements of the locomotor network may also undergo change due to CP manipulation. The advantage of this system is that most of these elements can be manipulated through cell-specific genetic drivers. The firing frequencies that we imposed (~5–10 Hz) are also lower than seen during fictive locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kadas et al., 2019</xref>), which shows burst firing lasting for ~300 ms and achieving spike frequencies of up to 100 Hz. Nevertheless, we identified an increase in the amplitude of minis which suggests the primary mechanism that alters excitability is postsynaptic. The precise mechanism contributing to increased mini amplitude remains to be determined, but a plausible scenario may involve change in cholinergic subunit composition. Similar changes to synaptic physiology have been reported in mammalian systems. For example, monocular deprivation in rat increases excitability in layer 4 of the visual cortex skewing the E:I balance towards excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maffei et al., 2004</xref>). However, the complexity of the visual system obscures definitive conclusions because of apparent confounding observations of increasing inhibition in different components of the same circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maffei et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, these observations mirror our results where we report increases in both excitation and inhibition, but show that the former predominates, thus altering E:I balance. Moreover, and again similar to our findings, monocular deprivation in rats is sufficient to increase mini amplitude indicative of active postsynaptic mechanisms for altered excitability. Specifically, mini amplitude first declines following monocular deprivation, but after 3–6 d is potentiated due to homeostatic synaptic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lambo and Turrigiano, 2013</xref>). This observation suggests that homeostatic compensation can alter properties set during a CP and thus the final effect to any given network is likely to be due to a mix of CP-dependent and homeostatic-dependent change. The ability to record from identified network components and capability to explore along the entire developmental timeline of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval locomotor circuit offers the prospect of exploring this in greater detail. For example, it remains unknown if the effects we observe in late L3 are a result of only CP-related mechanisms, or are a consequence of the former plus additional homeostatic compensation occurring during larval life. The ability to record from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baines and Bate, 1998</xref>), in addition to all larval stages, means that this important question can be addressed experimentally.</p><p>Our results show excitatory input to motoneurons is increased to a greater extent than inhibitory input when the developing circuit is exposed to excessive activity during the CP. This could be considered surprising. This is because it may be assumed that the nervous system should compensate for increased excitation by decreasing excitability through either (1) reducing excitatory (A18a) input strength; (2) increasing inhibitory (A31k) input strength; and (3) both 1 and 2. A potential explanation may be that activity during a CP is not compensated for; rather it is used to encode homeostatic set points to which the mature nervous system will continually attempt to return. Set points are defined as ‘ranges of activity’ associated with normal circuit function, so that activity outside of the set point may induce abnormal behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Styr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Truszkowski and Aizenman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tien and Kerschensteiner, 2018</xref>). Inappropriate E:I balance during the CP may establish a non-physiologically relevant set point which then serves as the basis for homeostasis once the CP is closed. If CPs capture, rather than compensate for activity to establish set points, it is logical that the strength of premotor inputs increases in accordance with the hyperexcitability induced by exposure to PTX during the CP. It may also explain how the otherwise lifelong hyperexcitation caused by the <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> mutation can be rescued by inhibiting neural activity during the short 2 hr CP window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giachello and Baines, 2015</xref>). Alternatively, whilst the increased inhibition we observe is not statistically significant (p=0.15), it is close and has a medium effect size (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.78), and thus may be indicative of an attempt by the locomotor network to rebalance activity back towards a genetically predetermined level. In this regard, it may just not have sufficient range to be able to counter the increase in excitation due to CP manipulation.</p><p>How neurons measure levels of activity during the CP remains under active investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carreira-Rosario et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giachello et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coulson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peters and Naneix, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibel-Russo et al., 2022</xref>). The second messenger calcium is likely to be involved as calcium signalling is central to activity-regulated plasticity during nervous system development, including adjustment to changing internal and external environments, as well as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spitzer, 2012</xref>). Similarly, we expect reactive oxygen species to have an important role. Reactive oxygen species have been identified as obligate signals required for activity-regulated synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sobrido-Cameán et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oswald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doser and Hoerndli, 2021</xref>). At the same time, dysregulation in reactive oxygen species levels or buffering has been identified as one of the earliest indicators in human CP-associated neurodevelopmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steullet et al., 2017</xref>). There are numerous intersections between calcium and reactive oxygen species signalling. For example, mitochondria are well-known regulators as well as sensors of intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>) and a recent study has explored how in neurons activity-dependent changes in mitochondrial calcium regulate changes in metabolism, which invariably link to changes in the rate of reactive oxygen species generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Díaz-García et al., 2021</xref>). We had previously shown that nitric oxide plays an important role during the CP of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, potentially as an activity-regulated signal that mediates adjustment within an interconnected network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giachello et al., 2021</xref>). Nitric oxide might also intersect with calcium signalling as a modifier of CamKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2020</xref>). It will be interesting to explore both calcium and reactive oxygen species signalling further in the context of neuronal plasticity and CPs.</p><p>Our observations of lasting change to synaptic physiology provides further evidence to support the hypothesis that physiologically balanced E:I during a CP is key to normal network function. Similarly, our results that show that a ch neuron inhibitory ‘brake’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carreira-Rosario et al., 2021</xref>) provides a dose-dependent rescue of excessive excitation caused by PTX or the <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> mutation are consistent with a CP integrating activity to which it is exposed. It is notable that 80 dB-induced ch activity rescued both the PTX and <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> seizure phenotype completely. The simplest explanation for this is that 80 dB inhibition matches the strength of both types of increased excitation so they cancel each other out. That is to say, the degree of hyperexcitation caused by PTX and <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> are similar. However, this may be an overly simplistic assumption and instead ch neuron activity may achieve rescue via alternate means including, but not limited to, an influence on activity-dependent CPG wave frequency during the CP.</p><p>Ch neurons have been implicated in establishing CPG rhythm via connections to premotor and pacemaker neurons A27h and M, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>). This rhythm-setting function may be related to relaying early muscle activity and coordinating it with the output of the CNS. Muscles produce myogenic activity and twitch early in development, beginning around 15 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crisp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crisp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baines and Bate, 1998</xref>). Given that this is just before the locomotor circuit CP (17–19 hr AEL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giachello and Baines, 2015</xref>), it is possible that the development of coordinated activity in the locomotor circuit depends on a succession of set points established in muscles, then peripheral neurons (e.g. ch neurons), central neurons (A18a, A31k, M, and A27h neurons), and motor neurons (aCC). Finally, despite the ch brake being inhibitory in the sense that it slows the CPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carreira-Rosario et al., 2021</xref>) and counteracts the excessive excitation provided by PTX or <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic>, electrophysiological recording from aCC shows that stimulating ch neurons (by optogenetics) is sufficient to depolarise aCC (IH &amp; RAB, unpublished data). The idea that a depolarising input can inhibit activity in the locomotor circuit is likely explained by the contribution ch neurons make to the CPG rhythm. CPG activity causes regular significant depolarisation of aCC in the form of spontaneous rhythmic currents (SRCs). SRCs may be followed by refractory periods that prevent further (i.e. greater) activity occurring in the network. This could be explored in future work.</p><p>The rescue of increased seizure in <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic> reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giachello and Baines, 2015</xref>) was achieved using a different modality to inhibit neurons (optogenetics) than we have used here (vibration). The latter is more physiological; it is known that mechanoreceptors provide activity that contributes to normal development of locomotor circuits/CPGs in flies and other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carreira-Rosario et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, our validation experiment showed that activating proprioceptors during just the CP, in the absence of PTX, is sufficient to induce a seizure phenotype.</p><p>Vibration represents one of a growing list of approaches that show that manipulating neural activity during development can cause permanent change to network function. Other methods for manipulating activity include endogenous mutations (e.g. <italic>para<sup>bss</sup></italic>), exposure to drugs (PTX or phenytoin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giachello and Baines, 2015</xref>), genetically targeted expression of tetanus toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carreira-Rosario et al., 2021</xref>), temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiral et al., 2021</xref>), and light (via optogenetics) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giachello and Baines, 2015</xref>). Some (e.g. temperature and vibration) may be encountered by animals developing in the wild and can be excitatory or inhibitory (e.g. altered temperature can increase or decrease neural activity during development). Thus, our work, in combination with that conducted by others, suggests that CPs may ‘measure’ neural activity which is influenced by various environmental and internal factors. This measurement is used to set key network parameters according to the context in which the circuit functions. In support of this, a recent study reports that synaptic number in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult eye scales inversely with developmental temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiral et al., 2021</xref>). Behavioural analysis indicates that this phenomenon ensures that adult movement is highly dependent on, and optimised for, developmental temperature.</p><p>In conclusion, our work provides novel insight into how activity manipulation, during a defined CP, results in mature network change. Specifically, we show a clear and lasting change to network E:I balance that leaves the locomotor network prone to seizure following a sufficiently large stimulus and relate this to cellular and synaptic-level changes in the circuit. The changes we observed may reflect a network that has encoded a non-physiological set point that, though capable of supporting normal locomotion, is not sufficient to guard against the effects of strong stimulation. Finally, we show that changes induced by excessive excitation can be compensated by inhibition provided by mechanosensory neurons in a dose-dependent manner. This supports the view that a CP acts to tune a developing network based on the influences on activity to which it is exposed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>para<sup>bss1</sup>(bss</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Laboratory stocks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Na<sub>v</sub> channel hypermorph</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>GMR94G06-Gal4</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Juan J.

Once animals had recovered and normal crawling had resumed, a handheld stimulator composed of two tungsten wires fixed to a nonconducting rod (tips of the two wires [0.1 mm diameter] were set 1–2 mm apart) was positioned and very gently pressed into the larval cuticle, perpendicular to and over the approximate position of the CNS. A direct current pulse (10 V, 1 s) generated by a DS2A Mk.II stimulator (Digitimer Ltd, UK) was delivered via the probe to the animals, which usually responded with a sustained contraction and subsequent immobility representing seizure-like behaviour. The time to resumption of normal behaviour (regular, whole-body peristaltic waves that produce forward locomotion) was recorded and defined as duration of recovery from seizure. Strong peripheral stimulation likely causes excessive and synchronous synaptic excitation within the CNS, resulting in seizure.

Premotor synaptic drive was elicited by optogenetic stimulation of interneurons using green light (565 nm OptoLED, Cairn Instruments) controlled by a Clampex (version 10.7) protocol comprised of three sweeps (repetitions) of 1 s LED off, 1 s on, 1 s off, for each preparation. Change in frequency (ΔAP Freq. [Hz]) was calculated as the difference in number of APs firing before and during optogenetic stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>GCaMP imaging</title><p>Imaging was performed on aCC motor neurons in w; UAS-GCamP7f x w;;GMR94GO-Gal4 male and female L3 derived from gravid females fed PTX, or vehicle control (see section ‘Manipulation of activity during development’). Larvae were dissected in a dish in external saline (see section ‘Electrophysiology’) to remove the CNS. The isolated CNS preparation was then transferred to a droplet of saline, within which it was laid flat (dorsal side up) on a Sylgard-coated cover slip on a slide. The slide was positioned under a microscope (model BX51WI, Olympus) with a Hamamatsu ORCA-flash 4.0C114440 digital camera, and the CNS viewed using a ×20 water immersion lens. Blue light (a 470 nm OptoLED, Cairn Instruments) was used to excite GCaMP, and fluorescence was recorded for 180 s at a 10 Hz imaging rate using Winflour v4.1.3 (University of Strathclyde). During analysis, ROIs were placed on aCC axons, on the same side of the VNC, from A6-A4, and exported into Clampex (10.7). Traces were smoothed (add type and amount), with forward wave propagation being measured between adjacent ipsilateral ROIs. Time lag was measured as the mean duration between events (peak amplitudes), between segments A6-A5 and A5-A4. Means were calculated from up to five individual measures of time lag.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>PTX feeding protocol</title><p>PTX (Merck, NJ) was prepared to 25 mg/ml in 100% ethanol, then 40 ul of this stock diluted 50-fold by adding to 1960 ul ddH<sub>2</sub>O then mixed with 8 g of yeast extract powder (Melford), while for controls the equivalent amount of EtOH only was used. Canton-S virgin females were crossed to RN2-FLP LexA-tdTom Drep2::YPet males (see above for complete genotype) and left to mate in vials at 25°C for 24 hr. Mated flies were distributed to two laying pots with apple juice agar plates, with an excess (~0.5 g) of either PTX or control yeast extract paste. Laying pots were kept at 25°C, and yeast plates changed and discarded daily for 3 d to ensure sufficient time for drug exposure. Thereafter, newly hatched larvae aged to within 1 hr of one another were picked from laying plates and transferred to new apple juice agar plates with an excess of normal yeast paste (dried baker’s yeast and ddH<sub>2</sub>O), and allowed to develop at 25°C for 72 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Imaging</title><p>At 72 hr after larval hatching (ALH), larvae of the correct genotype were chosen by selection against the Dfd-GMR-YFP balancer. Larval nerve cords were dissected at room temperature in Sorensen’s saline, adhered to a poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine (Merck)-coated coverglass, and imaged ‘live’ within a drop of Sorensen’s saline on a Leica Stellaris 5 upright confocal microscope with a Leica 506148 HC APO L 63×/0.9 W U-V-I Water Immersion objective. The following imaging settings were used: format 800 × 800, 16 bit, scan speed 400 Hz, bidirectional scanning, pinhole 1 Airy Unit, z step size 0.3 um, sequential frame scanning. For Drep2::YFP detection: excitation 514 nm at 1.5% power, gain 20, emission collection window 520–540 nm, frame accumulation 3. For myr::tdTom detection: excitation 561 nm at 2% power, gain 15, emission collection window 570–700 nm, line accumulation 4. Inbuilt Leica LIGHTNING deconvolution software was used with default settings optimised for water immersion. Following acquisition of the ‘live’ image, nerve cords were fixed for 15 min at room temperature in 2% PFA in Sorensen’s saline, washed 3× in Sorensen’s saline, blocked for 1 hr at 4°C in blocking solution (1× Sorensen’s saline, 0.3% Triton-X-100, 0.25% BSA), and then incubated for 15 hr at 4°C with FluoTag-X4 anti-RFP STAR635P and FluoTag-X4 anti-GFP ATTO488 (NanoTag Biotechnologies), both diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. Stained samples were then washed 3× in Sorensen’s saline at 4°C for &gt;1 hr before imaging again. Imaging settings for nanobody-stained samples were the same as for live samples, with the following specific differences: format 1024 × 1024, z step size 0.25 um. For Drep2::YFP&gt;anti-GFP ATTO488 detection: excitation 488 nm at 1.5% power, gain 2.5, emission collection window 498–580 nm, line averaging 3, line accumulation 3. For myr::tdTom&gt;anti-RFP STAR635P detection: excitation 638 nm at 2% power, gain 15, emission collection window 648–830 nm, line averaging 3, line accumulation 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Imaris v10.0 software (Bitplane) was used for image analysis. Dendrites were reconstructed from the myr::tdTom channel of ‘live images’ as dendrite morphology is clearer pre-fixation. The Imaris filaments module was used for dendrite reconstruction using the tree autopath algorithm, with the starting points threshold set to include just one starting point on the cell body. Seed points for segments multiscale points were set to a thinnest diameter of 0.01 um and largest diameter of 3 um. Iterative rounds of user-informed AI training were used for seed point classification until all seed points correctly coincided with dendrites, followed by iterative rounds of AI training for segment classification. A tree-build maximum gap length of 5 um was used. Drep2::YPet marking postsynaptic sites was detected from the fixed and nanobody-stained images since Drep2::YPet&gt;anti-GFP ATTO488 showed good photostability through the z-stack compared with ‘live’ YPet protein, which suffered substantial photobleaching through the course of acquiring a ‘live’ image stack. The Imaris spots module was used for Drep2::YPet spot detection using an estimated xy diameter of 0.1 um and z diameter of 0.5 um. The spot quality threshold was informed by the frequency histogram and set to the trough point, at which any further decrease in threshold results in a sharp increase in spot number, corresponding to false-positive spots detected outside the cell from low-level background. In this way, all Drep2::YPet puncta of different sizes were detected, while avoiding false positives from low-level background.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were imported into and organised in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, WA), and GCaMP imaging activity peaks were smoothed and quantified in ClampFit before being copied into GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software) for statistical analysis. Normality was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test, with further analysis conducted according to the nature of the distribution. Specifically, differences between two groups of normally distributed data for crawling velocity, recovery time from electroshock, change in aCC evoked AP firing frequency in response to premotor interneuron stimulation and mini amplitude or frequency, were analysed by Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests and are shown as mean ± SEM. Normally distributed data compared across three groups (e.g. all experiments that showed rescue of activity imbalance by ch stimulation, besides synchronicity [see below]) was analysed using one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons. Data for rescue of synchronicity following exposure to PTX by ch stimulation were not normally distributed, so were analysed using one-way ANOVA with Kruskal–Wallis multiple comparisons test. p-Values&lt;0.05 are considered significant, and levels of significance are represented by *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.01.</p><p>Effect size (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) for change in aCC-evoked AP firing frequency in response to premotor interneuron stimulation was calculated manually using the formula: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>`</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> , where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> = mean aCC AP firing frequency before activation of premotor neuron; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> = mean aCC AP firing frequency during activation of premotor neuron; and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt/></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> .</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Because this work uses Drosophila, there are no ethical concerns to report.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-91599-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Figures depicting behavioural experiments show all data points including calculated means ± sems.

manipulation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic model system to pinpoint the neural substrate that is influenced by altered activity during a critical period (CP) of larval locomotor circuit development.

Have the authors already demonstrated that exposure to picrotoxin at L1 or L2 (and even early L3 if experimentally possible) does not lead to changes in induced seizure at L3? This would further the authors' hypothesis of the uniqueness of the 17-19h AEL period. If this has already been established in prior publications, then this needs to be further explained. I do note in Gaicehllo and Baines (2015) that Fig 2E shows the identification of the 17-19h window.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a pertinent comment. We now have evidence that activity manipulation (in this instance by increasing temperature, which recapitulates the effect of PTX) is not effective at larval stages (L1 to L3) but remains effective between 17-19hrs AEL. This observation forms part of a separate study where we explore the role of circadian activity on embryonic and larval neuronal development. We include a brief statement to address this comment in the revision (first paragraph of Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Regarding experiments in Fig 2, authors only report changes in AP firing frequency. Can the authors also report other metrics of excitability, including measures of intrinsic excitability with and without picrotoxin exposure (including RMP, Rm)? Was a different amount of current injection needed to evoke stable 5-10 Hz firing with and without picrotoxin? In the representative figure (Fig. 2A), it appears that the baseline firing frequencies are different prior to optogenetic stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>No differences in RM, Rin or capacitance were observed due to PTX. This is now included in the revision along with an explanation that different levels of current injection were used to measure effects to excitatory vs inhibitory synaptic drive. We did not specifically monitor the amount of current required to maintain stable firing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The ch-related experiments require further controls and explanation. Regarding experiments in Fig 6, what is the effect of ch neuron stimulation alone on time lag and AP frequency? Can the authors further clarify what is known about connections between aCC and ch neurons? It is difficult for this reviewer to conceptualize how enhancing ch-mediated inhibition would worsen seizures. While the cited study (Carreira-Rosario et al 2021) convincingly shows that inhibition of mechanosensory input leads to excessive spontaneous network activity, has it been shown that the converse - stimulation of ch neurons - indeed enhances network inhibition?</p><p>• The interpretation of ch-related experiments is further complicated by the explanation in the Discussion that ch neuron stimulation depolarizes aCC neurons; this seems to undercut the authors' previous explanation that the increased E:I ratio is corrected by enhanced inhibition from ch neurons. The idea that ch neurons are placing neurons in a depolarized refractory state is not substantiated by data in the paper or citations.</p></disp-quote><p>To respond to these two points combined: The reviewer is correct in stating that additional experiments will be required to fully understand mechanism. We believe that cholinergic (excitatory) chordotonal input to aCC may be an important component for setting the rhythm of the locomotor CPG. Indeed, it may be that CPG rhythm is a key factor during the CP. Our observations suggest optogenetic stimulation of Ch neurons alone is sufficient to induce large, ~400-, currents that resemble endogenous spontaneous rhythmic currents (SRCs) associated with CPG activity. SRCs occur with a characteristic frequency of ~1Hz, and we have some unpublished data that suggests it is possible to change this frequency using ch stimulation. This data therefore unifies prior work (Carreira-Rosario et al., 2021 description of a brake) with our own (observation that ch depolarize aCC). However, we do not include this speculation in the Discussion because the experiments we have conducted were pilots. They may be expanded upon and included in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In the Discussion, the authors suggest that enhanced proprioception leading to seizures is reminiscent of neurological conditions. This seems to be an oversimplification. Connecting abnormal proprioception to seizures is quite different from connecting abnormal proprioception to disorders of coordination. This should be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>Because this is peripheral to our main study, we have deleted this from the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Although the authors have to be commended for the scrutiny with which they pinpoint a site of circuit change, it cannot be excluded that other parts of the circuit also undergo adjustments in response to activity manipulation during the CP, e.g. the membrane properties of the interneurons. This is not a problem but should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and have added the following text to the discussion……’However, we recognise that other parts of the locomotor network may also undergo change due to CP manipulation. The advantage of this system is that most of these elements are now open to specific manipulation through cell-specific genetic drivers’. (Discussion paragraph 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is surprising that there is no discussion of the potential molecular cause for the observed increases in postsynaptic responses to SV release from cholinergic neurons. Given that there are no differences in postsynaptic structure, puncta number etc., the subunit composition of the nAChR seems an obvious guess. What is known about the nAChRs subunit composition on aCC, and when during development do the receptors/different subunits become expressed? A paragraph in the discussion on this issue would be highly relevant to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Our own work (unpublished) together with a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627323005810?via%3Dihub#mmc2">recent paper</ext-link> from the Littleton lab suggests that aCC expresses the majority, if not all, of the 7 alpha and 3 beta subunits that compromise nAChRs. The situation is further complicated by the fact that these receptors are pentameric and are composed of various subunits – the composition significantly altering channel kinetics. Less is known about expression timelines for each receptor subunit, and certainly not in aCC. We already include the following sentence in the results text……’ A change in the frequency of mini excitatory postsynaptic potentials (mEPSPs, a.k.a. minis) would suggest the adaptation is primarily presynaptic (e.g. increased probability of release), whilst a change in distribution and/or amplitude of minis is more consistent with a mechanism acting postsynaptically (e.g. increased or altered receptor subunits).’ Given that we know next to nothing about the nAChR subunit composition in aCC and how this might change due to CP manipulation, we feel it better not to speculate further. To help the reader, we include the following sentence in the discussion……’The precise mechanism contributing to increased mini amplitude remains to be determined, but a plausible scenario may involve change in cholinergic subunit composition.’ (Discussion paragraph 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would be important to provide the p-values for Figures 1B and C, especially because it seems that the inhibition also becomes stronger upon PTX treatment during the CP. There is no statistical testing mentioned, was no test done or was it not significant? It is agreed that the effect size is clearly stronger for the increased excitation than for the increased inhibition, but looking at the data suggests that the effect on excitation is not much more significant than the effect on inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is referring to Fig 2B&amp;C. P values have been added to both main text and to the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Associated with the point above, in the discussion line 407 and below the authors come back to this point and reason that it is surprising that increased excitation is not compensated for by homeostatic mechanisms. It is concluded that homeostatic compensation brings the system back to a setpoint that is defined during the critical period, but the setpoint is set higher in this case. However, an alternative explanation is that GABA administration during the critical period causes the excitation set point to be too high, but this is then partially counteracted in a homeostatic manner by increasing inhibition. If the p-values in Figures 2B and C are rather similar, this might even be the favorable interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer means ‘PTX administration’ and not GABA. This is an interesting idea and one we had not really considered. We address this comment by adding the following text………. ‘Alternatively, whilst the increased inhibition we observe is not statistically significant (p = 0.15), it is close and has a medium effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.78), and thus may be indicative of an attempt by the locomotor network to rebalance activity back towards a genetically pre-determined level. In this regard, it may just not have sufficient range to be able to counter the increase in excitation due to CP manipulation.’ (Discussion paragraph 5)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. To asses the magnitudes of A18a-mediated excitation and A31k-mediated inhibition to aCC, changes in aCC firing frequency were measured. For this aCC was injected with current to fire at all. However, the current injections were chosen to cause firing at 5-10 Hz. During a crawling burst, aCC fires well above 100Hz (Kadas et al., 2017). Are the effects also visible at such firing frequencies, or at least across different firing frequencies? I am not asking for additional experiments, but maybe the data are there and can be referred to?</p></disp-quote><p>Spiking in aCC occurs as burst firing, evoked by cholinergic synaptic drive, that lasts for ~300ms and achieving firing frequencies of between 50-100Hz (Kadas et al., 2017 and our own unpublished data). We did not test for effects to excitation or inhibition at these higher frequencies. We now make this explicit in the discussion by adding the following sentence……’The firing frequencies that we imposed (1-10Hz) are also lower than seen during fictive locomotion (Kadas et al., 2017), which shows burst firing lasting for ~300 ms and achieving spike frequencies of up to 100Hz.’ (Discussion paragraph 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 3B some minis are demarked by green arrows and others are not. Were the non-marked ones not included in the analysis, and what were the criteria to mark some and others not? This is particularly important because the cumulative distribution of minis is analyzed in Figure 3D, and this depends crucially on what qualifies as mini and what does not.</p></disp-quote><p>All mini’s are marked by green arrows. The events not marked are not mini’s. <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons are small and have an unfavourable dendritic structure for recording minis. Thus, we carefully analyse traces by eye taking only events that show very rapid rise times and slower, exponential decay (the typical mini shape). There are, however, other events which are most likely single/multiple channel openings, which due to filtering are rounded. We now include this same trace, greatly expanded, as Fig S1D to show how we identified minis from non-minis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The asynchronous release experiment under Sr2+ seems an elegant way to analyze minis upon optogenetic stimulation of an identified presynaptic cholinergic neuron. I suggest being a little more conservative with the term asynchronous release (or replacing it), which is usually the release of many single vesicles that follow AP-mediated synaptic transmission and has nicely been demonstrated at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ (Besse et al., 2007). Also, please show the trace in Figure S2A under Sr2+ at a higher pA magnification, it is really hard to see the minis there.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adopted a previously published technique that, in our view, correctly uses the term ‘asynchronous release’. This is not to say that all asynchronous release occurs via the same mechanism. Indeed, the papers that report the technique we use predate Besse 2007. We also expand the trace in Fig S1A (not S2A as wrongly indicated).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Can the authors explain what they think is the parameter of &quot;activity&quot; being measured in the locomotor circuit (mainly aCC) during the CP? Is the aCC neuron simply summing (perhaps through a proxy like Ca2+) total excitation/inhibition over time during the CP?</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1 also requests that we discuss how activity is ‘measured’ and thus we now include a dedicated paragraph in the discussion to address this concern. Whether aCC sums ‘average’ activity or perhaps is influenced by activity extremes remains uncertain. Our data is consistent with the former but further work is required to validate our conclusion. This work will be published in due course.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to understanding this concept, could the authors' silence activity (using Kir2.1, TNT, or BoNT) from each of the monosynaptic premotor inputs in otherwise wildtype and following PTX exposure to determine how the circuit responds when each of the monosynaptic inputs are silenced? This might inform the role they play in instructing how activity is measured over time during the CP.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion and, indeed, we have planned such experiments. Silencing specific neurons, whilst manipulating the CP, may well result in more significant network instability due to the setting of multiple (and physiologically inappropriate) homeostatic set points. Such studies go beyond the scope of the present study and thus we prefer not to speculate at this early stage, but to wait for experimental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related note, the authors focus on just 2 premotor inputs, presumably due to the availability of specific drivers. But do the authors know how many other inputs (other ACh, Gaba, and glutamate) onto aCC there are, and to what extent do the authors think these are changed in similar or distinct ways? Is it implied that all neurons are similarly altered by the manipulations?</p></disp-quote><p>The connectome details the number and types of neurons that directly contact the aCC motoneuron (Zarin et al., 2019). In terms of cholinergic excitors, the results present in Figure 3 suggest that most (all?) inputs are strengthened following embryonic PTX exposure. However, to conclude this would be highly speculative and thus we refrain from doing so in the manuscript. As other single-neuron driver lines become available, such expts will hopefully be possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. If PTX treatment does indeed increase CPG synchronicity, shouldn't there be a readout of this effect on larval locomotion? While the speed of locomotion wasn't significantly impacted, perhaps another parameter was altered.</p></disp-quote><p>It is quite possible that other aspects of locomotion are being altered (turning, rearing, etc), but we have not analysed for these more subtle behaviours. Indeed, although not statistically significant, there is a modest reduction in average velocity in larvae derived from PTX-exposed embryos. We see similar reductions in characterised seizure mutants which also show increased synchronicity (Streit et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 2 and elsewhere, what is the baseline level of AP firing rate in each aCC neuron, before optogenetic stimulation? Is this informative about how PTX exposure alters excitability to begin with, perhaps by changing intrinsic excitability.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include this data in the relevant results section. Interestingly, following exposure to PTX, basal firing was significantly increased in A18a (excitatory premotor) but not in A31k (inhibitory premotor). This reflects our experiment in which we conclude that excitatory drive to aCC is increased relative to inhibitory synaptic drive. Thus, this measure seemingly validates our conclusion that E:I balance has been altered following activity-manipulation during the CP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3: The apparent increase in mini amplitude is very small (4.1 vs 4.5 pA); is this physiologically meaningful? Although the authors say the decrease in mini freq is not significant in Fig. 3B after PTX, it does appear rather large, a 40% reduction (5 vs 3 Hz).</p></disp-quote><p>We must be guided by statistics in drawing conclusions, but the reader can interpret our data as they wish. Minis measure quantal release and thus to appreciate how small change can, when combined over the many receptors present, influence cell physiology, one needs to compare spiking activity. We show in Fig 2 that such change is sufficient to increase the excitatory synaptic drive provided by the A18a neuron. The seemingly larger reduction in mini frequency is intriguing and may reflect additional change, but without further experiments we cannot draw firm conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The clever vibration assay is a good one to induce the activation of mechanosensory neurons, but the specificity of the changes induced by this is difficult to ascertain. One possibility would be to silence the output of the ch neurons (by expression to tetanus or botulinum toxin) and still put the larvae through the same vibration during the CP to see if the rescue is lost.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further experiments are required to fully understand underlying mechanism(s). However, we will not be able to complete such follow-on expts in a timely manner and thus, these must wait and form the basis of future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>1. Typos - there are numerous areas where it seems a comma is used inappropriately (e.g. lines 28, 69, 77, 104, 348, 365, etc).

It would be of benefit to show the genotypes of the larvae in the various experimental manipulations in the relevant figure legends. This reviewer could not follow exactly how each experiment was done as it was not always clear which driver was being used to express which transgene in what genetic background.</p></disp-quote><p>Done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>• Please provide sample videos of electroshock-induced seizures (e.g. Fig 1B). Is it clear that the period of immobility after electroshock is a seizure (perhaps defined as hyperactivity originating from the brain)? I acknowledge the Baines group is quite skilled in this technique and perhaps there is a straightforward answer or citation to include.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer the reader to Marley and Baines 2011 which contains videos of seizure activity (first paragraph of Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Seizures are generated in the brain and travel to the periphery. Do the authors think it is possible that the peripheral manipulations in this manuscript might be controlling the behavioral readout of seizures without affecting hypersynchronous activity in the brain?</p></disp-quote><p>We include the following statement (in methods) to provide our best understanding for how peripheral electroshock induces seizure………. ‘Strong peripheral stimulation likely causes excessive and synchronous synaptic excitation within the CNS resulting in seizure. However, the precise mechanism of this effect remains to be determined.’ Moreover, we feel it unlikely that manipulation of Ch neurons, by vibration, would suppress the effects we observe via peripheral mechanisms. Indeed, the Ch manipulation is limited to the embryonic CP, whilst our seizure assays are recorded many days later at L3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• How might enhancement of inhibition lead to worsened seizures? Is the enhancement of ch-related inhibition selectively affecting inhibitory circuits, thereby leading to a net increase in excitation?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a difficult point to respond to at present. Enhanced inhibition per se might similarly disturb the encoding of an appropriate homeostatic setpoint(s) thus leaving a network open to being destabilized by a strong stimulus. Indeed, we have previously shown that increased inhibition during the CP results in the same effect (seizure) as increasing excitation (Giachello and Baines, 2015). Thus, presuming activation of Ch neurons during the CP translates to increased inhibition, then worsened seizure behaviour is a predictable effect. How this is achieved remains unknown and we prefer not to speculate here.</p></body></sub-article></article>
