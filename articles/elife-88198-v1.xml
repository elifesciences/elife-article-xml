and accordingly REM and SWS are thought to achieve a different set of functions. The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is increasingly being used as a model to understand sleep functions, although it remains unclear if the fly brain also engages in different kinds of sleep as well. Here, we compare two commonly used approaches for studying sleep experimentally in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: optogenetic activation of sleep-promoting neurons and provision of a sleep-promoting drug, gaboxadol. We find that these different sleep-induction methods have similar effects on increasing sleep duration, but divergent effects on brain activity. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that drug-induced deep sleep (‘quiet’ sleep) mostly downregulates metabolism genes, whereas optogenetic ‘active’ sleep upregulates a wide range of genes relevant to normal waking functions. This suggests that optogenetics and pharmacological induction of sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> promote different features of sleep, which engage different sets of genes to achieve their respective functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>gaboxadol</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>RNA seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1164879</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Swinderen</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1NS076980</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Paul J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Different methods for inducing sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies may be promoting distinct sleep stages with different functions when brain activity and gene expression are compared.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is increasing evidence that sleep is a complex phenomenon in most animals, comprising of distinct stages that are characterized by dramatically different physiological processes and brain activity signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaggard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van De Poll and van Swinderen, 2021</xref>). This suggests that different sleep stages, such as rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS) in humans and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dijk et al., 1990</xref>), are accomplishing distinct functions that are nevertheless collectively important for adaptive behavior and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>). While REM and SWS appear to be restricted to a subset of vertebrates (e.g., mammals, birds, and possibly some reptiles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siegel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shein-Idelson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rattenborg et al., 2019</xref>), a broader range of animals, including invertebrates, demonstrate evidence of ‘active’ vs. ‘quiet’ sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaggard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van De Poll and van Swinderen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Libourel and Herrel, 2016</xref>). Whether active and quiet sleep represent evolutionary antecedents of REM and SWS, respectively, remains speculative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaggard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van De Poll and van Swinderen, 2021</xref>). However, during active sleep, although animals are less responsive, brain recordings reveal a level of neural activity that is similar to wakefulness, in contrast to quiet sleep, which is characterized by significantly decreased neural activity in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yap et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>) as well as certain fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leung et al., 2019</xref>), mollusks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iglesias et al., 2019</xref>), and reptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shein-Idelson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although it is likely that even insects such as fruit flies and honeybees sleep in distinct stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sauer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>), sleep studies using the genetic model <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> still mostly measure sleep as a single phenomenon, defined by 5 min (or more) of inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>). As sleep studies increasingly employ <italic>Drosophila</italic> to investigate molecular and cellular processes underpinning potential sleep functions, this simplified approach to measuring sleep in flies carries the risk of overlooking different functions accomplished by distinct kinds of sleep. Sleep physiology and functions are increasingly being addressed in the fly model by imposing experimentally controlled sleep regimes, either pharmacologically or via transient control of sleep-promoting circuits by using opto- or thermogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shafer and Keene, 2021</xref>). Yet, there is little knowledge available on whether these different approaches are producing qualitatively similar sleep. For example, sleep can be induced genetically in flies by activating sleep-promoting neurons in the central complex (CX) – a part of the insect brain that has been found to be involved in multimodal sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>). In particular, the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) of the CX has been proposed to serve as a discharge circuit for the insect’s sleep homeostat, whereby increased sleep pressure (e.g., due to extended wakefulness) alters the physiological properties of dFB neurons, causing them to fire more readily and thereby promote decreased behavioral responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Troup et al., 2018</xref>) and thus sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donlea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donlea et al., 2018</xref>). Crucially, activation of sleep-promoting circuits including the dFB has been shown to be sleep-restorative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dissel et al., 2015</xref>), but confusingly, brain recordings during optogenetically induced sleep, via electrophysiology, as well as whole-brain calcium imaging techniques, reveal wake-like levels of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yap et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that some approaches to optogenetically induced sleep might be promoting a form of sleep akin to the ‘active’ sleep stage detected during spontaneous sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yap et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>An alternate way to induce sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is by feeding flies drugs that have been designed to treat insomnia in humans, such as the GABA-agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahyrdoisoxazolopyridin-3-ol (THIP), also known as gaboxadol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrison, 2007</xref>). Several studies have shown that THIP-induced sleep in flies is also restorative and achieves key functions ranging from memory consolidation to cellular repair and waste clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dissel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stanhope et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>). This pharmacological approach centered on GABA function has a solid foundation based on better-understood sleep processes: in mammals, many sleep-inducing drugs also target GABA receptors, and this class of drugs tends to promote SWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lundahl et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, there are no obvious drugs that promote REM sleep, although local infusion of cholinergic agonists (e.g., carbachol) to the brainstem has been shown to induce REM-like states in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mitler and Dement, 1974</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we compare THIP-induced sleep with optogenetically induced sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using behavior, brain activity, and transcriptomics. To ensure the validity of our comparisons, we performed all of our experiments in the same genetic background, employing a canonical Gal4 strain that expresses a transgenic cation channel in a sleep-promoting circuit: R23E10-Gal4&gt;UAS-Chrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). When these flies are fed all-trans-retinal (ATR) and then exposed to red light, they are put to sleep optogenetically. When these flies are instead fed THIP, they are put to sleep pharmacologically. By using the same genetic background, we were thus able to contrast the effects of either kind of sleep at the level of behavior, brain activity, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We questioned how similar either form of induced sleep was.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study rationale and design.</title><p>The same genetic background strain (R23E10;UAS-Chrimson) was used for optogenetic or pharmacologically induced sleep. Flies were fed either all-trans retinal (ATR) or 4,5,6,7-tetrahyrdoisoxazolopyridin-3-ol (THIP) to promote either kind of sleep, which was assessed in three different ways: behavioral analysis, whole brain imaging, and gene expression changes. The comparisons made for each level of analysis are labeled A–E.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88198-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prolonged optogenetic- and THIP-induced sleep have near-identical effects on sleep duration</title><p>We first compared pharmacological and optogenetic sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) by using the traditional behavioral metrics employed by most <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep researchers: &gt;5 min inactivity for flies confined in small glass tubes over multiple days and nights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>). We found that optogenetic- and THIP-induced sleep yielded almost identical effects on sleep duration, with both significantly increasing total sleep duration for both the day and night, when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). An increase in total sleep duration can be due to either an increase in the number of sleep bouts that are occurring (reflective of more fragmented sleep) or an increase in the average duration of individual sleep bouts, which indicates a more consolidated sleep structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zimmerman et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andretic and Shaw, 2005</xref>). To investigate whether both sleep induction methods also had similar effects on sleep architecture, we plotted bout number as a function of bout duration for optogenetic- and THIP-induced sleep for the day and night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirszenblat et al., 2019</xref>). We found that both optogenetic activation and THIP provision produce a similar increase in sleep consolidation during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). During the night, induced sleep effects were also similar, although less clearly different to the spontaneous sleep seen in control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Interestingly, red light exposure decreased average night bout duration in non-ATR control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>), suggesting a light-induced artifact at night. For THIP, we observed an increase in both bout number and duration during the day, and an increase in bout duration during the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Taken together, these results show that prolonged optogenetic activation and THIP provision have similar behavioral effects on induced sleep duration in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, although some differences in night bout architecture were noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Without any further investigations, this might suggest that both sleep induction methods represent similar underlying processes that uniformly increase sleep in flies.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic- and 4,5,6,7-tetrahyrdoisoxazolopyridin-3-ol (THIP)-induced sleep have similar effects on sleep duration and consolidation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental regime for observing the effects of optogenetic activation and THIP provision (<bold>B</bold>).

In a previous study employing whole-brain calcium imaging in tethered flies, we showed that optogenetic activation of the R23E10 circuit promotes wake-like sleep, with neither neural activity levels nor connectivity metrics changing significantly even after 15 min of optogenetically induced sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore utilized the same fly strain as in that study (R23E10-Gal4&gt;UAS-Chrimson88-tdTomato;Nsyb-LexA&gt;LexOp-nlsGCaMP6f) to examine the effect of THIP-induced sleep on brain activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Since we were interested in comparing acute sleep induction effects on brain activity (as opposed to prolonged sleep induction effects on behavior, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), we adapted our calcium imaging approach to allow a brief perfusion of THIP directly onto the exposed fly brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods’). As done previously for examining optogenetically induced sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>), we examined calcium transients in neural soma scanning across 18 optical slices of the central fly brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left) and identified regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to neuronal soma in this volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right, see ‘Materials and methods’). As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>), optogenetically activating the R23E10 circuit renders flies asleep (albeit twitchy at times) without changing the average level of neural activity measured this way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We have previously shown that even 15 min of R23E10 activation fails to produce a ‘quiet’ sleep stage that is evident after 5 min in spontaneously sleeping flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that this manipulation promotes ongoing active sleep until the red light is turned off – although this has not been investigated for longer epochs, for example, the chronic activation experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. To determine the effect of THIP on neural activity in the exact same strain, we transiently perfused onto the fly brain the minimal THIP dosage required to reliably promote sleep in flies within 5 min (0.2 mg/ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yap et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to optogenetic-induced sleep, we observed overall decreased neural activity coincident with the flies falling asleep, and flies remained asleep well after the drug was washed out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To ensure that we were actually putting flies (reversibly) to sleep in this preparation, we probed for behavioral responsiveness by puffing air onto the fly once every minute (50 ms duration, 10 psi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since the time when flies fell asleep following 5 min of THIP perfusion could be variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yap et al., 2017</xref>), arousal probing during sleep was only initiated after 5 min of complete quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, behavioral responsiveness testing). We observed decreased arousability for flies that had been induced to sleep via THIP perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Drug-induced sleep was, however, reversible, with flies returning to baseline levels of behavioral responsiveness to the air puffs ~20–30 min after sleep initiation. This confirmed that the brief exposure to THIP was indeed putting flies to sleep, with an expected sleep inertia lasting the length of a typical spontaneous sleep bout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>). This contrasts with optogenetic sleep induction using the R23E10-Gal4 circuit, which does not appear to show any sleep inertia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Troup et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Brain imaging during optogenetic- and 4,5,6,7-tetrahyrdoisoxazolopyridin-3-ol (THIP)-induced sleep.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flies were mounted onto a custom-built holder that allowed a coronal visualization of the brain through the posterior side of the head.

We found that neural activity decreased rapidly within 5 min after sleep onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, +THIP, early). Correlation analysis also revealed a decrease in connectivity among the remaining active neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, +THIP, early). We also analyzed the next 5 min of sleep and observed similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, +THIP, mid). All flies eventually woke up from THIP-induced sleep, and brain activity returned to wake levels in three flies that were recorded throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These observations suggest that acute THIP exposure is promoting rapid entry into a ‘quiet’ sleep stage in flies, bypassing the wake-like sleep evident during the first 5 min of spontaneous sleep onset, and closely resembling spontaneous quiet sleep typically seen after 5 minutes of inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, THIP-induced sleep appears to be dissimilar from optogenetically induced sleep in this genotype at the level of neural activity as well as connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In a recent work, we showed that rendering flies unresponsive with a general anesthetic, isoflurane, in surprising contrast to THIP, does not quieten the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Troup et al., 2023</xref>). Isoflurane also decreased neural connectivity, as well as the diversity of neural activity across the fly brain, whereas optogenetic-induced sleep did not show any differences in neural activity or ensemble dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Troup et al., 2023</xref>). Since in our current THIP experiments we were similarly recording from neural soma that we could track through time, we were able to assess the level of overlap between the neurons that remained active during THIP-induced sleep and wakefulness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). We found that ~30% of active neurons during THIP-induced sleep were also active during wake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). We next examined whether the same neurons remained active across successive 5 min epochs during THIP-induced sleep compared to wake. We found that there is significantly more overlap between successive 5 min sleep epochs (41%), compared to the waking average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), suggesting less neural turnover during THIP-induced sleep than during wake. This contrasts with optogenetic sleep, where the rate of neural turnover was not different from wake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Troup et al., 2023</xref>). Taken together, our calcium imaging data confirm that pharmacological sleep induction promotes a different kind of sleep than optogenetic sleep induction in the same strain. Henceforth, we call this ‘quiet’ sleep, in contrast to the ‘active’ sleep that seems to be engaged by optogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van De Poll and van Swinderen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, calcium imaging of spontaneous sleep bouts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also revealed active and quiet sleep stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that both of our experimental approaches are physiologically relevant. Whether drug perfusion to the brain is equivalent to feeding is of course less clear. When feeding on 0.1 mg/ml THIP-laced food, flies were continuously exposed to the drug over days, with comparatively less reaching the brain. With perfusion, the brain was directly exposed to 0.2 mg/ml THIP for only 5 min. Interestingly, in both cases this induces daytime sleep bouts, which average around 25 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>), the average duration of a spontaneous night-time sleep bout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transcriptional analysis of flies induced to sleep by THIP provision</title><p>Our calcium imaging experiments suggest that different biological processes might be engaged by optogenetic-induced sleep compared to THIP-induced sleep. Additionally, we observed neural effects encompassing much of the fly brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) as our recording approach exploited a pan-neural driver. We therefore wondered if either sleep-induction method might lead to differences in gene expression across the whole brain and if these might highlight distinct molecular pathways engaged by either kind of sleep. To address this, we collected brains from flies that had been induced to sleep by either method and compared the resulting transcriptomes with identically handled control animals that had not been induced to sleep by these methods.</p><p>To control for genetic background, we again used the same R23E10-Gal4&gt;UAS-Chrimson flies as in our multiday behavioral experiments and fed the flies either THIP or ATR, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. We only examined daytime sleep-induction effects for either method as this is when we observed the greatest increase in sleep compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and previous work has shown that daytime sleep induction using either method achieves sleep functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dissel et al., 2015</xref>). We present our THIP results first. Since THIP is a GABA-acting drug that probably affects a variety of processes in the brain aside from sleep, we also assessed the effect of THIP on flies that were prevented from sleeping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left panel). Sleep deprivation (SD) was performed by mechanically arousing flies once every 20 s for the duration of the experiment on a ‘SNAP’ apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dissel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seugnet et al., 2009</xref>). RNA was extracted from the brains of all groups of flies (+/-THIP, +/-SD) after 10 hr of daytime (8 AM to 6 PM) THIP (or vehicle) provision. Samples for RNA-sequencing were collected in replicates of 5 to ensure accuracy, and any significant transcriptional effects were thresholded at a log fold change of 0.58 (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Metabolic processes are downregulated during 4,5,6,7-tetrahyrdoisoxazolopyridin-3-ol (THIP)-induced sleep.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental set-up and samples processed using RNA-sequencing.

The top Gene Ontology biological processes included primary, organic substance, cellular, biosynthetic, and nitrogen compound metabolic pathways, as well as ribosomal processes. Interestingly, these downregulated processes are largely consistent with a recently published mouse sleep transcriptome study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muheim et al., 2019</xref>). Among the metabolism pathways uncovered in this dataset, we observed over-representation of expected genes such as <italic>bgm</italic> (bubblegum CG4501) and <italic>Acer</italic> (angiotensin-converting enzyme-related CG10593). Both of these genes are found in the primary metabolic and organic substance metabolic processes as well as within the Sleep Gene Ontology dataset (GO:0030431).

The combined collection points also allowed us to compare transcriptional profiles between conditions (e.g., ZT10 +ATR vs. ZT10 -ATR), to identify sleep genes, as well as within conditions (ZT1 vs. ZT10), to account for genetic effects potentially linked to light-dark cycles.

The control flies were therefore never induced to sleep by optogenetic activation, although they were still able to sleep spontaneously (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, E and G</xref>). We found that 10 hr of optogenetic activation led to 278 significant transcriptional changes, comprising mostly of upregulated genes, with 171 upregulated compared to 107 downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). In contrast to the THIP-induced sleep dataset, transcriptional analysis of 10 hr optogenetic sleep induction uncovered a variety of different processes predominantly related to the regulation of biological and cellular processes, rather than metabolism specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, of the genes that were overexpressed there is an enrichment of the Semaphorin-plexin signaling pathway (GO:0071526, GO:1902287, GO:1902285, and GO:2000305) and the ephrin receptor signaling pathway (GO:0046011), both of which are known to be involved in axonal guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Interestingly, several upregulated genes code for different subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRα1,3,4, and 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Importantly, there was almost no overlap with our SD dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2,</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>), suggesting that optogenetic activation is not sleep depriving (or stressing) the flies (only one upregulated gene was shared, CG40198). Of the genes that were downregulated, there is enrichment of pathways that relate to synaptic vesicle recycling (GO:0036465 and GO:0036466) as well as neurotransmitter metabolic processes (GO:0042133) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the 10 hr timepoint, 1 hr of optogenetically induced sleep had far fewer transcriptomic consequences, with only 17 genes upregulated and 10 downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). This small number of transcriptomic changes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>) may reflect the effect of ATR feeding, rather than any genes relevant to optogenetic sleep. That 9 hr of additional optogenetic sleep increased transcriptomic changes by an order of magnitude lends confidence to the interpretation that relevant genes linked to prolonged optogenetic activation are being engaged.</p><p>To account for potential genetic effects linked to light-dark expression cycles, we compared transcriptional profiles between 10 hr of optogenetic-induced sleep to 1 hr of induced sleep. Here, we found 220 differentially regulated genes (119 upregulated and 101 downregulated) when comparing ATR-fed flies at both timepoints (ZT10 vs. ZT1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata3">Figure 7—source data 3</xref>). Since the 1 hr group was collected in the morning and the 10 hr group was collected in the evening, we expected this dataset to expose a number of circadian-regulatory genes, and this is indeed what we found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then compared these results with a parallel ZT10 vs. ZT1 experiment where flies were not fed ATR. Here we uncovered 503 differentially expressed genes (252 upregulated and 251 downregulated) when comparing flies that had not been fed ATR at both timepoints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata4">Figure 7—source data 4</xref>). Importantly, there were 98 genes that overlapped between these independent Z10 vs. ZT1 datasets, suggesting commonalities linked to circadian processes. Indeed, GO Pathway analysis of Biological Processes revealed a number of genes involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm among these 98 overlapping genes, including the well-known circadian genes <italic>period, timeless, clockwork-orange, clock and vrille</italic>. Notably, co-factors <italic>period</italic> and <italic>timeless</italic> are both upregulated whereas <italic>clk</italic> is downregulated, and this is replicated in both independent datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). This correspondence with expectations for zeitgeber or light-dark effects provides a level of confidence that our respective sleep datasets are highlighting transcriptomic changes and biological pathways relevant to either sleep induction approach. Notably, there was no overlap at all in gene expression changes between optogenetic-induced sleep and THIP-induced sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), and the respective GO pathways analyses of biological processes are also largely non-overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To validate these findings, we compared our transcriptional results with qRT-PCR on six genes.

We found convincing correspondence between our qRT-PCR data and our transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). qRT-PCR comparisons with RNA-seq data and associated statistics are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors regulate sleep architecture</title><p>While THIP-induced sleep caused a systemic downregulation of metabolism-related genes, the effect of optogenetic-induced sleep on gene expression was not dominated by a single category. This may be consistent with our earlier observation that brain activity looks similar to wake during optogenetic-induced sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>), so we could essentially be highlighting biological processes relevant to an awake fly brain, such as dopamine function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Swinderen and Andretic, 2011</xref>). However, optogenetic activation of the R23E10 circuit is not like wake, in that flies are rendered highly unresponsive to external stimuli, so perhaps like REM sleep in mammals a different category of molecular processes could be involved. In mammals, acetylcholine generally promotes wakefulness and alertness, but activity of cholinergic neurons is also high during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Watson et al., 2010</xref>). Neurotransmission in the insect brain is largely cholinergic, with seven different nicotinic ‘alpha’ receptor subunits expressed in neural tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rosenthal and Yuan, 2021</xref>). Interestingly, four of these subunits were significantly upregulated in our optogenetic sleep dataset: nAchRα1, nAchRα3, nAchRα4, and nAchRα5 (with nAchRα6 and nAchRα7 approaching significance, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). For comparison, none of these were upregulated in our SD dataset, suggesting a sleep-relevant role. Previous studies have demonstrated a role for some of these same receptor subunits in sleep regulation, in particular nAchRα4 (also called <italic>redeye</italic>), which is upregulated in short-sleeping mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shi et al., 2014</xref>), and nAchRα3, which has been reported to regulates arousal levels in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these studies suggest processes that might be reconsidered in the context of active sleep, as highlighted by our gene expression findings. We therefore sought to examine the role of cholinergic signaling in sleep more closely by knocking out each nAchRα subunit and examining the effects of each subunit knockout on sleep architecture. Since our transcriptomic analysis encompassed effects of active sleep on whole-brain gene expression, we first eliminated each nAchRα subunit across the brain by testing confirmed genetic deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perry et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We first examined the effect of each nAchRα subunit deletion on sleep duration using the 5 min criterion for quantifying sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). We found that the nAchRα mutants fell into two different categories: removal of nAchRα1 and nAchRα2 significantly decreased sleep, day and night; whereas removal of nAchRα3, nAchRα4, nAchRα6, and nAchRα7 significantly increased sleep, day and night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The nAchRα5 knockout was found to be homozygous lethal, so was not included. To examine sleep architecture in these mutants, we quantified sleep bout number and duration and plotted these together as done previously for our sleep induction experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Examining the data this way, it is clear to see how nAchRα1 and nAchRα2 are different: most sleep bouts are very short, day and night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, top two rows, left panels, green dots). In contrast, knocking out the other alpha subunits seems to consolidate sleep, especially at night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, bottom four rows, left panels). nAchRα3 knockouts were most striking in this regard, with these flies sleeping uninterrupted for an average of 156.53 min (± 18.06) during the day and 160.76 min (± 17.92) at night. Increased sleep consolidation in these mutants was, however, not due to the lack of activity. While awake, nAchRα3 animals were just as active as controls (activity per waking minute = 2.69 ± 0.18 vs. 2.5 ± 0.06, respectively). However, some knockouts did increase waking activity levels; waking activity data for all of the knockout strains and their genetic controls are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>nAchRα subunit knockouts bidirectionally regulate &gt;5 min sleep as well as short sleep.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average total day and night sleep duration (minutes ± 95% confidence intervals) in nAchRα knockout mutants, expressed as difference to their respective background controls (see ‘Materials and methods’). α1, N = 91; contro1 (X<sup>59</sup>w<sup>1118</sup>) = 93; α2, N = 70; control (w<sup>1118</sup>ActinCas9) = 65; α3, N = 43; (ActinCas9) = 91; α4, N = 87; (w<sup>1118</sup>ActinCas9) = 98; α6, N = 91; (w<sup>1118</sup>ActinCas9) = 91; α7, N = 94; (ActinCas9) = 95. *p&lt;0.05, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001 by <italic>t</italic>-test adjusted for multiple comparisons.

In previous work, we have shown that flies can be asleep already after the first minute of spontaneous inactivity, and that during the first 5 min of sleep the fly brain displays wake-like levels of neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>). We have termed this early sleep stage ‘active sleep’ to distinguish it from ‘quiet sleep’ that typically follows after 5–10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>). One way of estimating the amount of ‘active sleep’ in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies is to sum all short sleep epochs lasting between 1 and 5 min and expressing this as a percentage of total sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>). When we re-examined our nAchRα knockouts in this way, we found that this behavioral readout for ‘active sleep’ was significantly affected by the loss of select nAchRα subunits. Short sleep increased significantly during both the day and the night in nAchRα1 and nAchRα2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, top two rows, right panel, green dots). In contrast, and consistent with our sleep architecture analyses (above), nAchRα3 displayed almost no short sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, row 3, right panel). Finally, in nAchRα4 and nAchRα6 short sleep was significantly decreased at night, while in nAchRα7 short sleep was significantly decreased day and night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, rows 4–6, right panel). In conclusion, every one of the nAchRα knockouts we tested affect short sleep in some way, either increasing (nAchRα1 and nAchRα2) or decreasing it (nAchRα3, nAchRα4, nAchRα6, nAchRα7). Additionally, tallying the proportion of short sleep bouts provides valuable insight into altered sleep architecture in mutant strains.</p><p>We nevertheless questioned whether these systemic effects of nicotinic receptors on short sleep were perhaps a trivial consequence of altered &gt;5 min sleep duration in these mutants, especially regarding the striking differences between nAchRα1&amp;2 and the other subunit knockouts. We therefore returned to our ‘quiet’ sleep (THIP) dataset to contrast a gene derived from that study. We found that several of the THIP-induced sleep genes are involved in metabolic processes, which are mostly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). This included the adipokinetic hormone receptor (AkhR), which has previously been associated with starvation-induced sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2020</xref>). We employed an RNAi strategy to downregulate this metabolic gene’s expression across the fly brain in AkhR-RNAi/R57C10-Gal4 flies (see ‘Materials and methods’). We found that downregulating AkhR significantly decreased sleep duration during the day as well as night compared to genetic control strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). Accordingly, sleep bout duration and number decreased, especially during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). However, in contrast to knocking out nAchRα1 and nAchRα2, which also significantly decreased sleep duration day and night, short sleep was not significantly altered in AkhR knockdown animals compared to genetic controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). This suggests that short (1–5 min) sleep might be under separate regulatory control than &gt;5 min sleep.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>AkhR knockdown decreases &gt;5 min sleep but not short sleep.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Total sleep (&gt;5 min) in UAS-AkhR:RNAi/R57C10-Gal4 flies (blue, N = 126) compared to genetic controls (light gray: UAS-AkhR:RNAi/+, N = 124; dark gray: R57C10-Gal4/+, N = 120).

While it is unlikely that these cholinergic receptor subunits are restricted to just these neurons, we were curious if removing any of them from this specific circuit had similar effect on sleep as in the knockout strains. We found that nAchRα1 knockdown in the R23E10 neurons significantly decreased total sleep during both day and night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>), which was also true for the nAchRα1 knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

By being able to induce sleep on demand, either genetically or pharmacologically, researchers have been able to manipulate sleep as an experimental variable, and in this way be better able to assess causality when probing potential sleep functions. However, this approach has often sidestepped the question of whether different sleep induction methods are equivalent or whether distinct forms of sleep might be engaged by different genetic or pharmacological treatments. In mammals, GABA agonists typically promote SWS, which has been associated with cellular homeostasis and repair process in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, drugs targeting acetylcholine receptors, such as carbachol, have been found to promote brain states more reminiscent of REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kubin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Torterolo et al., 2016</xref>). Although these drugs all induce sedative (or dissociative) states, they are clearly producing dissimilar forms of sleep in mammals, with likely different functions or consequences for the brain. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, evidence suggests that the GABA agonist THIP promotes a form of deep or ‘quiet’ sleep, which may be functionally analogous to mammalian SWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yap et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirszenblat and van Swinderen, 2015</xref>). In contrast, optogenetic activation of the dFB as well as other neurons may promote a form of active sleep, which we have suggested could be achieving some similar sleep functions as REM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van De Poll and van Swinderen, 2021</xref>). THIP-induced sleep in flies has been associated with waste clearance from the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>), just as SWS has been associated with clearance of waste metabolites via the mammalian brain’s glymphatic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xie et al., 2013</xref>). Such functional homology suggests that the transcriptional changes we uncovered for THIP-induced sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> might also be relevant for mammalian SWS, with these largely centered on reduced metabolic processes and stress regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muheim et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, except for the upregulation of cholinergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vazquez and Baghdoyan, 2001</xref>), there is little to compare to test hypotheses potentially linking active sleep in flies with REM sleep in mammals, except for the potential upregulation of cholinergic signaling. Even this cholinergic connection seems odd, seeing that the predominant excitatory neurotransmitters are reversed in the brains of insects and mammals: glutamate in mammals and acetylcholine in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smarandache-Wellmann, 2016</xref>). Additionally, only nicotinic receptor subunits were identified in our analyses, whereas muscarinic receptors have been more commonly associated with REM sleep in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourgin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kashiwagi and Hayashi, 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, it is clear from our results that optogenetic-induced active sleep upregulates the expression of multiple nicotinic acetylcholine subunits, and that knocking these out individually has profound (and opposing) effects on sleep architecture in flies, and that a subset might function intrinsically within sleep-promoting neurons. This supports other studies showing a role for nAchRα’s in sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). It will be especially interesting in future brain imaging studies to see whether a knockout such as nAchRα3 is eliminating one kind of sleep (e.g., active sleep) as predicted by our behavioral data, and whether this is associated with any functional consequences. Similarly, it will be telling to see whether the opposite sleep phenotypes observed in nAchRα1, for example, result in a distinct class of functional consequences. A previous study has shown that nAchRα1 knockout animals have significantly shorter survivorship compared to controls, with flies dying almost 20 d earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Somers et al., 2017</xref>). One reason could be because of impaired or insufficient deep sleep functions (e.g., brain waste clearance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>). The nAchRα knockouts provide an opportunity to further examine mutant animals potentially lacking either kind of sleep, although this will have to be confirmed by brain imaging or electrophysiology.</p><p>We found little similarity between two different approaches to inducing sleep in flies at the level of gene expression as well as acute effects on brain activity. It may, however, not be surprising that these entirely different sleep induction methods produce dissimilar physiological effects. After all, one method requires flies to ingest a drug, which then must make its way to the brain, while the other method directly activates a subset of neurons in the central brain, as well as in the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones et al., 2023</xref>). Yet both methods yield similarly increased sleep duration profiles and consolidated sleep architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). One underlying assumption with focusing on sleep duration as the most relevant metric for understanding sleep function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is that sleep is a unitary phenomenon in the fly model, meaning that primarily one set of functions and one form of brain activity are occurring when flies sleep. There is now substantial evidence that this is unlikely to be true, and that like other animals flies probably also experience distinct sleep stages that accomplish different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yap et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wiggin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong et al., 2022</xref>). This does not mean that these functions are mutually exclusive; for example, both THIP provision and neuronal activation of central brain circuits have been found to promote memory consolidation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dissel et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, it seems reasonable to propose that different sleep stages could be synergistic, accomplishing a variety of homeostatic functions that might be required for adaptive behaviors in an animal. Our results suggest that THIP provision promotes a ‘quiet sleep’ stage in flies, which induces a brain-wide downregulation of metabolism-related genes. This is consistent with studies in flies showing that metabolic rate is decreased in longer sleep bouts, especially at night, and that this is recapitulated by THIP-induced sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stahl et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings also align with a previous study showing that mitochondrial metabolic processes are upregulated in the absence of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kempf et al., 2019</xref>). One argument for why metabolism-related genes are downregulated during THIP-induced sleep might be that flies are starved (because they are sleeping more, and thus perhaps not eating). However, flies induced to sleep by optogenetic activation are also sleeping more (indeed, their average sleep bouts are longer), yet these did not reveal a similar downregulation of metabolic processes. Another view might be that our sampling was done after flies had achieved 10 hr of induced sleep, so sleep functions might have already been achieved by that time. Thus, we might not be uncovering genes required for achieving ‘quiet’ sleep functions as much as identifying exactly the opposite: genetic pathways that have been satisfied by 10 hr of induced quiet sleep. Other studies using THIP to induce sleep have examined longer time frames (e.g., 2 d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dissel et al., 2015</xref>), so it remains unclear whether changes in gene regulation relate to sleep functions that have been achieved or that are still being engaged. For our transcriptomic study, both sleep induction protocols were conducted during the day (thus in presumably well-rested flies) to deliberately avoid any sleep pressure confounds. Since the dFB has been proposed as a regulator of sleep homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donlea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donlea et al., 2018</xref>), one could question why its prolonged activation did not incur a deep sleep debt, which might have been detectable at a transcriptomic level by some overlap with our SD controls. That we did not see this suggests induced daytime active sleep might not accrue any sleep debt. We have shown previously that daytime sleep is qualitatively different than night-time sleep in flies, which is ‘deeper’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>). It is, for example, possible that most quiet sleep happens at night in flies, so a daytime regime of induced active or quiet sleep might not incur any sleep debt for either. Following this logic, our RNA analyses simply revealed the transcriptomic changes resulting from either manipulation in well-rested flies, with the key result being that there are zero shared genes after 10 daytime hours of either manipulation.</p><p>In contrast to THIP, our optogenetic manipulation induced a brain-wide upregulation of a variety of neural mechanisms unrelated to metabolic processes, suggesting a different kind of sleep was engaged. Although many studies have shown that the R23E10-Gal4 circuit is sleep promoting (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Troup et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donlea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong et al., 2022</xref>), and we have shown that acute activation of these neurons produces a form of active sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>), it seems unlikely that active sleep regulation is limited to the dFB neurons alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones et al., 2023</xref>). Other circuits in the fly central brain are also sleep-promoting, including in the ellipsoid body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) and the ventral fan-shaped body (vFB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lei et al., 2022</xref>), although it remains unknown whether activation of these other circuits also promotes an active sleep stage or whether a similar transcriptome might be engaged by these alternate approaches to optogenetic sleep induction in flies. This again highlights a variant of the same problem we have uncovered in this study comparing pharmacology with optogenetics: different circuit-based approaches could all be increasing sleep duration but achieving entirely different functions by engaging distinct transcriptomes and thus different sleep functions. How many different kinds of functions are engaged by sleep remains unclear: is it roughly two functional categories linked to quiet and active sleep, or is it a broader range of subcategories that are not so tightly linked to these obviously different brain activity states?</p><p>A compelling argument could nevertheless be made for two kinds of sleep in most animals, with two distinct sets of functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaggard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirszenblat and van Swinderen, 2015</xref>). Most animals have been shown to require a form of ‘quiet’ sleep to ensure survival, suggesting that these might encompass an evolutionarily conserved set of cellular processes that promote neural health and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zimmerman et al., 2008a</xref>), and that operate best during periods of behavioral quiescence. Nematode worms thus experience a form of quiet sleep when they pause to molt (‘lethargus’) into different life stages during their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>) or when cellular repair processes are needed following environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2014</xref>). In flies, quiet sleep seems to be similarly required for neuronal repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stanhope et al., 2020</xref>) or waste clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>), and there is evidence that glia might play a key role in these cellular homeostatic processes in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stanhope et al., 2020</xref>), as well as other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artiushin and Sehgal, 2020</xref>). Thus, SWS in mammals and birds might present a narrow neocortical view of a more ancient set of sleep functions centered on quiescence and decreased metabolic rate. Indeed, neural quiescence is also a feature of SWS, both at the level of pulsed inhibition (down-states) and in other parts of the brain beyond the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaggard et al., 2021</xref>). Similar to findings in flies that are induced into a quiet sleep stage with THIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stahl et al., 2017</xref>), metabolic rate also decreases during SWS in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caron and Stephenson, 2010</xref>). In contrast, metabolic rate is similar to waking during REM sleep in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maquet, 1995</xref>), suggesting an alternate set of functions not linked to cellular homeostasis. What might these functions be, and could some of these be conserved between active sleep in invertebrates and REM sleep in mammals? A REM-like sleep stage has now been identified in a variety of invertebrate species, including cephalopods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iglesias et al., 2019</xref>) and jumping spiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rößler et al., 2022</xref>). In humans, REM sleep has been implicated in emotion regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hutchison and Rathore, 2015</xref>), and cognitive disorders where emotions are dysregulated, such as depression, are often associated with REM sleep dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrington et al., 2018</xref>). While it is not evident how to study emotions in insects (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>), it could be argued that arousal systems more generally are employed to detect prediction errors and thereby promote learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seth and Friston, 2016</xref>). Thus, we and others have suggested that REM sleep might be crucial for optimizing prediction, and attention, and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van De Poll and van Swinderen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirszenblat and van Swinderen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hobson, 2009</xref>), and this may involve different kinds of homeostatic mechanisms centered on brain circuits rather than cells. Whether active sleep in flies plays a similar homeostatic role remains to be determined. Our finding that optogenetically induced sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> upregulates different nAchRα subunits is consistent with new findings that these subunits regulate appetitive memories in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pribbenow et al., 2022</xref>) and that cholinergic systems more generally underpin learning and memory in this animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>). Yet learning and memory in flies clearly also benefit from quiet sleep, as evidenced by multiple studies using THIP as a sleep-promoting agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dissel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Melnattur et al., 2021</xref>). One view consistent with our findings and previous studies is that both kinds of sleep are crucial for optimal behavior: quiet sleep for cellular homeostasis and active sleep for circuit-level homeostasis. Manipulating these separately, alongside the non-overlapping pathways engaged by either kind of sleep, should help further disambiguate the functions potentially associated with these distinct sleep stages.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> flies were reared in vials (groups of 20 flies/vial) on standard yeast-sugar-agar based media (1.0–1.5–0.5 g ratio) under a 12:12 light/dark (8 AM:8 PM) cycle and maintained at 25°C with 50% humidity.

The entire nlsGCaMP6f signal was located within a 256 × 256 px area, corresponding to 667 × 667 µm.

Flies were subjected to 10 pre-THIP stimuli at a rate of 1 puff/min to characterize the baseline response rate. Flies were then perfused with 0.2 mg/ml THIP in ECF for 5 min, followed by continuous ECF perfusion for the remaining experimental time. Five minutes after the fly had fallen asleep on the ball, a further 20 air puff stimuli were delivered, at a rate of 1 puff/min. Behavioral responses to the air puff were noted as a ‘yes’ (1) or ‘no’ (0), which were characterized as the fly rapidly walking on the ball immediately following the air puff.

Image registration was achieved using efficient sub-pixel image registration by cross-correlation. Each z-slice in a volume (18 z-slices and 2 flyback slices) is acquired at a slightly different timepoint compared to the rest of the slices. Hence, to perform volume (x,y,z) analysis of images, all the slices within a volume need to be adjusted for timing differences. This was achieved by using the ninth z-slice as the reference slice, and temporal interpolation was performed for all the other z-slices using ‘sinc’ interpolation. The timing correction approach implemented here is conceptually similar to the methods using fMRI for slice timing correction.</p><p>For each individual z-slice, a standard deviation projection of the entire time series was used for watershed segmentation with the ‘Morphological segmentation’ ImageJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Legland et al., 2016</xref>). Using a custom-written MATLAB (MathWorks) code, the mean fluorescent values of all pixels within a given ROI were extracted for the entire time series, resulting in a <italic>n</italic> × <italic>t</italic> array for each slice of each experiment, where <italic>n</italic> refers to the number of neurons in each Z-slice, and <italic>t</italic> refers to the length of the experiment in time frames. These grayscale values were z-scored for each neuron, and the z-scored data was transformed into a binary matrix where a value of &gt;3 standard deviations of the mean was allocated a ‘1’ and every value &lt;3 standard deviations was allocated a ‘0.’ To determine whether a neuron fired during the entire time series, a rolling sum of the binary matrix was performed, where 10 consecutive time frames were summed together. If the value of any of these summing events was greater than or equal to 7 (indicating a fluorescent change of &gt;3 standard deviations in 7/10 time frames), a neuron was deemed to be active. For THIP sleep experiments, the 5 min of inactivity occurring after an initial 30 s of behavioral inactivity were used. After identifying firing neurons for each condition (wake vs. sleep), the percentage of active neurons was calculated in each slice by taking the number of active neurons and dividing it by the total number of neurons.</p><p>Traces of active neurons were used to calculate the number of firing events. This was done using the ‘findpeaks’ MATLAB function on the z-scored fluorescent traces, with the parameters ‘minpeakheight’ of 3 and ‘minpeakdistance’ of 30.

The RNAi strain for the adipokinetic hormone receptor gene knockdown experiments (UAS-<italic>AkhR-</italic>RNAi) was obtained from the VDRC (KK109300). This RNAi construct was expressed in neurons across the fly brain by crossing the UAS flies to R57C10-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>). RNAi strains for the nicotinic alpha receptor gene knockdown experiments (UAS-nAchRα1-7-RNAi) were obtained from the BDRC.

The establishment of definable sleep stages/state in the fly model should be seen as a central goal in the field and this study represents an important step toward that goal. In particular, managing to draw parallels between sleep stages in flies and humans would make it relevant to use the power of fly genetics to better understand the molecular and cellular basis of these sleep stages. The authors use behavioral, physiological and transcriptomics approaches to describe the differences that exist between sleep triggered by optogenetic stimulation of dFB neurons and sleep induced by consumption of the sleep-promoting drug Gaboxadol (THIP). While there are still concerns regarding the interpretation of the major results, the authors have, in general, adequately responded to the reviewers' concerns.</p><p>The strengths of this work are:</p><p>1- The article is easy to read, and the figures are mostly informative.</p><p>2- The authors employ state-of-the-art techniques to measure neuronal activity and locomotion in a single assay.</p><p>3- The analysis of transcriptomic data is appropriate.</p><p>4- The authors identify many new genes regulated in response to specific methods for sleep induction. These are all potentially interesting candidates for further studies investigating the molecular basis of sleep. It would be interesting to know which of these genes are already known to display circadian expression patterns.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1- The fact that flies with dFB activation seem to keep a basal level of locomotor activity whereas THIP-treated ones don't is quite striking. Is it possible that there is an error with Figure 4C-D? Based on this, it is hard to believe that dFB stimulation and THIP consumption have similar behavioral effects on sleep.</p><p>2- The authors seem satisfied with the 'good correspondence' between their RNA-seq and qPCR results, this is true for only ~9/19 genes in Fig 6G and 2/6 genes in Fig 7G. The variability between the three biological replicates is not represented in the figure.</p><p>Comments</p><p>1- The fact that THIP-induced sleep persists long after THIP removal (Fig 3D) is intriguing. This suggests that the drug might trigger a sleep-inducing pathway that, once activated, can continue on its own without the drug.</p><p>2- The claim that induction of the two forms (active/quiet) of sleep produce distinct transcriptomic and physiological effects while producing highly similar behavioral effects makes it difficult to understand the relationships between the former changes with sleep state. In their response the authors argue that sleep behavior, as currently measured using duration of inactivity, is not necessarily expected to allow for a differentiation between active and quiet sleep. This further argues for a need for better physiological/molecular correlates of sleep state in the fly (a laudable goal of this very study). However, until clear behavioral correlates can be strongly associated with physiological/molecular correlates, we will be limited to speculation about this important issue.</p><p>3- The authors suggest that the duration of the periods of inactivity may not be particularly useful for defining sleep states/stages in the fly. If this is the case, it is certainly an important issue as this measurement is the behavioral criteria for defining sleep in the field. In this regard, it raises the question of the relationship between the active and quiet sleep states examined in this study and the growing evidence for a deep sleep state (characterized by, among other things, a lowered metabolism).</p><p>4- Although the methodological concerns regarding the dose of Gaboxadol and the controls for the optogenetic/transcriptomic experiments remain, the authors have explained the rationale for the experimental design they used.</p><p>5- Overall, the authors have managed to clearly illustrate the differences between dFB stimulation and THIP consumption on behavior, neuronal activity, and gene expression.

The majority of the conclusions of the paper are supported by compelling data, but the evidence supporting the claim that the two interventions trigger distinct transcriptional responses is incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the helpful and detailed reviews. We feel that these have improved the manuscript considerably, and hopefully the additional figures in this Reply letter will help further convince our readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Public Review</p><p>In this study, Anthoney and coworkers continue an important, unique, and technologically innovative line of inquiry from the van Swinderen lab aimed at furthering our understanding of the different sleep stages that may exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Here, they compare the physiological and transcriptional hallmarks of sleep that have been induced by two distinct means, a pharmacological block of GABA signaling and optogenetic activation of dorsal fan-shaped-body neurons. They first employ an incredibly impressive fly-on-the-ball 2-photon functional imaging setup to monitor neural activity during these interventions, and then perform bulk RNA sequencing of fly brains at different stages. These transcriptomic analyses leads them to (a) knocking out nicotinic acetyl-choline receptor subunits and (b) knocking down AkhR throughout the fly brain testing the impact of these genetic interventions on sleep behaviors in flies. Based on this work, the authors present evidence that optogenetically and pharmacologically induced sleep produces highly distinct brain-wide effects on physiology and transcription.The study is of significant interest, is easy to read, and the figures are mostly informative. However there are features of the experimental design and the interpretation of results that diminish enthusiasm.</p><p>a- Conditions under which sleep is induced for behavioral vs neural and transcriptional studies</p><p>1- There is a major conceptual concern regarding the relationships between the physiological and transcriptomic effects of optogenetic and pharmacological sleep promotion, and the effects that these manipulations have on sleep behavior. The authors show that these two means of sleep-induction produce remarkably distinct physiological and transcriptional responses, however, they also show that they produce highly similar effects on sleep behavior, causing an increase in sleep through increases in the duration of sleep bouts. If dFB neurons were promoting active sleep, the sleep it produces should be more fragmented than the sleep induced by the drug, because the latter is supposed to produce quiet sleep. Yet both manipulations seem to be biasing behavior toward quiet sleep.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a correct observation, which is already evident in our sleep architecture data (Figure 2E-H): chronic optogenetic sleep induction promotes longer sleep bouts that are similar in structure (bout number vs bout duration) to those produced by THIP feeding. Since our plots in Figure 2E-H follow the 5min sleep criterion cutoff, upon the Reviewer’s advice we re-analyzed our optogenetic experiments for short (1-5min) sleep. These are graphed below in Author response image 1. As can be seen, and as suspected by the Reviewer, the optogenetic manipulation does not increase the total amount of short sleep; indeed, it decreases it compared to baseline (these are for the exact same data as in Figure 2). Optogenetic sleep induction does not create a bunch of short sleep bouts.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Short sleep in optogenetic experiments.</title><p>A. Average baseline ( ± SEM) 1-5min sleep across a day and night. B. Average ( ± SEM) 1-5min sleep in optogenenetically-activated flies, across a day and night.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88198-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We agree with the reviewer that this observation might seem inconsistent with the idea that optogenetic activation promotes active sleep, and that short sleep is active sleep. However, it does not necessarily follow that optogenetic activation has to produce short sleep. Indeed, we know from our brain imaging data (and the associated behavioral analysis) that active sleep will persist for as long as we induce it with red light. While we have not induced it for longer than 15 minutes (Tainton-Heap et al, Current Biology, 2021; Troup et al, J. of Neuroscience, 2023), this is already clearly longer than a &lt;5min sleep bout. So our interpretation is that the longer sleep bouts induced by optogenetic activation are prolonged active sleep, rather than quiet sleep. In other words, this artificial sleep manipulation induces prolonged active sleep, rather than many short sleep bouts. This is of course different than what happens during spontaneous sleep. We have tried to be clearer about sleep bout durations in the revised manuscript (e.g., the new Figure 3), and we now admit early in the results (lines 376-380) that that we don’t know what optogenetic activation looks like in the fly brain beyond 15 minutes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2- The authors show that the pharmacological block of GABA signaling and the optogenetic activation of dorsal fan-shaped-body neurons cause different responses on brain activity. Based on these recordings and the behavioral and brain transcriptomic data they then claim that these responses correspond to different sleep states and are associated with the expression and repression of a different constellation of genes. Nevertheless, neural activity in animals was recorded following short stimulations whereas behavioral and transcriptomic data were obtained following chronic stimulation. In this regard, it would be interesting to determine how the 12-hour pharmacological intervention they employed for their transcriptomic analysis changes neural activity throughout the brain - 12 hours will likely be too long for the open-cuticle preps, but an in-between time-point (e.g. 1h) would probably be equally informative.</p></disp-quote><p>The longest we’ve imaged brain activity for optogenetic sleep induction is 15 minutes, as discussed above. We see no changes in activity across this time, which would normally have led to a quiet sleep stage in spontaneous sleep recordings. Whole-brain imaging after 10 hours of optogenetic sleep induction (our RNA collection timepoint) is not realistic, and even 1 hour is difficult. We have however conducted overnight electrophysiological recordings (with multichannel silicon probes), where we activated the same R23E10 neurons for successive 20-minute bouts (alternating with 20min of no red light). We are preparing this work for publication (Van De Poll, et al). We see no evidence of optogenetic activation of this circuit ever producing anything resembling quiet sleep. Since we are not in a position to provide this new electrophysiological data in the current study, we are careful to clarify that we have not investigated what brain imaging looks like after chronic optogenetic activation (lines 376-380). We are showing through diverse lines of evidence that what is called sleep can look different in flies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b- Efficiency of THIP treatment under different conditions</p><p>1- There are no data to quantify how THIP alters food consumption. It is evident that flies consume it otherwise they would not show increased sleep. However, they may consume different amounts of food overall than the minus THIP controls. This might have an influence on the animal's metabolism, which could at least explain the fact that metabolism-related genes are regulated (Figure 5). Therefore, in the current state, it is not possible to be certain that gene regulation events measured in this experiment are solely due to THIP effects on sleep.</p></disp-quote><p>We have two arguments against this reasonable criticism. First, as discussed above, the optogenetic flies are sleeping at least as much as the THIP-fed flies, so in principle they also might be feeding less. But we see no metabolic gene downregulation in the optogenetic dataset. We include this counterargument in the discussion (lines 752-756). Then, together with our co-author Paul Shaw we have shown that THIP-fed flies are not eating less compared to controls (Dissel et al, Current Biology, 2015), by tracking dye consumption. We show those results again below in Author response image 2 to support our reasoning that feeding is not an issue.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Flies were fed blue dye in their food while being sleep deprived (SD), or while being induced to sleep with 0.</title><p>1mg/ml THIP in their food, or both.

If flies are snapped every 20 seconds, they may not have the freedom to consume appropriate amounts of food, and therefore their consumption of THIP or ATR may be smaller than in non-sleep deprived controls. Thus, it would be crucial to know whether the flies that are sleep-deprived (i.e. shaken every 20 seconds for 12 hours) actually consume comparable amounts of food (and therefore THIP) as those that are undisturbed. If not, then perhaps the transcriptional differences between the two groups are not sleep-specific, but instead reflect varying degrees of exposure to THIP.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the similar critique above, and how Figure R2 addresses this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3- The authors should further discuss the slow action of THIP perfusion vs dFB activation, especially as flies only seem to fall asleep several minutes after THIP is being washed away. Is it a technical artifact? If not, it may not be unreasonable to hypothesize that THIP, at the concentration used, could prevent flies from falling asleep, and that its removal may lower the concentration to a point that allows its sleep-promoting action. The authors could easily test this by extending THIP treatment for another 4-5 minutes.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is partially correct in suggesting a technical artifact: THIP does not get washed away immediately after 5min of perfusion. The drip system we employ means that THIP concentration will slowly increase to the maximum concentration of 0.2mg/ml, and then slowly get diluted away at a rate of 1.25ml/minute (this is all in the Methods). In a previous study (Yap et al, Nature Communications, 2017) we used this exact same perfusion procedure to test a range of THIP concentrations, and settled on 0.2mg/ml as the lowest that reliably induced quiet sleep within 5 minutes. Higher concentrations induced quiet sleep faster, so the alternate explanation proposed by the Reviewer is not supported. We feel that our previous electrophysiological study provided the necessary groundwork for using the same approach and dosage here for our whole-brain imaging readout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c- Comments regarding the behavioral assays</p><p>1- L319-322: the authors conclude that dFB stimulation and THIP consumption have similar behavioral effects on sleep. However, this is inaccurate as in Figure S1 they explain that one increases bout number in both day and night and the other one only during the day.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a caveat about night bout architecture being different (lines 353-356). Figure S1 is now Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2- The behavioral definitions used for active and quiet sleep do not fit well with strong evidence that deep sleep (defined by lowered metabolic rates) is probably most closely associated with bouts of inactivity that are much longer than the &gt;5min duration used here, i.e., probably 30min and longer (Stahl et al. 2017 Sleep 40: zsx084). Given that the authors are providing evidence that quiet sleep is correlated with changes in the expression of metabolism related genes, they should at least discuss the fact that reductions in metabolism have been shown to occur after relatively long bouts of inactivity and might reconsider their behavioral sleep analysis (i.e., their criteria for sleep state) with this in mind.</p></disp-quote><p>Interestingly, induced sleep bout durations are on average longer for the optogenetic manipulation (40min vs 25min); this was evident in Figure S1C vs S1F (now Figure 3). So as discussed above, this provides a counterargument for sleep bout duration alone being indicative of metabolic processes associated with quiet sleep: the optogenetic dataset did not uncover metabolic-related pathways as relevant to that sleep manipulation. We refer to Stahl et al, Sleep, 2017, in our discussion (lines 748-750), making exactly this point about metabolic rates being decreased in longer sleep bouts, and flowing up with our observation that optogenetic flies sleep just as much, and their bouts are actually longer. So clearly different processes must be involved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d- Comments regarding the recordings of neuronal activity</p><p>1- There is an additional concern regarding the proposed active and quiet sleep states that rest at the heart of this study. Here these two states in the fly are compared to the REM and NREM sleep states observed in mammals and the parallels between active fly sleep and REM and quiet fly sleep and NREM provide the framework for the study. The establishment of such parallel sleep states in the fly is highly significant and identifying the physiological and molecular correlates of distinct sleep stages in the fly is of critical importance to the field. However, the proposal that the dorsal fan shaped body (dFB) neurons promote active sleep runs counter to the prevailing model that these neurons act as a major site of sleep homeostasis. If quiet sleep were akin to NREM, wouldn't we expect the major site of sleep homeostasis in the brain to promote it? Furthermore, the authors state that the effects of dFB neuron excitation on transcription have &quot;almost no overlap&quot; (line 500) with the transcriptomic effects of sleep deprivation (Supplementary Table 3), which is not what would be expected if dFB neurons are tracking sleep pressure and promoting sleep, as suggested by a growing body of convergent work summarized on page four of the manuscript. Wouldn't the 10h excitation of the dFB neurons be predicted to mimic the effects of sleep deprivation if these neurons &quot;...serve as the discharge circuit for the insect's sleep homeostat...&quot; (line 60)? Shouldn't their prolonged excitation produce an artificial increase in sleep drive (even during sleep) that would favor deep, restorative sleep? How do the authors interpret their results with regard to the current prevailing model that dFB neurons act as a major site of sleep homeostasis? This study could be seen as evidence against it, but the authors do not discuss this in their Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>These are all excellent and thoughtful points, which have made us re-think parts of our discussion. First off, the potential comparison with REM and NREM is entirely speculative, and we have tried to make that more obvious in introduction and the discussion (e.g, see lines 43, 708, 818). The evidence that the FB neurons (and maybe others) are involved in the homeostatic regulation of sleep is well-supported in the literature, so that part of the discussion holds. However, we concede that the timing of our sleep manipulations could benefit from more explanation. We conducted these during the flies’ subjective day, after the animals had presumably had a good night’s sleep. This means that we induced either kind of sleep for 10 daytime hours, which presumably replaced whatever behavioural states would ‘naturally’ be happening during the day. Female flies sleep less during the day than at night, and we have shown in previous work that daytime sleep quality is different than night-time sleep (van Alphen et al, Journal of Neuroscience, 2013), leading us to suggest that most ‘deep’ or quiet sleep happens at night, for flies. Following this reasoning, daytime optogenetic activation might not be depriving flies of much quiet sleep, or accumulating a deep sleep drive as the Reviewer proposes. Rather, both induced sleep manipulations could be providing 10 hours of either kind of sleep that the flies don’t really ‘need’. Why did we design it this way? Firstly, we were interested in simply asking what these chronic sleep manipulations do to gene expression in rested flies, and how they might be similar or different. We focussed on daytime manipulations to avoid precisely the confound of sleep pressure, and also because we observed red-light artifacts at night for our optogenetic experiments (which we reported). Our sleep deprivation strategy was designed specifically as a control for the THIP (Gaboxadol) experiments, to control for non-sleep related effects of the drug (see below our rationale for why this was less crucial for the optogenetic experiments). In conclusion, we had a logical rationale for how the experiments were done, centred on the straightforward question of whether these two different approaches to sleep induction were having similar effects in well-rested flies. In retrospect, we were not anticipating the Reviewer’s thoughtful logic regarding the dFB’s potential role in also regulating deep sleep homeostasis. We now provide some discussion along these lines to make readers aware of this line of reasoning, as well as our rationale for why prolonged optogenetic sleep induction was not sleep-depriving (lines 768-777).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2- Regarding the physiological effects of Gaboxadol, to what extent is the quieting induced by this drug reminiscent of physiology of the brains of flies spontaneously meeting the behavioral criterion for quiet sleep? Given the relatively high dose of the drug being delivered to the de-sheathed brain in the imaging experiments (at least when compared to the dose used in the fly food), one worries that the authors may be inducing a highly abnormal brain state that might bear very little resemblance to the deeply sleeping brain under normal conditions. As the authors acknowledge, it is difficult to compare these two situations. Comparing the physiological state of brains put to sleep by Gaboxadol and brains that have spontaneously entered a deep sleep state therefore seems critical.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, our Gaboxadol (THIP) perfusion concentration (0.2mg/ml) was the minimal dosage that effectively induced sleep within 5 minutes, based upon previously published work (Yap et al, Nature Communications, 2017). Lower concentrations were unreliable, with some never inducing sleep at all. Comparisons with feeding THIP are tenuous, and we make that clear in our discussion (lines 731-735). Nevertheless, the Reviewer makes an excellent point about comparisons with spontaneous ‘quiet’ sleep. Here, we feel well supported (please see Author response image 3 below, comparing THIP-induced sleep (this work, B) and spontaneous sleep (A) from previous study). In our previous study (Tainton-Heap et al, 2021) we showed that neural activity and connectivity decreases during spontaneous quiet sleep. This is what we also see with THIP perfusion. In contrast, in Troup et al, J. of Neuroscience (2023) we confirm that neither neural activity nor connectivity changes during optogenetic R23E10 activation, and general anesthesia – unlike THIP – does NOT produce a quiet brain state. Our finding that THIP effects are nothing like general anesthesia (at the level of brain activity levels) suggests a physiological sleep state closer to spontaneous quiet sleep. We elaborate on this important observation in our results, also pointing to crucial differences with general anesthesia (lines 411-415).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>THIP-induced sleep resembles quiet spontaneous sleep.</title><p>A.

It is not clear whether these panels show representative traces or an average, however both the baseline activity and fluorescence are different between C and D, in particular in their amplitude. Therefore, it is difficult to attribute the differences between C and D to the stimulation itself or to the previously different baseline. In addition, the fact that flies with dFB activation seem to keep a basal level of locomotor activity whereas THIP-treated ones don't is quite striking, however it is not being discussed. Finally, the authors claim that the flies eventually wake up from THIP-induced sleep (L360-361), however there are no data to support this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>These are representative traces, which is a way of showing the raw calcium data (Cell ID) so readers can see for themselves that one manipulation silences whereas the other does not – even though flies become inactive for both. The Y-axis scale is standard deviation of the experiment mean. Since THIP decreases neural activity, then the baseline is comparatively higher. Since optogenetic activation does not change average neural activity levels, the baseline is centered on zero. This is an outcome of our analysis method and does not reflect any ‘true’ baseline. We have now clarified this in our figure legend. We now also confess that flies rendered asleep optogenetically can be ‘twitchy’ (line 374). Finally, we show data for 3 flies that were recorded until they woke up. The rest were verified behaviorally, after the experiment. This is now explained in the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4- In Figure 4C, it is strange that the SEM is always exactly the same across the whole experiment.

This is because of the way we did the analysis, asking how many flies responded to each stimulus event, with incremental levels of responsiveness. This is explained in the Methods. The figure makes the important point of sleep and recovery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e- Comments regarding the transcript analyses</p><p>1- General comment: the title of this manuscript is inaccurate - the &quot;transcriptome&quot; commonly refers to the entirety of all transcripts in a cell/tissue/organ/animal (including genes that are not differentially expressed following their interventions), and it is therefore impossible to &quot;engage two non-overlapping transcriptomes&quot; in the same tissue. Perhaps the word &quot;transcriptional programs&quot; or transcriptional profiles&quot; would be more accurate here?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this advice and have changed the title as proposed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2- Given the sensitivity of transcriptomic methods, there is a significant concern that the optogenetic experiments are not as well controlled as they could be. Given the need for supplemental all-trans retinal (ATR) for functional light gating of channelrhodopsins in the fly, it is convenient to use flies with Gal4-driven opsin that have not been given supplemental ATR as a negative control, particularly as a control for the effects of light. However, there is another critical control to do here. Flies bearing the UAS-opsin responder element but lacking the GAL4 driver and that have been fed ATR are critical for confirming that the observed effects of optogenetic stimulation are indeed caused by the specific excitation of the targeted neurons and not due to leaky opsin expression, or the effect of ATR feeding under light stimulation or some combination of these factors. Given the sensitivity of transcriptomic methods, it would be good to see that the candidate transcripts identified by comparing ATR+ and ATR- R23E10GAL4/UAS-Chrimson flies are also apparent when comparing R23E10GAL4/UAS-Chrimson (ATR+) with UAS-Chrimson (ATR+) alone.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not done these experiments on UAS-Chrimson/+ controls. Like many others in our field, we viewed non-ATR flies as the best controls, because this involves identical genotypes. Since we were however aware that ATR feeding itself could be affect gene expression, we specifically checked for this with our early (1hour) collection timepoint. We only found 26 gene expression differences between ATR and -ATR flies at this early timepoint, compared with 277 for the 10-hour timepoint. We detail this rationale in our results, explaining why this is a convincing control for ATR feeding. If there was leaky opsin expression / activity, this would have been evident in our design. Regarding the cumulative effect of light, this would also have been accounted in our design, as only 1 hour would have elapsed in our first timepoint compared to 10 hours in our second. While the Reviewer is correct in saying that parental controls are called for in many <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiments, this becomes quickly unmanageable in transcriptomic studies, which is exactly why well-designed +ATR vs -ATR comparisons in the exact same strain are most appropriate. We feel that our 1-hr timepoint mostly addresses this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3- Figures about qPCR experiments (5G and 6G) are problematic. First, whereas the authors seem satisfied with the 'good correspondence' between their RNA-seq and qPCR results, this is true for only ~9/19 genes in 5G and 2/6 genes in 6G. Whereas discrepancies are not rare between RNA-seq and qPCR, the text in L460-461 and 540-541 is misleading. In addition, it is unclear whether the n = 19 in L458 refers to the number of genes tested or the number of replicates. If the qPCR includes replicates, this should be more clearly mentioned, and error bars should be added to the corresponding figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We consider that our qPCR validations were convincing, as they were all mostly changed in the ‘right’ direction. We agree that are some discrepancies, so have modified our language to reflect this. We have also clarified that 19 refers to the number of genes validated by qPCR in that THIP dataset. All qPCRs involved three technical replicates. We prefer to keep these histograms the way they are to convey these simple trends. For complete transparency, we now provide a supplemental Excel worksheet with all of the qPCR data, alongside corresponding RNAseq data and stats for the selected genes (Supplementary Table 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4- There is a lack of error bars for all their RNAseq and qPCR comparisons, which is particularly surprising because the authors went to great lengths and analyzed an applaudably large amount of independent biological replicates, yet the variability observed in the corresponding molecular data is not reported.</p></disp-quote><p>The genes reported in each of our datasets and associated supplemental figures and tables were all significant, as determined by criteria outlined in the Methods. However, we appreciate that readers might want to get a sense of the values and variances involved, as well as access to the entire gene datasets. We now provide all of these as additional ‘sheets’ in our existing supplemental tables (S2-S7), so this should be very easy to navigate and evaluate. In addition to the previously provided lists for significant genes, in the second Excel sheet (‘All genes’) readers will be able to see the data for all 5 replicates, for the significant genes as well as all other ~15,000 genes (listed in alphabetical order). We feel that this will be a helpful resource, because admittedly significance thresholds can still be a little arbitrary and some readers might want to look up ‘their’ genes of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments to authors</p><p>Other comments</p><p>1- Text in L441 &amp; 606 is misleading.

In particular, their behavioral data is difficult to reconcile with the RNA-seq data showing overexpression of both short sleep increasing and short sleep decreasing subunits. Without knowing where in the brain these subunits are required for controlling sleep, the data in Figure 7 is difficult to appreciate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now conducted additional experiments where we specifically knocked down these alpha receptor subunits (all 7 of them) in the R23E10 neurons. This seemed an obvious knockdown location, to determine if any of these subunits regulated activity in the same sleep promoting neurons that were the focus of this study. We found that alpha1 knockdown in these neurons had similar sleep phenotypes, which we believe is an important result. Since this functional localisation is a logical ending for the paper, we have now made it the final figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions &amp; comments</p><p>1- It would be interesting if the authors could discuss their findings that metabolism genes are downregulated in THIP flies in the context of recent work that showed upregulation of mitochondrial ROS after sleep deprivation (Kempf et al, 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>We now add the Kempf 2019 reference and allude to how those findings could be consistent with ours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2- The fact that THIP-induced sleep persists long after THIP removal (Fig 3D) is very intriguing and interesting. This suggests that the drug might trigger a sleep-inducing pathway that can continue on its own without the drug, once activated.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct, and in stark contrast to the optogenetic manipulation we employ, which does not appear to show such sleep inertia. We have now added a sentence highlighting this interesting difference (lines 394-396).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3- The authors identify many new genes regulated in response to specific methods for sleep induction. These are all potentially interesting candidates for further studies investigating the molecular basis of sleep. It would be interesting to know which of these genes are already known to display circadian expression patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>By providing all of the gene lists, these are now available to ask questions such as these. We hesitate however to delve into this domain for this work, as our main goal was to compare these two kinds of sleep in flies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4- The brain-wide monitoring of neural activity invites a number of very exciting follow-up experiments - most importantly, it would be fascinating to establish, which neurons are active in the different phases the authors describe! Are these neurons that are involved in transmitting external visual stimuli to the central brain? Do they also project into the central complex? They could make use of the large collection of existing driver lines in the fly and they could also exploit the extraordinary knowledge of the connectome and transcriptome of the fly brain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for sharing our enthusiasm for these likely future directions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5- The Dalpha2,3,4,6 and 7 Knock-out strains they generate will be a useful reagent for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroscience community once the efficiency/success of the knock-out has been confirmed by qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>These knockout strains have all been confirmed by our co-authors Hang Luong, Trent Perry, and Philip Batterham. These knockout confirmations are outlined in publications that we reference (Perry et al, 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>1- This study has employed custom-built apparatus and custom-written code/scripts, but these do not appear to be available to the reader.

The imaging hardware and analysis code are identical to what was described in a previous publication, and available as directed therein (Tainton-Heap et al, 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2- Also, the authors should give details on the food used to rear their flies. Fly media comes in several common forms and sleep is sensitive to diet.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been elaborated in the beginning of the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3- The light regime used for optogenetic excitation of dFB neurons consists of 12h of uninterrupted bright red LED light. Most optogenetic stimulations consist of pulsed high frequency flashes interlaced with pauses in illumination. Can dFB neurons be driven constitutively with 12 hours of bright light?</p></disp-quote><p>We showed in Tainton-Heap (2021) that 7Hz pulsed red light had exactly the same effect on R23E10/Chrimson readouts as continuous red light, which is why we opted here to provide continuous red light. That optogenetic sleep induction can be driven continuously for 12 hours is evident by our 24-hour sleep profiles. However, we agree that one could question whether sleep quality is similar after 12 hours. To address this, we did an additional experiment where we stimulated the flies hourly, to determine if their behavioural responsiveness to mechanical stimuli changed over the course of continued sleep induction, for both optogenetic and THIP-induced sleep. We present the data below in Author response image 4. As can be seen in these new analyses, while optogenetic sleep induction persists across 12 daytime hours (speed is close to zero throughout), flies do indeed become more responsive later in the day. This could have two different interpretations: either some sleep functions are being satisfied over time, or the activation regime is becoming less effective over time. Either way, these data show that at our 10-hour daytime timepoint, unstimulated flies are still largely inactive, even though their arousal thresholds might have gradually changed; so the uninterrupted red-light regime is still effective. The comparison with THIP is interesting: here there does not seem to be a change in responsiveness over time; the drug just decreases behavioral responsiveness throughout. Together, these experiments support our view that both approaches are sleep-promoting throughout the 12-hour day, although we appreciate that sleep quality is not identical.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Responsiveness to mechanical stimuli.</title><p>(A) The average speed of baseline (grey) and optogenetically-activated flies (green) across 24 hours.

This is an excellent control. Why have the authors not done the same with the optogenetic treatment? It's surprising not to see this control given the concern the authors express (lines 501 - 502) that the dFB manipulation might be paralyzing awake flies, which certainly seems possible given the light regimes used. Why not test this directly with SNAP?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that this may have been a valuable additional control. However, we designed this control for the THIP experiments specifically because of concerns about THIP’s (yet unknown) mechanism of action in flies. THIP is a gabaergic drug with most likely many off-target effects that have little to do with sleep, hence the need for a control where we compare to flies that ingested THIP but have been prevented from sleeping. In contrast, R23E10-driven sleep induction is exactly that, a circuit when activated that induces sleep. Whatever specific neurons might really be involved, the Gal4 circuit is sleep-inducing. This is well supported by multiple publications. The most appropriate control for assessing transcriptomic effects during optogenetic sleep here is not preventing sleep, but rather no increased sleep in flies that have not ingested ATR, and comparing that to effects of ATR alone, which is what we have done. Adding a sleep-deprivation layer onto both of these analyses may have been interesting, but a lot more analyses and not strictly required to identify relevant sleep-related genes. We have rephrased the misleading sentence about paralyzing flies, to instead clarify that lack of overlap with the SD dataset suggests that optogenetic activation is not preventing sleep functions from being engaged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5- A pairwise comparison of ZT01 and ZT10 does not address circadian expression cycles in a meaningful way. There will be strong effects of the LD cycle here. I suggest toning this down.

Doesn't that lead to a whole range of very different behaviors?

Flies wake up enough to have a good feed (see Author response image 2) and then go back to sleep.
