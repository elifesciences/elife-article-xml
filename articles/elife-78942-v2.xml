to injury. However, the signals that activate these cells and the mechanisms governing how these cells renew or differentiate are highly context-dependent and incompletely understood, particularly in non-hematopoietic tissues. In the skin, melanocyte stem and progenitor cells are responsible for replenishing mature pigmented melanocytes. In mammals, these cells reside in the hair follicle bulge and bulb niches where they are activated during homeostatic hair follicle turnover and following melanocyte destruction, as occurs in vitiligo and other skin hypopigmentation disorders. Recently, we identified melanocyte progenitors in adult zebrafish skin. To elucidate mechanisms governing melanocyte progenitor renewal and differentiation we analyzed individual transcriptomes from thousands of melanocyte lineage cells during the regeneration process. We identified transcriptional signatures for progenitors, deciphered transcriptional changes and intermediate cell states during regeneration, and analyzed cell–cell signaling changes to discover mechanisms governing melanocyte regeneration. We identified KIT signaling via the RAS/MAPK pathway as a regulator of melanocyte progenitor direct differentiation and asymmetric division. Our findings show how activation of different subpopulations of <italic>mitfa</italic>-positive cells underlies cellular transitions required to properly reconstitute the melanocyte pigmentary system following injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>melanocytes</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>melanocyte stem cells</kwd><kwd><italic>Danio rerio</italic></kwd><kwd>stem cell biology</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR081355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frantz</surname><given-names>William Tyler</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM107000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frantz</surname><given-names>William Tyler</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA130807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frantz</surname><given-names>William Tyler</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Zebrafish pigment cell progenitors are a heterogeneous class of adult tissue-resident cells which reiterate developmental signaling during melanocyte regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult stem and progenitor cells are responsible for adult tissue maintenance and critical in recovery from injury. These cells are maintained through renewal, often self-renewal, and respond to tissue injury by proliferating or differentiating. Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs), which are found in the hair follicle niche in mammals, are adult stem cells that replenish melanocytes, which ultimately impart pigment to hair and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Slominski et al., 2005</xref>). Mechanisms governing adult stem and progenitor cell behavior are critical to maintaining proper tissue function as well as recovery from injury or disease.</p><p>Zebrafish, with their characteristic stripes of pigment-retaining dermal melanocytes, have emerged as a useful model to study melanocyte regeneration. Ablation of embryonic and adult melanocytes results in generation of new melanocytes from tissue-resident stem or progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hultman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Reilly-Pol and Johnson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rawls and Johnson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). Cells involved in melanocyte regeneration were identified in adult zebrafish stripes as unpigmented cells that are admixed with mature melanocytes and express <italic>mitfa</italic>, the zebrafish ortholog of the MITF melanocyte lineage regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>). These zebrafish melanocyte progenitors respond to injury by either differentiating into mature melanocytes to reconstitute the skin’s pigment pattern or dividing asymmetrically to generate an unpigmented daughter and another daughter that ultimately differentiates into a melanocyte. Additional cells divide symmetrically, and they are hypothesized to replenish the progenitor pool of cells for subsequent responses to injury. Notably, unpigmented daughter cells from progenitor divisions can, following subsequent injury, directly differentiate, indicating a plasticity of fates that can be adopted by progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>). Other tissue-resident cells, such as murine basal epidermal stem cells, can also adopt different fates during regeneration. These epidermal stem cells appear initially uncommitted, with environmental signals likely to trigger self-renewal or differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rompolas et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Identification of zebrafish melanocyte progenitors facilitated our investigation of mechanisms governing differentiation. In vivo imaging revealed that the unpigmented progenitors upregulate WNT signaling prior to undergoing differentiation, and animals treated with WNT inhibitor fail to regenerate. Meanwhile, symmetric and asymmetric divisions were unaffected, demonstrating a fate-specific requirement for WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>). Like in the zebrafish, previous murine studies have identified coordinated WNT signaling as a key regulator of differentiation during melanocyte regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rabbani et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, profiling of stem cells and melanocyte single-cell transcriptomes from regenerating hair follicles has revealed coordinated activation of WNT/BMP signaling as a gate governing differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Infarinato et al., 2020</xref>). These studies underline the conserved mechanisms regulating melanocyte regeneration in murine and zebrafish models, emphasizing the utility of studying adult progenitors in zebrafish.</p><p>While the mechanisms governing stem cell fates during regeneration have been elucidated in some tissues, adult stem cell identities and responses to injury are incompletely understood. Some tissue-resident stem cells, such as epidermal hair follicle and basal epidermal stem cells, rely on positional cues for fate determination, suggestive of a stochastic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rompolas and Greco, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rompolas et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, other tissue-resident stem cells, such as hematopoietic and lung epithelial stem cells, appear to be organized in a hierarchical manner with a self-renewing common multipotent stem cell giving rise to lineage-committed progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laurenti and Göttgens, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McQualter et al., 2010</xref>). Even within the same stem cell pool the behaviors can be context dependent. In response to injury, murine McSCs will prioritize differentiation over self-renewal, but in normal hair follicle turnover these cells engage in balanced differentiation and self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2002</xref>). It is currently unknown if the different McSC and melanocyte progenitor behaviors observed in murine and zebrafish regeneration studies are due to heterogeneity within the stem/progenitor cell pool or the ability of similar stem/progenitor cells to adopt different fates stochastically. To date, most analysis of McSCs has relied on in vivo imaging and targeted transcriptomics, potentially missing the role of mixed transcriptional responses to injury. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has been used to dissect the extraordinary heterogeneity and transcription dynamics present in developing pigment cell lineages as well as melanocyte regeneration and offers new powerful insights into signaling mechanisms governing progenitor fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Infarinato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saunders et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we utilize single-cell transcriptomics to find that zebrafish melanocyte progenitors are a heterogenous group of <italic>mitfa</italic>-expressing cells within the melanocyte stripe which require KIT signaling to directly differentiate during melanocyte regeneration. Importantly, changes in gene expression of progenitors during regeneration are well conserved between mice and zebrafish. Lastly, we observe that heterogeneity of progenitors, evident in distinct transcriptional signatures, underlies the different fates adopted by these cells – direct differentiation versus division – during regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adult melanocyte lineage cells revealed by single-cell RNA-sequencing</title><p>During melanocyte regeneration, unpigmented <italic>mitfa</italic>-expressing cells in the zebrafish stripe engage in coupled differentiation and division to replenish lost melanocytes and maintain the pool of unpigmented progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>). To identify the mechanisms governing these behaviors we sought to capture cell states and transcriptional changes in the melanocyte lineage during regeneration. Melanocyte progenitors are rare, so we generated a <italic>Tg(mitfa:nlsEGFP)</italic> reporter line and sorted EGFP-positive cells to isolate the 0.19% of total cells which express <italic>mitfa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We utilized neocuproine to ablate mature melanocytes, leading to the destruction of stripe melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Reilly-Pol and Johnson, 2008</xref>), then performed scRNAseq on <italic>mitfa:nlsEGFP</italic>-positive cells following melanocyte destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In all, we obtained transcriptomes of 29,453 wild-type cells across six time points before, during, and after melanocyte regeneration. Quality control and pre-processing followed by dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering identified several subpopulations of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Analysis of captured cells revealed that 87.5% were positive for endogenous <italic>mitfa</italic> expression, reinforcing the success of our enrichment strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The vast majority of <italic>mitfa</italic>-expressing cells were in the two large subgroups, and expression of <italic>sox10</italic>, <italic>tyrp1b</italic>, <italic>aox5</italic>, and other markers was consistent with these subgroups containing pigment cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Expression of the <italic>tyrp1b</italic> melanin biosynthesis gene was limited to one subpopulation, and we have assigned this subpopulation as differentiated (and differentiating) melanocytes. Expression of another differentiated melanocyte marker, <italic>pmela</italic>, confirmed this assignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The two large subgroups were distinguished from one another by their differential expression of the <italic>aox5</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). <italic>aox5</italic> is expressed in differentiated xanthophores, a pteridine- and carotenoid-containing pigment cell type of zebrafish, and in some undifferentiated pigment progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parichy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saunders et al., 2019</xref>). Expression of additional marker genes defined subpopulations of differentiated xanthophores and a third type of pigment cell, iridophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3A</xref>). Additionally, <italic>pcna</italic> and <italic>mki67</italic> expression highlighted areas of proliferation within the <italic>mitfa<sup>+</sup>aox5</italic><sup><italic>lo</italic></sup> and <italic>mitfa<sup>+</sup>aox5<sup>hi</sup></italic> subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The non-<italic>mitfa</italic>-expressing clusters comprised other cell populations such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts, immune cells, and Schwann cells, based on expression of canonical cell-type marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Our cell-type assignments generally agree with cells obtained in a transcriptomic analysis of cell lineages that expressed the <italic>sox10</italic> neural crest and pigment cell marker during development, supporting the robustness of our approach to capture these cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saunders et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single-cell transcriptomic identification of melanocyte lineage cells during regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top, diagram of zebrafish flank with melanocyte stripes.

Because of this as well as the expression of genes typically observed in the neural crest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), the tissue from which melanocytes are derived during embryonic development, we considered these two subpopulations as putative progenitors and have designated them as melanocyte progenitor-0 (MP-0) and melanocyte progenitor-1 (MP-1). The MP-0 and MP-1 subpopulations themselves showed gene expression differences (e.g., <italic>dio3a</italic> and <italic>bco2b</italic>) that drove their separate cluster assignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>).

To validate that our scRNAseq procedure was reproducible enough to enable comparisons between samples, we performed independent sampling of <italic>mitfa</italic>-positive cells without any melanocyte ablation. The cell sampling prevalence between single-cell runs was consistent, as seen by comparing proportions of cell types from two independent, pre-ablation samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), giving confidence to our inter-sample comparisons.

However, our analyses thus far were limited to our real-time sampling and could miss cellular transitions during biological process time. To interrogate whether transcriptional changes present in our samples reflect cellular transitions during regeneration, we utilized a latent variable, pseudotime analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>). We applied the R package monocle3 to learn graph trajectories for our <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>aox5</italic><sup>lo</sup> subgroup of cells, which includes melanocyte progenitor and mature melanocyte subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). We set the MP-0 subpopulation as pseudotime 0, an approach validated by known neural crest and melanocyte synthesis markers as well as RNA splicing mechanics as determined by RNA velocity analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>). Pseudotime analysis projected onto the <italic>mitfa</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>aox5</italic><sup>lo</sup> subgroup of cells suggested two trajectories: one from the MP-0 subpopulation through the direct differentiation subpopulation into melanocytes and another branching through the MP-1 and cycling differentiation subpopulations into melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Using this graph projection, we ordered the cells by biological pseudotime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Progenitors are low pseudotime cells (enriched for <italic>sox4a</italic>, <italic>sox10</italic>, and no melanin synthesis genes) while melanocytes are high pseudotime cells (enriched for <italic>tyrp1b</italic> and <italic>pmela</italic>). High pseudotime melanocytes were lost following ablation between days 0 and 1, resulting in a distribution of predominantly low pseudotime progenitors at day 1. Then, as regeneration proceeded the intermediate cell states became enriched and can be visualized as medium pseudotime cells in days 2–5. Ultimately, as regeneration proceeded, high pseudotime melanocytes were regained. This pseudotime dynamic mirrors what is seen in vivo when unpigmented <italic>mitfa</italic>-positive progenitor cells divide or directly differentiate, reinforcing that the progenitor populations we have defined through scRNAseq correspond to progenitors observed in vivo. Together these analyses provide a comprehensive picture of changes in progenitor transcriptomes during melanocyte regeneration which mirror real-time regeneration observations.</p><p>To assess if our approach could inform broader mechanisms governing melanocyte regeneration, we compared our zebrafish melanocyte progenitor signatures with a mammalian McSC signature. A single-cell transcriptomic analysis of murine progenitors during hair follicle homeostatic cycling provided an opportunity to compare zebrafish and mammalian signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Infarinato et al., 2020</xref>). Clustering of 626 wild-type murine McSCs and melanocytes revealed four populations of previously described cells: quiescent McSCs (qMcSCs), activated McSCs (aMcSCs), cycling McSCs, and melanocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Infarinato et al., 2020</xref>). Visualization of this structure reveals similarities to the previously computed zebrafish clustering, where non-cycling progenitors are separated from mature melanocytes by intermediate cell populations. To assess similarities in gene expression we calculated marker genes for each zebrafish and murine subpopulation, and then visualized conserved gene signatures via heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As murine McSCs progress from qMcSCs to differentiated melanocytes they lose expression of <italic>Zeb2</italic>, <italic>Pax3</italic>, and AP-1 FOS and JUN family subunits, while upregulating melanin synthesis genes such as <italic>Tyrp1</italic> and <italic>Oca2</italic>. These changes mirror the transcriptional profiles found in our zebrafish dataset. Lastly, to visualize correlation between zebrafish and murine populations we calculated cluster-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs), mapped these to murine orthologs, and then scored the murine populations with these zebrafish signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Through these comparisons, we find that our MP-0 and MP-1 subpopulations are most similar to qMcSCs. The zebrafish direct differentiation subpopulation, much like when it is compared to other zebrafish subpopulations, shares aspects of murine McSC and more differentiated subpopulations. The zebrafish cycling differentiation subpopulation most strongly overlaps with murine cycling McSC subpopulation. And as expected, mature pigment producing melanocytes in each dataset are most like each other. These signature scores reflect the positional similarities we see in UMAP visualization where qMcSC and MP-0 and MP-1 are most stem-like and least differentiated. Overall, these signatures support a shared gene signature of differentiation during melanocyte progenitor activation, supporting the use of zebrafish to uncover conserved signaling pathways governing melanocyte regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Signaling pathway dynamics in progenitors uncover the KIT signaling axis as a candidate regulator of melanocyte regeneration</title><p>To identify signaling pathways governing melanocyte regeneration we first analyzed potential receptor–ligand interactions using NicheNetR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browaeys et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, NicheNetR calculates transcriptional changes in a target ‘receiver’ cell population between time samples. It uses these DEGs to predict ligands responsible for the observed behavior. Finally, it matches the expression of these ligands on potential ‘sender’ cells with cognate receptors on the receiver cell subpopulation. We designated our identified progenitor subpopulations as receptor-expressing receiver cells and all other cell types as potential ligand sender cells. We compared gene expression in our regenerating progenitors (MP0 and MP1) on days 2, 3, and 5 to progenitor gene expression in the unactivated day 0 controls. Data shown are from day 3 versus day 0, although comparisons of day 2 or 5 versus day 0 show similar results. We then filtered down top scoring ligand/receptor pairs to NicheNetR’s ‘bona fide’ literature-supported pairs. This approach identified several signaling systems with known roles in melanocyte biology, including KITLG/KIT, ASIP/MC1R, EDN3/EDNRB, and NRG1/ERBB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hultman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>).

To assess if these differences resulted from lineage defects during regeneration, we performed serial imaging in <italic>kita(lf)</italic> mutants containing the <italic>mitfa(nls:EGFP)</italic> transgene. Serial imaging revealed a greater than eightfold decrease in progenitors undergoing direct differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Asymmetric divisions were also decreased by twofold. Serial imaging of <italic>kitlga(lf); Tg(mitfa:nlsEGFP)</italic> mutants showed similar defects as those observed in <italic>kita(lf)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Together, these data elucidate paths and signaling requirements for the two fates adopted by progenitors to regenerate new melanocytes. In one fate progenitors directly differentiate through an intermediate cell state before becoming melanocytes. This fate has a strong requirement for KIT signaling. In the other fate, progenitors take part in asymmetric divisions to generate new melanocytes. This fate path is characterized by co-expression of differentiation and cell cycle genes and is also affected, albeit less so, by defects in KIT signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><italic>kita</italic> receptor and <italic>kitlga</italic> ligand loss-of-function mutants have impaired melanocyte regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Brightfield images of the melanocyte stripe before melanocyte ablation and after melanocyte regeneration in wild-type, <italic>kita(lf)</italic>, and <italic>kitlga(lf)</italic> zebrafish strains.

Secondly, this subpopulation expresses markers that are associated with multipotent pigment progenitors cells found during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brombin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunsdon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Budi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johansson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saunders et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Subkhankulova et al., 2023</xref>). Thirdly, although this subpopulation expresses <italic>aox5</italic> and some other markers associated with xanthophores, we showed that differentiated xanthophores are not ablated by the melanocyte-ablating drug neocuproine and this <italic>mitfa<sup>+</sup>aox5<sup>hi</sup></italic> subpopulation does not make new pigmented xanthophores following neocuproine treatment. However, current observations cannot definitively determine the potency and fates adopted by these cells. One possibility is that these cells are indeed progenitors that arise through cell divisions, are in an as yet undefined way lineally related to MP-0 and MP-1 subpopulations, and ultimately give rise to new melanocytes during additional rounds of regeneration. Given their expression of markers associated with multipotent pigment cell progenitors, these cells could be multipotent but fated toward the melanocyte lineage following melanocyte-specific ablation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these cells are another cell type. For example, there is a type of partially differentiated xanthophores that populate adult melanocyte stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>). At least some of these cells arise from embryonic xanthophores that transitioned through a cryptic and proliferative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>). That the descendants remain partially differentiated could indicate that they are in more of a xanthoblast state and maintain proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eom et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that some or all of the cells in question are melanocyte stripe-resident, partially differentiated xanthophores that arise: (1) from cell divisions that are triggered by loss of interactions with melanocytes, or (2) simply to fill space that is vacated due to melanocyte death. Such causes for partially differentiated xanthophore divisions have not been documented, but nonetheless this possibility must be considered given the <italic>mitfa</italic> and <italic>aox5</italic> expression and proliferative potential of these cells. Transcriptional profiles of ‘cryptic’ xanthophores are not available to help clarify the nature of these cells. Lastly, the relationship between adult progenitor populations – MP-0, MP-1 and, potentially, <italic>mitfa<sup>+</sup>aox5</italic><sup><italic>hi</italic></sup> G2/M adj – and other progenitors present at earlier developmental stages is unclear and could be defined through additional long-term lineage tracing studies. In particular, previous examinations of pigment cell progenitors in developing zebrafish have identified dorsal root ganglion-associated pigment cell progenitors in larvae that contribute to adult pigmentation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Budi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dooley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that these cells give rise to the adult progenitors we have identified. The further alignment of cell types that have been observed in vivo and cell subpopulations defined through expression profiling is a necessary route for understanding the complex relationship between stem and progenitor cells in development, homeostasis, and regeneration.</p><p>Our investigation of KIT signaling sheds light on how the process of melanocyte regeneration is controlled. KIT signaling has well-known roles in melanocyte development in promoting the differentiation, survival and migration of melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rawls and Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we have found that KIT signaling is reactivated during melanocyte regeneration to enable progenitors to generate new melanocytes. Specifically, shortly after melanocyte ablation we observed increased expression of the <italic>kitlga</italic> ligand, and the increased expression of <italic>kitlga</italic> was coupled with an increase in MAPK signaling in progenitors. KIT receptor mutants showed a profound reduction in cells in the direct differentiation subpopulation and a less marked, but nonetheless significant, reduction in the cycling differentiation subpopulation. In these mutants there were no changes in the <italic>mitfa<sup>+</sup>aox5<sup>hi</sup></italic> cycling subpopulation. For some context, studies of Kit dependence during the hair cycle in the mouse found that McSCs could be divided into two groups, a Kit-independent quiescent McSC pool and an activated, cycling, Kit-dependent McSC pool that is derived from the quiescent McSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ueno et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, the quiescent pool of McSCs was spared during treatment with anti-Kit neutralizing antibody whereas the activated, cycling McSCs died as a result of Kit inhibition. In our study we find that MP-0 and MP-1 subpopulations are similarly unaffected by <italic>kita</italic> loss of function. However, the subpopulations that are products of MP-0 and MP-1 activation during regeneration – direct differentiation and cycling differentiation subpopulations – are both impacted by <italic>kita</italic> loss. Thus, whereas quiescent McSCs in the mouse and melanocyte progenitors in the zebrafish are insensitive to loss of Kit activity, cells derived from these subpopulations become sensitive to loss of Kit. Interestingly, although melanocyte progenitors in our study were unaffected by loss of <italic>kita</italic>, we nonetheless found that MAPK signaling was decreased in progenitors as a result of <italic>kita</italic> loss. This suggests that, while zebrafish subpopulations of progenitors might upregulate KIT-dependent MAPK signaling during regeneration, it is the products of these progenitors that are deficient. This indicates a potential role for Kit in the specification or survival of cycling differentiation and direct differentiation subpopulations during regeneration.</p><p>Overall, our study has found unexpected heterogeneity of progenitor subpopulations, defined new intermediate subpopulations involved in regeneration, and discovered cellular trajectories that link these subpopulations during the regeneration process. Along with providing a greater understanding of melanocyte regeneration in zebrafish and tissue regeneration in general, these findings are relevant to pigmentary disorders and melanoma. In recovery from vitiligo, after the immune-mediated destruction of melanocytes, melanocyte stem cells must be activated and produce differentiated melanocytes that migrate from the hair follicle niche into interfollicular epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eby et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishimura et al., 2010</xref>). By illuminating cellular transitions and molecular signaling pathways involved in regeneration, our studies could assist in the development of treatments or therapeutics for pigmentary disorders to encourage melanocyte progenitor activation, migration, and differentiation. In melanoma, stem cell-like identities are implicated in tumor maintenance and drug resistance. In single-cell analysis of human melanomas, a subpopulation of cells expressing high levels of AXL, a putative cancer stem cell marker, and low levels of MITF were present in treatment-naive human melanoma samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>). These AXL-high MITF-low cells were admixed with AXL-low MITF-high differentiated cells, demonstrating cellular heterogeneity present in untreated melanomas. Furthermore, samples from patients after relapse were enriched for this AXL-high state, furthering the concept that stem-like cells facilitate relapse. Similarly, zebrafish melanoma models have demonstrated the role of a stem-like minimal residual disease cells in facilitating relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Travnickova et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, MITF-low zebrafish melanoma cells had striking transcriptional similarities to invasive melanoma signatures found in humans following treatment with small molecule inhibitors of MEK or BRAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Travnickova et al., 2019</xref>). Additional studies have found stem-like properties in melanoma cells involved in therapeutic resistance and tumor relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boshuizen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Konieczkowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mehta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rambow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). Our study provides a reference to which melanoma cells, as well as cells involved in pigmentary diseases such as vitiligo, can be compared to for identifying relationships between and conserved pathways shared by melanocyte progenitors and cells involved in melanocytic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Differentiation was recognized by melanization, and self-renewal was recognized by a division in which neither daughter cell differentiated. The <italic>aox5</italic> fluorescence intensity of these cells was then measured using Fiji. <italic>aox5:PALM-eGFP</italic> intensity was calculated in ImageJ by determining the mean intensity within a cell, subtracting the background, and log transforming the signal. Differences in <italic>aox5</italic> intensity between traced fates were visualized in Prism 9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>scRNAseq sample prep and FACS enrichment</title><p>Prior to zebrafish dissection the animals were euthanized with 0.85 mg/ml tricaine. Scales were then removed from the lateral aspects of the animal with forceps, and a scalpel was used to cut the epidermal and dermal tissue from the underlying muscle and adipose tissue. Skin was then peeled away with forceps. The skin retrieved was caudal to the gills, dorsal to the lower melanocyte stripe, ventral to the top melanocyte stripe, and rostral to the anal fin. Dissected skin was enzymatically dissociated with Liberase TM (Sigma-Aldrich LIBTM-RO, 0.25 mg/ml in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline) at 32°C for 20 min followed by manual trituration with a glass pipette for 2 min. Cell suspensions were then filtered through a 70-µm Nylon cell strainer. This single-cell suspension was then spun down for 5 min at 1500 pm in an Eppendorf 5810 R swing bucket centrifuge and resuspended in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in dPBS for FACS enrichment. Singlets were then isolated using a series of FSC-A versus SSC-A and FSC-A versus FSC-H gates. We then enriched for our <italic>mitfa:nlsEGFP</italic>-expressing cells using unlabeled WT animals as a negative control. All samples were kept on ice in 0.1% BSA/5% FBS except during enzymatic dissociation. All surfaces encountering the cell solution were coated in 1% BSA before use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>scRNAseq regeneration sampling, library construction sequencing</title><p>For each time point before (day 0) and during (days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10) regeneration we captured transcriptomes from WT and <italic>kita(lf)</italic> fish. To generate sufficient material for single-cell capture 30 zebrafish lateral skins were dissected for each time point and an estimated 10,000 EGFP-positive cells per sample were obtained via FACS. For each sample, we targeted 4000–6000 cells for capture using the 10× Genomics Chromium platform with one sample per lane. Libraries were prepared using the Single Cell 3′ kit (v3.1). Quality control and quantification assays were performed using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher) and a fragment analyzer (Agilent). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using 75-cycle, high output kits with read 1: 28 cycles, index: 8 cycles, read 2: 50 cycles. Each sample was sequenced to an average depth of 216 million total reads resulting in an average read depth of approximately 59,000 reads/cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>scRNAseq sequencing analysis</title><p>We ran the below pipelines in the DolphinNext environment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/dolphinnext">https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/dolphinnext</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yukselen and Kucukural, 2022</xref>) using the Massachusetts Green high Performance Computing Cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yukselen et al., 2020</xref>). Raw base call (BCL) files were analyzed using CellRanger (version 3.1.0). Cell Ranger ‘mkfastq’ was used to generate FASTQ files and ‘count’ was used to generate raw feature-barcode matrices aligned to the Lawson Lab zebrafish transcriptome annotation v4.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lawson et al., 2020</xref>).

These parameters resulted in retention of 29,453 WT cells and 24,724 <italic>kita(lf)</italic> cells across 14 total samples. Each dataset was further pre-processed by log normalizing each dataset with a scale factor of 10,000 and finding 2,000 variable features using the default ‘vst’ method in seruat3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). Datasets were integrated using the WT datasets as references in the ‘FindAnchors’ step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). After integration the integrated dataset was scaled to regress out differences driven by inequalities in total RNA count and mitochondrial capture. The top 60 principal components were used for construction of a UMAP and neighbor finding. During clustering we utilized a resolution parameter of 1.0. The resulting 33 Louvain clusters were visualized in 2D and/or 3D space and were annotated using known biological cell-type markers. Visualization of the UMAP and calculation of DEGs split by sample revealed no observable strong batch effects. Changing any of the above parameters yielded similar cell-type identifications and clustering structures. Both 2000 and 4000 variable features revealed similar results in final cell clustering and DEG analysis. Similarly, using between 20 and 80 principal components and a resolution parameter between 0.5 and 1.2 revealed similar UMAP visualizations and clustering, underlining the robustness of the approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>NicheNetR</title><p>Our analysis identifying potential ligand/receptor pairs regulating progenitor behavior during regeneration utilizes the open-source R implementation of NicheNetR available at GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr">github.com/saeyslab/nichenetr</ext-link>). We followed the default parameters for average logFC and percent expression. For elucidating ligand/receptor interactions we assigned all non-progenitor cell populations as defined by clustering in Seurat as potential ‘sender cells’ and progenitors as ‘receiver cells’.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Melissa L. Harris (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The consensus opinion is that the work is interesting, makes a valuable contribution to the field, and is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviews are thorough and identify several issues needing clarification, minor modifications, additional citations, etc., all of which are reasonable and all of which will improve the paper in its final version.</p><p>The one major sticking point that is essential to address concerns the identity of mitfa+ aox5-hi cells as the reviewers (and I) are not convinced these are bona fide McSC as opposed to &quot;cryptic&quot; xanthophores. Indeed one might expect cryptic xanthophores to have the transcriptomic profile shown here, clustering with other xanthophores, and to proliferate after melanocyte ablation simply because there is space to do so. The ambiguity could be addressed by tempering relevant portions of the text OR by providing experimental evidence that shows the differentiation of these cells into melanophores (which would be exciting, if true).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Identity/Xanthophores: The authors list 14 clusters that identify as xanthophores and call them mitfa+aox5+ cells on the UMAP (Figure 1). Later the authors follow mitfa+aox5+ cells dividing by scRNA-seq, and in the stripes and interpret these as McSCs (Figure 6, Figure 7). It seems likely these are simply dividing xanthophores? More evidence is required to link these cells to melanocytes, and melanocyte stem cells.</p><p>2) scRNA-seq analysis: Please explain some of the choices taken in the scRNA-seq pipeline.</p><p>a. Cells with 200 expressed genes are considered high quality. Can the authors justify this figure?</p><p>b. We wonder whether the integration between WT and Kita datasets missed any other major differences between WT and mutant cells? Were the datasets so similar even before the integration?</p><p>3) Statistics: Although the authors used appropriate statistical tools in the analysis of the scRNA-seq datasets, we are concerned about the stats used in the plots generated with GraphPad Prism. The Student's t-test can be used when comparing the mean of two datasets with normal distribution. However, it cannot be used for multiple comparisons. Please review the choice of their statistical test for Figures 3C, 4A, 4E, 5B, 5D, 5F, and S5B, and indicate the missing statistical test in Figures S1C, S2D, S6B.</p><p>[Please use ANOVA or similar for initial analyses to assess whether significant differences are present overall, and appropriate post hoc comparisons, like Tukey-Kramer, if warranted. Include values of test statistics (e.g., F) with degrees of freedom for overall tests. -Parichy]</p><p>4) Context in the field:</p><p>a. The authors directly examine adult skin, which has not been done in depth before, and provide an important dataset resource. However, it is important to interpret the data within the context of the wider melanocyte stem cell field (i.e. DRG-associated and daughter cells lining the peripheral nerves as shown by Budi et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2016, Brombin et al., 2022). These cells are also kit-dependent (Dooley et al., 2013). It is important to address how the melanocyte adult skin progenitors relate to the DRG-associated progenitors. One idea is that the cells that line nerves are a source of melanocytes. Not all the pigment progenitors described by Saunders and colleagues are skin-associated. Could these progenitors contribute to the regeneration in adult fish as previously shown (Budi et al., 2011)?</p><p>b. We have concerns with the use of the term &quot;stem cell&quot;, and believe the data is more in line with &quot;Progenitor&quot; as they have previously called these cells in Iyengar et al., 2015.</p><p>c. For their cycling differentiation cells, it might be appropriate to cite other work showing division of differentiating melanocytes as well (e.g. Taylor et al. 2011)</p><p>5) Melanoma: As the authors rightfully claim, the study of McSC might be beneficial to the understanding of how these contribute to melanoma, however, they do not make an actual link to melanoma signatures. Perhaps they could cite and discuss some of the papers that show McSCs and progenitors in zebrafish are relevant to melanoma?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study uses a nice combination of -omics and zebrafish genetics/lineage tracing to heighten our understanding of McSCs and their potential. The manuscript extends our understanding of existing mechanisms (e.g., KIT signaling in McSCs) but also makes small leaps to novel discovery (e.g., identification and function of axo5 self-renewing McSCs). The extensive single-cell datasets generated by this study will be of interest to researchers interested in pigment regeneration, stem cell-based therapeutics for pigment disorders, and the basic biology of stem cells and their heterogeneity. Overall, the data presented seems to support the claims.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78942.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The consensus opinion is that the work is interesting, makes a valuable contribution to the field, and is appropriate for publication in eLife.

The issue, as we see it, is whether mitfa+aox5hi cells that arise via cell division during regeneration are multipotent pigment cell progenitors or ‘cryptic’ xanthophores. The experiments we have performed to address this ambiguity have not worked for technical reasons, so we have tempered text in the relevant Results and Discussion sections to leave both options open. We have backed off from calling these cells progenitors but have included additional data showing that they (i.e. the mitfa<sup>+</sup>aox5<sup>hi</sup> subpopulation of cells that we believe are daughters of mitfa+aox5hi cycling cells) express multiple markers associated with multipotent pigment cell progenitors that have been characterized in developing zebrafish. Our expanded Discussion is as follows:</p><p>“Heterogeneity may also be evident by the additional mitfa<sup>+</sup>aox5<sup>hi</sup> G2/M adj subpopulation that likely arises via cell divisions during regeneration. There are reasons to think that this could be a progenitor subpopulation. Firstly, these cells arose in response to specific ablation of melanocytes. Secondly, this subpopulation expresses markers that are associated with multipotent pigment progenitors cells found during development (Budi, et al., 2011; Saunders, et al., 2019). Thirdly, although this subpopulation expresses aox5 and some other markers associated with xanthophores, we showed that differentiated xanthophores are not ablated by the melanocyte-ablating drug neocuproine and this mitfa<sup>+</sup>aox5<sup>hi</sup> subpopulation does not make new pigmented xanthophores following neocuproine treatment. However, current observations cannot definitively determine the potency and fates adopted by these cells. One possibility is that these cells are indeed progenitors that arise through cell divisions, are in an as yet undefined way lineally related to MP-0 and MP-1 subpopulations, and ultimately give rise to new melanocytes during additional rounds of regeneration. Given their expression of markers associated with multipotent pigment cell progenitors, these cells could be multipotent but fated toward the melanocyte lineage following melanocyte-specific ablation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these cells are another cell type. For example, there is a type of partially differentiated xanthophores that populate adult melanocyte stripes (McMenamin, et al., 2014). At least some of these cells arise from embryonic xanthophores that transitioned through a cryptic and proliferative state (McMenamin, et al., 2014). That the descendants remain partially differentiated could indicate that they are in more of a xanthoblast state and maintain proliferative capacity (Eom, et al., 2015). It is possible that some or all of the cells in question are melanocyte stripe-resident, partially-differentiated xanthophores that arise: (a) from cell divisions that are triggered by loss of interactions with melanocytes or, (b) simply to fill space that is vacated due to melanocyte death. Such causes for partially-differentiated xanthophore divisions have not been documented, but nonetheless this possibility must be considered given the mitfa and aox5 expression and proliferative potential of these cells. Transcriptional profiles of ‘cryptic’ xanthophores are not available to help clarify the nature of these cells. Lastly, the relationship between adult progenitor populations – MP-0, MP-1 and, potentially, mitfa<sup>+</sup>aox5<sup>hi</sup> G2/M adj – and other progenitors present at earlier developmental stages is unclear and could be defined through additional long-term lineage tracing studies. In particular, previous examinations of pigment cell progenitors in developing zebrafish have identified dorsal root ganglion-associated pigment cell progenitors in larvae that contribute to adult pigmentation patterns (Singh, et al., 2016; Dooley, et al., 2013; Budi, et al., 2011). It is possible that these cells give rise to the adult progenitors we have identified. The further alignment of cell types that have been observed in vivo and cell subpopulations defined through expression profiling is a necessary route for understanding the complex relationship between stem and progenitor cells in development, homeostasis, and regeneration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Identity/Xanthophores: The authors list 14 clusters that identify as xanthophores and call them mitfa+aox5+ cells on the UMAP (Figure 1).

We adopted the cutoff of 200 expressed features as used by the developers of Seurat for analysis of CellRanger outputs from 10x platform 3’ prepared cells (https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html). A discussion of quality parameters that helped to guide our choices can be found in Ilicic et al. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4758103/). We also filtered out cells expressing more than 10% mitochondrial reads and more than 50000 total reads. The current field standard is that cells with high mito reads in non-oncological tissues are likely dead or dying cells. Of note, we did try to relax this parameter during some initial analyses to identify dying melanocytes following neocuproine ablation; however, were unable to discern dying melanocytes from other dead or dying cells in the tissue preparation. We also found that cells with high numbers of unique genes expressed or high numbers of reads were likely to be doublets. This observation was helped by comparing our filtering strategy to the R package “DoubletFinder” (McGinnis et al., 2019).

Of course, the UMAPs are not identical, and due to the reduction of certain cell subpopulations in kita(lf) mutants, namely direct differentiation and cycling differentiation, we do not expect them to look the same. There are also some differences in the aox5hi grouping of subpopulations. Nonetheless, there is striking conservation of cell types/clusters. Specifically, similar subpopulations were identified, and were, for the most part, positionally similar to each other in the UMAP. None of the differences observed, aside from the noted differences in direct and cycling differentiation subpopulations, are a focus of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Statistics: Although the authors used appropriate statistical tools in the analysis of the scRNA-seq datasets, we are concerned about the stats used in the plots generated with GraphPad Prism. The Student's t-test can be used when comparing the mean of two datasets with normal distribution. However, it cannot be used for multiple comparisons. Please review the choice of their statistical test for Figures 3C, 4A, 4E, 5B, 5D, 5F, and S5B, and indicate the missing statistical test in Figures S1C, S2D, S6B.</p><p>[Please use ANOVA or similar for initial analyses to assess whether significant differences are present overall, and appropriate post hoc comparisons, like Tukey-Kramer, if warranted.

The authors directly examine adult skin, which has not been done in depth before, and provide an important dataset resource. However, it is important to interpret the data within the context of the wider melanocyte stem cell field (i.e. DRG-associated and daughter cells lining the peripheral nerves as shown by Budi et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2016, Brombin et al., 2022). These cells are also kit-dependent (Dooley et al., 2013). It is important to address how the melanocyte adult skin progenitors relate to the DRG-associated progenitors. One idea is that the cells that line nerves are a source of melanocytes. Not all the pigment progenitors described by Saunders and colleagues are skin-associated. Could these progenitors contribute to the regeneration in adult fish as previously shown (Budi et al., 2011)?</p></disp-quote><p>The ability of DRG- or nerve-associated melanocyte stem or progenitor cells to contribute to adult regeneration is an interesting possibility and something we have considered:</p><p>a) Firstly, the DRG- and nerve-associated progenitors that have been recognized at earlier stages of development (embryonic and juvenile stages) have not been tracked to determine lineal relationships to the adult progenitors we have characterized. Lineage-tracing experiments could potentially make a link between earlier melanocyte progenitors and the cells we find in adult skin.</p><p>b) If nerve-associated progenitors or progenitors in other deeper-lying locations were present in adults (i.e. a separate population from what we have defined through scRNAseq) could they contribute to melanocyte regeneration? In our serial imaging, we found that all new melanocytes arose from skin-resident progenitors. Thus, new melanocytes from regeneration come from skin-resident progenitors. What is less clear is whether new skin-resident progenitors can be derived from migration into the skin of deeper-lying cells. This could potentially occur rapidly or slowly after a new complement of melanocytes have been regenerated and would be evident if any cells that migrated after one round of regeneration produced melanocytes in a subsequent round of regeneration. We have not conducted serial imaging over such an extended period of time to address this question.</p><p>The experiments needed to relate DRG- or nerve-associated progenitors to skin-resident adult progenitors are challenging, if at all possible. However, this is an interesting question, and we have included the following in our discussion to add context as the reviewer has recommended:</p><p>“Lastly, the relationship between adult progenitor populations – MP-0, MP-1 and, potentially, symmetrically dividing cells – and other progenitors present at earlier developmental stages is unclear and could be defined through additional long-term lineage tracing studies. In particular, previous examinations of pigment cell progenitors in developing zebrafish have identified dorsal root ganglion-associated pigment cell progenitors in larvae that contribute to adult pigmentation pattern (Singh, et al., 2016; Dooley, et al., 2013; Budi, et al., 2011). It is possible that these cells give rise to MP-0, MP-1 and/or symmetrically dividing subpopulations. The further alignment of cell types that have been observed in vivo and cell subpopulations defined through expression profiling is a necessary route for understanding the complex relationship between stem cells in development, homeostasis, and regeneration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. We have concerns with the use of the term &quot;stem cell&quot;, and believe the data is more in line with &quot;Progenitor&quot; as they have previously called these cells in Iyengar et al., 2015.</p></disp-quote><p>In retrospect we are comfortable changing to the “progenitor” label. The conventional definition of a stem cell includes both the ability to create differentiated descendants and self-renew. Our data indicate some cells have the capacity to produce new melanocytes, but the ability of other cells to self-renew has not been formally demonstrated by our data. In the revised manuscript we have renamed McSC-0 and McSC-1 subpopulations MP-0 and MP-1, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. For their cycling differentiation cells, it might be appropriate to cite other work showing division of differentiating melanocytes as well (e.g. Taylor et al. 2011)</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure how to relate the cycling differentiation cells to those defined by Taylor et al. While the Taylor study nicely shows divisions of pigmented, differentiating melanocytes during melanocyte regeneration in embryos, we don’t find such cells in adults. Specifically, cells that divide during melanocyte regeneration in adult skin are never pigmented. Furthermore, the cell divisions in adults that produce new melanocytes are asymmetric, in which one daughter differentiates and the other remains undifferentiated. Because of these fundamental differences, we feel that a comparison between pigmented, dividing melanocytes in embryos and cycling differentiation cells in adults is too uncertain and have not included it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Melanoma: As the authors rightfully claim, the study of McSC might be beneficial to the understanding of how these contribute to melanoma, however, they do not make an actual link to melanoma signatures. Perhaps they could cite and discuss some of the papers that show McSCs and progenitors in zebrafish are relevant to melanoma?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree the overlap between MP signatures and melanoma is a fascinating facet of studying MPs. To demonstrate the link between MPs and melanoma we have bolstered our discussion of the potential utility of examining the overlap between MPs signatures during regeneration and melanoma as follows:</p><p>“In melanoma, stem cell-like identities are implicated in tumor maintenance and drug resistance. In single-cell analysis of human melanomas, a subpopulation of cells expressing high levels of AXL, a putative cancer stem cell marker, and low levels of MITF were present in treatment-naïve human melanoma samples (Tirosh, et al., 2016). These AXL-high MITF-low cells were admixed with AXL-low MITF-high differentiated cells, demonstrating cellular heterogeneity present in untreated melanomas. Furthermore, samples from patients after relapse were enriched for this AXL-high state, furthering the concept that stem-like cells facilitate relapse. Similarly, zebrafish melanoma models have demonstrated the role of a stem-like minimal residual disease cells in facilitating relapse (Travnickova, et al., 2019). In this study, MITF-low zebrafish melanoma cells had striking transcriptional similarities to invasive melanoma signatures found in humans following treatment with small molecule inhibitors of MEK or BRAF (Travnickova, et al., 2019). Additional studies have found stem-like properties in melanoma cells involved in therapeutic resistance and tumor relapse (Boshuizen, et al., 2020; Mehta, et al., 2018; Rambow, et al., 2018; Sharma, et al., 2017; Konieczkowski, et al., 2014). Our study provides a reference to which melanoma cells, as well as cells involved in pigmentary diseases such as vitiligo, can be compared to for identifying relationships between and conserved pathways shared by melanocyte progenitors and cells involved in melanocytic diseases.”</p><p>We have also compared signatures of MP and other subpopulations to signatures defined for melanomas from humans (Tirosh et al.) and zebrafish (Brombin et al., Travicknova et al.). These comparisons were conducted in two ways: (a) MP and other subpopulations compared to individual tumors, and (b) MP and other subpopulations compared to subpopulations of tumor cells defined after pooling all tumor cells in a given study. From the first comparisons, it is clear that there is marked heterogeneity between tumors. Some tumors have signatures that are aligned with MPs, whereas other tumors have signatures more similar to melanocytes, cycling differentiation and direct differentiation subpopulations. From the second comparisons, there are subpopulations of tumor cells (derived from multiple different tumors) that are aligned with MPs and other subpopulations of tumor cells with signatures more similar to melanocytes, cycling differentiation and direct differentiation subpopulations. From this latter type of comparison, we suspect that the tumor subpopulations more similar to MPs are likely to be tumor stem or propagating cells. Further functional would need to be performed to solidify this hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
