adaptive behaviors through distinct output pathways. Despite its complex functions, the diversity of molecularly defined neuronal types in the CEA and their contributions to major axonal projection targets have not been examined systematically. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to classify molecularly defined cell types in the CEA and identified marker genes to map the location of these neuronal types using expansion-assisted iterative fluorescence in situ hybridization (EASI-FISH). We developed new methods to integrate EASI-FISH with 5-plex retrograde axonal labeling to determine the spatial, morphological, and connectivity properties of ~30,000 molecularly defined CEA neurons. Our study revealed spatiomolecular organization of the CEA, with medial and lateral CEA associated with distinct molecularly defined cell families. We also found a long-range axon projection network from the CEA, where target regions receive inputs from multiple molecularly defined cell types. Axon collateralization was found primarily among projections to hindbrain targets, which are distinct from forebrain projections. This resource reports marker gene combinations for molecularly defined cell types and axon-projection types, which will be useful for selective interrogation of these neuronal populations to study their contributions to the diverse functions of the CEA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>fluorescent in situ hybridization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sternson</surname><given-names>Scott M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dementia Research Switzerland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krabbe</surname><given-names>Sabine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the central amygdala, transcriptomic definition of cell types and corresponding spatial transcriptomic analysis reveals major regional differences in molecular organization and relates newly identified molecularly defined cell types to major axon projection targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal heterogeneity has been characterized and classified in brains by gene expression, morphology, and connectivity. The increasing number of molecularly defined neuron types revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) accentuates the need for integrated methods to relate gene expression, cell morphology, and axon projection patterns. Several imaging-based and sequencing-based methods have been developed to allow for spatial gene expression profiling in both thin (~10 µm) and thick (≥100 µm) tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Codeluppi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nicovich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), including expansion-assisted iterative fluorescence in situ hybridization (EASI-FISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). These methods provide spatially resolved molecular composition of neuronal types, but they can also serve as a bridge to link cell types classified using scRNA-seq with functional attributes, such as neuronal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bugeon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lovett-Barron et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Some methods, such as BARseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sun et al., 2021</xref>) and MERFISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), have been developed for mapping neuronal projections in the cortex, but most of these methods have been performed in thin tissue sections, limiting 3D tissue context.</p><p>The central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cassell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassell and Gray, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Keifer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moscarello and Penzo, 2022</xref>) integrates external and internal sensory information to control motivated behaviors and learning in appetitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hardaway et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>) and aversive domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ehrlich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). The CEA also controls a variety of innate responses such as autonomic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Iwata et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kapp et al., 1979</xref>), taste valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sadacca et al., 2012</xref>), food and water intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Douglass et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), jaw movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Han et al., 2017</xref>), as well as predatory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Han et al., 2017</xref>). The CEA is also involved in responses to general anesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hua et al., 2020</xref>), addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Domi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Torruella-Suárez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Venniro et al., 2020</xref>), pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Okutsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>), and itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Samineni et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>CEA neurons elicit these distinct behavioral functions based on their axon projection patterns. For example, the CEA influences multiple processes associated with threat responses, such as freezing and cardiovascular adaptations, via projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>) and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saha, 2005</xref>). CEA→vPAG projections are also involved in chloroquine-induced pruritic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Samineni et al., 2021</xref>). Neurons in the anterior CEA are implicated in predatory hunting responses in rodents via projections to the parvocellular reticular formation (PCRt) and the vlPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Han et al., 2017</xref>). CEA projections to other hindbrain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Veening et al., 1984</xref>), such as the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), modulate food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Douglass et al., 2017</xref>), alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Torruella-Suárez et al., 2020</xref>), and pain responses and aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Okutsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the CEA→lateral SN (lateral substantia nigra) pathway promotes learned behavioral responses to salient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steinberg et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The CEA consists of primarily GABAergic neurons that are organized within at least three subdivisions. In the classical view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duvarci et al., 2011</xref>), the lateral central amygdala (CeL) is a primary target for external and internal sensory inputs that are processed and passed to the medial central amygdala (CeM), a major output nucleus projecting to hindbrain autonomic and motor control areas. For instance, activation of CeM elicits freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>), which is gated by disinhibition of a local inhibitory projection from CeL to CeM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>). However, long-range projections from the CeL have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cassell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Herry and Johansen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li and Sheets, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Veening et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ye and Veinante, 2019</xref>), indicating direct influence of this subregion on downstream areas. In addition, the capsular central nucleus (CeC), a subdivision at the far lateral edge of the middle and posterior CEA and the anterior lateral portion of CEA, receives distinct axonal inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cassell et al., 1999</xref>) and contributes to controlling defensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) and appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to distinct projection patterns, neurons in different CEA subnuclei also showed distinct electrophysiological properties and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li and Sheets, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mork et al., 2022</xref>), with additional functional heterogeneity observed along the rostrocaudal topographic axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The CEA also contains multiple molecularly defined neuron populations that have been investigated for their role in appetitive and defensive behaviors. Previously used marker genes for CEA cell types include protein kinase C delta (<italic>Prkcd</italic>), somatostatin (<italic>Sst</italic>), corticotropin-releasing hormone (<italic>Crh),</italic> tachykinin-2 (<italic>Tac2</italic>), or neurotensin (<italic>Nts</italic>). <italic>Prkcd</italic> is expressed in a set of CEA neurons that reduce freezing, promote extinction learning, suppress appetite when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), and elicit defensive behaviors when inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>). CEA <italic>Prkcd</italic> neurons are also associated with drug craving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Venniro et al., 2020</xref>) and alcohol addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Domi et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Sst</italic>, <italic>Crh,</italic> and <italic>Tac2</italic> neurons have been associated with the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear responses such as freezing or flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gafford and Ressler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sanford et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, <italic>Nts-</italic>expressing neurons are involved in feeding and reward-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Torruella-Suárez et al., 2020</xref>). Additional work has demonstrated that some of these markers (<italic>Sst, Crh, Nts</italic>) have a considerable degree of overlap in the same neurons, whereas others are distinct (e.g., <italic>Prkcd</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McCullough et al., 2018b</xref>). However, the molecular diversity of CEA neurons has been incompletely examined. In addition, it has been difficult to establish the correspondence of CEA axonal projections with its many molecularly defined cell types. Therefore, the functional significance of CEA subpopulations defined by both anatomical and molecular characteristics remains largely uncharacterized.</p><p>To increase understanding of the organization of the CEA, it is important to systematically classify the molecularly defined neuron types in the CEA as well as their anatomical locations in CEA subnuclei and major projection pathways. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on neurons from the CEA and used these data to define molecularly defined neuron types. We then integrated retrograde axonal tracing with EASI-FISH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) in 100-µm-thick tissue sections to determine the molecular identity and spatial distribution of neurons that project to several important CEA output targets.

Class 1 contained a family of <italic>Sst/Pdyn</italic> co-expressing neurons that was comprised of two types distinguished by additional co-expression of <italic>Crh</italic>, <italic>Tac2</italic>, <italic>Nts,</italic> and <italic>Vipr2</italic> in seq-c7 and lacking these genes in seq-c10. Another population, seq-c5, expressed mRNA encoding D2-receptor (<italic>Drd2</italic>) and voltage-gated sodium channel β subunit, <italic>Scn4b</italic>. Seq-c8 was the primary <italic>Prkcd</italic>-expressing (97%, 107.0 ± 6.9 UMIs/cell) population that co-expressed <italic>Cartpt</italic> at high levels (87.1%, 158.0 ± 16.8 UMIs/cell). This cluster was closely related to seq-c6, in which some neurons also expressed <italic>Prkcd</italic> (48%, 69.9 ± 10.0 UMIs/cell) and only 20% co-expressed <italic>Cartpt</italic> at lower levels (65.7 ± 16.6 UMIs/cell), but seq-c6 differed from seq-c8 by expression of other genes, such as <italic>Cyp26b1</italic>, <italic>Crym</italic>, and <italic>Penk</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Seq-c2 and seq-c4 expressed <italic>Ppia</italic>, <italic>Actg1,</italic> and <italic>Aldoa</italic>, while seq-c12 and seq-c13 did not. Seq-c2 and seq-c4 differed in their expression of <italic>Tac2</italic>. Seq-c13 expressed <italic>Dlk1</italic> and <italic>Cyp26b1</italic>, which were absent from seq-c12. In addition, <italic>Htr2a</italic> has been previously used as a marker gene in the CEA. In this scRNA-seq dataset, very few cells with <italic>Htr2a</italic> RNA expression were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with some other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hardaway et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). To determine how our scRNA-seq dataset compared with recently published CEA scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">O’Leary et al., 2022</xref>), we integrated the two datasets via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and found that all neurons from the O’Leary et al. dataset mapped with neuronal clusters from our dataset, indicating that our dataset covered the molecular diversity in the CEA. Analysis of the newly combined data also did not affect clustering of most neurons from our original scRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>For seq-c1, c4 and c12, although differentially expressed genes were identified, these genes had low selectivity in the CEA based on scRNA-seq analysis (the fraction of neurons with marker gene expression in the cluster versus expression of that gene in the rest of the populations, pct.1 and pct.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Broad expression of these genes was also apparent in Allen Brain Atlas ISH images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). Because of this, we de-prioritized these clusters when selecting marker genes. We selected a set of 23 marker genes whose combinations were used to define major CEA molecular types. Additionally, we included <italic>Gad1</italic> to distinguish CEA neurons from non-neurons and five additional differentially expressed neuromodulatory GPCRs (<italic>Npy1r</italic>, <italic>Drd1</italic>, <italic>Drd2</italic>, <italic>Htr1b</italic>, and <italic>Htr2c</italic>) that showed selective expression patterns in the CEA. Based on selected marker genes (29 total, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) expression, more than 60% of neurons correctly mapped to their original molecular identity, and further increasing the number of marker genes did not substantially improve this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Also, 10 out of 13 scRNA-seq clusters could be identified by these marker genes, as defined by greater than 50% neurons mapped correctly from these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The unmapped scRNA-seq clusters lacked highly specific marker genes (seq-c1, seq-c4, seq-c12). Instead, seq-c4 and seq-c12 can be considered as <italic>Nefm</italic>-expressing CEA neurons that lack additional marker genes (<italic>Nefm</italic> could be substituted with <italic>Fxyd6</italic>), which is also consistent with our analysis of the combined scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>EASI-FISH with retrograde tracing</title><p>To map the spatial distribution and axon projection patterns of molecularly defined neurons identified by scRNA-seq, we developed methods to combine EASI-FISH using 29 marker genes with 5-plex retrograde tracing using fluorophore-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) and hydroxystilbamidine (FluoroGold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saleeba et al., 2019</xref>), which showed good labeling in the CEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We selected five brain regions that have been previously identified as CEA targets/effectors and are involved in appetitive and defensive behaviors: the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), lateral substantia nigra (lateral SN), ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG), parabrachial nucleus (PBN), and parvocellular reticular formation (PCRt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Douglass et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">LeDoux et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steinberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). In each mouse, retrograde tracers with distinct fluorophores were injected into the five sites to label CEA neurons that project to these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>; also see 'Materials and methods'). We aimed to maximize the number of retrogradely labeled CEA projecting neurons to each brain area with injections that encompassed most of each brain region but limited spread outside of the targeted areas. However, injections into the PBN included some adjacent medial structures, such as the locus-coeruleus and peri-locus coeruleus. vlPAG injections also labeled varying portions of dorsal PAG along the injection pipette track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>We developed a two-stage protocol to combine CTb and fluorogold labeling with EASI-FISH. First, we imaged retrogradely labeled neurons and DAPI-stained nuclei from CEA-containing brain sections (100 µm) that were cleared using 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nicovich et al., 2019</xref>) and refractive index matched to allow for imaging of fluorophores throughout the 100-µm-thick tissue using confocal microscopy (see 'Materials and methods,' <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Next, we processed the same tissue sections for EASI-FISH, which is a method based on expansion microscopy that facilitates high-quality imaging of mRNA in thick tissue sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Protease treatment in the EASI-FISH procedure, which is necessary for tissue clearing and tissue expansion, also removes CTb proteins and Fluorogold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>), thus avoiding fluorophore ambiguity between retrograde labeling and FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To align image volumes across rounds, EASI-FISH relies on DAPI-stained RNA that conveniently labels the cytoplasm (cytoDAPI) after DNase treatment, which is used to strip oligonucleotide probes between FISH rounds but also eliminates DAPI staining of nuclei. For rapid volumetric imaging while limiting photobleaching, EASI-FISH-processed tissue is imaged using selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM or 'light-sheet' microscopy). To register confocal image volumes that contained information about neuronal projections with SPIM image volumes that contained information about gene expression, we developed an experimental and computational modification to the EASI-FISH procedure (see 'Materials and methods'). For this, an additional staining and imaging round (called round 0 because marker genes were not probed) was included to 'link' the confocal and the EASI-FISH image volumes at the beginning of the EASI-FISH experiment, where nuclei were labeled with DAPI, and the surrounding cytosolic region of a cell was marked with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). The nuclear DAPI images were used to register the first EASI-FISH image volumes with confocal images, while the cytosolic rRNA-stain was used to register with cytoDAPI in subsequent EASI-FISH rounds that probed for CEA marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Using this procedure, we acquired axon projection information targeting five downstream brain regions along with expression levels of 29 marker genes in individual neurons from the same tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). 29-plex marker gene expression was measured and computationally extracted using the previously described EASI-FISH procedure and data processing pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/multifish">https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/multifish</ext-link>). This includes automatically generated three-dimensional segmentation masks for every cell in the tissue volume. High-quality confocal-to-SPIM image registration using this pipeline permitted us to apply the high-resolution EASI-FISH segmentation masks to confocal images to extract fluorescence intensities from CTb or FluoroGold that indicated the neuronal projection types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, this is simpler and more accurate than generating and reconciling separate segmentation masks for the same specimen across image volumes that were acquired using different modalities (confocal and SPIM).</p><p>Low expressor marker genes (<italic>Oprk1</italic>, <italic>Scn4b,</italic> and <italic>Vipr2</italic>) were reprobed at the last round of EASI-FISH to evaluate RNA loss during the procedure.

Neurons from the two top-level classes defined by scRNA-seq were spatially separate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), with MCs from class 1 enriched in the lateral and capsular parts of the CEA and most neurons from class 2 enriched in the medial part of the CEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We mapped all 17 EASI-FISH clusters in the CEA to the 13 scRNA-seq clusters.

In addition, seq-c5, the major <italic>Drd2</italic>-expressing population mapped to two EASI-FISH clusters in the CEA, one spanning the CeC and AST (MC-5) and one enriched in CeM (MC-14).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Somatic size and shape of CEA cell types</title><p>Because the EASI-FISH analysis pipeline provides high-quality three-dimensional neuronal soma segmentation, we also evaluated the somatic shape of the molecularly defined CEA cell types.

Only CEA neurons in MC-1 (<italic>Nefm</italic>/<italic>Tac2</italic>) from CeM were significantly larger (mean somatic volume: 2506.9 ± 818.5 µm<sup>3</sup>) than the mean CEA neuron soma size (1581.3 ± 744.6 µm<sup>3</sup>) (p&lt;0.0001).

The BLA (MC-8) has many large neurons and some small neurons (mean somatic volume: 2736.0 ± 1291.5 µm<sup>3</sup>), which is consistent with the previous report of principal neurons with large somata, and interneurons with smaller somata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McDonald, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The ITCs (MC-21) were the smallest (906.5 ± 317.3 µm<sup>3</sup>) and the D2-receptor-expressing neurons in the AST (MC-20) were also smaller (1229.3 ± 372.6 µm<sup>3</sup>) than most CEA neurons (p&lt;0.0001). Because our segmentation approach is largely restricted to neuronal somata, future studies will be needed to determine how this heterogeneity in soma size and shape relates to complete neuronal morphology and functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Parcellation of CEA</title><p>Canonical subdivisions of the CEA in mouse are derived from neuroanatomical studies in rats, where three sub-nuclei (CeM, CeL, and CeC) have been identified based on cytoarchitecture, connectivity, and selected neuropeptide expression, such as enkephalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cassell et al., 1999</xref>). In mice, these boundaries can be difficult to discern reliably and precisely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ye and Veinante, 2019</xref>). A consistent parcellation of the CEA would be facilitated by molecular markers that are associated with different subregions. These genes need not be expressed in every neuron within a particular region but, instead, have a combinatorial expression pattern from which the boundaries are apparent. To identify these marker gene combinations, we examined the spatial variation of marker gene expression in the CEA and its surrounding region. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the expression patterns of 29 marker genes identified spatial patterns that explained the greatest proportion of molecular variance in the region. As expected, this revealed regional boundaries with surrounding brain areas (CEA, BLA, PAL, AST, and ITCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zirlinger et al., 2001</xref>). Within the CEA, most PCs associated with the largest gene expression variation corresponded to differences between capsular/lateral zones and the medial zone (CeC/CeL and CeM), consistent with our scRNA-seq hierarchical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). PCA revealed <italic>Ppp1r1b</italic> and <italic>Nefm</italic> as marker genes with large loadings in the top 4 PCs that demarcate these subregions along the anterior–posterior extent of the CEA, with <italic>Ppp1r1b</italic> expressed laterally and <italic>Nefm</italic> medially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Additional spatial variation in gene expression was observed in the lateral part of the CEA, especially in the more posterior sections. Instead of a clear separation, a gradient of gene expression was observed in PC2-4 in most samples, with <italic>Penk</italic> showing large loadings on these PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In light of this, we used <italic>Penk</italic>, which has been used previously to subdivide CeC from CeL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cassell et al., 1986</xref>), as an additional marker gene.

Because neuron types were defined by combinations of marker genes and several genes were expressed by multiple types, we also investigated whether marker genes were predictive of projection targets. For this, we trained a logistic regression classifier that used the marker gene expression in neurons to predict their axonal projections to the five selected brain regions as well as neurons lacking projections to these brain regions (six classes: 'PBN', 'vlPAG', 'PCRt', 'lateral SN', 'BNST', 'unlabeled') (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The model had an average area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) and f1 score of 0.58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), significantly better in performance compared to data where the relationship between gene expression of individual neurons and their projections was shuffled (p&lt;0.01) (see 'Materials and methods,' <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating high predictive power of marker genes for axon projection targets. The confusion matrix showed that the model had the highest performance predicting BNST (71%) and lateral SN (66%) projections, with more incorrect predictions for hindbrain projections (PBN, PCRt, and vlPAG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). One possibility that could explain lower performance for hindbrain targets was potentially incomplete retrograde labeling of neurons with collateralizations among hindbrain regions, which is indicated by a report of collateralization in axonal reconstructions from rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Veinante and Freund-mercier, 2003</xref>). When we trained a model in which the hindbrain projections were grouped (four classes: ‘hindbrain’, ‘lateral SN’, ‘BNST’, ‘unlabeled’), the prediction scores were improved (AUC-ROC score: 0.81, f1 score: 0.59) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with the six-class model, the BNST projection, which had the greatest anatomical separation from the other projection targets, was best predicted by gene expression information (74%). Marker gene expression correctly predicted 73% lateral SN projections and 67% hindbrain projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The predictions for neurons lacking projections to these regions in both models were lower (43%). Most of the incorrect predictions were false-positive predictions, where unlabeled neurons were predicted to project to three projection classes (BNST: 22%; hindbrain: 17%; and lateral SN: 18%). Among them, 33% of false-positive predictions to BNST were from MC-13 neurons and 35% and 34% of unlabeled neurons predicted to project to hindbrain regions and lateral SN, respectively, were from MC-16 and MC-3.

This revealed the molecular, spatial, morphological, and connectional diversity in the CEA within a three-dimensional tissue context and uncovered molecularly defined cell types that projected to specific brain regions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Technical considerations</title><p>Our technical objectives were to extend the EASI-FISH procedure by mapping the location of molecularly defined neuron types using marker genes from scRNA-seq and correlating this with the location of axon projection types in the same samples. We aimed to do this in thick tissue sections because this will eventually facilitate experiments that incorporate EASI-FISH with other experimental modalities such as calcium imaging or electrophysiology. Finally, we configured our experiments so that the automated EASI-FISH analysis pipeline was suitable for the joint analysis of gene expression and retrograde tracer labeling. We opted to develop EASI-FISH for use in conjunction with traditional high-efficiency retrograde tracers, such as CTb and FluoroGold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Saleeba et al., 2019</xref>). This is because alternative retrograde viral axon tracing tools have considerable tropism for different cell types, and in preliminary experiments, we found poor efficiency of canine adenovirus, AAV2/retro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>), and other retrograde viral tools when applied to the CEA projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). CTb and FG do not survive the tissue digestion step associated with expansion microscopy (ExM), which led us to perform an initial tissue clearing and confocal microscopy step to obtain projection information as well as to develop methods for automatic registration of confocal and SPIM image volumes, which has been challenging in the past. We chose tissue thickness of 100 µm (instead of 300 µm in the previous EASI-FISH study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) due to the long imaging time and photobleaching associated with confocal imaging as well as compromised image quality due to tissue scattering in thicker tissue sections when using confocal imaging before the expansion microscopy procedure.</p><p>Here, we evaluated 22 cell types, using 29 marker genes, for their contribution to 5 projection types, which is more than previous studies for individual samples using retrograde tracers. High-quality neuron somata segmentation provided cell body size and shape information for each neuron, which could be related to neuronal classifications. Our approach to systematically evaluate all CEA cell types for retrograde labeling from five projection targets offers a comprehensive view of the relative contributions of different cell types to each axon projection target. Nevertheless, the absolute number of neurons from each cell type that contribute to each projection is difficult to determine. Although the labeling efficiency of neurons by CTb and FG was high, CEA neurons may arborize in portions of the five target brain regions that were not completely filled with the retrograde tracer by our stereotaxic injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and increasing the amount of tracer comes with the tradeoff of overflowing the boundary of the targeted structure. Underfilling the axon-target region may lead to false negatives for classifying neuron contributions to each projection based on measurements of retrogradely labeled neurons, thus underestimating the number of neurons projecting to these regions. Furthermore, this would lead to an undercount of axon collateralization, for which there is prior evidence based on a limited set of single-neuron axon projection reconstructions that have been performed for CEA neurons from rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Veinante and Freund-mercier, 2003</xref>). This means that the gene-based predictive model for axon projection target potentially underestimated the predictive power of marker genes due to incomplete retrograde labeling (false-negative labeling). In addition, this study with 5-plex retrograde axon labeling does not include all possible CEA projection targets, such as hypothalamic areas or the nucleus of the solitary tract. Increasing the number of axonal projection targets using this approach will require additional differentially labeled fluorescent retrograde tracers as well as spectral unmixing of the emission of these fluorophores. In this study, we only analyzed samples from male animals, and additional experiments will be needed in female animals to evaluate whether there are differences in molecularly defined cell types or their projections. However, scRNA-seq data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peters et al., 2022</xref> using CEA neurons of both male and female animals did not report sex-specific differences. Ultimately, combining EASI-FISH with fluorescent retrograde tracers enables the profiling of tens of thousands of cells for gene expression and projections. In the future, the development of technology for single-neuron axon reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Winnubst et al., 2019</xref>) combined with detailed multi-gene expression information would enable evaluation of the complete collateralization of molecularly defined neurons. Overall, our methodology for EASI-FISH combined with fluorescent retrograde axonal tracers is a systematic approach for profiling the gene expression and axon projection targets of single cells in thick tissue volumes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Biological insights</title><p>The CEA is a major output nucleus of the amygdala, and functional investigation of the CEA has uncovered roles for both defensive and appetitive outputs, which are associated, in some cases, with distinct molecularly defined neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2016</xref>).

In addition, our molecularly defined mouse CEA cluster also matched well with two recent studies in mouse CEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">O’Leary et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peters et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-2-1"><title>Molecular definition of CEA subnuclei molecular boundaries</title><p>We found that the primary distinction between molecularly defined CEA cell types corresponded to an anatomical split between CeM and CeC/CeL. This revealed a fundamental distinction between the cellular makeup of these CEA subdivisions, and most cell types mapped specifically to one of these subdomains. Importantly, we used the spatial variation of CEA gene expression to determine combinations of molecular markers to automatically define the boundary of CeL, CeC, and CeM, which have been difficult to determine in the mouse. This provides an approach to increase consistency of anatomical assignments in different studies across animals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-2"><title>Molecularly defined CEA neuron types in CeM</title><p>We identified many previously undescribed CeM neuron types. For example, MC-16 (<italic>Nefm</italic>/<italic>Htr1b</italic>/<italic>Ebf1/Drd2<sup>–</sup></italic>/<italic>Tac2<sup>–</sup></italic>) is the most abundant CeM cell type but was not previously reported, possibly due to the lack of neuropeptide marker genes. In rats, CeM has been reported to be the primary origin of hindbrain projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cassell et al., 1999</xref>). We found that MC-16 neurons projected primarily to hindbrain and midbrain targets. MC-13 (<italic>Cyp26b1</italic>/<italic>Dlk1</italic>) is another abundant cell type that is present in both CeM and CeL, and MC-13 projected to the BNST in the forebrain. The different projections of these two cell types are consistent with earlier single-cell anterograde-tracing studies that ignored molecular identity but showed subsets of neurons that had axon projections to either BNST or hindbrain targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Veinante and Freund-mercier, 2003</xref>). Moreover, we found that CeM neurons with ascending versus descending projection targets have spatially separate anatomical distributions, with BNST-projecting CeM neurons located more ventrally compared to hindbrain-projecting CeM-projecting neurons.</p><p>Although CeM neurons have been reported to be associated with neuropeptide marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McCullough et al., 2018b</xref>), we found that these neuropeptide-expressing cell types made up only a small proportion of the cells in the CeM. MC-1 is the primary CeM cell type expressing <italic>Tac2</italic>, and we discovered that these cell types have the largest somata in the CEA. <italic>Tac2-</italic>expressing CeM neurons have been previously reported to be associated with appetitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), but it is challenging to use stereotaxic methods to target these selectively from CeL <italic>Tac2</italic> (MC-2) neurons in mice. We found that this population can be specified by co-expression with <italic>Nefm</italic>, which could potentially be used for the intersectional targeting of this cell type. <italic>Tac1</italic> neurons in the CeM (MC-11) co-expressed <italic>Sema3c</italic>, and this intersection distinguished this population from overlying <italic>Drd1</italic> neurons in the AST that also expressed <italic>Tac1</italic>. In addition, most CeM <italic>Sst</italic> neurons belonged to MC-12, although <italic>Sst</italic> was also found in a subset of <italic>Tac1</italic>-expressing MC-11 neurons. MC-15 was a rare cell type defined by expression of vitamin D receptor (<italic>Vdr</italic>). Although <italic>Vdr</italic> expression has been observed previously in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stumpf and O’Brien, 1987</xref>) and its expression was shown to be elevated in proestrus rats during the pain response to chicken pox infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hornung et al., 2020</xref>), the functional importance of this <italic>Vdr</italic>-expressing cell type has not been examined. In addition, two other CeM cell types, MC-18 (<italic>Sema3c/Tac1<sup>-</sup></italic>) and MC-19 (<italic>Gpx3/Gal<sup>-</sup></italic>), also have not been examined previously. MC-19 was in the ventral CeM and had projections to the BNST, whereas MC-18 had a broader distribution, with projections to PBN and PCRt. Other previously reported CeM markers were expressed in more than one molecularly defined cell type. For example, <italic>Pnoc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hardaway et al., 2019</xref>) was broadly expressed across most major CeM cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). While the D2-receptor (<italic>Drd2</italic>) was primarily expressed in two CeM clusters (MC-5 and MC-14, both corresponding to seq-c5 but differing in <italic>Penk</italic> expression), the D1-receptor (<italic>Drd1</italic>) was primarily expressed in the AST cluster (MC-7) and the intercalated cells (MC-21). <italic>Drd1</italic> was also detected (&gt;10%) in multiple CeM clusters (MC-1, MC-11, MC-12, MC-16, and MC-18: seq-c2, seq-c4, seq-c11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), largely consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-3"><title>Molecularly defined CEA neuron types in CeL and CeC</title><p>The lateral and capsular portions of the CEA contained five primary cell types. <italic>Prkcd</italic> neurons (primarily in MC-6) were the predominant neuron type in the posterior and middle portions of the CeL and CeC. Neurons expressing <italic>Prkcd</italic> have been shown to be suppressed by conditioned stimuli predicting an aversive stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>), to modulate anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Griessner et al., 2021</xref>), and to suppress food intake associated with either satiety or illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). We identified two populations with <italic>Prkcd</italic> expression, one in rostral CEA (MC-10 corresponds to seq-c6) and one in caudal CEA (MC-6 corresponds to seq-c8, with a higher fraction of neurons expressing <italic>Prkcd</italic>), which likely correspond to the rCEA <italic>Calcrl</italic>+ and cCEA <italic>Calcrl</italic>+ neurons identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowen et al., 2022</xref>. A small proportion of neurons in these two populations MC-6 and MC-10 showed projections to BNST, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Prkcd</italic>-expressing neurons have been reported to be the primary projections from CeC/CeL→BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ye and Veinante, 2019</xref>); however, we found that this marker gene is associated with a small proportion (15.2%) of CeC/CeL neurons that project to BNST. Instead, most BNST-projecting neurons are from MC-13 (31%), which straddles the boundary between CeL and CeM, and the second-most abundant BNST-projecting population was MC-10 (8.1%). We did not evaluate intra-CeA connectivity, but <italic>Prkcd</italic> neurons of the CeC and CeL have been reported to also form connections with CeM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ye and Veinante, 2019</xref>), some of which go on to project to the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, <italic>Prkcd</italic> neurons are also engaged in a recursive inhibitory local circuit with CeL <italic>Sst</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hunt et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with previous reports, we detected significant levels of co-localization in CeC/CeL of previously used marker genes such as <italic>Sst</italic>, <italic>Crh</italic>, <italic>Nts,</italic> and <italic>Tac2</italic>, which were distinct from <italic>Prkcd-</italic>expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McCullough et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ye and Veinante, 2019</xref>). Yet, we identified separate CeC/CeL <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing subpopulations that can be selectively targeted based on the co-expression of previously unknown molecular markers. MC-3 strongly expressed <italic>Sst</italic> and was spatially intermingled with <italic>Prkcd</italic> neurons. A closely related <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing cell type, MC-2, expressed <italic>Vipr2</italic>, was partially offset to the medial portion of the CeL and co-expressed varying proportions of <italic>Sst, Nts, Crh</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McCullough et al., 2018b</xref>). MC-2 was restricted to posterior and middle CEA sections, while MC-3 was also in anterior CeC. These <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing clusters might correspond to distinct functional subpopulations and could explain seemingly contradictory reports on the behavioral role of SST and CRH neurons in the CEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Sst-</italic>expressing neurons from the CeL have been reported to be the primary projection to PBN, and we found that it was the MC-3 population that was the major descending projection from CeC/CeL to the PBN, PCRt, and lateral SN. Both MC-3 and MC-2 neurons participate in projections to vlPAG. The functional significance of two <italic>Sst</italic> neuron populations in CeL is not known, but functional activation of CeL<sup>CRH</sup> neurons, possibly projecting to vlPAG (likely MC-2), has been shown to promote flight responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andero et al., 2014</xref>), whereas activation of CeL<sup>SST</sup> projecting to vlPAG (likely MC-2 and MC-3) promotes freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). However, these earlier studies may include contributions from neurons expressing these genes in CeM, thus state-dependent effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fadok et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moscarello and Penzo, 2022</xref>) that primarily affect separate CEA subpopulations cannot be excluded.</p><p>In the anterior CeC/L, the predominant cell type, MC-10 (<italic>Cyp26b1</italic>/<italic>Crym<sup>–</sup></italic>), has not been reported previously and, as mentioned above, is the primary CeC/L projection to BNST. The anterior CeC also contained a <italic>Drd2</italic> cell type co-expressing <italic>Scn4b</italic> (MC-5) that extended ventrally from the AST and projected to lateral SN, which likely corresponded to previously reported <italic>Drd2</italic> neurons in and around CEA that enhance conditioned freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McCullough et al., 2018a</xref>). However, <italic>Drd2</italic> expression is not limited to MC-5 (e.g., MC-14 in CeM), and we anticipate that the use of intersectional targeting with <italic>Drd2/Scn4b</italic> will facilitate selective targeting of this CeC cell type. A previous study reported that most <italic>Prkcd</italic>-expressing neurons co-expressed <italic>Drd2</italic> and that most CeC/L <italic>Drd2</italic> was expressed in these neurons using a <italic>Drd2::EGFP</italic> transgenic mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Bundel et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, we find that direct detection of RNAs by scRNA-seq as well as high-sensitivity EASI-FISH identified <italic>Drd2</italic> expression in only a proportion of <italic>Prkcd</italic>-expressing neurons (7.7% scRNA-seq, 43.0% FISH).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-4"><title>Long-range projections of CEA molecular cell types</title><p>We observed a complex set of relationships in the long-range neuronal projection network of the CEA, where target regions receive inputs from multiple molecularly defined cell types, with molecularly defined cell types projecting to more than one target region. We also observed distinct projection patterns from closely related cell types. For example, the MC-3 <italic>Sst-</italic>expressing cell type in the CeL projects to multiple descending brain areas but the closely related and anatomically intermingled MC-2 (<italic>Sst/Vipr/Nts/Tac2</italic> co-expressing) cell type had an ~11-fold lower proportion of retrogradely labeled neurons. The most abundant projections from CEA were to PBN and involved 11 (50% of total) molecularly defined cell types in the CEA, while MC-16 from CeM and MC-3 from CeC/CeL were the primary cell types projecting to lateral SN, PBN, and PCRt. Thus, dual control of CEA projection targets by CeL and CeM is a common organizational characteristic of CEA output. However, it remains to be investigated whether these distinct molecular clusters with common projection targets serve specific functions, such as associative learning to salient stimuli, feeding or predatory behavior that have been previously linked to CEA projections to the lateral SN, PBN, or PCRt, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Douglass et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steinberg et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, two of the CeM clusters with distinct projection patterns identified in this study likely corresponded to the novel CeM cell types identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">O’Leary et al., 2022</xref>. MC-16 that projects to multiple hindbrain targets corresponds to <italic>Isl1<sup>+</sup></italic>, while MC-13 that showed a spatial distribution between CeL and CeM likely corresponds to <italic>Nr2f2<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons. And we show in this study that MC-13 is a major BNST-projecting population. In addition to these findings, our study offers a more comprehensive view of the co-projection relationships of all CEA clusters in CEA subnuclei that is not limited by retrograde viral tropism.</p><p>We also evaluated the predictive accuracy of marker genes for individual projection types. Because multiple cell types contributed to each projection type, it is important to determine whether marker genes expressed across multiple cell types would be associated with an axon projection. Overall predictive scores (AUROC) ranging from 0.78 to 0.83 indicate good predictability. When we examined the predictive power of top-ranked marker genes, we found, on average, that single marker genes would be associated with ~70%/30% split between true positives and false positives for a given projection type (~80%/20% for <italic>Crh</italic> prediction of vlPAG). However, the prediction scores for these marker genes may be underestimated because of false-negative neurons that projected to portions of the targeted regions not contacted by the tracer injections and were thus unlabeled by tracers. Nevertheless, applications involving selective transgene expression in molecularly distinct neuronal projection types are likely best achieved using retrograde viral approaches, possibly in conjunction with marker genes that represent the distinct cell types contributing to that projection.</p><p>Together, our findings define the molecular neuronal subtypes of the CEA, reveal major differences in the molecular cytoarchitecture of CeC, CeL, and CeM, and relate molecular subtypes to major projection targets. Future work will be required to establish conditions for targeting these cell types in mice with transgenes. In addition, previous studies indicate that local CEA circuitry is highly organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hunt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2013</xref>). It remains to be investigated to which extent molecular identity predicts local connectivity within and across CEA subnuclei. This study will provide a basis to use marker genes to facilitate experiments that address whether distinct molecular CEA cell types, in conjunction with their projection targets, control distinct motivated appetitive and aversive behaviors and whether CEA output pathways convey more abstract, scalable, and state-dependent information.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

details</title><p>Adult C57Bl/6J male mice (8 weeks old at the beginning of the experiments) were used. All methods for animal care and use were conducted according to National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Janelia Research Campus (Protocol number: 18-174). Mice were housed in a 12  hr light/12  hr dark cycle and had ad libitum access to water and chow diet.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing was focused on the central amygdala (CEA). For visually guided dissection of the CEA, we used the fluorescent boundaries of the robust PBN→CEA axon projection. This has the advantage of marking the CEA without directly expressing a transgene in neurons to be analyzed by scRNA-seq. For this, male C57Bl/6J mice were bilaterally injected with AAV2/1-CAG-GFP (Capsid from AAV1 and ITR from AAV2) (titer 5.5E+12 vg/ml; Janelia Viral Tools facility) into the parabrachial nucleus (PBN; 100 nl per hemisphere, coordinates from bregma: anterior-posterior [AP] –5.2 mm, medial-lateral [ML] 1.15 mm, dorsal-ventral [DV] 3.25 mm). For AAV injection under stereotaxic control, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (3–5% for induction, 1–2% for maintenance) in oxygen and fixed on a stereotactic frame (Model 1900, Kopf Instruments). Injections of buprenorphine (0.1  mg per kg body weight subcutaneously before anesthesia) and ketoprofen (5 mg per kg body weight after the surgery and every 24 hr for 2 days postoperatively) were provided for analgesia. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to avoid eye drying. The body temperature of the animal was maintained at 36°C using a feedback-controlled heating pad. A pulled glass pipette (tip diameter ~20  μm) was connected to a microinjection system (Oil Microinjector, Narishige) and lowered into the brain at the desired coordinates with the stereotaxic micro-positioner (Model 1940, Kopf Instruments). After a waiting time of 10 min, the pipette was slowly removed, and the wound was closed with a surgical suture.</p><p>Four weeks after PBN injection, mice were sacrificed to collect CEA neurons for scRNA-seq. The manual sorting procedure to isolate cell bodies from micro-dissected brain slices was similar to a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hempel et al., 2007</xref>). Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated to collect 300 μm coronal brain slices. The CEA was manually dissected with spring scissors using the GFP signal as guidance. Afferent fibers from the PBN specifically labeled the CEA but not surrounding nuclei such as the basolateral or medial amygdala, or the amygdala-striatal transition zone, and thus allowed for specific dissection of the CEA without expression of the fluorescent protein in CEA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). Two to three tissue sections from each animal were taken to cover the entire CEA and subjected to protease digestion, after which cells were dissociated. Intact neurons were manually selected into individual wells. Neurons collected from seven animals were pooled for sequencing. Sorted single cells were lysed with 3 µl lysis buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 [Sigma] and 0.1 U/µl RNase inhibitor [Lucigen]) and cDNAs were prepared using the Smart-SCRB chemistry as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cembrowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Barcoded cDNAs were then pooled to make cDNA libraries, and the cDNA libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 550 high-output flowcell with 26 bp in read 1 to obtain the barcode and UMI, and 50 bp in read 2 for cDNA. PhiX control library (Illumina) was spiked in at a final concentration of 15% to improve color balance in read 1. Libraries were sequenced to an average depth of 6,611,566 ± 92,440 (mean ± S.D.) reads per cell.</p><p>Sequencing alignment was performed similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gur et al., 2020</xref>). Sequencing adapters were trimmed from the sequencing reads with Cutadapt v2.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martin, 2011</xref>) prior to alignment with STAR v2.7.5c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) to the <italic>M. musculus</italic> GRCm38.90. genome assembly from Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://asia.ensembl.org/index.html">https://asia.ensembl.org/index.html</ext-link>). Gene counts were generated using the STARsolo algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/docs/STARsolo.md">https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/docs/STARsolo.md</ext-link>). Gene counts for the subset of barcodes used in each library were extracted using custom R scripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>scRNA-seq analysis</title><p>First, genes that were expressed in &lt;5 cells and cells with &lt;200 detected genes were removed from the dataset. Cell doublets/multiplets and low-quality cells were filtered based on the total number of detected genes (1500-7500), relative abundance of mitochondrial transcripts (percent.mito &lt; 0.055) and number of unique molecular identifiers (nUMI) per cell (&lt;2 × 10<sup>5</sup>), respectively. The resulting dataset consisted of 1,626 cells and 33,372 genes. Next, gene expression in remaining cells were normalized to total expression and log transformed. The top 5,000 highly variable features were selected after variance-stabilizing transformation (vst) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>). Gene expression was then z-score transformed after regressing out the effects of latent variables including nUMI and percent.mito. PCA was performed on z-score normalized data. The top 40 PCs from the PCA were used for clustering analysis. Non-neuronal clusters were identified by expression of non-neuronal markers (e.g., <italic>Aqp4</italic>, <italic>Olig1</italic>, <italic>Olig2</italic>, <italic>Opalin</italic>, <italic>Pdgfra</italic>, <italic>Ctss</italic>, <italic>Flt1</italic>, <italic>Epas1</italic>, <italic>Esam</italic>, <italic>Krt18</italic>, <italic>Jchain, Pecam1</italic>) and absence of neuronal markers (<italic>Snap25</italic>, <italic>Syp</italic>, <italic>Tubb3</italic>, <italic>Map1b</italic>, <italic>Elavl2</italic>, <italic>Gad1</italic>, <italic>Gad2</italic>, etc.) and removed. Neuronal clusters outside of the CEA (based on expression of <italic>Neurod6</italic>, <italic>Slc17a7</italic>, <italic>Slc17a6</italic>, <italic>Lhx8</italic>, and <italic>Lhx6</italic>) were also removed from subsequent analysis. The resulting dataset consisted of 1,393 cells and 33,372 genes.</p><p>Next, as described above, variable features were identified and used for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis. The shared nearest neighbor (SNN) with modularity optimization (Louvain algorithm with multilevel refinement procedure and 10 iterations) clustering algorithm implemented in Seurat was used to identify cell clusters. Silhouette score and the Jaccard index distribution after bootstrapping were used to determine the optimal resolution and neighborhood size for clustering, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The Silhouette score is a measure of how similar a cell is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, and the silhouette score for each cell in a specified cluster was calculated as the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the CalculateSilhouette function in Seurat. For bootstrap analysis, we randomly selected 80% of cells from the integrated dataset and performed dimensionality reduction and clustering. We then calculated the Jaccard similarity index between the most similar new cluster and the original cluster. This procedure was repeated 100 times, and the distribution of Jaccard similarity index across clusters was plotted and used to evaluate cluster stability. Clusters with high stability have consistently high Jaccard similarity index with bootstrapping. This bootstrap analysis was performed using <italic>scclusteval</italic> package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tang et al., 2020</xref>) with modifications. Based on these evaluations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), the following parameters were chosen for graph-based clustering of the CEA neurons: k.param=25, resolution = 1.5. Clustering analysis identified 13 neuronal clusters, whose identities were assigned based on expression of enriched genes. BuildClusterTree() function in Seurat was used to generate the dendrogram representing transcriptomic relationships of neuronal clusters. It constructs a phylogenetic tree based on a distance matrix constructed in the PCA space on averaged cell from each cluster. For data visualization, the top 30 PCs were used to calculate the UMAP, with n.neighbors=30L and min.dist=0.3. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, logfc.threshold=0.75, min.pct=0.25), with p-values adjusted based on the Bonferroni correction. The top 50 enriched genes for each neuronal cluster are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Marker gene selection for EASI-FISH</title><p>To identify marker genes for EASI-FISH, we first started with the differentially expressed genes outlined above . We applied a series of selection criteria designed to allow classification of a maximum number of unique cell types using the fewest number of genes possible. As such, in addition to limiting our search to genes with an adjusted p-value cutoff of at least 0.05 and an average log-fold change of 0.55 or over, we also specifically selected markers with as close to binary 'on/off' expression patterns in the cell type of interest as possible, based on high percentage of marker positive cells in the target population compared to low percentage of marker positive cells outside the target population (displayed as pct.1 and pct.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, respectively). This provided us with a candidate gene list, which we cross-validated with Allen ISH data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lein et al., 2007</xref>) based on marker gene expression in the CEA. To independently validate marker gene selection, we also built a combinatorial marker gene panel with a greedy algorithm implemented in <italic>mfishtools</italic>, where marker genes were selected one at a time to maximize the fraction of neurons that can be correctly assigned to the correct identity.</p><p>In addition to marker genes, differentially expressed GPCRs (e.g., <italic>Npy1r</italic>, <italic>Drd1</italic>, <italic>Drd2</italic>, <italic>Htr1b</italic>, and <italic>Htr2c</italic>) were included because of their potential interest as neuromodulatory receptors. A total of 29 marker genes were chosen, and we note that this is not the only combination of genes that could feasibly serve to represent these molecularly defined cell types. Based on cross-correlation analysis, we were able to correctly assign cluster identity to around 60% of neurons in the scRNA-seq dataset based on selected marker genes. Addition of another 71 marker genes (total of 100) provided only modest improvement in the assignment accuracy to 65%. With all genes in the dataset, the cross-correlation analysis assigned 87.8% of neurons to their original identity, with the lowest assignment accuracy in seq-c13 (70%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Integration of scRNA-seq datasets</title><p>We compared our scRNA-seq data with a recently published scRNA-seq dataset in the CEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">O’Leary et al., 2022</xref>) by integrating the two datasets using the canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) implemented in Seurat (v4.2.0). Processed gene count expression and metadata matrices for the O’Leary et al. dataset were directly downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). First of all, gene expressions were normalized to total expression and then log-transformed. Then the top 5,000 highly variable features were selected from each dataset after variance-stabilizing transformation (vst) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>) and used to identify integration anchors through the FindIntegrationAnchors function in Seurat (parameters used: dims=1:50, k.score=30, reduction='cca’, anchor.features=5,000). 3,118 anchors were selected and used to compute a weighted integration vector (k. weight = 100), which was then used to transform the two datasets into a common space (merging O’Leary et al. dataset into our dataset) using Seurat’s IntegrateData function. The integrated dataset with a total of 2,222 cells was then used as input for dimensionality reduction and clustering. UMAP was computed and used for visualization with the following parameters (dims=1:30, n.neighbors=30L, min.dist=0.30, n.epochs=500, seed.use = 6). SNN based clustering was performed on integrated data with the following parameters: k.param=25, resolution = 1.0. To compare scRNA-seq clusters between the integrated data and our study in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Jaccard similarity index was computed using scclusteval package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tang et al., 2020</xref>) with modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Projection-FISH method</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Retrograde labeling</title><p>C57Bl/6J male mice (8 weeks old) were used for all EASI-FISH experiments with retrograde tracer labeling. The non-toxic retrograde tracers cholera toxin b (CTB) conjugated with different fluorophores (Alexa Fluor-488, Alexa Fluor-555, Alexa Fluor-594, Alexa Fluor-647; all Thermo Fisher, 0.5%) and FluoroGold (FG; Fluorochorome, 2%) were injected into the left hemisphere of five selected projection areas of the CEA: the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST; coordinates from bregma: AP 0.25 mm, ML 1.0 mm, DV 4.4 mm), the lateral part of the substantia nigra (lateral SN; AP –3.65 mm, ML 1.8 mm, DV 3.8 mm), the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG; AP –4.65 mm, ML 0.5 mm, DV 2.35 mm), the parabrachial nucleus (PBN; AP –5.2 mm, ML 1.15 mm, DV 3.25 mm), and the parvocellular reticular nucleus (PCRt; AP –6.4 mm, ML 1.25 mm, DV 4.7 mm). The surgery was performed as described above. Animals received up to 0.5 ml 0.9% saline/0.5 ml 5% glucose (subcutaneously) during the surgery. 50 nl of retrograde tracer was injected into each region. For animal #1, BNST was injected with FG, lateral SN CTB-647, vlPAG CTB-594, PBN CTB-555, and PCRt CTB-488. For animal #2, BNST was injected with FG, lateral SN CTB-647, vlPAG CTB-488, PBN CTB-555, and PCRt CTB-594. For animal #3, BNST was injected with FG, lateral SN CTB-594, vlPAG CTB-647, PBN CTB-555, and PCRt CTB-488.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Tissue fixation and preparation</title><p>8–10 weeks after CTB and FG injection, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with RNase-free PBS (15 ml) followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (50 ml). Brain tissue was dissected and fixed in 4% PFA overnight before sectioning on a vibratome. Brain coronal slices (100 µm) were sectioned and stored in 70% ethanol (to preserve RNA) at 4℃ for up to 6 months. The CEA region (approximately –0.7 to –1.9 mm AP from bregma) was cut out using anatomical landmarks as boundaries. Three sections per animal were analyzed, an anterior section (located between –0.7 and –1.0 mm AP from bregma), a medial section (−1.1 to –1.5 mm), and a posterior section (−1.6 to –1.9 mm). For ease of orientation and optimal imaging, the tissue was cut as a rectangle (~2.5 × 4 mm). An RNase-free paintbrush was used for tissue handling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Tissue clearing and projection class imaging</title><p>The tissue slice was rehydrated in PBS at room temperature (RT) (2 × 15 min) and incubated in PBS with 8% SDS (Fisher Scientific) at RT (4 hr) for tissue clearing. Cleared tissue was rinsed in 2× SSC (2 × 1 hr) and stained in PBS with 200 ng/ml DAPI (30 min), followed by rinsing in PBS (2 × 30 min). Next, the sample was transferred to a glass-bottom 6-well plate and mounted with index-matched imaging medium (60% sucrose in PBS) and cover-slipped. The Zeiss 880 confocal with Plan-Apochromat 20×/0.8 M27 objective was used to collect CTB, FG, and nuclear DAPI fluorescence signals. The following four image tracks (z-stack) were collected sequentially. Track 1: CTB-594 was excited by 594 nm laser and signals in the range of 597–633 nm were collected. Track 2: CTB-555 and CTB-647 were excited simultaneously with 561 nm and 633 nm laser and signals in the range of 562–597 nm were collected for CTB-555 and 650–690 nm for CTB-647. Track 3: CTB-488 was excited by 488 nm laser and signal detected in the range of 500–571 nm. Track 4: nuclear DAPI and FG were excited with 405 nm laser, with DAPI signal collected in the range of 410–480 nm and FG in the range of 500–695 nm. Single-color tissue samples were used and imaged separately to correct for signal crosstalk post hoc using Fiji spectral unmixing plugin. Tiled fluorescent images were taken with 10% overlap between tiles, with pixel size 0.73 µm in x and y dimension, and z step size of 0.77 µm.</p><p>To determine whether the tissue clearing and imaging procedure compromise RNA quality, genes uniquely expressed in selected neuronal subset with known expression levels according to scRNA-seq data (<italic>Ezr</italic> in <italic>Prkcd</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons and <italic>Igf1</italic> in <italic>Pmch</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons) were used to determine RNA quality with EASI-FISH. Transcript spot counts in conditions with and without 8% SDS clearing and confocal imaging were assessed and compared.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>EASI-FISH procedure modifications</title><p>After confocal imaging, the tissue sample was recovered and rinsed in PBS (2 × 15 min) and incubated in MOPS buffer (20 mM, pH 7.7, 30 min). Tissue was incubated overnight (37℃) in MOPS buffer (50 µl) with 1 mg/ml MelphaX and gelled according to the EASI-FISH protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Proteinase K digestion in EASI-FISH procedure removes most proteins, including retrograde tracers, and frees up all fluorescence channels. To register confocal image volumes with EASI-FISH images from light-sheet fluorescence imaging, round 0 imaging was performed before DNase I digestion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a ribosomal RNA probe produced a cytosolic stain and was used to register to cytoDAPI in EASI-FISH rounds and nuclear DAPI staining was applied to allow registration to confocal imaging. Specifically, tissue-gel sample was first equilibrated in hybridization buffer (500 µl) for 30 min at 37℃. Samples were then hybridized with a ribosomal RNA probe (sequence: <named-content content-type="sequence">gcgggtcgccacgtctgatctgaggtcgcg/3ATTO550N/</named-content>) (1 µM) in hybridization buffer (300 µl) overnight at 37℃. The next morning, samples were washed in probe wash buffer (2 × 30 min), followed by PBS (2 × 30 min) at 37℃. The tissue-gel sample was then stained in PBS with 200 ng/ml DAPI (30 min), followed by rinsing in PBS (2 × 30 min), and imaged on a Zeiss Z.1 Lightsheet microscope. After imaging, the tissue-gel sample was DNase I digested and processed according to the EASI-FISH protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Projection-FISH data analysis</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>EASI-FISH data processing</title><p>EASI-FISH data analyses, including image stitching, registration, segmentation, spot detection, and assignment, were performed using the pipeline described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). For determining the number of cells expressing a gene, we first calculated the number of background spots in samples lacking that gene to account for nonspecific spots in tissue samples, which gives on average 10 background spots/cell. Based on this, we set the threshold to define positive cells as any cell with a spot count greater than 10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Projection data analysis</title><p>First, projection images were aligned to EASI-FISH images using nuclear DAPI signals. Nuclear DAPI signal from projection image taken by confocal microscope (moving) was used to register to nuclear DAPI signal in round 0 EASI-FISH image (fixed) using Bigstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fleishman, 2021</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/GFleishman/bigstream">https://github.com/GFleishman/bigstream</ext-link>) with modifications. First, 50 features on average were manually selected from both images, matched with RANSAC to calculate the global affine transform for moving image. After applying this global affine transformation, the transformed image volumes were split into overlapping chunks for further processing as described before. Another round of feature selection using Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter and RANSAC-based affine transformation was performed on image chunks, followed by deformable registration. All registration steps on image chunks were executed in parallel. The global affine, piecewise affine, and piecewise deformable transforms were composed to a single displacement vector field stored in N5 format. The forward transform was applied to all projection channels to align them to EASI-FISH images (fixed).</p><p>The EASI-FISH segmentation mask was applied to registered, crosstalk corrected confocal images to calculate the average fluorescence intensity of CTB and FG signals in each neuron (ROI). The fluorescence intensities from each neuron were thresholded based on the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine projection types. Briefly, signal intensities were z-score normalized for each projection. Neurons were then randomly sampled (100 neurons from each projection at each selected normalized threshold) and manually inspected at different fluorescence intensity cut point to generate the ROC curve. The Youden index (J) was used to determine the optimal threshold for each projection, and neurons with fluorescence intensity above this threshold were classified as targetX-projecting and neurons below this threshold were classified as unlabeled.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>FISH clustering analysis</title><p>Cells were first clustered after PCA using graph-based SNN clustering method implemented in Seurat (4.0.1) with Louvain algorithm with multilevel refinement to remove non-neurons as well as neurons outside of the CEA. Parameters for clustering were determined with bootstrap analysis by subsampling 80% of the data for 100 times (k params: 25 and resolution: 0.2). The non-neurons were identified based on small cell body volume and lack of neuronal marker gene expression and removed. 33,139 out of 42,619 cells from 6 samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) were used for downstream analysis. As described before, the clustering analysis was performed after PCA of z-score normalized spot counts (without logarithmic transformation to minimize the weight of false-positive spot detections).</p><p>Subsequent clustering was performed on CEA neurons with parameters optimized with bootstrapping analysis to maximize the number of stable clusters (k parameter: 45; resolution: 1.0). Two confusing clusters were merged, and the clusters were reordered (from high to low) based on the cluster-average total spot counts. For visualization, normalized expression of 29 marker genes were used to calculate the UMAP, with n.neighbors = 30L and min.dist = 0.3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>FISH to scRNA-seq data mapping</title><p>To map FISH data to scRNA-seq clusters, we first z-score normalized the scRNA-seq data and calculated the average marker gene expression in each scRNA-seq cluster. Marker gene expression measured via EASI-FISH was also z-score normalized. Pearson’s correlation was computed between EASI-FISH neurons and scRNA-seq cluster averages. Each EASI-FISH neuron was assigned the scRNA-seq cluster identity with the highest correlation. We then calculated the fraction of neurons from each EASI-FISH cluster that mapped to each scRNA-seq cluster and assigned correspondence based on the highest fraction of neurons from EASI-FISH cluster that mapped to scRNA-seq clusters. MC-7, MC-8, MC-20, and MC-21 were excluded from this analysis as most neurons from these clusters were not in the CEA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Spatial parcellation in the CEA and surrounding area</title><p>As described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), PCA was performed on the expression patterns of 29 marker genes from each sample to identify the most variable and highly correlated spatial patterns. Marker gene expression from EASI-FISH data were first z-score normalized and mapped in 3D to reconstruct the expression patterns. Images containing expression patterns of 29 marker genes were decomposed into PCs. The eigen images from the top four PCs explained on average 71.3 ± 4.3% of variance in each sample. We selected genes that on average have the largest magnitude of weight on each PC as candidates for structural parcellation. Based on this criterion, <italic>Penk</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r1b</italic>, and <italic>Nefm</italic> were chosen for parcellation in all samples. Neighboring brain regions (BLA, ITCs, PAL, AST) were prominent from the PCA, the boundaries were also confirmed with cell size, soma morphology, and density.</p><p>To parcellate the CEA into subregions, neurons were first classified based on their expression of <italic>Penk</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r1b,</italic> and <italic>Nefm</italic>. Otsu’s method implemented in Python scikit-image was used to identify the optimal threshold for this classification. Then Gaussian process classifier with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel (length scale: 1.0) was used (implementation in scikit-learn) to generate the probabilistic segmentation (1 µm isotropic resolution). Probability greater than 0.5 was used as threshold for the segmentation mask. This segmentation was performed separately on each CEA sample. Analysis on spatial distribution of molecularly defined cell types were the same as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Logistic regression to predict projection class with gene expression</title><p>Prediction of projection classes from marker gene expression was assessed using binomial logistic regression. Due to the small number of neurons (1%) with collateral projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), these neurons were excluded from this analysis. Neuronal projection types were binarized for each projection class, and z-score normalized gene expression matrix was used as input to train a multiclass logistic regression classifier to predict its projection probability for each target. Logistic regression was implemented using the scikit-learn package linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV() class with liblinear solver and L2 regularization. To account for data imbalance, the class weights were adjusted inversely proportional to class frequencies from the input data. The performance scores were calculated with 20 randomized repeats of stratified fivefold cross-validation. p-value was calculated with permutation test, where the projection classes were shuffled 100 times to generate randomized data to compute the empirical p-value against the null hypothesis that projection classes and marker gene expression are independent.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All methods for animal care and use were conducted according to National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Janelia Research Campus (Protocol number: 18-174).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes in molecularly defined clusters identified from scRNA-seq data.</title><p>Gene names are listed in the first column, and molecular clusters in the last column. avg_logFC: log fold-chage of the average expression between cells in the cluster of interest and all other cells;

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Richard D Palmiter (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Having consulted with reviewers and editors, our collective impression is that this is a strong study that offers valuable insight into the molecular organization of the central amygdala. However, various points were raised during our discussions that will require your attention before the manuscript can be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The review feels that the current sample size of 1300 cells for scRANseq is quite a low quantity despite having a high sequencing depth.

Given that sequencing clusters are typically listed in order of the cluster size, c1 and c4 would represent some of the larger clusters in the dataset, and do appear to have top marker genes from the supplementary table. If so, excluding these from spatial validation lacks justification, particularly when the cell number is already quite low. The authors should consider selecting some of these markers from these clusters for spatial validation.</p><p>2. The spatial resolution and utility of the EASI-fish technique is showcased elegantly in the present study. However, snRNAseq is also a high throughput technique that should reflect the level of heterogeneity in gene expression at the transcriptomic level. There seems to be a quite a difference in the number of clusters between the two techniques (13 seq-cs and 21 MCs), which the authors do not really discuss. It is unclear whether this is due to the lack of cells in the scRNAseq dataset (1300) compared to the EASI-FISH data set (~33000). This may be addressed by adding more cells to the scRNAseq dataset.</p><p>3. The violin plots in Figure 1B and Figure 3B do not appear to be organized by cluster and are hard to interpret in this way.

However, the experiment in this manuscript was only performed in male subjects. This study would benefit from evaluation of female subjects as it is now standard in the field.</p><p>2. The work presented in this manuscript is a purely descriptive genetic and anatomical study that can be applied to the multiple functions of the CeA. While the authors mentioned some of these functions in their introduction, many important CeA-dependent functions that are also cell-type-specific were not mentioned. These include alcohol use (Torruella-Suarez et al. 2020 and Domi et al. 2021), drug craving (Venniro et al. 2018 and 2020), itch (Samineni et al. 2021), general anesthetics (Hua et al. 2020), and pain (Wilson et al. 2019, various papers on CRH cells from the Neugebauer lab). Including the multiple functions of the CeA, many of which have been reported to depend on the same genetically defined cell type, underscores the need for a more detailed categorization of CeA neurons that goes beyond the expression of a single gene.</p><p>3. Related to the point above, multiple papers from the Sheets lab have also shown distinct electrophysiological properties of CeA neurons based on subnuclei within the CeA, efferent projections, and morphology. Different CeA subnuclei have also been shown to be functionally distinct in the modulation of multiple behaviors (Kim et al. 2017). Separate work from the Palmiter lab has also shown that the anterior and posterior CeA are also functionally distinct. Including this information in the manuscript will strengthen the justification for the need to identify new strategies to target and manipulate anatomically distinct CeA neurons.</p><p>4. The authors mention one study that has previously described single nucleus RNA sequencing in the CeA of rats and present their findings in the context of that previous study. However, at least 2 previously published studies (Samineni et al. 2021 and O'Leary et al. 2022) have also completed transcriptomic analyses of CeA neurons in mice, and these studies were not discussed. Two additional papers from the Tonegawa and Ressler's labs have also completed thorough anatomical descriptions of selected genes within the CeA, including co-expression patterns. Multiple papers have also described the genetic identity of CeA neurons with specific long-range projection targets, including some of the projections described in this manuscript. A transparent discussion of the previously published work and the author's interpretation of the similarities and differences between the present results and previously published studies would be useful. A clear distinction between new findings and results that confirm previously published work is imperative.</p><p>5. The authors claim that they evaluated the morphological properties of the molecularly defined CEA cell types but only included size and cell body shape. They concluded that &quot;most neurons in the CEA have a medium size, with a similar cell body shape&quot;. This overly simplified conclusion can be misleading, particularly in light of multiple studies demonstrating that CeA neurons are morphologically heterogeneous.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84262.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Having consulted with reviewers and editors, our collective impression is that this is a strong study that offers valuable insight into the molecular organization of the central amygdala. However, various points were raised during our discussions that will require your attention before the manuscript can be considered further for publication in eLife.</p><p>1) The review feels that the current sample size of 1300 cells for scRANseq is quite a low quantity despite having a high sequencing depth. We think that there may be a sampling bias inherent to the low quantity of cells. We request that the authors increase their sample size.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the reviewer’s concern by combining our original dataset (1,393 cells) with a recently published study (O'Leary et al., 2022) (829 cells) through the canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) implemented in Seurat (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) for a total of 2,222 cells. Dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis on the integrated data showed that all neurons from the O’Leary et al. dataset mapped to neurons from our dataset and no O’Leary et al. specific clusters were identified (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-B), suggesting that the original dataset covered the molecular diversity in the CEA. We also evaluated the clustering by comparing the integrated clusters (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C) with our original clusters using Jaccard similarity index. We found consistent clustering of most neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 3D-E), only with the following exceptions: seq-c1 is largely absent from the O’Leary et al. dataset, seq-c4 and seq-c12 were grouped into one cluster (cluster 5), and seq-c13 was split into two clusters, cluster 3 and cluster 6, which are the closest clusters on the cluster tree (Figure 1—figure supplement 3F). An additional 28 neurons in the combined dataset clustered together but showed differential expression of RNA spike-ins (ERCCs) (cluster 1 in the combined data) and represented cells with low quality, as indicated by reduced gene count and total RNA counts (Figure 1—figure supplement 3G). These results indicate that the scRNA-Seq clusters presented in this study does not have a sampling bias.</p><p>In addition, we compared our scRNA-Seq clusters with a new preprint (Peters et al., 2022) based on their selected marker gene expressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>). Based on examining expression of the marker genes reported by Peters et al. (data not publicly available) in our own scRNA-Seq data, we were able to match most of CEA clusters in the Peters, et al. study to our dataset. We also found additional clusters in our data that were not identified by Peters, et al. For example, <italic>Gal</italic>/<italic>Gpx3</italic> (seq-c3), which we validated by FISH. Notably, Peters et al. sequenced a larger number of cells (3,325 cells) using droplet-based methods, but they did not find additional cell clusters, which further validates our clustering results.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>ScRNA-Seq cluster correspondence between the Peters et al.</title><p>study and this study.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Peters, et al.

We have now included additional information in the main text and supplemental figure to discuss the exclusion of seq-c1, seq-c4 and seq-c12 for marker gene selection.</p><p>For seq-c1, despite that candidate marker genes were identified from scRNA-Seq data based on their differential expression between seq-c1 and the rest of the population, we found that most of these candidate marker genes showed broad expression patterns in the CEA and surrounding areas, which is also evident in Allen ISH data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). We did not think choosing a gene with such broad regional expression but with expression in only 66% of the neurons of our seq-c1 was useful, and this reduced our confidence in the cluster, so we excluded it. Moreover, in light of the availability to compare our dataset with two new datasets (O’Leary et al. and Peters et al. datasets), this decision to exclude the cluster in marker gene selection appears justified by the fact that seq-c1 was not evident in these two new datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref> and Figure 1—figure supplement 3B).</p><p>For seq-c4 and seq-c12, the candidate marker genes (<italic>Ppia, Tuba1b, Gnas</italic>) lack high cluster selectivity/specificity, based on the fraction of neurons expressing these markers in other clusters (Table S1, all marker genes have pct.2 greater than 0.3 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B-C</xref>). Given the high sequencing depth for these neurons, it is unlikely that we have failed to detect highly selective marker genes from these neurons. Instead, these clusters are <italic>Nefm</italic> (<italic>Fxyd6</italic>)<italic>-</italic>expressing CEA GABAergic cells (new Figure 1B) that are mostly distinguished from other clusters by the absence of additional unique marker genes (e.g., lack of <italic>Penk</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r1b</italic> and <italic>Prkcd</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2E</xref>). We included <italic>Nefm</italic> in our panel of marker gene probes.

Furthermore, clustering analysis after merging our data with O’Leary et al. showed that seq-c4 and seq-c12 were grouped into a single cluster (integrated Cluster 5) that is <italic>Nefm</italic>-expressing and continued to lack highly selective marker genes (Figure 1—figure supplement 3E). This cluster most likely corresponds to CeM_Il1rapl2 in Peters et al. dataset, which also showed the least marker gene selectivity in our scRNA-Seq dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that cells lacking other marker genes (<italic>Penk</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r1b</italic>) but expressing <italic>Nefm</italic> are representative of a corresponding large number of cells in our original scRNA-Seq Clusters 4 &amp;12 (integrated Cluster 5).</p><p>Thus, based on evidence above, we did not include additional differentially expressed (DE)-genes identified from seq-c1, seq-c4, and seq-c12 for further analysis.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Candidate marker genes and their expression from seq-c1, c4 and c12.</title><p>(A) Sagittal sections from Allen ISH database showing expression patterns of selected seq-c1 marker genes at the central amygdala and surround area, as schematized from reference atlas-defined regions.

We agree with the reviewer that this could be related to the difference in number of cells between the two datasets, as all additional EASI-FISH clusters are further split from existing scRNA-Seq clusters.

These include alcohol use (Torruella-Suarez et al. 2020 and Domi et al. 2021), drug craving (Venniro et al. 2018 and 2020), itch (Samineni et al. 2021), general anesthetics (Hua et al. 2020), and pain (Wilson et al. 2019, various papers on CRH cells from the Neugebauer lab). Including the multiple functions of the CeA, many of which have been reported to depend on the same genetically defined cell type, underscores the need for a more detailed categorization of CeA neurons that goes beyond the expression of a single gene.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments and have now included these important functional aspects and corresponding references in the introduction section (Page 3-5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Related to the point above, multiple papers from the Sheets lab have also shown distinct electrophysiological properties of CeA neurons based on subnuclei within the CeA, efferent projections, and morphology. Different CeA subnuclei have also been shown to be functionally distinct in the modulation of multiple behaviors (Kim et al. 2017). Separate work from the Palmiter lab has also shown that the anterior and posterior CeA are also functionally distinct. Including this information in the manuscript will strengthen the justification for the need to identify new strategies to target and manipulate anatomically distinct CeA neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments and have now included these references in the main text (Page 4, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors mention one study that has previously described single nucleus RNA sequencing in the CeA of rats and present their findings in the context of that previous study. However, at least 2 previously published studies (Samineni et al. 2021 and O'Leary et al. 2022) have also completed transcriptomic analyses of CeA neurons in mice, and these studies were not discussed. Two additional papers from the Tonegawa and Ressler's labs have also completed thorough anatomical descriptions of selected genes within the CeA, including co-expression patterns. Multiple papers have also described the genetic identity of CeA neurons with specific long-range projection targets, including some of the projections described in this manuscript. A transparent discussion of the previously published work and the author's interpretation of the similarities and differences between the present results and previously published studies would be useful. A clear distinction between new findings and results that confirm previously published work is imperative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included extensive additional information and detailed analysis in the results and figures to address the reviewer’s suggestion for O’Leary et al. 2022. Samineni et al. 2021 was cited by us, but this study uses bulk RNA-Seq and was less relevant to the analyses that we performed here. We cited the influential two papers from Kim/Tonegawa (14 times) and McCullough/Ressler (4 times) extensively in the context of our analysis of cell types, which serves to point the reader to past quantitative work examining the co-expression of subsets of the marker genes evaluated by us. For example, we note in the Introduction: “Additional work has demonstrated that some of these markers (Sst, Crh, Nts) have a considerable degree of overlap in the same neurons, whereas others are distinct (e.g., Prkcd) (McCullough, Morrison, et al., 2018).” However, we defined cell populations in the context of co-expression of many more genes, thus it is difficult to perform a detailed comparison. We state this in the discussion: “Although CeM neurons have been reported to be associated with neuropeptide marker genes (Kim et al., 2017; McCullough, Morrison, et al., 2018), we found that these neuropeptide-expressing cell types made up only a small proportion of the cells in the CeM.” We also mention that: “Other previously reported CeM markers were expressed in more than one molecularly defined cell type. For example, Pnoc (Hardaway et al., 2019) was broadly expressed across most major CeM cell types (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). While the D2-receptor (Drd2) was primarily expressed in two CeM clusters (MC-5 and MC-14, both corresponding to seq-c5 but differing in Penk expression), the D1-receptor (Drd1) was primarily expressed in the AST cluster (MC-7) and the intercalated cells (MC-21). Drd1 was also detected (&gt;10%) in multiple CeM clusters (MC-1, MC-11, MC-12, MC-16, and MC-18: seq-c2, seq-c4, seq-c11) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 4), largely consistent with a previous report (Kim et al., 2017).” In the results we note: “Although calcitonin receptor-like (Calcrl) has been proposed as a distinguishing marker gene between Prkcd neuron types (Kim et al., 2017), it was expressed in a subset of cells in both seq-c6 (9.1% of neurons) and seq-c8 (36% of neurons).” Related to this, in the Discussion we note: “We identified two populations with Prkcd expression, one in rostral CEA (MC-10 corresponds to seq-c6) and one in caudal CEA (MC-6 corresponds to seq-c8) with a higher fraction of neurons expressing Prkcd, which likely correspond to the rCEA Calcrl+ and cCEA Calcrl+ neurons identified in (Bowen et al., 2022).”Also for CeL and CeC we noted: “Consistent with previous reports, we detected significant levels of co-localization in CeC/CeL of previously used marker genes such as Sst, Crh, Nts and Tac2, which were distinct from Prkcd-expressing neurons (Kim et al., 2017; McCullough, Morrison, et al., 2018; Ye and Veinante, 2019).” And “A closely related Sst-expressing cell type, MC-2, expressed Vipr2, was partially offset to the medial portion of the CeL and co-expressed varying proportions of Sst, Nts, Crh (Kim et al., 2017; McCullough, Morrison, et al., 2018).” And “The anterior CeC also contained a Drd2 cell type co-expressing Scn4b (MC-5) that extended ventrally from the AST and projected to lateral SN, which likely corresponded to previously reported Drd2 neurons in and around CEA that enhance conditioned freezing (McCullough, Daskalakis, et al., 2018).” We also wrote: “Recently, single nucleus RNA sequencing from the CEA in rat identified 13 neuronal types (11/13 neuronal types were from CEA) (Dilly et al., 2022). We found good correspondence with major CEA cell types identified by Dilly, et al., such as the Prkcd and the Crh neurons in the CeC and CeL, and the Drd1 and Drd2 neurons in the CeM. However, the separation of rat CEA Sst subtypes in Dilly, et al. was not clear. In addition to these major cell types, our study revealed additional cell type diversity in the mouse CEA, especially in the CeM, which had been largely underdefined. In addition, our molecularly defined mouse CEA cluster also matched well with two recent studies in mouse CEA (O'Leary et al., 2022; Peters et al., 2022) (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).”</p><p>Moreover, the incidence of detected genes and co-expression values (e.g. % positive) will be sensitive to differences in analysis, which was based on transcript count detections for us and integrated fluorescence intensity for Tonegawa and Ressler studies. Slight differences in how experimenters defined their baseline values can influence the number of cells reported as positive for gene. In our case, we thresholded the gene expression against background spots and any cell with a spot count of greater than 10 was identified as gene positive.</p><p>We have cited a number of cases of analysis of projections from cells expressing specific marker genes: “We did not evaluate intra-CeA connectivity, but Prkcd neurons of the CeC and CeL have been reported to also form connections with CeM neurons (Ye and Veinante, 2019), some of which go on to project to the PAG (Haubensak et al., 2010). In addition, Prkcd-neurons are also engaged in a recursive inhibitory local circuit with CeL Sst neurons (Fadok et al., 2017; Hunt et al., 2017).” We also note in the discussion: “The functional significance of two Sst neuron populations in CeL is not known, but functional activation of CeLCRH neurons, possibly projecting to vlPAG (likely MC-2), has been shown to promote flight responses (Andero et al., 2014), whereas activation of CeLSST projecting to vlPAG (likely MC-2 and MC-3) promotes freezing (Fadok et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2016). However, these earlier studies may include contributions from neurons expressing these genes in CeM, thus state-dependent effects (Fadok et al., 2018; Moscarello and Penzo, 2022) that primarily affect separate CEA subpopulations cannot be excluded.” We also mention other CEA axon projection studies in the context of our findings: “However, it remains to be investigated whether these distinct molecular clusters with common projection targets serve specific functions, such as associative learning to salient stimuli, feeding or predatory behavior which have been previously linked to CEA projections to the lateral SN, PBN or PCRt, respectively (Douglass et al., 2017; Han et al., 2017; Steinberg et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors claim that they evaluated the morphological properties of the molecularly defined CEA cell types but only included size and cell body shape. They concluded that &quot;most neurons in the CEA have a medium size, with a similar cell body shape&quot;. This overly simplified conclusion can be misleading, particularly in light of multiple studies demonstrating that CeA neurons are morphologically heterogeneous.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point and have now modified the language to limit our description to soma and discussed the limitation of this characterization in Page 12 Line 276.</p></body></sub-article></article>
