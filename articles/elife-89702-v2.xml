Ciliome gene mutations underlie a group of pleiotropic genetic diseases known as ciliopathies. Proper cilium function requires the tight coregulation of ciliome gene transcription, which is only fragmentarily understood. RFX transcription factors (TF) have an evolutionarily conserved role in the direct activation of ciliome genes both in motile and non-motile cilia cell-types. In vertebrates, FoxJ1 and FoxN4 Forkhead (FKH) TFs work with RFX in the direct activation of ciliome genes, exclusively in motile cilia cell-types. No additional TFs have been described to act together with RFX in primary cilia cell-types in any organism. Here we describe FKH-8, a FKH TF, as a direct regulator of the sensory ciliome genes in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. FKH-8 is expressed in all ciliated neurons in C. <italic>elegans</italic>, binds the regulatory regions of ciliome genes, regulates ciliome gene expression, cilium morphology and a wide range of behaviors mediated by sensory ciliated neurons. FKH-8 and DAF-19 (<italic>C. elegans</italic> RFX) physically interact and synergistically regulate ciliome gene expression. <italic>C. elegans</italic> FKH-8 function can be replaced by mouse FOXJ1 and FOXN4 but not by other members of other mouse FKH subfamilies. In conclusion, RFX and FKH TF families act jointly as direct regulators of ciliome genes also in sensory ciliated cell types suggesting that this regulatory logic could be an ancient trait predating functional cilia sub-specialization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>cilium</kwd><kwd>terminal

organelles defined as specialized membrane protrusions formed from a stereotyped assembly of microtubules. Cilia are composed of hundreds of proteins, required for their assembly, structure and function, which are collectively known as the ciliome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cilia can be classified into motile or non-motile based on their function and structure: motile cilia are responsible for propelling cells or generating fluid flow while non-motile (a.k.a primary or sensory) cilia function as cellular antennae to sense extracellular stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>). Cilia appeared early in eukaryotic evolution and it is thought that in ancient unicellular eukaryotes cilia displayed mixed motile and sensory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mitchell, 2017</xref>). In multicellular invertebrates, primary and motor cilia are restricted to specific cell types. In contrast, in vertebrates, primary cilia are present almost in every cell, including neurons, while motile cilia are present only in specialized cell types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FKH-8 is a candidate for direct regulation of ciliome gene expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schema for a sensory cilium.

In addition, motile cilia usually contain specialized axonemal dyneins, other motile-specific components and specific signaling proteins while the membrane of sensory cilia is decorated with receptors that trigger downstream signaling cascades when they are activated by small molecules, mechanical perturbations, or radiation.</p><p>The importance and wide range of cilia functions are underscored by the large number of congenital disorders caused by mutations in genes coding for ciliome components, which are collectively called ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreu-Cervera et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Horani and Ferkol, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tobin and Beales, 2009</xref>). These disorders cause a broad spectrum of symptoms including retinal degeneration, polycystic kidney, deafness, polydactyly, brain and skeletal malformations, infertility, morbid obesity and mental retardation. Importantly, there are still many ‘orphan ciliopathies’, which correspond to congenital disorders classified as ciliopathies by phenotype but with yet unidentified causal mutations. Genetic variants lying in coding genes (including mutations in the ciliome genes) are easier to identify as causal mutations, however, most variants associated to human diseases lie in the non-coding genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chatterjee and Ahituv, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Battle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Timpson et al., 2018</xref>). It is currently thought that some of these non-coding variants act as regulatory mutations affecting gene expression. Thus, regulatory mutations affecting ciliome gene expression might underlie many orphan ciliopathies. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that ensure correct co-regulation of ciliome genes is then of utmost importance.</p><p>Little is known about the direct transcriptional co-regulation of ciliome gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lewis and Stracker, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>).

This work was followed by numerous reports on the role of different members of the RFX TF family as direct ciliome gene regulators both in primary and motile cilia cell-types in several animal models including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, <italic>Xenopus laevis,</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashique et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonnafe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Chung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dubruille et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Liu et al., 2007</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sugiaman-Trapman et al., 2018</xref>). FOXJ1, an ancient member of the Forkhead family, also acts as a direct activator of ciliome gene transcription in several vertebrates, but its role is limited to cell types containing motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brody et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stubbs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Vij et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yu et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, currently additional TFs acting together with RFX TFs in the direct regulation of the ciliome gene expression in sensory cilia cell-types are unknown in any organism.</p><p>Here, we take advantage of the amenability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> for genetic studies to understand the transcriptional regulatory logic of the non-motile primary cilliome genes. <italic>C. elegans</italic> contains sensory but not motile cilia. In hermaphrodites, sensory cilia are found in 25 out of the 118 neuronal types known as the ciliated sensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We find that FKH-8, a FKH TF, is expressed in all ciliated sensory neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, with an onset of expression concomitant to the start of ciliome gene expression. Chromatin immuno-precipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) data analysis shows that FKH-8 binds to a broad range of ciliome genes, at locations often near X-box motifs, the binding sites for DAF-19/RFX. <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutants show decreased ciliome reporter gene expression, cilia morphology abnormalities and deficits in a wide range of behaviors mediated by sensory cilia. In addition, we find FKH-8/FKH and DAF-19/RFX can physically interact and act synergistically in the regulation of ciliome genes. Finally, we show that mouse FoxJ1 and FoxN4, two ancient FKH TFs known to directly regulate ciliome gene expression in vertebrate motile-cilia cell types, rescue <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutant expression defects in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This functional conservation is not observed with members of other FKH sub-families. Our results identify FKH-8 as the first TF acting together with RFX TFs in the direct regulation of the ciliome genes in sensory-ciliated cells and suggest that this function could be evolutionary conserved in vertebrates. Taken together, a global ciliome regulatory logic starts to emerge in which RFX and FKH TFs could act together in the direct regulation of ciliome gene expression both in cell types containing motile or primary cilia. Considering that ancestral eukaryotic cilium is proposed to combine motile and sensory functions, we speculate that RFX / FKH regulatory module might represent the ancestral state of eukaryotic ciliome gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Persistent activity of regulatory regions for ciliome genes in <italic>daf-19</italic>/RFX mutants</title><p>The activity of regulatory regions controlling ciliome gene expression is dramatically reduced in <italic>daf-19(m86</italic>) null mutants.

As <italic>daf-19</italic> is the only RFX TF encoded in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, we reasoned that persistent ciliome enhancer activity in <italic>daf-19(m86</italic>) null mutants would underscore the presence of additional TF families acting in concert with DAF-19. Based on previous data, we selected enhancers and built fluorescent reporters for ten phylogenetically conserved and broadly expressed core cilia components: five intraflagelar transport (IFT) genes (<italic>che-11, osm-1, ift-20, che-13, osm-5</italic>); the transition zone transmembrane genes <italic>tmem-107</italic> and <italic>mks-1</italic>; a Tubby family of bipartite transcription factors involved in receptor trafficking (<italic>tub-1</italic>); the dynein-component <italic>xbx-1</italic> and the ubiquitin protein ligase <italic>peli-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Human orthologs for several of these genes are linked to ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Horani and Ferkol, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Thevenon et al., 2016</xref>). All fluorescent reporters contain at least one experimentally validated X-box, the binding site for DAF-19/RFX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To avoid the dauer constitutive phenotype of <italic>daf-19(m86</italic>) null animals, we analyzed reporter expression in <italic>daf-19(m86); daf-12(sa204</italic>) double mutants and <italic>daf-12(sa204</italic>) was used as control, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">De Stasio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Phirke et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>daf-12(sa204</italic>) worms, all reporters show broad activity in the ciliated system, with mean reporter expression in at least 30 ciliated neurons, except for <italic>mks-1</italic> and <italic>osm-5</italic> reporters that showed expression in less than 20 cells, suggesting other enhancers outside the analyzed sequences might drive expression in additional ciliated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

We hypothesized that these short constructs might lack binding sites for additional TFs acting with DAF-19. Indeed, we find that shorter versions of <italic>xbx-1</italic> and <italic>peli-1</italic> reporter constructs are more affected by <italic>daf-19</italic> mutation than corresponding longer constructs, consistent with shorter sequences lacking additional regulatory information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Altogether our data strongly suggests that additional TF or TFs act together with DAF-19 to directly activate core ciliome gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of FKH-8 as candidate regulator of ciliome gene expression</title><p>We reasoned that similar to <italic>daf-19,</italic> additional regulators of cilia gene expression could act broadly on many genes coding for ciliome components and in many different ciliated neuron types. Thus, to identify these putative candidates, we combined three strategies: <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory analysis of the ciliome genes, TF expression enrichment in the sensory ciliated system and TF binding to putative regulatory regions of the ciliome genes.</p><p>We built a manually curated list of 163 cilium effector genes (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This list can be divided in four categories: (1) 73 ‘<italic>core components’</italic> present in all types of cilia and thus expressed by all ciliated neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Core components include IFT particles, kinesins, dyneins, BBSome complex, etc; (2) 68 ‘<italic>Subtype specific’</italic> genes, that code for channels or receptors located in cilia that are expressed in a neuron-type-specific manner, providing neuron-type-specific functions; (3) 13 ‘<italic>Broad expression’</italic> genes, specifically expressed within the ciliated system but not associated with well-defined core cilia functions and (4) 9 ‘<italic>Male’</italic> genes that code for genes with male-specific cilia functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>De novo motif enrichment analysis using the promoters of ciliome genes identified previously known RFX consensus binding sites (X-box motif). In agreement with published results, X-box motifs are preferentially associated to ‘<italic>Core’</italic> and ‘<italic>Broadly expressed’</italic> ciliome genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burghoorn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Efimenko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Swoboda et al., 2000</xref>). An additional motif matching the pro-neural bHLH TF <italic>lin-32</italic>/Atoh1 is present in 28% of the genes, with no particular bias to any ciliome category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The pro-neural binding motif might reflect the neuronal nature of this gene set, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> cilia are only present in neurons. Motif enrichment analysis limited only to the 102 genes containing predicted X-box sites identified two additional motifs one showing similarity to DAF-19/RFX binding site and the other to the previously reported C-BOX motif for whom TF binding has not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burghoorn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Analysis limited to the 61 genes lacking predicted X-box sites failed to identify enriched motifs for known transcription factors. Thus, motif enrichment of ciliome genes regulatory regions failed to pinpoint additional TF candidates to regulate ciliome gene expression. The X-box motif consists of a long imperfect palindromic consensus binding site with high information content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), in contrast, most TF binding motifs (TFBM) are often short and degenerate, thus predicted matches can be found at high frequency in the genome. This feature might underlie the failure to find enriched motifs for additional TFs in ciliome gene regulatory regions.</p><p>As an alternative to motif enrichment analysis, we turned to TF expression enrichment. We hypothesized that TFs acting broadly on sensory cilia gene expression could show enriched expression in the sensory ciliated neurons. Using available single cell RNA expression data (sc-RNAseq) from the second larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cao et al., 2017</xref>), we retrieved the expression pattern of 861 <italic>C. elegans</italic> transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Narasimhan et al., 2015</xref>). Ten transcription factors are specifically enriched within the ciliated sensory neurons compared to other neuron types or non-neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Not surprisingly, <italic>daf-19</italic> expression is not enriched in ciliated neurons, as <italic>daf-19</italic> is expressed panneuronally and only a specific splicing isoform is restricted to ciliated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Senti et al., 2008</xref>). The expression of TFs controlling terminal identity is often maintained throughout the life of the animal. Using an independent set of sc-RNAseq data from young adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>), we found that among the 10 TF candidates only FKH-8 expression is detected in all 25 different types of sensory ciliated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting it could be a good candidate to act together with DAF-19 in the regulation of ciliome gene expression.</p><p>Finally, we interrogated 446 published ChIP-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Luo et al., 2020</xref>), corresponding to 259 different TFs (including FKH-8 but not DAF-19), for nearby binding to the ciliome gene list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). We find FKH-8 behaves very differently from the rest of TFs with at least one FKH-8 binding peak associated to 49% of the genes on the ciliome gene list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). FKH-8 binds both core components and subtype-specific ciliome genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), although similar to X-box motifs, FKH-8 binding is significantly more prevalent for core ciliome genes (75% compared to 22% binding to subtype genes). Thus, both sc-RNAseq and ChIPseq data analysis pinpoint FKH-8 as a good candidate TF to directly control ciliome gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FKH-8 is expressed in all ciliated sensory neurons</title><p>FKH-8::GFP fosmid expression at young adult stage is detected in all ciliated sensory neurons, as assessed by co-localization with the <italic>ift-20</italic> core ciliome reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

X-boxes are less significantly or not significantly enriched in ChIP-seq datasets for other FKH TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>), which is consistent with specific co-binding of DAF-19 and FKH-8.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the presence of X-boxes and FKH-8 binding events specifically associated to ciliome genes. Regulatory sequences for 34% of ciliome genes contain both X-box motifs and FKH-8 genomic binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). This dual regulatory signature is more prevalent in core ciliome genes (present in 62% of this gene category) than in subtype-specific ciliome (present in 6% of these genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). In addition, most X-boxes are located less than 600 bp from the center of its closest FKH-8 ChIP-seq peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), this close proximity is a feature of core-ciliome components (found in 66% of core ciliome genes) but not for sub-type ciliome genes (only 9% of X-boxes found in this category contain a nearby FKH-8 peak) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we assessed FKH-8 and DAF-19 physical interaction by co-expression in HEK293 cells and co-immunoprecipitation. Our results show that FKH-8 and DAF-19 interact bound to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and ) and more importantly also in the nuclear soluble fraction free of chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>).

The beads were separated by a magnetic separator and washed three times in 500 µl TNE buffer 0.1% Triton X-100. Finally, for reducing SDS-PAGE analysis, 30 µl 2xLaemmli buffer (with 2% ß-MeOH) was added and the samples were boiled for 5 min at 96 ° C. Anti-mouse Light chain-specific secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch ref: 115-655-174) were used for detection since the heavy chain from the immunoprecipitation would mask the FKH-8 signal [anti-HA antibody (Biolegend 901501), anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, F1804)]. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were controlled using antibodies against MEK2 (Becton Dickinson, 610235), marker for cytoplasmic fraction and histone H3, marker for chromatin associated fraction (Abcam ab1791).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microscopy</title><p>For scoring and image acquisition, worms were anesthetized with a drop of 0.5 M sodium azide (Sigma, #26628-22-8) on 4% agarose pads (diluted in distilled water) placed over a regular microscope glass slide (Rogo Sampaic, #11854782). These preparations were sealed with a 24x60 mm coverslip (RS France, #BPD025) and animals were then conveniently examined.</p><p>Scoring of ciliome features was performed observing the animals on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope using a 63 X objective. Assessment of fluorescence signal on PDE and Phasmid regions was performed <italic>de visu</italic>. To appropriately assess number of cells in the head, optical sections containing the volume of reporter-positive neurons in the head of the animals were acquired at 1 μm intervals and images were manually scored using FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Reporters used in the FKH cis-mutational analyses (both <italic>wild type</italic> and mutated forms) were scored <italic>de visu</italic> as the low intensity and fast bleaching in their signals precluded us from taking pictures.</p><p>Fluorescence intensity levels from the endogenous <italic>osm-5::SL2::GFP::H2B</italic> reporter strain were measured on young adult animals grown at 25 °C. All images were acquired with a TCS-SP8 Leica Microsystems confocal microscope using a 63 X objective on animals immobilized as previously described.

To avoid a possible bias induced by the volume of the worm’s body, <italic>dat-1::cherry</italic> reporter was used to select a single section for the PDE, CEPV, CEPD and ADE nuclei and was used for <italic>osm-5::GFP</italic> fluorescence quantification. The contour of each nucleus was delineated and fluorescence intensity quantified using FIJI. For each cell, corrected total cell fluorescence was calculated as follows: Integrated Density – (Area of selected cell X Mean fluorescence of background reading).</p><p>For cilia morphology assessment, 0.5 M sodium azide was used as an immobilization agent image acquisition was performed with a TCS-SP8 Leica Microsystems confocal microscope using a 63 X objective. The following conditions of optical sections (μm) were used: CEP: 0.4 μm; ADF: 0.2; AWB: 0.24; AWC: 0.3. Retrieved images were z-projected at maximum intensity (Leica LAS X LS) and linear adjustment for brightness and contrast was performed prior to cilia length quantification (N≥32 cilia per neuron type; FIJI). AWA analysis was performed from images acquired from dorsoventrally positioned animals (N=7) in which both cilia were levelled and depth of arborisation was estimated from the volume containing all the optical sections (0.3 μm) in which fluorescence signal was observed. Ciliary morphology was also measured on animals immobilized as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Niwa, 2017</xref>) using 10% (w/v) agarose pads and 2.5% solids (w/v) aqueous suspension of polystyrene microspheres with 100 nm of diameter (Polysciences, #00876–15). Optical sections containing the volume of reporter-positive cilia were acquired at 0.3 μm intervals. Images were z-projected at maximum intensity (Leica LAS X LS) and linear adjustment for brightness and contrast was performed prior to ciliary length quantification (N≥30 cilia per neuron type) (FIJI).</p><p>All micrographs presented in this paper were acquired with a TCS-SP8 Leica Microsystems confocal microscope using a 63 X objective and appropriate zooming conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical significance for the mean number of reporter-positive neurons in whole animals among different genetic backgrounds was assessed by two-tailed t-test.

Behavioral responses were ultimately analysed through the corresponding indexes ranging from 0 to 1 (or to –1–0 when avoidance responses were assayed).

Briefly, average number of reporter-expressing neurons found in the whole animals for each genetic background was transformed into the corresponding fold change related to the observed mean value in the <italic>daf-12</italic> single mutant. Next, expected values for the fold change corresponding to triple <italic>daf-12; daf-19, fkh-8</italic> mutants were calculated as the product of the mean observed values for the double <italic>daf-12; daf-19</italic> and daf-12; <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutant strains. To calculate the associated error for this indirect measure, propagation error was used (sum of each standard deviation between the corresponding mean from each observed value in each double mutant multiplied by the value of the expected value). Statistical significance between observed and expected values was then assessed through a one-sample t test.</p><p>For the assessment of statistical significance in rescue experiments, data was categorically classified as ‘on’ or ‘off’ and the significance of the association was examined using the two-tailed Fisher’s exact test.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Forkhead transcription factor FKH-8 is a master regulator of primary cilia in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, , including Douglas Portman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. However, if you are able to carry out the significant additional work that would be required to address the concerns below, we would be willing to consider a significantly revised manuscript as a new submission.</p><p>As you will see, both reviewers find the question you address, as well as the identification of fkh-8, to be of interest. However, there are multiple significant concerns with the work as it stands. In particular, Reviewer #2 raises important concerns about calling fhk-8 a &quot;master regulator,&quot; given its relatively weak mutant phenotypes, as well as concerns about a lack of clarity regarding the nature of the functional relationship between fkh-8 and daf-19. (Although it is not specifically noted in either of the reviews below, showing that ectopic expression of fkh-8, or perhaps fkh-8 and daf-19 together, is sufficient to activate cilium genes in non-ciliated neurons might help address some of these issues.) Related to this are concerns, described below, with the methods used to detect and quantify cilium gene expression. There is also an important concern about using language rigorously -- this arises, for example, by repeatedly discussing the binding of FKH-8 to particular regions without any direct demonstration of this, and by using terms like 'master regulator' and 'synergy' without strong support. We hope that you will find the detailed comments of the reviewers listed below helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this paper, Brocal-Ruiz et al. set out to identify factors that work together with the RFX factor DAF-19 in the development of sensory cilia in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Using an informatic approach, they identify the Forkhead-family transcription factor FKH-8 as a candidate for this role. Their findings largely support the idea that fkh-8 is expressed broadly in sensory cilia, that it acts cell-autonomously and directly to activate the expression of many cilium-specific genes, and that full expression of these genes may depend on synergy between DAF-19 and FKH-8. Consistent with this, animals lacking fkh-8 have defects in cilium morphology and in many sensory behaviors that require the function of ciliated neurons. Interestingly, they provide evidence that some vertebrate Forkhead-family factors can substitute for fkh-8 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that cooperation with RFX-family factors is an ancient, conserved phenomenon important for cilium specification. These results provide insight into a long-standing question about factors required for the differentiation of ciliated neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and provide a prediction that a similar mechanism acts in sensory cilia in vertebrates. However, some concerns about interpretation of the data call into question whether it is legitimate to think of FKH-8 as a master regulator that acts syndergistically with DAF-19.</p><p>– Figure 6: it's nice to see (in the Methods) that a formal quantitative approach is used to test synergy between daf-19 and fkh-8. I'm concerned, however, that in this analysis the computed &quot;expected&quot; value assuming no synergy seems to have no associated error. This will make the one-sample t-test less stringent than it should be – that is, it will be easier for the experimentally observed value to appear significantly different from the expected value if there is no error associated with the expected value. I'm not sure there's any easy way around this, but the authors should provide stonger evidence that fkh-8 and daf-19 function synergistically.</p><p>– Authors argue that tm292 is a hypomorph based on its molecular structure and less severe phenotypes compared to vlc43. However, the truncation makes it seem possible that it could act as a dominant-negative/antimorphic allele. If so, this might affect the conclusions about synergy made in the double-mutant experiment, as nearly all of the experiments are carried out with tm292. Asking whether tm292 phenotypes are recessive would help to resolve this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The transcriptional mechanisms driving the ciliogenic program are incompletely understood. Members of the RFX and Forkhead domain family of TFs have been implicated in motile ciliogenesis, and RFX TFs also regulate the expression of ciliogenic genes and regulate the development of primary cilia. Here the authors propose that the FKH-8 Forkhead domain TF works with the DAF-19 RFX TF in the development of primary cilia in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Strengths of this work include the extensive bioinformatics and experimental analysis, and the finding that a subset of the fkh-8 mutant phenotypes can be rescued by their vertebrate homologs. However, the role of FKH-8 as a master regulator of ciliogenesis is not well-supported by the presented data. In particular, exactly how and where this TF acts in relation to the DAF-19 RFX remains unclear.</p><p>1. There are a few cases where an observation is reported but then not further followed up or discussed. This makes for a disjointed narrative. Examples:</p><p>Line 160: The authors report that mutations in daf-12 also have an effect on ciliary gene expression but this is not addressed any further. Given this, all data shown with daf-19; daf-12 should include not just WT as controls, but also the daf-12 mutant background as the directly relevant control (Figure 1C for example and others). Also see point 8 below.</p><p>Line 195: Figure 1E is another example. The authors report the enrichment of two PWMs in the upstream regions of genes containing X-boxes. But again, these are not followed up experimentally at all. Are these relevant in any way?</p><p>2. In Figure 1C and elsewhere, the authors report the overall number of cells expressing specific ciliary proteins. However, in addition to number, the level of expression is also a critical parameter. This is not described. A particular problem here is that all ciliary gene expression is examined using extrachromosomal reporters and the mosaicism of expression from these reporters together with their overexpression make precise measurements challenging. The authors need to validate at least a subset of their claims regarding effects of fkh-8, daf-19 and double/triple mutations on ciliary gene expression by examining the expression of GFP knockins at the relevant endogenous loci. Mutations in predicted FKH-8 binding sites should also be made at at least a subset of the endogenous loci and not only in these reporter constructs.</p><p>3. A particularly interesting category is the set of ciliary genes (broad and/or subtype-specific) that do NOT contain a predicted X-box. Is there any indication that these are regulated by any other shared motif?</p><p>4. It really wasn't clear to me from the presented analysis, exactly what fraction of ciliary genes containing X boxes also contain a predicted FKH-8 binding site and vice versa. Also, there is no clear data presented regarding the location and number of predicted FKH-8 binding sites relative to the X-boxes across the dataset (except for the few from the ChIP-seq dataset). These analyses need to be clearly presented.</p><p>5. The cilia morphology defects in fkh-8 mutants are very minor especially as compared to the drastic phenotypes of daf-19 mutants. It is difficult to assess how the shown effects on the expression of a subset of ciliary genes correlates with the shown ciliary morphological phenotypes. Did the authors look at cilia morphologies in the double/triple? How do they account for lengthening of one cilia type and shortening of others? I noted that cilia imaging was performed using sodium azide – this reagent shortens cilia. These measurements should be redone using levamisole.</p><p>6. The biggest issue with this work is that it is unclear whether the observed synergism is arising as a consequence of partly redundant effects on gene expression in individual neurons or across the population or both. In other words, there are at least two possible models. In the first, FKH-8 and DAF-19 could be acting together to regulate say ift-20 gene expression in every ciliated cell with perhaps somewhat each TF having greater or lesser contribution in individual cell types. In the second, these proteins could be acting to regulate ift-20 in different cell types. Either scenario would lead to an observed synergism in gene expression defects as measured in a population. Thus the statement in lines 521-22 regarding the mechanism of the synergism is not supported by the data.</p><p>What the authors need to do is to select a small number of genes, create endogenous reporter knock-ins (maybe consider using split-gfp to make it easier to look at single neurons) and then analyze gene expression levels in detail in a few defined ciliated sensory neurons in the singles and double/triples.

The forkhead domain protein FKH-2 was previously also implicated in regulation of expression of ciliary genes specifically in the AWB olfactory neurons and proposed to work together with DAF-19 (PMID: 17510633).

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this paper, Brocal-Ruiz et al. set out to identify factors that work together with the RFX factor DAF-19 in the development of sensory cilia in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Using an informatic approach, they identify the Forkhead-family transcription factor FKH-8 as a candidate for this role. Their findings largely support the idea that fkh-8 is expressed broadly in sensory cilia, that it acts cell-autonomously and directly to activate the expression of many cilium-specific genes, and that full expression of these genes may depend on synergy between DAF-19 and FKH-8. Consistent with this, animals lacking fkh-8 have defects in cilium morphology and in many sensory behaviors that require the function of ciliated neurons. Interestingly, they provide evidence that some vertebrate Forkhead-family factors can substitute for fkh-8 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that cooperation with RFX-family factors is an ancient, conserved phenomenon important for cilium specification. These results provide insight into a long-standing question about factors required for the differentiation of ciliated neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and provide a prediction that a similar mechanism acts in sensory cilia in vertebrates. However, some concerns about interpretation of the data call into question whether it is legitimate to think of FKH-8 as a master regulator that acts syndergistically with DAF-19.</p><p>– Figure 6: it's nice to see (in the Methods) that a formal quantitative approach is used to test synergy between daf-19 and fkh-8. I'm concerned, however, that in this analysis the computed &quot;expected&quot; value assuming no synergy seems to have no associated error. This will make the one-sample t-test less stringent than it should be – that is, it will be easier for the experimentally observed value to appear significantly different from the expected value if there is no error associated with the expected value. I'm not sure there's any easy way around this, but the authors should provide stonger evidence that fkh-8 and daf-19 function synergistically.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank both reviewers for pointing out the importance of further addressing the synergistic actions of FKH-8 and DAF-19. Regarding the specific issue of the error associated to expected values we have now used propagation error to assign an error to the expected values (Supplementary File 1). This error is calculated as the sum of each standard deviation between the corresponding mean from each observed value in each double mutant multiplied by the value of the expected value. It is important to point out however that this has no impact on the statistical test used for the analysis of synergistic effects.</p><p>To provide stronger evidence for synergistic effects between these two transcription factors we have followed Reviewer #2 suggestion and focus on specific subpopulations of sensory neurons to quantify the phenotypes in the different genetic backgrounds. We show data for 3 different neuron types (CEPV, CEPD and PHA) and two different ciliome gene reporters (<italic>osm-1</italic> and <italic>xbx-1</italic>). These are examples in which reporter's expression is not affected or only very partially affected in each single mutant but completely absent from the double mutant. These constitute important results strongly supporting synergistic effects between FKH-8 and DAF-19. These data are now presented in Figure 4E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Authors argue that tm292 is a hypomorph based on its molecular structure and less severe phenotypes compared to vlc43. However, the truncation makes it seem possible that it could act as a dominant-negative/antimorphic allele. If so, this might affect the conclusions about synergy made in the double-mutant experiment, as nearly all of the experiments are carried out with tm292. Asking whether tm292 phenotypes are recessive would help to resolve this.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate raising this concern, we have now included data on the recessive nature of both the <italic>tm292</italic> and <italic>vlc43</italic> alleles (Figure S6C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The transcriptional mechanisms driving the ciliogenic program are incompletely understood. Members of the RFX and Forkhead domain family of TFs have been implicated in motile ciliogenesis, and RFX TFs also regulate the expression of ciliogenic genes and regulate the development of primary cilia. Here the authors propose that the FKH-8 Forkhead domain TF works with the DAF-19 RFX TF in the development of primary cilia in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Strengths of this work include the extensive bioinformatics and experimental analysis, and the finding that a subset of the fkh-8 mutant phenotypes can be rescued by their vertebrate homologs. However, the role of FKH-8 as a master regulator of ciliogenesis is not well-supported by the presented data. In particular, exactly how and where this TF acts in relation to the DAF-19 RFX remains unclear.</p><p>1. There are a few cases where an observation is reported but then not further followed up or discussed. This makes for a disjointed narrative. Examples:</p><p>Line 160: The authors report that mutations in daf-12 also have an effect on ciliary gene expression but this is not addressed any further. Given this, all data shown with daf-19; daf-12 should include not just WT as controls, but also the daf-12 mutant background as the directly relevant control (Figure 1C for example and others). Also see point 8 below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and apologise for the disjointed narrative. Regarding the specific issue about <italic>daf-12</italic>, and considering the focus of the paper is FKH-8 characterization, we have decided to follow the same strategy as previous works using <italic>daf-12(sa204); daf-19(m86)</italic> mutants in which <italic>daf-12(sa204)</italic> is always used as the relevant control (<italic>doi:10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.06.028; doi:10.1534/genetics.117.300571/-/DC1.1)</italic>.</p><p>Thus, in the new manuscript whenever <italic>daf-12(sa204); daf-19(m86)</italic> is used the control refers to <italic>daf-12(sa204)</italic> (Figure 1 and Figure 4). To avoid disjointed narrative we have omitted the comment on <italic>daf-12</italic> effect on ciliary gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 195: Figure 1E is another example. The authors report the enrichment of two PWMs in the upstream regions of genes containing X-boxes. But again, these are not followed up experimentally at all. Are these relevant in any way?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank again the reviewer for helping improve the flow of the manuscript. We found that the two additional motifs found in genes containing X-boxes show strong similarity to DAF-19 and to the previously reported C-BOX (<italic>doi:10.1016/j.ydbio.2012.05.033)</italic>. Thus, these motifs are not useful to identify new factors involved in the regulation of ciliogenesis. We have added this information in Line 200-202 and move the panel to Figure S3C to help the reader stay focused on the main message of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 1C and elsewhere, the authors report the overall number of cells expressing specific ciliary proteins. However, in addition to number, the level of expression is also a critical parameter. This is not described. A particular problem here is that all ciliary gene expression is examined using extrachromosomal reporters and the mosaicism of expression from these reporters together with their overexpression make precise measurements challenging. The authors need to validate at least a subset of their claims regarding effects of fkh-8, daf-19 and double/triple mutations on ciliary gene expression by examining the expression of GFP knockins at the relevant endogenous loci. Mutations in predicted FKH-8 binding sites should also be made at at least a subset of the endogenous loci and not only in these reporter constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer's comments on the use of extrachromosomal arrays. Extrachromosomal multicopy arrays have been extensively used in the past to provide robust evidence for the relevant targets for many transcription factors. Undoubtedly, mosaicism associated to Ex arrays is one caveat for their use, to avoid this issue, the same extrachromosomal line is crossed in the different genetic backgrounds to be able to compare and assess the effects associated to the mutations and not to the mosaicism. Nevertheless, we understand CRISPR endogenous tagging has become the gold standard in the field, thus we built an endogenously tagged <italic>osm-5</italic> strain (<italic>osm-5::SL2::GFP::H2B</italic> ) as a proof of concept to assess the role of FKH-8 in core ciliome gene expression. Our results show that <italic>fkh-8(vlc43)</italic> displays broad defects in <italic>osm5</italic> endogenous expression. Following reviewer #2 advice, we have quantified fluorescence levels in specific subpopulations of sensory neurons. These data are now presented in Figure 3 C,D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A particularly interesting category is the set of ciliary genes (broad and/or subtype-specific) that do NOT contain a predicted X-box. Is there any indication that these are regulated by any other shared motif?</p></disp-quote><p>There are 61 ciliome genes that do not show an X-BOX in the analysed regulatory sequences. Most of them (43 genes) correspond to subtype specific ciliome components. We did not find enriched motifs for known transcription factors (this is now included in the text line 203-209). It is important to mention that many subtype specific ciliome components are known to be directly regulated by the terminal selector acting in each specific sensory ciliated neuron (doi:10.1038/nature07929, doi: 10.1101/gad.1560107; doi:10.1242/dev.099721). Failure to identify common motifs in subtype specific ciliome components might be reflecting this subtype specific regulation by terminal selectors. This point has been included in the discussion (Line 608611)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It really wasn't clear to me from the presented analysis, exactly what fraction of ciliary genes containing X boxes also contain a predicted FKH-8 binding site and vice versa. Also, there is no clear data presented regarding the location and number of predicted FKH-8 binding sites relative to the X-boxes across the dataset (except for the few from the ChIP-seq dataset). These analyses need to be clearly presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank very much the reviewer for this comment and apologise for the lack of clarity.</p><p>It is important to clarify that we use experimentally assessed FKH-8 ChIP-seq peaks and not predicted motifs, as the predicted binding site for FKH-8 has not been experimentally determined. Predicted motifs for FKH TFs (RYMAAYA for the classical FKH motif and GACGC for the FKH like) are small and degenerate and thus not very informative for predictions in the genome.</p><p>Regarding DAF-19, there is no available ChIP-seq data, however X-boxes correspond to long imperfect palindromic sequences with high information content (Figure S3A). They are so informative that their mere presence in the promoters of novel genes has been used to identify new ciliome components in different organisms including <italic>C. elegans</italic> (doi: 10.1186/gb-2006-7-12r126; doi: 10.1186/gb-2006-7-12-r126; doi:10.1016/j.cub.2005.04.059). Moreover, many of these predicted X-boxes have been previously verified by site directed mutagenesis. Finally, many bioinformatic hits of X-boxes compare extremely well to experimentally determined vertebrate RFX TF binding (DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110661; doi.org/10.1038/35002634). Thus, most Xboxes are likely to correspond to DAF-19 bound sequences.</p><p>Our data shows that most core ciliome genes contain both an X-box and a FKH-8 peak, in addition, FKH-8 genomic binding takes place in close proximity to X-boxes (center of FKH-8 peak is less than 600 bp apart from the X-box motif).</p><p>Importantly, we complemented this information with coIP experiments that show DAF-19D and FKH-8 can physically interact.</p><p>All these new data are presented in Figure #2F-H and Figure S5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The cilia morphology defects in fkh-8 mutants are very minor especially as compared to the drastic phenotypes of daf-19 mutants. It is difficult to assess how the shown effects on the expression of a subset of ciliary genes correlates with the shown ciliary morphological phenotypes. Did the authors look at cilia morphologies in the double/triple? How do they account for lengthening of one cilia type and shortening of others? I noted that cilia imaging was performed using sodium azide – this reagent shortens cilia. These measurements should be redone using levamisole.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. Several pieces of evidence indicate that <italic>daf-19</italic> mutants show stronger phenotypes: (1) Reporter gene expression is more affected in <italic>daf-19</italic> than in <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutants (Figure 1C compared to Figure 3A), (2) Lipophilic staining with DiI is affected in <italic>daf-19</italic> but not in <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutants and (3) There are smaller ciliary morphology defects in <italic>fkh-8</italic> compared to complete absence of cilia in <italic>daf-19</italic> mutants (doi:10.1016/0012-1606(86)90314-3) (4) Our new data shows that DAF-19 ectopic expression, but not FKH-8, is sufficient to drive ciliary gene expression (Figure S9). Accordingly, we have now omitted the term master regulator to refer to FKH-8 ciliogenic actions.</p><p>Following reviewer's suggestion, there are some links that can be extrapolated between <italic>fkh-8</italic> ciliome gene expression defects and morphology and behaviour defects. For example, our new data shows broad expression defects for <italic>osm-5</italic> endogenous gene reporter in <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutants (Figure 3C), and <italic>osm-5</italic> mutants show AWB cilia morphology defects (doi:10.1038/sj.emboj.7601717) which are also present in <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutants (Figure 5). Finally, repulsion to 2-nonanol, that is mediated by AWB, is also affected in <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutants (Figure 6). We now refer to these correlations of phenotypes directly in the text (Line 447 to 449 and 505 and 507).</p><p>Nevertheless, both ciliary morphology and behaviour are functional readouts of cilia integrity that is regulated by a great number of different genes, thus mutations in many ciliome components produce cilia morphology defects or behaviour defect. It is hard to assign specific targets to specific defects. The relevance of our manuscript is the description of the role of FKH-8 in the DIRECT regulation of a BROAD number of ciliome components, COOPERATING with DAF-19 (which we now show further support of synergistic actions and physical interaction). Thus, it is probable that <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutant defects in ciliary morphology and cilia regulated behaviours could be attributed to gene expression defects in several ciliome components.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion of studying synergistic effects of DAF-19 and FKH-8 in cilia morphology however <italic>daf-19</italic> mutants lack cilia (doi:10.1016/0012-1606(86)90314-3), thus we cannot perform those experiments.</p><p>We thank the reviewer suggesting that we measure cilia length using levamisole. We found <italic>fkh8</italic> mutants are extremely resistant to levamisole, alternatively we used beads to immobilise worms and reproduced morphology defects in the mutant (Figure S10).</p><p>Finally, cilia length is controlled by a balance between cilia assembly and disassembly regulated by IFT and mutants for ciliome components can produce both shortened or elongated cilia. We have added this explanation in the text (Line 435-437). Nevertheless, we should be cautious with the lengthening phenotype in ADF in <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutants because when assessed in bead immobilized worms ADF cilia in <italic>fkh-8</italic> mutants is shorter than in <italic>wild type</italic>, this is now included in the text (Figure S10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The biggest issue with this work is that it is unclear whether the observed synergism is arising as a consequence of partly redundant effects on gene expression in individual neurons or across the population or both. In other words, there are at least two possible models. In the first, FKH-8 and DAF-19 could be acting together to regulate say ift-20 gene expression in every ciliated cell with perhaps somewhat each TF having greater or lesser contribution in individual cell types. In the second, these proteins could be acting to regulate ift-20 in different cell types. Either scenario would lead to an observed synergism in gene expression defects as measured in a population. Thus the statement in lines 521-22 regarding the mechanism of the synergism is not supported by the data.</p><p>What the authors need to do is to select a small number of genes, create endogenous reporter knock-ins (maybe consider using split-gfp to make it easier to look at single neurons) and then analyze gene expression levels in detail in a few defined ciliated sensory neurons in the singles and double/triples. The population level analysis is a good start but does not provide the resolution needed to really understand the underlying regulatory principles.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful to the reviewer for this suggestion. Our initial data suggest the effects are higher than what will be expected by an additive effect, either at the cell or at the population level, nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer this population level analysis does not have enough resolution to strongly claim synergistic effects. An additional important limitation with the population analysis is the ectopic reporter expression observed for some ciliary gene reporters in <italic>daf-19</italic> mutants, which could mask missing expression in ciliated neurons in the different mutant backgrounds.</p><p>Thus, following reviewer's advice we aimed to identify specific subpopulations of ciliated neurons. First, we attempted to use Neuropal (DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.12.012) to identify each different ciliated neuron type, however, although NeuroPAL worked well for neuron identification in the <italic>wild type</italic> background, NeuroPAL reporters were massively missregulated in <italic>daf-19</italic> mutants precluding its use to identify specific neuron types in double and triple mutants.</p><p>Alternatively, we first tentatively identified neuron-types candidates to display synergy based on population scores and cell locations and next selected specific reporter strains unaffected in all genetic backgrounds to unequivocally identify those neuron types. This was a laborious task but turned out to be very important. In this way we have been able to assess synergistic effects of DAF19 and FKH-8 in the regulation of <italic>osm-1</italic> reporter in CEPV and CEPD and of <italic>xbx-1</italic> reporter expression in PHA (Figure 4E).</p><p>We think this new set of experiments, together with additional data (co-expression of DAF-19 and FKH-8 in all ciliated neurons, binding in nearby regions of the regulatory genome of ciliome genes and physical interaction) provide strong evidence for synergistic actions for both TFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

We now cite this work and have now determined that <italic>fkh-2</italic> expression in AWB is unaffected in <italic>fkh-8</italic> null mutants. The data is now indicated in results (Line 374-386) and discussion (Line 594-596).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 6D examines expression of a subset of ciliome genes in fkh-8; daf-19; daf-12 triple mutants. It is unclear from the figure whether expression of ciliome genes in the triple mutant is significantly different from that of the daf-19; daf-12 double mutant. This is particularly critical because these are the only data addressing whether FKH-8 and DAF-19 act synergistically.</p></disp-quote><p>Following reviewer #2 suggestion we have now addressed synergism analysing specific sensory ciliated neuron subtypes (Figure 4D).</p><p>We have nevertheless maintained total quantification of cells for <italic>ift-20</italic> (Figure 4C) and for <italic>xbx-1</italic> and <italic>peli-1</italic> reporters (Figure S9). For all three reporters, mean number of expressing neurons in <italic>daf-12(sa204); daf-19(m86)</italic>, <italic>fkh-8(tm292)</italic> triple mutants is significantly different from each of the double mutants and significantly lower than the expected from the multiplicative effect of both <italic>daf-12(sa204); fkh-8(tm292)</italic> and <italic>daf-12(sa204); daf-19(m86)</italic> animals. This information is now indicated in the corresponding figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The rescue of the ift-20 expression phenotype by the vertebrate homologs is nice, but this result would be more convincing if additional phenotypes of fkh-8 mutants were also assessed for rescue.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer rescuing of additional phenotypes with mouse orthologs will be nice, however these experiments will not provide any conceptually addition to the manuscript. We decided to prioritize the work on the synergistic actions of DAF-19 and FKH-8, for which we have now provided new data on double mutants and also physical interaction. In addition, as part of a new project in the laboratory, we are performing a systematic analysis on the rescuing ability of different members of the mammalian FKH family in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In this context, we will also expand the panel of rescued reporters, but we think performing these experiments is beyond the scope of this manuscript and will further delay its publication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
