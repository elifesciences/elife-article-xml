in the first few weeks of life, as tested by manipulations of litter size, growth hormone levels, or mutations with effects specifically on early-life growth rate. The pace of early development in mice can also be influenced by exposure of nursing and weanling mice to olfactory cues. In particular, odors of same-sex adult mice can in some circumstances delay maturation. We hypothesized that olfactory information might also have a sex-specific effect on lifespan, and we show here that the lifespan of female mice can be increased significantly by odors from adult females administered transiently, that is from 3 days until 60 days of age. Female lifespan was not modified by male odors, nor was male lifespan susceptible to odors from adults of either sex. Conditional deletion of the G protein Gαo in the olfactory system, which leads to impaired accessory olfactory system function and blunted reproductive priming responses to male odors in females, did not modify the effect of female odors on female lifespan. Our data provide support for the idea that very young mice are susceptible to influences that can have long-lasting effects on health maintenance in later life, and provide a potential example of lifespan extension by olfactory cues in mice.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The environment that animals are exposed to early in life can influence their subsequent rate of development, reproduction and aging. Experiments done in rodents have shown that social stimuli such as odours from the same sex or opposite sex individuals can affect the age at which sexual maturity is reached. Variations in age of sexual maturity are directly correlated with median lifespans of mice, with strong associations observed between later sexual maturity and longer lifespans in female mice.</p><p>Detailed experiments exposing female or male mice to scents from mice of the same or another sex strongly suggest that growing up smelling the same sex can delay sexual maturity, while scents from another sex can hasten it. Interestingly, mice that lacked the cells that sense odours do not change their age of sexual maturity in response to scents from the opposite sex. This ability to steer one’s developmental timeline depending on environmental cues may allow animals to prepare for future environments. But can it also influence an animal’s lifespan?</p><p>To answer this question, Garratt et al. observed the lifespans of female and male mice under different conditions. Mice were exposed to same-sex or other-sex odours, in the form of urine or soiled bedding, from day 3 to day 60 of their lives. The results showed that female mice exposed to odours from other females exhibited an increased lifespan, as compared to those not exposed to scents, while those exposed to odours from males did not show any change in their lifespan. In striking contrast, male mice exposed to odours from either sex showed no variation in their lifespans. The impairment of a particular type of odour-sensing neuron in mice did not change these results, making it likely that another neuron type is responsible for the changes in lifespan observed in the female mice.</p><p>These experiments elegantly demonstrate that exposure to certain sensory information, in this case scent, can change how long mammals live. While similar effects involving smells are unlikely to influence lifespan in humans, it is possible that other types of sensory information affect our health and how we age.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>life history</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG024824</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Richard A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pletcher</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Richard A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 894</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zufall</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name><name><surname>Leinders-Zufall</surname><given-names>Trese</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB/TRR 152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zufall</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name><name><surname>Leinders-Zufall</surname><given-names>Trese</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Early-life exposure to conspecific urine and bedding extends the lifespan of female mice, indicating that social chemosensory cues can influence aging in a mammal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interventions in the first few weeks of postnatal life seem to have particular power to produce life-long changes in mouse physiology, with effects on late-life illnesses and on survival. Bartke’s laboratory, for example, has shown that the exceptionally long lifespan of the Ames dwarf mice, in which longevity appears to reflect lower levels of growth hormone (GH) produced by the anterior pituitary, can be reduced back to that of non-mutant controls by transient exposure to daily GH injections started at 2 weeks of age and discontinued 6 weeks later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Panici et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, these early-life GH injections block the development of multi-modal stress resistance shown by skin-derived fibroblasts of Ames dwarf mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Panici et al., 2010</xref>), and also prevent the lower levels of hypothalamic inflammatory characteristics of unmanipulated Ames mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sadagurski et al., 2015b</xref>). Many other characteristics of Ames dwarf mice, plausibly connected to their longevity, insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dominici et al., 2002</xref>), and cognitive health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kinney et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2005</xref>), are also blocked by early-life GH treatments when tested at 18 months of age, including changes in fat, muscle, plasma irisin and GPLD1, liver, and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, lifespan can be increased in genetically normal mice by pre-weaning manipulation of litter size – mice weaned from litters in which litter size has been increased to 12 pups/nursing mother live longer than those in control litters of 8 pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). Genetic selection experiments have also provided relevant data, by showing extended lifespan in non-inbred stocks of mice that were selected, for 17 or more generations, for exceptionally slow growth in the first 10 days of life, or between 26 and 56 days of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Age at sexual maturity is another early-life developmental factor that has been associated with lifespan. Across strains of mice, age at sexual maturity correlates positively with median lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>), and genetic manipulations that delay sexual maturity have been associated with longer lifespan in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Age at sexual maturity in rodents is also influenced by environmental cues, in particular olfactory cues from conspecifics. Female mice that are exposed to male odors (typically soiled bedding or male urine) during development show hastened sexual maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drickamer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vandenbergh, 1973</xref>). In contrast, exposing females to the odors of group-housed adult virgin females can delay sexual maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vandenbergh, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drickamer, 1977</xref>). In males, exposure to females or their odors has been shown to be associated with increased masses of reproductive organs (testes, seminal vesicles) early in life, also indicating earlier sexual maturity in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vandenbergh, 1971</xref>). These odor priming effects are assumed to be adaptive, allowing animals to modulate their timing of early-life reproduction to suit predicted future environments. In one previous study, hastened female sexual maturity was associated with an increase in mortality over the first 180 days of life and reduced litter sizes when breeding, suggesting a cost to this developmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drickamer, 1988</xref>). However, in this prior study females were exposed directly to males on the day of their first estrous, which was earlier in females exposed to male odors producing a confounding effect that could contribute to mortality differences.</p><p>The effects of odors on sexual maturity are initiated, at least partly, by detection of odorants through the vomeronasal organ, one of the two olfactory sub-systems in mice. Female mice that have had their vomeronasal organ surgically removed do not show hastened sexual maturity in response to male odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lomas and Keverne, 1982</xref>). Vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) express hundreds of different sensory receptors, but these receptors largely use one of two different types of G protein for signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Munger et al., 2009</xref>). The G protein Gαo is used for signal transduction in VSNs of the basal layer of the vomeronasal organ. Cre-mediated deletion of Gαo in the olfactory system has been shown to inhibit females from showing hastened sexual maturity in response to male odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oboti et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that this subset of VSNs is important in driving changes in sexual maturity, at least in response to opposite sex cues in females.</p><p>With these precedents in mind, we tested the idea that olfactory signals, presented to mice from 3 days of age but discontinued at 60 days, would have long-lasting effects that influence age at death. We initiated odor exposure early in life, prior to weaning, because a previous study had shown that very early exposure influences female body weight during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cowley and Wise, 1972</xref>). In particular, we speculated that odor from adult female mice would lead to lifespan extension in female (but not in male) mice, and vice versa. We also hypothesized that exposure to opposite-sex odors would reduce survival given the hastening of sexual maturity. Here, we show that transient exposure to odor from adult females starting at 3 days of age can extend lifespan of female mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Survival</title><p>Our principal hypothesis was that early-life exposure to sex-specific olfactory cues indicative of social environment would influence lifespan of mice. A secondary hypothesis was that the response to those cues would depend on function of Gαo-expressing neurons in the vomeronasal organ, since these have been shown to mediate early-life priming responses to opposite-sex urine, at least in female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oboti et al., 2014</xref>). Mice were exposed either to same-sex or to opposite-sex odors starting from 3 days of age, with daily exposure through day 60 of life. They were housed in same-sex cages from the age of weaning, that is from 19 or 20 days. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows survival curves for female and for male mice subjected either to odors from adult males (‘MU’) or from adult females (‘FU’), or exposed to water as a control (ZU, for zero urine). Data from male and female mice were evaluated separately. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> shows median age, and age at 90th percentile, for each combination of sex and treatment, pooling across genotypes. In female mice, FU led to an 8% increase in median lifespan, compared to the ZU control group, and a 9% increase in the age at 90th percentile. The log-rank test, comparing all three treatment groups, showed that treatment led to significant differences among the groups (p=0.04), and a follow-up test showed that for females the FU mice were longer-lived than the ZU controls (p=0.01 by log-rank test). Male odors did not produce a lifespan change in female mice compared to controls (p=0.6). Treatment did not modify lifespan in the male mice; log-rank p=0.8 for all treatment groups taken together.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Survival curves for female (left panels) and male mice (right panels) exposed to male, female, or no odors daily from 2 to 60 days of age.</title><p>Top row: pooled across genotypes.

A significant interaction would indicate that the two genotypes of mice have responded differently to the odor treatment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> shows the significance levels for each of the three terms, calculated separately for female and for male mice. The interaction term did not achieve significance in either sex, implying that the odor effect did not depend on genotype. In addition, there was no independent effect of genotype on survival. Only the odor treatment had a significant effect on survival, and only in female mice (p=0.04), consistent with the results of the log-rank tests. The Cox regression calculation also confirmed the inference that FU females lived longer than ZU females (p=0.015 without adjustment for multiple comparisons, and p=0.045 with Sidak adjustment), and that no other pairwise comparison between treatment groups had a significant effect in either sex. Within each genotype and sex individual comparison (e.g. WT females, mutant females, WT males, mutant males), there was no significant difference in survival between odor treatment groups using a log-rank test. This further emphasizes the lack of any strong genotype-specific effect and that the effects of the odor treatment are more clearly apparent when both genotypes are included within an analysis due to the increased sample size.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Significance tests for predictors in Cox regression, calculated separately for each sex.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Sex of mouse</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Treatment</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Genotype</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Interaction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Female</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.5<break/>p=0.039</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.4<break/>p=0.5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.12<break/>p=0.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Male</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.52<break/>p=0.8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.23<break/>p=0.6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.31<break/>p=0.5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To evaluate the effects of early-life odor exposure on survival to unusually high ages, we used the method of Wang and Allison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), which calculates a Fisher’s exact test statistic on the proportion of mice in each treatment that remain alive at the 90th percentile of their joint survival distribution, the method also employed by the mouse Intervention Testing Program consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Macchiarini, 2021</xref>).

The ‘window of opportunity’, or age at which a mouse is susceptible to such influences, is not known, and may differ depending on the specific form of environmental variation, but it is noteworthy that GH treatments can prevent lifespan extension of Ames dwarf mice when these are initiated at 2 weeks of age, but fail in Snell dwarf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vergara et al., 2004</xref>) and Ames dwarf animals (Bartke, unpublished results) when started at 4 weeks of age. The basis for this transient susceptibility to factors that set the tempo of late-life decline is unknown, but seems likely to involve epigenetic modulation of events that are sensitive to nutritional and neuro-endocrine stimuli. Fibroblast cultures from adult mice of the Ames and Snell dwarf mutant strains are resistant, in culture, to multiple forms of lethal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salmon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salmon et al., 2008</xref>), unless the Ames mice had been subjected to early-life GH treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Panici et al., 2010</xref>). In this context it is noteworthy that fibroblasts derived from 1-week-old Snell dwarf and control mice do not differ in stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salmon et al., 2005</xref>) at this age GH levels are still largely derived from the intra-uterine blood circulation, and are not yet controlled by the pituitary of the newborn mouse itself. GH exposure experience in the 2- to 8-week-old mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sadagurski et al., 2015b</xref>), as well as milk availability mediated by the size of the nursing litter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sadagurski et al., 2015a</xref>), also modulates the hypothalamic inflammatory state in mice 18 months of age or older. Ames mice treated transiently with GH also resemble WT, that is, non-mutant, controls in adipose tissue UCP1 levels, relative ratios of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages in adipose tissue, production of FNDC5 and its myokine cleavage product irisin by skeletal muscle, hepatic and plasma levels of GPLD1, and brain levels of protective factors BDNF and DCX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2022</xref>), showing that these early-life environmental factors can have long-lasting, presumably permanent, effects on many physiological properties of high relevance to health maintenance and disease resistance.</p><p>The data reported here document another vector for early-life modulation of late-life fitness and mortality risks, by manipulation of conspecific social odors. We chose to study this topic because of data showing effects of early exposure to same-sex and opposite-sex odors on the pace of mouse development and sexual maturation. We hypothesized that exposure to same-sex odor, which delays development in some circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drickamer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drickamer, 1982</xref>), might also delay the rate of age-related decline, and we found that indeed female mice exposed early to odors from adult females had longer lifespan than females exposed to water. Male odor did not have this effect on female longevity. The FU-treated female mice also resisted the age-related decline in core body temperature, although there was no inter-group difference in grip strength or rotarod performance, other indices of late-life physiological state. Male mice, in contrast, did not exhibit lifespan or performance effects in response to either same-sex or opposite-sex odors. We do not know the mechanism for the lifespan effect in the FU-treated female mice, or why we saw no such effect in male animals; these are questions we plan to explore in future work.</p><p>We should note that the genotype of the mice exposed to odor was not the same as the genotype (UM-HET3 genetically heterogeneous stock) from which urine and bedding was collected. The use of a genetically heterogeneous mouse model as odor donors would mean that the odor receiving animals would be exposed to signaling proteins and volatile odorants produced by several strains of mice. We perceived this as a strength because different mouse strains produce different olfactory signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheetham et al., 2009</xref>), and exposing mice to odors from a variety of genotypes would increase the probability of exposure to an odorant that influences lifespan. However, different mouse strains also express different olfactory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2017</xref>), and could show different physiological responses to bedding from different strains, although VNO activation responses in mice to odors from the same or different strain of mouse has been reported as broadly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bansal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Silvotti et al., 2018</xref>). In principle, it’s possible that different lifespan responses may occur if mice are exposed to odors from their background genotype.</p><p>The effects of odor exposure on lifespan were not modified by deletion of Gαo in the olfactory system. This G protein is important in mediating responses to peptide and protein-based ligands in basal VSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chamero et al., 2011</xref>), and has previously been shown to inhibit priming responses to male odors in females, including changes in sexual maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oboti et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore designed this experiment using this model because this deletion is known to inhibit priming effects, but does not affect normal body development or suckling behavior as has been observed with manipulations that impair main olfactory system function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandiyan et al., 2005</xref>). Previously published research with this model has largely focused on responses to male odors, but in this study we observed changes in lifespan in response to female odors. Exposure of female mice to female odors has previously been shown to activate a different subset of VSNs compared to male odorants, including apical VSNs that use a different G protein in signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Silvotti et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, effects of female odors on female survival may be mediated by a subset of VSNs different from those that were inhibited in this study. It is also possible that effects could be mediated by detection of odorants by the main olfactory system. As our results were not significantly altered by the olfactory genetic manipulation employed in this experiment, it is possible that a different sensory modality might be involved in mediating these effects. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that microbiota transferred with the bedding, rather than the urine odor and bedding odor per se, cause these effects. Regardless, this must be a female-specific secreted factor that only influences female lifespan, and can do so even when females are exposed only over the first 60 days of life.</p><p>Changes in sexual maturity with exposure to conspecific odors can be initiated even by brief exposure to the diluted urine of a conspecific after weaning, although longer-term effects on female body weight have been observed when odor exposure begins prior to weaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cowley and Wise, 1972</xref>), which is why we chose an extended treatment protocol to maximize the chance of detecting effects on survival. Future studies with a shorter treatment time course after weaning, and with only urine or specific urinary fractions, would help to reveal the signals and developmental periods that are important causing subsequent changes in survival. Use of a different genetic model of impaired VNO signaling, for example disruption of the apical layer of the VNO, or a main olfactory system deficit mouse model, would help to firmly establish the role of the olfactory systems in mediating these effects.</p><p>Studies of the effects of sensory perception on aging and lifespan in invertebrates dates back at least to the work of Apfeld and Kenyon in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apfeld and Kenyon, 1999</xref>), and in the years since, a variety of sensory modalities, including smell, taste, sight, and pain, have become established as important modulators of aging across invertebrate taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Libert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waterson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riera and Dillin, 2016</xref>). Exposure of flies and worms to food-based odorants, for example, limit the benefits of dietary restriction and influence measures of healthy aging, including sleep and daily activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miller et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linford et al., 2015</xref>). Some of these studies have focused on how perception of conspecific pheromones, detected through olfaction and gustation, can modulate <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maures et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gendron et al., 2014</xref>). Although there is no guarantee that mechanisms linking pheromones to aging in worms and flies will prove to be analogous to pathways in mice, they do provide clues that deserve to be explored. Worm perception impacts insulin-specific pathways, and conserved motivation and reward neuropeptides, such as NPF/NPY, are required for aging effects in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maures et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gendron et al., 2014</xref>). It seems reasonable to test whether these same pathways influence mammalian lifespan in mice, either with, or in the absence of, sensory cues of the kind revealed by our experimental findings.</p><p>As far as we know, this is the first observation that lifespan can be increased, in a mammal, by olfactory signals, or indeed secreted factors found in soiled bedding and urine. More generally, the work hints that very young mice, and perhaps animals of other species, are able to assess aspects of the social environment and adjust their development to improve their Darwinian fitness and, as a side effect, slow the rate of aging and maintain health in later life.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>We conducted an initial preliminary experiment on changes in sexual maturity with urine and bedding exposure using UM-HET3 mice.

Litters of size 7 or lower were not used, and litters with more than 8 pups were trimmed to 8 pups as soon as discovered. A tail snip biopsy was taken for genotyping at age 10–19 days. Each cage of weanlings contained four mice, two WT and two mutant, and each mouse in a cage was in the same odor-exposure treatment group. Cages were labeled with details of mouse sex, genotype, and treatment group and so were not blinded, although the technician team that assessed mice on a daily basis were largely unaware of the principal hypotheses of the proposed experiment. Thirty mice were allocated per sex, genotype, and odor treatment combination with each mouse assumed to be an independent biological replicate. This sample size was selected because it provides sufficient power to detect a change in median lifespan of approximately 10–15% within one sex and genotype. We originally hypothesized that some effects would be consistent across sexes allowing sexes to be pooled for analysis, further increasing statistical power. All mice received Purina 5LG6 food and water without restriction. Animal housing rooms were maintained on a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle, with relative humidity of 30–70%, and temperature of 21–23°C.

After 60 days of age there was no further odor exposure for mice in any of the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Lifespan data</title><p>Lifespan analysis and criteria for inclusion in final survival statistics followed the established protocols of the Interventions Testing Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Macchiarini, 2021</xref>). Each mouse was inspected daily and the date of natural death recorded. Mice were euthanized to comply with humane-use protocols if they appeared unlikely to survive more than another 7 days using a symptom checklist. Animals were excluded from analysis and censored if they were injured due to fighting, showed malocclusion, or had dermatitis covering greater than 20% of their body. Six females and two males were removed from the study as a consequence of these exclusion factors, leaving the final sample sizes for survival analysis presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Assessment of temperature, grip strength, and rotarod performance</title><p>Mice were evaluated at 22 months of age. Cages of mice were transferred to the testing room between 8 am and 10 am, and immediately evaluated for core body temperature using a rectal thermometer (Braintree RET3). Mice in the cage were then individually weighed. The mice were then allowed to acclimate in their home cage for 1 hr prior to further testing, after which grip strength was evaluated. Mice were held by the base of the tail and lowered toward a wire grid connected to a strain gauge (Bioseb Research Instruments). Once both forepaws grasped the grid, they were firmly but gently pulled horizontally until they released their grip. Strain gauge measurements were recorded for each of three trials for each mouse (‘forepaw grip’). Three additional trials were then conducted, allowing all four paws to simultaneously grasp the grid (‘allpaws grip’). The cage was then returned to its original housing room. On the next day, cages were again moved to the testing room and mice allowed to acclimate for an hour, after which a RotaRod test device (Ugo Basile) was used to measure motor coordination on an accelerating, rotating rod, for three trials. Mice were placed on the RotaRod at an initial speed of 5 RPM. The RotaRod accelerated to a maximum of 40 RPM over 300 s. The trial ended when the mouse fell from the RotaRod, and the latency to fall was recorded. Each mouse was tested three times, with a 1 min interval between trials to allow the apparatus to be cleaned. The mean forepaw grip strength and rotarod performance for each mouse was used for the analysis of genotype and odor effects as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herrera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garratt et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Assessment of non-fasting blood glucose and weight</title><p>Blood samples (approximately 50 µm) were taken by tail venipuncture from restrained, non-anesthetized 12-month-old mice into 300 µm tubes containing EDTA, and tested using a Bayer Contour Next EZ Glucometer. Body weight was periodically assessed between 9 am and noon.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We tested for survival differences among treatment groups, for each sex, using the log-rank test, with the two genotypes pooled. When the overall log-rank test, with all three odor groups, failed to confirm the null hypothesis, we then proceeded to consider all pairs of odor groups using the log-rank test. To determine if genotype modulated the response to odors, we used Cox regression with two factors, genotype and odor group, including the interaction term, and did so for each sex separately. The significance of the interaction term was used as the indicator of whether response to odor was or was not genotype-dependent within each sex. As a surrogate for ‘maximum’ lifespan, we used the Wang/Allison test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), comparing odor groups for the proportion of mice still alive at the 90th percentile of the joint survival distribution. Calculations of median and 90th percentile age were performed on the number of mice shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, that is, excluding mice that had died because of fighting or other accident. All non-longevity data were analyzed using an ANOVA. Where an overall treatment group effect was detected we used the Sidak post hoc multiple comparison test to determine whether specific odor treatment groups differed compared to controls. All analyses were conducted using STATA version 17.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The proposed lifespan experiment was approved by the University of Michigan Animal Care and Use Program, Protocol PRO00007884.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yu-Xuan Lu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After discussion, the reviewers agreed that for rigor and reproducibility of the analysis, the authors should:</p><p>(i) plot all data, regardless of significance (i.e. both for male vs male, all functional phenotypes tested);</p><p>(ii) plot data segregated by genotype, not just pooled;</p><p>(iii) address all noted caveats (i.e. cross genotype exposure of urine, potential traces of fecal matter/microbiome in soiled bedding), at least in the discussion;</p><p>(iv) provide more information about the Gao KO, including genotyping protocol and validation that the gene was knocked out (essential to conclude that Gao is not involved in the phenotype).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Although the experiments were performed in WT vs. Gnao1 mutant animals, the data is only reported pooled (e.g. Figure 1, Figure 2). Although the authors say that there is no genotype effect, it is crucial that the data presented in Figures 1 and 2 be also provided segregated by genotype, so that it is clear to the readers that no genotype effect (even if potentially underpowered) is present.</p><p>2. The authors performed the experiments on a mixed C57BL6/Sv129 background, but urine and soiled bedding were obtained from UM-HET3 mice. Since there may be variation in olfactory cues and receptors between strains, this should be discussed as a caveat for the study.</p><p>3. Although methods indicate that all mice survive to 22 months (which should be &gt;50% of the cohort for both females and males), functional data reported in Figure 2 is only so for 1 sex each. The text indicates data not shown for the other sex – this is not acceptable, as all data should be provided if only as a supplemental panel to support all statements. In addition, glucose is reported for males, which did not show survival benefits. However, we suggest plotting both female and male data for the 3 parameters for easy comparison by the readers. It would also be beneficial to color code by genotype. The data from the rotarod and grip strength test, although not significant, should also be plotted and reported.</p><p>4. Please provide all necessary information for how the mice were genotypes (i.e. DNA extraction from the tail, PCR master mix and cycling conditions, primer sequences).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Spent bedding was added for 12 weeks. Does that mean after 12 weeks, all mice were placed on standard bedding with no disruption?</p><p>– What was the temperature, humidity, and light/dark cycle for the animal facility?</p><p>– What statistics did you use for any of the non-longevity data? You state ANOVA in your results, but it should also be in your methods. Also for rotarod, you need to control for body weight.</p><p>– Is there a reason you did glucose measurement at 12 months, but all other health measures at 22 months?</p><p>– In your body temperature analysis, it seems like you have two outliers in your ZU group (one definitely outside the normal range of mouse healthy physiology). If you remove these individuals, do you still find a significant difference? I would assume those two very low temp animals were either sick or there was a misreading of the thermometer.</p><p>– I think Figure 2 is confusing. It would make more sense to show each variable for both sexes, not just cherry-picking the significant ones. I would also like to see the body weight trajectory curves since they were measured at multiple time points.</p><p>– I would include the coefficients and test statistics in Table 2.</p><p>– While you found no effect of genotype, I think you need to include what the sample sizes were for each group, not the genotypes pooled in Table 1.</p><p>– Did you confirm that the Gao gene was knocked down/out in your mice?</p><p>– I'm not sure why the discussion focuses so much on GH when it does not really affect any of the results here, other than as evidence that early life effects can influence lifespan.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In figure 1, the authors did a log-rank text to compare all three treatment groups, and then did follow-up log-rank tests to compare differences between pairs. It would be crucial to run the second test with correction for multiple comparisons and mention in the method section clearly.</p><p>2) In figure 2, it would be better to visualise all data points and median. Box plots or violin plots could be good options.</p><p>3) In the last sentence of the Abstract, the authors stated &quot;…have long-lasting effects on disease resistance, and…&quot;. But the entire study did not perform any direct challenges on testing disease resistance, for instance, infection, etc. I would suggest using &quot;health maintenance at late life&quot; or something similar instead.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84060.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After discussion, the reviewers agreed that for rigor and reproducibility of the analysis, the authors should:</p><p>(i) plot all data, regardless of significance (i.e. both for male vs male, all functional phenotypes tested);</p></disp-quote><p>We have added several new figure panels in response to this request, showing temperature in both sexes (Figure 2), glucose in both sexes (Figure 2), and weight at all ages in both sexes (Figure 3).

The use of a genetically heterogeneous mouse model as odor donors would mean that the odor receiving animals would be exposed to signaling proteins and volatile odorants produced by several strains of mice. We perceived this as a strength because different mouse strains produce different olfactory signaling proteins [28], and exposing mice to odors from a variety of genotypes would increase the probability of exposure to an odorant that influences lifespan. However, different mouse strains also express different olfactory receptors [29], and could show different physiological responses to bedding from different strains, although VNO activation responses in mice to odors from the same or different strain of mouse has been reported as broadly similar [30, 31]. In principle, it’s possible that different lifespan responses may occur if mice are exposed to odors from a background genotype.”</p><p>“As our results were not significantly altered by the olfactory genetic manipulation employed in this experiment, it is possible that a different sensory modality might be involved in mediating these effects. Similarly, we cannot exclude the possibility that microbiota transferred with the bedding, rather than the urine odor and bedding odor per se, cause these effects. Regardless, this must be a female-specific secreted factor that only influences female lifespan, and can do so even when females are exposed only over the first 12 weeks of life”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) provide more information about the Gao KO, including genotyping protocol and validation that the gene was knocked out (essential to conclude that Gao is not involved in the phenotype).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided a complete description of the genotyping protocol. We have also provided more information on the validation of this model from previous studies, including specific information on conditional loss of Gao in the vomeronasal organ and assessory olfactory bulb but not the main olfactory epithelium. This deletion was comprehensively described in the original study by coauthors Frank Zufall and Trese Leinders-Zufall, documenting impaired aggressive behavior in cGao -/- mice. Since then, this mouse model has also been used to show that cGao -/- mice exhibit impaired reproductive behavior (including sexual maturity) and a reduced ability to detect some bacterial peptides. We also have another preprint currently under revision that shows male cGao -/- mice show impaired metabolic responses to females and their odours. This comprehensive validation and phenotyping is now referred to in the revised article with associated references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

You state ANOVA in your results, but it should also be in your methods. Also for rotarod, you need to control for body weight.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added reference to using an ANOVA for non-longevity data in the methods, and the associated post-hoc test. Given that there is no differences between the groups for rotarod function or body weight, and we have measured multiple parameters, we feel that it is not worth including the body weight controlled data. Just to check, for grip strength and rotarod performance we also reran each ANOVA including body weight as a covariate. This analysis also showed no effect of genotype or treatment for these parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is there a reason you did glucose measurement at 12 months, but all other health measures at 22 months?</p></disp-quote><p>We measure temp, grip, and rotarod at 22 months because these vary with age, and we wanted to look for possible delay in age changes. We do not like to take blood samples at that age, because of a concern that this might diminish survival for some mice, so we took the glucose sample at mid-life. Glucose was not being used as an age-sensitive variable, but as a possible mediating factor in the process by which early life odors alter lifespan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In your body temperature analysis, it seems like you have two outliers in your ZU group (one definitely outside the normal range of mouse healthy physiology). If you remove these individuals, do you still find a significant difference? I would assume those two very low temp animals were either sick or there was a misreading of the thermometer.</p></disp-quote><p>If we ignore the lowest temperature, we obtain p = 0.03 for the overall ANOVA and p = 0.03 for the comparison of ZU to FU. If we ignore the two lowest temperatures, we obtain p = 0.07 for the ANOVA and p = 0.11 for the post-hoc comparison of FU to ZU. You may be right that one or both of these animals might have been sick, or (less likely) that the test was performed incorrectly, but we do not have any evidence to support or refute those ideas. Our preference is not to eliminate data points without a good reason, observational or statistical, to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I think Figure 2 is confusing. It would make more sense to show each variable for both sexes, not just cherry-picking the significant ones. I would also like to see the body weight trajectory curves since they were measured at multiple time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the data suggested by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I would include the coefficients and test statistics in Table 2.</p></disp-quote><p>STATA’s Cox regression algorithm calculates hazard ratios, standard errors, z-scores, and 95% confidence intervals comparing each group to its baseline. It then computes p-value and Χ2 statistics for the marginal effect of each factor (odor, genotype and interaction); it is these marginal p-values that were tabulated in Table 2. We have now added the Χ2 value to address the reviewer’s request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– While you found no effect of genotype, I think you need to include what the sample sizes were for each group, not the genotypes pooled in Table 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Groups were very nearly equal in size, with the number of WT mice ranging from 27 to 30, and the number of mutant mice ranging from 28 to 30. We have added the count of WT mice in each class to Table 1 as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Did you confirm that the Gao gene was knocked down/out in your mice?</p></disp-quote><p>The phenotype of these animals has been comprehensively described in previous studies, showing the loss of Gao in basal vomeronasal sensory neurons. As highlighted above the knockout of Gao was well characterized in the first study that generated these mice, and then three subsequent studies have demonstrated that this knockout impairs aspects of reproductive behavior, predator avoidance and detection of bacterial peptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I'm not sure why the discussion focuses so much on GH when it does not really affect any of the results here, other than as evidence that early life effects can influence lifespan.</p></disp-quote><p>Our key conclusions are (a) that transient early life environment can lead to enduring changes in state sufficient to extend lifespan, and (b) that odor can cause such a shift. Much of the prior evidence on transient early life environmental changes comes from manipulations of GH, and thus a synopsis of these experiments provides a useful context for the reader. The GH-injected design also points to possible mechanisms, including changes in stress resistance, hypothalamic inflammation, and the set of cellular changes listed in Ref [6]; listing these downstream phenotypes provides suggestions for follow-up work in our new odor exposure model</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) In figure 1, the authors did a log-rank text to compare all three treatment groups, and then did follow-up log-rank tests to compare differences between pairs.
