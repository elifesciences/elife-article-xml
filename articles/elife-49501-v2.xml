A chronic imbalance between energy intake and expenditure increases adiposity and leads to obesity and predisposes to the development of metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wajchenberg, 2000</xref>). White adipose tissue (WAT) is essential for triglyceride (TG) storage, whereas thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy as heat through mitochondrial uncoupling mechanisms including uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chechi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saely et al., 2012</xref>). A subpopulation of mature adipocytes in certain WAT depots, known as beige adipocytes, also acquires thermogenic capacity in response to cold or hormonal stimuli. Increasing the activity of thermogenic adipocytes in animal models counteracts the development of obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harms and Seale, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Villanueva et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling adipose thermogenesis could inform the development of new therapies for metabolic diseases.</p><p>In times of metabolic need, white adipocytes mobilize stored lipids through hydrolysis of triglycerides and release of free fatty acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zechner et al., 2009</xref>). Activation of β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) by catecholamines released by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is a major physiological inducer of lipolysis and adipose thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartness et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harms and Seale, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vitali et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Cold sensation triggers β-AR activation in adipose tissue, resulting in cAMP production and the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and p38 kinase. These kinases initiate phosphorylation cascades that impinge on C/EBP, ATF, and CREB transcription factors that regulate the expression of gene involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (such as <italic>Ppargc1</italic>) and thermogenesis (such as <italic>Ucp1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harms and Seale, 2013</xref>). Adrenergic stimuli induce lipolysis in adipocytes through PKA-dependent phosphorylation of lipases including hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaworski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zechner et al., 2009</xref>). Free fatty acid (FA) released from adipocytes can be used by peripheral tissues for mitochondrial respiration. The importance of β-AR-dependent lipid mobilization and thermogenesis is underscored by the observations that genetic deletion of β-ARs or adipocyte-specific loss of ATGL causes a drastic reduction in energy expenditure that predisposes mice to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schreiber et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Clearance of catecholamine is critical in terminating β-adrenergic signals, and local catabolism of catecholamine is an established mechanism for negative regulation of adrenergic signaling in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pirzgalska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Song et al., 2019</xref>). However, our prior studies revealed an unexpected role for IL10 signaling in the inhibition of β-adrenergic signaling and adipose thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rajbhandari et al., 2018</xref>). Mice globally-deficient in IL10 expression have enhanced energy expenditure and are protected from diet-induced obesity. We showed that chromatin accessibility at thermogenic genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue was linked to IL10 signaling; however, whether adipocytes themselves are the primary target for the metabolic effects of IL10 in vivo remains to be established. Here, we show that adipocyte-specific deletion of IL10Rα increases adipose adrenergic signaling, recapitulating the effects of whole-body IL10 deletion. Single nuclei transcriptomics of mature subcutaneous adipocytes identified a thermogenic adipocyte subtype that was enriched in IL10Rα-deficient mice. Additionally, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of adipose stromal populations revealed an increase in IL10-producing adaptive immune cells under adrenergic stimulation. These results define an immune-adipocyte axis that plays an important role in the modulation of the adipose adrenergic response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of AdIL10Rα in adipocytes promotes thermogenesis and confers obesity resistance</title><p>We previously reported that global IL10-deficient mice have increased energy expenditure and browning of white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rajbhandari et al., 2018</xref>).

However, metabolic cage analysis revealed increased oxygen consumption and energy expenditure in AdIL10Rα KO mice, without changes in locomotion and body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To determine if this difference in energy expenditure was associated with protection against diet-induced obesity, we challenged AdIL10Rα KO with high-fat diet (60% calories from fat). After 8–9 weeks of HFD feeding, both male and female AdIL10Rα KO mice were protected against weight gain compared to floxed littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). MRI analysis of body composition showed that the difference in body weight was entirely due to a change in fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistent with these findings, the inguinal WAT (iWAT) of AdIL10Rα KO mice was visibly redder than that of controls, suggesting increased tissue ‘browning’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49501.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ablation of IL10Rα in adipocytes increases energy expenditure and protects mice from diet-induced obesity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of IL10Rα expression in SVF and adipocyte fractions of iWAT from chow-fed 10 week-old mice.

The data revealed a selective increase in the thermogenic gene program in AdIL10Rα KO mice compared to controls. The gene expression differences between AdIL10Rα KO mice and controls were highly consistent with those observed in global IL10-deficient mice compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rajbhandari et al., 2018</xref>), strongly suggesting that the effects of IL10 on adipose tissue gene expression are mediated predominantly through direct action of IL10 on adipose IL10Rα. These data also supporting a specific inhibitory effect of IL10Rα signaling on adrenergic-responsive pathways. We also noted that several genes that were more highly expressed in control mice compared to AdIL10Rα KOs have been linked to negative regulation of thermogenesis. For example, <italic>Cnotl1</italic> and <italic>Brd2</italic> have been reported to negatively regulate the mRNA stability and transcription of UCP1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>).

Remarkably, this analysis revealed that the adipocytes from iWAT of chow-fed C57BL/6 mice were highly heterogeneous. We were able to distinguish 14 distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We then performed SNAP-seq on adipocytes derived from iWAT as described above. We performed unbiased aggregated clustering of the processed data for all the conditions as a tSNE-plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The aggregated cluster represents ~54,000 cell and allows us to confidently assign biological function to each cluster.

We previously reported that hematopoietic-secreted IL10 inhibits adrenergic signaling-mediated lipid mobilization and thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rajbhandari et al., 2018</xref>). Here we provide evidence from scRNA-seq analysis of both adipose stromal-vascular cells and mature adipocytes indicating that adrenergic stimulation causes an increase in the abundance of IL10-secreting adaptive immune cells, and that this cytokine acts directly on the IL10Rα complex in mature adipocytes to antagonize thermogenesis. Genetic ablation of IL10Rα in adipocytes increases the browning of white adipose tissue and selectively enhances thermogenic gene expression, defining mature adipocytes as the primary target of the metabolic actions of IL10. Our SNAP-seq data further revealed that adipose tissue is composed of surprisingly complex subpopulation of adipocytes, including distinct subtypes whose gene expression suggests they are subspecialized for different processes, including lipogenesis and thermogenesis. Deletion of IL10Rα selectively increases the subpopulation of metabolically active, thermogenic adipocytes.</p><p>The immune system plays an important role in maintaining adipose homeostasis. Prior studies have shown that signaling from both innate and adaptive immune cells influences lipid handling, adipocyte size and function, and whole body lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bapat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schäffler and Schölmerich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wernstedt Asterholm et al., 2014</xref>). In a proinflammatory state, as seen in adrenergic stress, cancer cachexia, and burn victims, adipose tissue undergoes remodeling that activates lipid mobilization and thermogenesis which can lead to lipodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Patsouris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petruzzelli et al., 2014</xref>). One established mechanism to block uncontrolled lipolysis is through catabolism of catecholamines. Sympathetic-associated macrophages, NRLP3 inflammasomes, and OCT3 have all been shown to enhance catecholamine clearance in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pirzgalska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Immune cells also could counteract adrenergic signaling by releasing factors that prevent excessive lipolysis and thermogenesis and thereby direct adipocytes to reserve energy in the setting of starvation or infection. This idea is supported by our scRNA-seq studies on iWAT SVFs of mice under adrenergic stress. Mice treated with β3-adrenergic agonist have expanded adaptive immune cell populations and a 3-fold increase the abundance of IL10 transcript in adipose SVF. Increased production of IL10 in the microenvironment could antagonize adrenergic-mediated thermogenesis, potentially providing a mechanism whereby immune cells help to maintain lipid homeostasis in the setting of energy demand.</p><p>A recent study has shown that deletion of Oct coactivator from B-cells (OcaB), which is essential for B-lymphocyte maturation and development, promotes adipose browning and protects mice from age-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2018</xref>). We showed here that the absence of IL10-secreting adaptive immune cells in mice also leads to enhanced adipose thermogenesis, a finding consistent with the phenotypes of both IL10 KO and AdIL10Rα KO mice.</p><p>To more deeply interrogate the effect of IL10 signaling on adipocyte identity and function, we performed SNAP-seq of adipocytes from iWAT. Although prior studies have used FACS and immortalized clonal preadipocytes to assess different types of adipocytes in various adipose tissue depots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hagberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2019</xref>), to our knowledge, this is the first report of rigorous single nuclei RNA-Seq of adipocytes in the setting of a thermogenic challenge. Our data revealed distinct clusters reflecting subsets of mature adipocytes with differential gene expression. Our data show that the mature tissue adipocyte population is much more heterogeneous than previously appreciated. We categorized by 14 distinct subsets of mature adipocytes that appear to be specialized to participate in at least partially distinct metabolic pathways. These findings suggest that different functions of adipose tissue may be executed by different cell populations, rather than similar cell populations performing diverse functions. Further studies will be needed to test this idea.</p><p>Interestingly, Type nine adipocytes were highly metabolically active and thermogenic, and we speculate that this cluster corresponds to the so-called ‘beige’ adipocyte population. Violin plots of the Type nine cluster showed selective expression of genes involved in lipid mobilization, such as <italic>Adrb3, Acsl2, Lipe, Pnpla2</italic>, and brown/beige-associated genes such as <italic>Ucp1, Cidea, Dio2,</italic> and <italic>Clstn3</italic>. The identity of this cluster was further confirmed by performing snRNA-seq on adipocytes from mice at RT, exposed to cold for various times, or treated with CL. We saw a gradual increase in the percentage of Type nine adipocytes with increasing thermogenic stimulus.</p><p>Interestingly, we also noticed distinct sub-clustering of Type nine adipocytes within the cluster. Cells expressing genes involved in lipolysis had an even distribution, whereas cells with higher expression of brown/beige genes were subclustered together after 4 days of cold or CL treatment. This data suggests that <italic>Adrb3</italic>-expressing adipocytes have varying browning capacity. We also noticed that the subclustering patterns of cold-exposed versus CL-treated Type nine adipocytes were also different. This likely reflects different transcriptional responses to cold exposure and pharmacological adrenergic receptor activation. DEG analysis of AdIL10Rα KO and control adipocytes showed that ablation of IL10Rα leads to differential enrichment of adipocyte populations. Type nine adipocytes appear to be enriched in genes that are highly expressed in AdIL10Rα KO compared to control iWAT. Furthermore, AdIL10Rα KO adipocytes are more metabolically active and have heightened response to adrenergic stimulation compared to controls. These data suggest that deletion of IL10Rα from adipocytes leads to the selective enrichment of metabolically active adipocytes that could ultimately lead to increased response to adrenergic signaling and enhanced thermogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, these data provide insight into crosstalk between IL-10-secreting immune cells and adipocytes within adipose tissue, as well as into the complexity of the transcriptional response to adrenergic signaling in mature adipocytes. A better understanding of the pathways influencing the development and phenotypic transformation of Type nine adipocytes could ultimately lead to strategies to increase energy expenditure and protect against diet-induced obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Experimental mice were sacrificed at ages mentioned in figure legends for gene expression analysis. For the time course cold exposure experiment, WT mice at 8–10 weeks of age were singly housed at 4°C room in a non-bedded cage without food and water for first 6 hr; thereafter food, water, and one cotton square were added.

For the 48 hr and 4 day cold exposure, cages were changed daily with new cotton squares and 3 hr before the time of harvest, the food, water, and cotton square were removed. For β-adrenergic stimulation experiments, mice were intraperitoneally injected with β3-adrenergic agonist (CL 316,243; CL, at 1 mg/kg/day for 4 days) or saline.

Indirect calorimetry was performed using a Columbus Instruments Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS, Columbus Instruments). Animals were placed individually in chambers for three consecutive days at ambient temperature (26.5°C) with 12 hr light/dark cycles. Animals had free access to food and water.

First, we used known cell-type specific markers curated from literature, single cell atlases, previous studies in the SVF and PBMCs, and from Immgen (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.immgen.org">immgen.org</ext-link>) to find distinct expression patterns in the cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hepler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoeckius et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). A cluster showing unique expression of a known marker gene can be used to identify that cell type. To consider more than a single gene, we evaluated the overlap between known cell type marker genes with the marker genes identified in our cell clusters using FindConservedMarkers. Significant overlap was assessed using a Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The two methods showed consistency in cell identity determination.

Fat pads were blotted on a napkin to removed excess liquid. Tissues were cut and minced with scissors and were placed in 15 ml conical tubes containing digestion buffer (DPBS and Collagenase D at 9.8 mg/ml; Sigma, MO) at incubated at 37°C for 45 mins with gentle shaking at 100 rpm. 10 ml of resuspension media (DMEM/F12 with glutamax supplemented with 15% FBS and 1% pen/strep; Thermo Scientific, CA) was added to digested solution and slowly inverted five times. The digestion mixture was centrifuged at 200 x g for 5 mins at RT. Floating adipocytes were collected using P1000 pipet with half cut P1000 tip. Adipocytes were transferred to a new 15 ml tube and kept on ice for five mins. Excess liquid was aspirated using 1 ml syringe and adipocytes were then washed with 1 ml DPBS and the suspension was spun down at 200 g for 5 mins at RT. Spun down liquid was aspirated using 1 ml syringe and adipocyte nuclei were isolated using Minute nuclei and cytosol isolation kit for adipose tissue using manufacture’s instruction (Invent Biotechnologies, MN) with modifications. Briefly, adipocytes were slowly resuspended in 600 μl nuclei lysis buffer (N/C Buffer) and lysate was transferred to a filter cartridge with collection tube and incubated at −20°C freezer for 20 min with cap open. After incubation, the tube was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min at 4°C. The filter cartridge was discarded without agitation and the collection tube was immediately centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 4 min at 4°C. Supernatant was gently removed using P200 pipet without touching the side walls. Nuclei were resuspended in 30 ul of nuclei resuspension buffer (DPBS+0.1%BSA) per 200–400 mg of iWAT (i.e. one 8–10 week chow fed mouse). For SNAP-seq, 2–3 mice were combined and 60 μl of nuclei suspension was transferred to a new 2 ml tube and resuspended with 500–700 μl of nuclei resuspension buffer and filtered using 40 μm cell strainer (Flowmi Cell Strainer, Belart, NJ) twice to get clean single nuclei suspension. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, for quality control, nuclei were first DAPI stained and then filtered or FACS sorted to get single nuclei suspension. After microfluidic partitioning in 10xGenomics platform (see below), nuclei lysis was checked by observing oil emulsion under fluorescent microscope for DAPI diffusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Adipocyte single nuclei barcoding and library preparation</title><p>Approximately 10,000 nuclei were loaded onto Single Cell 3’ Chip (10xGenomics, CA) per channel with an expected recovery to 4000–7000 nuclei. The Chip was placed on a 10XGenomics Instrument to generate single nuclei gel beads in emulsion (GEMs). For optimal nuclei lysis, GEMs were incubated on ice for 50 mins.

Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) instrument with PE100 reads and an 8 bp index read to multiplexing. With the version three chemistry, the first 26 bp of Read 1 consist of the cell barcode and the UMI, and the last 74 bp on the read are not used.

Briefly,. bcl files obtained from the UCLA Broad Stem Cell Research Center sequencing core were demultiplexed and converted to fastq files using the mkfastq function in Cell Ranger which wraps Illumina’s bcl2fastq v2.19.1.403. The counts function in Cell Ranger was used to generate DGEs from the fastq files. Briefly, the resulting fastq files are aligned to a 10x supplied mm10 reference genome (mm10-3.0.0) using STAR and reads are identified as either exonic, intronic, or intergenic using the supplied 10x Genomics GTF file. To determine cell barcodes, the counts function in Cell Ranger implements an algorithm based on EmptyDrops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lun et al., 2019</xref>). Only reads which align to exonic regions were used in the resulting DGE. The count values for each cell were normalized by the total number of UMIs in that cell and then multiplied by 10,000 and log transformed. Single cells were identified from background ambient mRNA using thresholds of at least 200 genes and a maximum mitochondrial fraction of 10%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-5"><title>Identification of adipocyte clusters</title><p>The Seurat R package version 3.0.0.9000 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/satijalab/seurat">https://github.com/satijalab/seurat</ext-link>) was used to project all sequenced cells onto two dimensions using t-SNE/UMAP and Louvain clustering was used to assign clusters. The optimal number of PCs used for t-SNE dimensionality reduction and Louvain clustering were determined using the Jackstraw permutation approach and a grid-search of the parameters. Similarly, the density used to assign clusters was identified using a parameter grid search.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-6"><title>Identification of marker genes of individual adipocyte clusters</title><p>We defined cell cluster specific marker genes from our 10x Genomics dataset using the FindConservedMarkers function in Seurat across all the samples. Briefly, a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test is run within each sample and a meta p-value across all samples is computed to assess the significance of each gene as a marker for a particular cluster. Within each sample, the cells are split into two groups: single cells from the cell type of interest and all other single cells. To be considered in the analysis, the gene had to be expressed in at least 10% of the single cells form one of the groups and there had to be at least a 0.25 log fold change in gene expression between the groups. This process was conducted within each sample separately, and then a meta p-value was assessed from the p-values across all samples. Multiple testing was corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method on the meta p-values and genes with an FDR &lt; 0.05 were defined as cell type specific marker genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-7"><title>Resolving cell identities of the cell clusters</title><p>Two methods were used to aid in resolving the identities of the cell type clusters. First, KEGG, Reactome, BIOCARTA, GO Biological Processes, and Hallmark gene sets were obtained from MSigDB. To identify pathways which had significant enrichment of our cell type marker genes, we used a hypergeometric test, followed by multiple testing correction with the Benjamini–Hochberg method. We also adapted the method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zywitza et al. (2018)</xref> to get a single cell level score for each pathway. Briefly, the expression of each gene was linearly transformed to (0,1) and the average gene expression of all genes for each gene set was computed to represent the score for that gene set. We then identified the top scoring gene sets which were representative of each cell type. The GEO accession number for the sequencing data is GSE133486.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNAScope fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</title><p>Inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) from CL-treated WT mice (Jackson Laboratory, #000664) was fixed in 10% formalin overnight, embedded with paraffin, and sectioned into unstained, 5-μm-thick sections.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Philipp E Scherer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers all agree that your work addresses an important issue, and that the manuscript advances our understanding of the role of IL10 and its receptor in adipose biology and systemic metabolism. Your nuclei scSeq method indicates substantial adipocyte heterogeneity, a most interesting observation that will be of importance to the field. However, prior to publication, a few substantive issues need clarification:</p><p>1) Has the food intake of the IL10Rα KO mice and calorie excretion been taken into account?

We have confirmed single cell transcriptomics from Cluster 9 using RNAScope in situ hybridization (FISH) from iWAT of saline or CL treated mice (new Figure 4F). This data directly confirms the existence and co-expression of thermogenic genes in cluster 9.</p><p>To address possible SVF contamination, we cross-matched SVF and adipocyte single cell/nuclei data (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1). A Fisher’s exact test was conducted between pairwise sets of cell type marker genes (determined by adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) to find cell types which had significant overlaps in their marker genes denoting transcriptional similarity. Cell types from both mature adipocyte nuclei and SVF single cells were used in this analysis and they were grouped using hierarchical clustering with tiles colored by -Log10 Bonferroni adjusted p-values. Adjusted p-values were thresholded to aid in visualization with values less than 10<sup>-5</sup> set to 10<sup>-5</sup>. We did not find high degree of transcriptional similarity between SVF and adipocyte clusters (top). However, under stringent p-value adjustment, the transcriptomic state of adipocyte clusters 12 and 14 correlated with markers of adaptative immune cells (bottom). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that clusters 12 and 14 may be contaminated with immune cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
