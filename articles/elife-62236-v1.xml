These drugs are also used to treat people with a condition call adrenal insufficiency who do not produce enough of an important hormone called cortisol. Use of glucocorticoids is very common, the proportion of people in a given country taking them can range from 0.5% to 21% of the population depending on the duration of the treatment. But, like any medication, glucocorticoids have both benefits and risks: people who take glucocorticoids for a long time have an increased risk of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and death.</p><p>Because of the risks associated with taking glucocorticoids, it is very important for physicians to tailor the dose to each patient’s needs. Doing this can be tricky, because the levels of glucocorticoids in a patient’s blood are not a good indicator of the medication’s activity in the body. A test that can accurately measure the glucocorticoid activity could help physicians personalize treatment and reduce harmful side effects.</p><p>As a first step towards developing such a test, Chantzichristos et al. identified a potential way to measure glucocorticoid activity in patient’s blood. In the experiments, blood samples were collected from ten patients with adrenal insufficiency both when they were on no medication, and when they were taking a glucocorticoid to replace their missing hormones. Next, the blood samples were analyzed to determine which genes were turned on and off in each patient with and without the medication. They also compared small molecules in the blood called metabolites and tiny pieces of genetic material called microRNAs that turn genes on and off.</p><p>The experiments revealed networks of genes, metabolites, and microRNAs that are associated with glucocorticoid activity, and one microRNA called miR-122-5p stood out as a potential way to measure glucocorticoid activity. To verify this microRNA’s usefulness, Chantzichristos et al. looked at levels of miR-122-5p in people participating in three other studies and confirmed that it was a good indicator of the glucocorticoid activity.</p><p>More research is needed to confirm Chantzichristos et al.’s findings and to develop a test that can be used by physicians to measure glucocorticoid activity. The microRNA identified, miR-122-5p, has been previously linked to diabetes, so studying it further may also help scientists understand how taking glucocorticoids may increase the risk of developing diabetes and related diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glucocorticoids</kwd><kwd>biomarkers</kwd><kwd>multi-omics</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>gene

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) have a key role in the metabolic, vascular, and immunological response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cain and Cidlowski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oster et al., 2017</xref>). GC secretion from the adrenal gland is under tight dynamic control by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and is regulated in a classic circadian pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cain and Cidlowski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oster et al., 2017</xref>). Most actions of GCs are mediated by the ubiquitously expressed GC receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cain and Cidlowski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oster et al., 2017</xref>). The tissue-specific effects of GCs are regulated by many local factors, including pre-receptor metabolism of GCs and the interaction of the GC receptor with tissue-specific transcription factors, or through non-genomic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cain and Cidlowski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oster et al., 2017</xref>). As a result of this complexity, circulating levels of cortisol relate poorly to tissue action of cortisol, and serum cortisol therefore has limited value as a biomarker for GC action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Karssen et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>GCs are among the most commonly prescribed drugs, and GC treatment remains a cornerstone in the management of many rheumatic and inflammatory diseases despite the introduction of modern disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biological immunomodulatory treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smolen et al., 2017</xref>). GC replacement is essential for survival in patients with various forms of adrenal insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johannsson et al., 2015</xref>). However, metabolic and other side effects of GC treatment or replacement are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Björnsdottir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fardet et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that current methods to monitor their action and tailor their treatment are inadequate. Unphysiological GC exposure has been implicated in the etiology of several common diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, abdominal obesity, and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ragnarsson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Against this background, it is highly desirable to be able to measure and quantify GC action as this might be useful to refine current GC therapy. Biomarkers of GC action will also provide potential mechanistic understanding for the role of GCs in the etiology of many common diseases. Previous attempts to identify biomarkers using metabolomics have identified circulating metabolites associated with GC exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alwashih et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alwashih et al., 2017b</xref>). Integrated multi-omic analysis provides increased robustness over analysis of individual ‘omic data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ideker et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, the identification of groups within one ‘omic ‘layer’ with shared co-regulation within another ‘omic layer implies a functional relationship that can be used both to assess the mechanistical relevance and to support the identification of biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karczewski and Snyder, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Misra et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this exploratory study was to define multi-omic patterns derived from independent tissues related to GC action and to use these patterns to search for clinically applicable circulating biomarkers of GC action. Subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency, Addison’s disease, lack GC production from the adrenal cortex and can therefore be considered a human GC ‘knock-down’ model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An experimental study design including subjects with Addison’s disease, standardizing for diurnal variation and food intake, allowed a within-individual comparison between physiological GC exposure and GC withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A multi-omic analysis strategy combining data from gene expression in circulation (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) and an important metabolic tissue, adipose tissue, integrated with circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) and metabolites was used to identify putative biomarkers. The strongest putative biomarkers were then replicated in independent study groups with different GC exposure.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Clinical and analytical part of the exploratory study and the replication step.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Subjects with Addison’s disease (primary adrenal insufficiency, step 1) were studied in a random order during both physiological glucocorticoid (GC) exposure and GC withdrawal (step 2). Transcriptomics (whole-genome expression) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and adipose tissue (<italic>n</italic> = 28,869,869 genes), plasma miRNAomics (<italic>n</italic> = 252), and serum metabolomics in morning samples were analyzed (<italic>n</italic> = 164) (step 3). Integration of the multi-omic data derived a network including gene expression (derived from two independent tissues), microRNAs (miRNAs), and metabolites that were statistically differentiated between the two interventions (step 4). The miRNA findings, because of their centrality in the network, were replicated in subjects with different GC exposures (within the physiological range) from three independent studies (step 5). (<bold>B</bold>) Subjects with Addison’s disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) received in a random order intravenous (i.v.) hydrocortisone (HC) infusion mixed in 0.9% saline in a circadian pattern (physiological GC exposure) or the same volume of 0.9% saline alone (GC withdrawal) during 22 hr starting at 9 AM more than 2 weeks apart.

As such, these structures can be used to describe complex relationships that link multiple elements. Hypernetworks also allow for the same pair of nodes to be connected by multiple edges. This means that relationships between nodes can be ranked by the number of edges shared between them. Hypernetworks allow for the summary of correlation matrices, compressing the high-dimensional relationships between data points (transcripts/miRNA/metabolites) into a single metric of similarity. Hypernetworks facilitate integration of ‘omic data and can be used to define strongly associated elements. Elements with large numbers of shared edges are more similar and likely to be of functional relevance; clustering allows refinement of large ‘omic data sets to highly associated elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>).

The novelty of this study is the identification of pathways related to GC response and putative biomarkers of GC action in gene expression, metabolome, and miRNAs derived from integrated multi-omic analysis in two independent tissues. We identified a transcriptomic profile that was under similar GC regulation in both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes, which was then validated by comparison to a range of previously published data by other research groups from cellular assays. We also identified a circulating miRNA, miR-122-5p, which was correlated with the circulating transcriptome and metabolome findings, suggesting for the first time a functional role in GC action. Moreover, the association between the expression of miR-122-5p and GC exposure was replicated in three independent study groups.</p><p>In order to identify putative biomarkers of GC action in humans, a clinical study was considered to be the most appropriate experimental setting. Addison’s disease or primary adrenal insufficiency is a rare disorder, but a unique clinical model for GC biomarker discovery due to absent or very low endogenous GC production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sævik et al., 2020</xref>). Subjects with Addison’s disease were studied in a random order during physiological GC exposure and GC withdrawal. During GC exposure, infusion of HC delivered in isotonic saline via an infusion pump using a circadian pattern and saline alone (using the same volume and infusion pattern as during HC infusion) was administered during the GC withdrawal in order to prevent a state of sodium and fluid deficiency. This study design therefore allowed a within-individual comparison accounting for circadian rhythm and food intake. The marked difference in serum and urinary cortisol and cortisone, and the similar serum electrolytes, glucose, body weight, and blood pressure between the two interventions support the experimental success of the study design and strongly indicate that confounders related to metabolic changes or other secondary events related to the GC exposure or GC withdrawal were not influencing the output of the study. The measurable but very low concentrations of serum cortisol and cortisone throughout the GC withdrawal may be explained by a residual adrenal steroid secretion in some subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sævik et al., 2020</xref>) and/or due to conversion of cortisone to cortisol in the liver and adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stimson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Network models of ‘omic data can be used as a framework to assess the potential utility of biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stevens et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we have used a hypernetwork model of GC action based on differential gene expression in PBMCs as a basis to integrate adipose tissue transcriptome, plasma miRNA, and serum metabolomic data. Hypernetwork analysis leverages the power inherent in large data sets to assess interactions between ‘omic elements in a manner that is robust to false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Battiston et al., 2020</xref>). The associated interactome network derived from the PBMC transcriptome was shown to contain a number of genes with previously known GC-dependent binding of <italic>NR3C1</italic> (the GC receptor) to regulatory elements, evidence that supports the specificity of the study design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Davis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Casper et al., 2018</xref>). Gene ontology analysis of the differential gene expression identified a range of pathways classically associated with GC action including GC-receptor signaling, immunoregulatory pathways such as those involving NF-κB, metabolic pathways, and cell cycle pathways. The plasma miRNA and serum metabolomic data was shown to map to the interactome network model of GC action, and this was taken as support for this data being putative circulating biomarkers functionally related to GC action.</p><p>Differential expression induced by GC treatment in both PBMCs and adipose tissue was indirectly associated with similar downstream elements by gene ontology analysis. These genes were not directly implicated with GC response, so, while the exact mechanisms may be different in each tissue, effects are coordinated through the same elements. Integration of the multi-omic data including both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes was performed in order to increase the robustness of putative markers that could reflect action in other tissues such as adipose tissue, which is an important target organ for the metabolic actions of GCs. The 59 genes that behaved similarly in PBMC and adipose tissue were then validated in a range of studies examining GC response in different cellular systems. These included primary cell culture on keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stojadinovic et al., 2007</xref>) and lens epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gupta et al., 2005</xref>), along with PBMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carlet et al., 2010</xref>) and cancer cells [both lymphoblastic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carlet et al., 2010</xref>) and osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jewell et al., 2012</xref>)]. The set of nine genes co-regulated in relation to GC exposure and GC withdrawal in both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes can therefore be considered as putative markers of GC response. These could be used as a gene set to interrogate GC action in other experimental settings.</p><p>All the miRNA findings in this study are novel. While emerging experimental evidence indicates impact on regulation of GC action at several points by miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Clayton et al., 2018</xref>), this is the first time that miRNAs are shown to be globally correlated to GC action in humans. Both the hypernetwork analysis and the interactome network model implied the functional significance of some miRNAs, particularly miR-122-5p. In our hypernetwork model, the expression of miR-122-5p was correlated with clusters of genes that were centrally coordinated by expression of both <italic>RNF157</italic> and <italic>TBXAS1</italic>, the former suggested to be a key regulator of both <italic>PI3K</italic> and <italic>MAPK</italic> signaling pathways, commonly perturbated in cancer and metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dogan et al., 2017</xref>). Expression of TBXAS1 is pharmacogenomic linked to inhaled GC exposure in asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dahlin et al., 2020</xref>). miR-122 is precursor transcript of mature miRNAs, including miR-122-5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel, 2004</xref>). miR-122 is expressed in the liver in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">GTEx Consortium, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">GTEx Consortium, 2013</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). Hepatocyte nuclear factor HNF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), along with HNF3A (FOXOA1), HNF3B (FOXOA2), and HNF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Coulouarn et al., 2009</xref>), has been shown to be a key regulator of miR-122 expression in human cells. Down-regulation of miR-122 in murine models has been associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alisi et al., 2011</xref>) and diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guay et al., 2011</xref>), and in humans, miR-122-5p has also been associated with fatty liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Raitoharju et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>miR-122-5p may be a functional link between unphysiological GC exposure and metabolic and cardiovascular disease. Increased exposure to GCs impairs glucose tolerance and may induce type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hackett et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, reduced miR-122-5p expression has been seen in animal models of diabetes, and the reduction of this miRNA in response to increased GC exposure may suggest that miR-122-5p is a functional link between GC action and metabolism. In support of these findings are observations showing that miR‐122-5p regulate insulin sensitivity in murine hepatic cells by targeting the insulin‐like growth factor (IGF) 1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). Recent human studies have also suggested that miR-122-5p is an indicator of the metabolic syndrome, with reduced expression in response to weight loss in overweight/obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hess et al., 2020</xref>). miR-122-5p has also been suggested as a biomarker of coronary artery stenosis and plaque instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Singh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ling et al., 2020</xref>). As unphysiological GC exposure has been associated with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Walker, 2007</xref>), it is possible that miR-122-5p is reflecting different GC exposure in these disorders. The subjects with Addison’s disease in our clinical experimental study had no other comorbidities previously known to be associated with miR-122-5p expression, and therefore the presence of such confounders in our miR-122-5p finding seems to be unlike.</p><p>Specific miRNAs circulating in a stable, cell-free form in plasma or serum may serve as biomarkers in some diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kroh et al., 2010</xref>), and, in our integrated analysis, they seem to be a realistic and clinically useful marker of GC action. We therefore focused on the replication of the miRNA findings from the discovery study. For this purpose, we performed a targeted analysis of 12 putative miRNAs and analyzed them in 120 subjects from independent study groups with different GC exposure in terms of dose, duration of exposure, and route of administration. The rationale for selecting these groups was that their GC exposure mostly remained within the normal physiological range. Despite the experimental differences between these studies, and the fact that these studies were not designed to study miRNA biomarkers of GC action, miR-122-5p was down-regulated by increased GC exposure in all of them. One exception was when short-term excessively high GC exposure was studied in afternoon samples in 20 subjects. There is no clear explanation for this, except the possibility that high non-physiological GC exposure has other secondary effects that may affect the levels of miR-122-5p.</p><p>The network analysis also identified putative metabolomic markers of GC action. GCs have a key role in metabolic regulation of stress by mobilizing energy through glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism. Previous studies have found an association between different GC doses and levels of branched-chain amino acids, fatty acids, some acyl carnitines, and tryptophan and its metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alwashih et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sorgdrager et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, the amino acid tyrosine and the pyrimidine base uracil had a central position in the hypernetwork, which defined a group of highly connected multi-omic relationships within physiological GC exposure. Some of the other metabolomic data from our study was also in line with previous metabolomic studies in patients with adrenal insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alwashih et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sorgdrager et al., 2018</xref>). Excessive exposure to GCs in healthy subjects has, on the other hand, shown a strong, immediately and long-lasting impact on numerous biological pathways in the metabolome that may be either direct or indirect through the metabolic and cardiovascular action of pharmacological doses of GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bordag et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>There are some study limitations that need to be acknowledged. The low number of subjects included in the clinical experimental study could have reduced the power to detect a putative marker in individual ‘omic data sets, but this limitation was compensated for by the crossover study design and the integration of multi-omic layers. Another limitation is that we have only studied markers collected in the morning during physiologically peak cortisol exposure. However, the strengths of our study are the experimental study design, consideration of diurnal variation in GC action and impact of food intake, and the within-individual comparison, which minimizes confounders, as well as the fact that the putative markers that we have replicated are associated with known GC-responsive genes in two different tissues, suggesting their functional importance in GC action. Moreover, the integration of multi-omic layers allows for the reduction of background noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) and forms the basis for a detailed model of GC action. Hypernetwork summaries of correlation networks are recognized as providing signatures of mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pearcy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Butte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oldham et al., 2006</xref>) and, as such, are useful to assess both function and define markers of direct action.</p><p>In this clinical biomarker discovery study, we identified genes, miRNA, and metabolites that are differently expressed during GC exposure and GC withdrawal in subjects with Addison’s disease. The multi-omic data showed a high degree of coherence, and network analysis identified transcriptomics and metabolites that were closely correlated. The final outcome of the study is identification of a miRNA that is regulated by GC exposure and correlated with genes and metabolites that are also regulated by GCs in this study, indicating its functional relevance. The replication of this miRNA in three independent study groups increases the likelihood that the discovered miRNA, miR-122-5p, could become a biomarker of GC action to be used in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Adrenal diseases in the Out-patient Clinic at the Department of Endocrinology-Diabetes-Metabolism, Sahlgrenska University Hospital (tertiary referral hospital), Gothenburg, Sweden, were eligible for inclusion. Other inclusion criteria were age 20–60 years, body mass index 20–30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and ability to comply with the protocol procedures. Exclusion criteria were GC replacement therapy for indication other than Addison’s disease, any treatment with sex hormones including contraceptive drugs, treatment with levothyroxine, renal or hepatic failure, significant and symptomatic cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, current infectious disease with fever, and pregnancy or breastfeeding. Recruitment was stopped when all eligible subjects had been asked to participate.</p><p>Power calculation was not performed because of the exploratory nature of the study. Power calculations were also difficult in the context of ‘omic analysis as there may be variable effect sizes over different ‘omic elements.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the University of Gothenburg, Sweden (permit no. 374-13, 8 August 2013) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before participation.

HC infusion was adjusted in accordance with previous observations in healthy males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kerrigan et al., 1993</xref>) and interventions in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Løvås and Husebye, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The aim was to achieve a near-physiological circadian cortisol curve with early morning rise in serum cortisol that would peak at 7 AM and trough concentrations at midnight. In the GC-withdrawal intervention, 0.9% saline infusion alone was administered using the same volume as during the HC infusion. Thus, a person weighing 75 kg received 2 L of intravenous infusion over 22 hr during each intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Interventions</title><p>All subjects were admitted after an overnight fast to the in-patient Endocrinology Department at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital at 8 AM (first intervention day) and were discharged at 12 PM the following day (second day). Subjects were randomized using a free randomization plan (generated at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com/">http://www.randomization.com/</ext-link> on 27 April 2014) before the first intervention to receive either HC infusion or only saline infusion in a single-blind, crossover manner at least 2 weeks apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The researcher responsible for the clinical study generated the randomization plan, enrolled the study subjects, and assigned participants to interventions. Female subjects (when fertile) were studied during the early follicular phase (days 5–10) of their regular cycle under both interventions. Subjects were told not to take their ordinary mineralocorticoid dose on the day before each intervention but to take their ordinary HC dose. Subjects received standard meals at fixed times during both interventions. Their consumption of coffee or tea was recorded during the first intervention in order to consume the same amount and at the same time points during the second intervention.</p><p>During each intervention, the subjects’ blood pressure, body temperature, and weight were monitored. Because of the study design and the variations in circadian rhythm, blood sampling was collected at exactly the same time before the start of intervention, at midnight (12 AM), and in the morning of the second intervention day (7 AM). Urine was collected between midnight and morning (overnight), and abdominal subcutaneous fat was collected in the morning of the second intervention day immediately after blood and urine sampling. Adipose tissue was collected after local injection with lidocaine under the umbilicus on the right side of the abdomen during saline infusion and on the left side during HC infusion. The study was unblinded for each study subject after the completion of all aspects of the study (the second intervention).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Replication studies</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Baseline samples in subjects treated with prednisolone for rheumatoid arthritis</title><p>This was a cross-sectional clinical study of prednisolone-induced adrenal insufficiency undertaken at the Department of Medical Endocrinology and Metabolism, at University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, between 2012 and 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borresen et al., 2017</xref>). In the current replication analysis, 60 subjects were included. All subjects had rheumatoid arthritis, received long-term prednisolone treatment (minimum 6 months), and treated with a current prednisolone dose of 5 mg/day. Of the 60 subjects, 23 had an insufficient response to the Synacthen test (GC-induced adrenal insufficiency, AI group) and 37 had a normal response (normal group). The samples included in the replication analysis were collected in the morning after an approximately 48 hr pause of prednisolone dosing (before the Synacthen test) and after overnight fasting.

In the current replication analysis, the subgroup of 20 subjects with Addison’s disease under daily replacement therapy with oral HC ≥ 30 mg (AD group) and their 20 healthy control subjects with no GC therapy matched for age and gender (control group) were included. The samples included in the replication analysis were collected in the morning between 8 AM and 10 AM after an overnight fast, and for the cases after morning administration of their oral HC, which means a very low cortisol exposure during the night before sample collection.

Volunteers were randomized to receive either a low- or medium-dose insulin infusion (10 subjects in each group) and attended on three occasions after overnight fasting. Subjects received metyrapone (to inhibit adrenal cortisol secretion) with and without HC infusion (over 6.5 hr) in order to produce low, medium, or excessive GC levels (Low/Med/ExcessGC during high insulin and low insulin cohorts, respectively). The samples included in the replication analysis were collected in the afternoon at the end of each intervention (approximately 6.5 hr after start) on three occasions (low, moderate, or excessive high GC levels).

We identified 4426 DEGs in PBMCs, 3520 adipose tissue DEGs, 38 metabolites (17 LC-MS, 21 GC-MS), and 12 miRNAs below an uncorrected p-value of 0.05. Data was analyzed across nine matching samples (normalized log2 score was inverted between GC exposure and GC withdrawal, i.e., +1 and –1, respectively).</p><p>A hypernetwork is inherently robust as individual correlations are not considered significant; rather hypernetworks model higher order interactions between nodes (‘omic elements) based on large numbers of shared edges (correlations).

regulated genes, miRNAs, and metabolites</title><p>A whole-genome transcriptomics analysis was performed separately from mRNA extracted from (a) PBMCs and (b) abdominal subcutaneous fat both collected at 7 AM. The RMA algorithm was used for background correction and quantile normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Irizarry et al., 2003</xref>). Gene-level summarization of exon-level data was conducted using the Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST annotation. Processing was conducted using the R-packages ‘oligo’ and ‘Limma’. Data homogeneity was assessed using PCA (Qlucore Omics Explorer and limma) with cross-validation. No outliers were identified. Differential gene expression was determined by linear models using the lmFit function in limma and by group analysis of variance (ANOVA). Both p-values for group ANOVA and FDR-modified p-values for linear models (Benjamini–Hochberg method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>]) were reported. By comparing GC exposure to GC withdrawal, 289 DEG probe sets were identified in PBMCs and 141 in adipose tissue (each FDR-modified p&lt;0.05), consisting of 234 and 111 unique known genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Five of the DEGs occurred in both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes (<italic>FOXO1, KLF9, PER1, TXNIP,</italic> and <italic>ZBTB16</italic>), of which four had the same direction of expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).</p><p>In total, 9 out of 252 analyzed plasma miRNAs were differentially expressed at 7 AM between the two interventions (p&lt;0.05, paired <italic>t</italic>-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). By mapping to databases of predicted interactions between miRNA and gene transcripts (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis), these nine miRNAs were identified as possible regulators of 46 of the 234 unique DEGs from the PBMC transcriptome analysis (all known to be GC responsive) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).</p><p>For all metabolomic data, Metaboanalyst (via R package MetaboanalystR) was used to filter variables based on ranked interquartile range, normalize metabolites to sample median, and log transform the resultant intensities. Comparison of 164 metabolite fragments (82 from GC-MS and 82 from LC-MS) between the two interventions at 7 AM revealed a distinction between GC exposure and GC withdrawal. A paired <italic>t</italic>-test analysis identified 21 metabolite fragments from the GC-MS and 17 metabolite fragments from the LC-MS analysis that were significantly different (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c, d</xref>).</p><p>The ‘omic data sets from PBMCs, plasma miRNA, and serum metabolomics were examined for inter-subject variability. SNF was used to show that the integrated unsupervised ‘omic data sets were fundamentally homogenous across the study subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). Some evidence of grouping between study subjects related to specific pair-wise comparison of ‘omic data sets was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Integration of unsupervised peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomic, metabolomic, and miRNAomic data in subjects between glucocorticoid (GC) exposure and GC withdrawal at 7 AM using similarity network fusion.</title><p>Integration of all circulating ‘omic data (<bold>A</bold>) simultaneously and (<bold>B</bold>) stepwise. Each matrix represents a subject-by-subject comparison using similarity network fusion of change in signal of ‘omic data between GC exposure and GC withdrawal.

An in-house LC-MS library built up by authentic standards run on the same system with the same chromatographic and mass-spectrometry settings was used for the targeted processing. The identification of the metabolites was based on MS, MS-MS, and retention-time information.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The research focuses on the identification of markers of glucocorticoid action both at the transcriptomics level and the metabolite level. The availability of robust markers would be valuable in allowing the optimisation of glucocorticoid dosage. Ten subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency were used to enable biomarker discovery following treatment with hydrocortisone. While the cohort was small many of the markers observed had a high level of significance making this a useful preliminary study. A micro RNA (MiR-122-5p) was identified as being strongly correlated with glucocorticoid exposure and this finding was replicated in independent studies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Molecular data are often very noisy and require extensive cleaning. Which pre-processing approaches were applied? PCA is normally used to explore the sample structure and identify possible abnormalities while normalisation is needed to rescale the expression values to reduce noise. More explanations are needed on how PCA was used and whether any array normalisation was conducted.</p><p>– Certain results are not well explained. For example, those reported in the subsection “PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes have limited overlap in response to GC but are enriched for shared pathways” for PBMCs (the same applies to adipose tissue), how many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) did you find? This number is important to know before using those genes in pathway analysis. Did you use FDR or other forms of multiple testing correction to determine significance? It is unclear if you then used those DEGs to test pathway enrichment and you found a connectivity of n=4426 which is 3.7-fold stronger than using random genes. I am not sure what this means, or maybe 4426 is the list of DEGs? If so what is 3.7 connectivity? Please explain. Again, for pathways or GO terms enrichment, FDR should be used to correct for multiple testing. Overall, this analysis (Figure 2) does not appear to add much to the manuscript. Without multiple testing correction, relevant analyses seem to be those based on further gene filtering (i.e. retaining only genes confirmed across tissues and platforms such as those in Figures 4-8).</p><p>– Another example of low clarity is Figure 3. What is shared correlation? Heatmaps have no contrast and are uninformative. The dichotomisation by 0.5 is inappropriate, a higher cut-off (e.g. 0.8) might increase the contrast. Maybe the Venn diagram alone (Figure 3E) would be enough to convey your message if better explained?</p><p>– Discussion. miR-122-5p is not a novel circulating miRNA, it has been widely monitored as a diagnostic marker. Rephrase.</p><p>– There is a very extensive literature on miR-122-5p as diagnostic marker which I don't think has been thoroughly covered in the Discussion. For elevated miR-122-5p has been proposed as predictor on myocardial infarction which in turn has been associated with depressed hydrocortisone levels. Some additional discussion in this direction might be useful.</p><p>– Given that many conditions seem to affect miR-122-5p it would be important differentiate the effect of GC exposure from other conditions that affect its levels.</p><p>– In the metabolomics data the fold changes are quite small to confident on their robustness in such a small data set. Were the values of the metabolomic markers normally distributed?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62236.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Molecular data are often very noisy and require extensive cleaning.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize the point made by the editors/reviewers and have now made clear the extensive work we performed to establish the limits of noise and signal in our multi-omic data sets.</p><p>Note that we chose to use multiple approaches to ‘omic data-processing where possible.

This has been clarified in the text (subsection “Hypernetworks”), along with the additional explanation in the Results section and the addition of Supplementary file 1G, defining FDR corrected p-values for transcripts and metabolites used in hypernetworks.</p><p>Appendix 1 interrogates the similarities between PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes, using a false discovery rate modified p-value cut-off of &lt;0.05. These lists are different to those used in hypernetwork analysis and p-value distributions that can be found in Supplementary file 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear if you then used those DEGs to test pathway enrichment and you found a connectivity of n=4426 which is 3.7-fold stronger than using random genes. I am not sure what this means, or maybe 4426 is the list of DEGs? If so what is 3.7 connectivity? Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>This point has been explained further. The analysis provides data showing an enrichment in connectivity of the differentially expressed genes in the interactome model and supports functional relevance. We have combined these data with the section from the start of the description of the hypernetwork data. These are minor pieces of circumstantial evidence and have now been added to Appendix 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, for pathways or GO terms enrichment, FDR should be used to correct for multiple testing. Overall, this analysis (Figure 2) does not appear to add much to the manuscript. Without multiple testing correction, relevant analyses seem to be those based on further gene filtering (i.e. retaining only genes confirmed across tissues and platforms such as those in Figures 4-8).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Figure 2 in the previous version of the manuscript does not add much to the manuscript and have added these results to Appendix 2 (Appendix 2—figure 2 and 3). As we were comparing the same pathways in both PBMC and adipose tissue we have reported p-value rather than FDR to facilitate identification of possible overlap. The data presented in the old Figure 2 highlight the hypothesis that there is a shared relationship in both PBMCs and adipose tissue with GC regulation and as such is minor point. We agree with the reviewer that the filtered analysis presented later is more important for interpretation of the main message of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Another example of low clarity is Figure 3. What is shared correlation? Heatmaps have no contrast and are uninformative. The dichotomisation by 0.5 is inappropriate, a higher cut-off (e.g. 0.8) might increase the contrast. Maybe the Venn diagram alone (Figure 3E) would be enough to convey your message if better explained?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed all heatmaps to a blue/yellow contrasting colour scheme in alignment with best practise.</p><p>We recognise that the hypernetwork concept is a novel concept and have taken the opportunity to spell out the interpretation in the Results section that describes the integrated ‘omic findings.</p><p>We now provide a figure to highlight the structure of a hypernetwork and describe more precisely how the analysis works (Figure 3A and B). We specifically explain shared correlation and its relationship to the underlying similarity analysis, although we leave the more precise mathematical description of the matrix structures for explanation in the Materials and methods section. We also provide further clarity in the Materials and methods section on how this method uses the correlation distance to simply define similarity based on the assessment of values <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&amp;#x003E;</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">|</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.5</mml:mn><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of the standard deviation of the distribution of all r-values. The correlation distance is calculated in a similar manner to a Pearson correlation coefficient but the interpretation is as a distance metric. Note that we could “improve” the r-values by using Spearman’s correlation coefficient but doing this removes sensitivity to variation in the data and, importantly, loses a direct relationship to the Euclidean distances between the expression values of different genes. We chose this threshold based on the standard deviation equates to a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.5 as this value maximised the signal window in the hypernetwork analysis ensuring specific analysis downstream. The hypernetwork signal window was assessed experimentally and these data are now presented (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Using these approaches, we reflect the small size of the study in the absolute magnitude of the r-value in an unbiased manner but leverage the depth of the multi-omic data sets to increase confidence in the findings. With this experimental pathway the analysis is resistant to low r-value thresholds and robustness testing via comparison of the analysis with the complement of the underlying similarity matrix (i.e. the dissimilarity matrix) adds a final level of confidence in the analysis. The use of the dissimilarity matrix of the data allows a subtraction of those interactions defined as dissimilar from those that are similar and results in a highly robust non-statistical assessment of “presence” in the analysis (subsection “Hypernetworks”). We propose that this approach is more robust than permutation analysis that is also a possible method to determine robustness.</p><p>I addition, we have now focussed the description of the results on the Venn diagram which has been simplified for clarity as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discussion. miR-122-5p is not a novel circulating miRNA, it has been widely monitored as a diagnostic marker.
