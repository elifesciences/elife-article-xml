radial glia (RGs) and serve as the direct precursors for cerebral cortical neurons, but factors that control their neurogenic plasticity remain elusive. Here we report that IPs’ neuron production is enhanced by abrogating filamin function, leading to the generation of periventricular neurons independent of normal neocortical neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Loss of Flna in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) led RGs to undergo changes resembling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) along with exuberant angiogenesis that together changed the microenvironment and increased neurogenesis of IPs. We show that by collaborating with β-arrestin, Flna maintains the homeostatic signaling between the vasculature and NPCs, and loss of this function results in escalated Vegfa and Igf2 signaling, which exacerbates both EMT and angiogenesis to further potentiate IPs’ neurogenesis. These results suggest that the neurogenic potential of IPs may be boosted in vivo by manipulating Flna-mediated neurovascular communication.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17823.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17823.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>intermediate progenitor</kwd><kwd>neurovascular</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>filamin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS087575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Yuanyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000882</institution-id><institution>Brain Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Yuanyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyses based on the mouse model of a human genetic disease reveal that the neuron production of cerebral tissue can be boosted by escalated signaling between neural progenitors and the vasculature.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons in the cerebral cortex are generated from a hierarchically organized pool of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) distinctively characterized by the essential presence of neuronal fate-restricted intermediate progenitors (IPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laguesse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lui et al., 2011</xref>). Derived from the apical-basally polarized epithelial-like multipotent neuroepithelial (NE) or radial glial (RG) progenitors of the ventricular zone (VZ), IPs constitute a heterogeneous cell population, undergo substantial evolutionary expansion, and contribute significantly to both increased number and function of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kriegstein et al., 2006</xref>). However, IPs are believed to have limited proliferation potential and can only divide once or twice before generating excitatory neurons that migrate radially to the cortical plate (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, enhancing the transit amplification and neurogenic potential of IPs would exclusively promote neuron production, but the mechanisms that control the plasticity of IPs remain unidentified.</p><p>In contrast to the multipotent NPCs of the VZ, IPs reside distantly from the lateral ventricles and are exposed to a distinctive microenvironment in the subventricular zone (SVZ), where they contact intimately with both the basolateral surface of RGs and blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Javaherian and Kriegstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stubbs et al., 2009</xref>). In the developing cerebral cortex, vascular circulation provides key factors to support NPC growth and differentiation. Conversely, VEGF-A produced by NPCs is indispensable for angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ogunshola et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wittko-Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). The extensive communication between the vasculature and NPCs thereby permits the orchestration of angiogenesis with neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vasudevan et al., 2008</xref>). However, the molecular control responsible for NPC-blood vessel congruency is yet to be defined; it is also unclear whether the neurogenic potential of IPs may be boosted by angiogenic manipulation.</p><p>The X-linked <italic>FLNA</italic> is essential for the development of both the cerebral cortex and cardiovascular system. Females who lose a copy of <italic>FLNA</italic> present Periventricular Nodular Heterotopia (PH or PVH), a disorder that manifests as grossly normal-appearing cerebral cortex but ectopically placed nodular gray matter along the lateral ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Eksioglu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fox et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parrini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sheen et al., 2001</xref>), while males carrying germline <italic>FLNA</italic> mutations often die prenatally of severe hemorrhage and cardiovascular defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernstein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Eksioglu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reinstein et al., 2013</xref>). As <italic>FLNA</italic> encodes the 280 kDa filamin A (FLNA) that together with FLNB and FLNC constitutes a family of large actin binding proteins, PH associated with <italic>FLNA</italic> loss-of-function mutations has been thought to be caused by an X-chromosome inactivation-mediated mosaic neuronal migration arrest, which assumed cortical neurons that inherited the mutant <italic>FLNA</italic> allele lacked actin promoted cell motility. However, radiological and pathological findings in both females and a rare case of a male infant with inherited <italic>FLNA</italic> mutations showed unremarkable neocortical size and structural aberration, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ferland and Guerrini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guerrini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parrini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poussaint et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reinstein et al., 2012</xref>), implying more complex mechanisms than the actin based mechanical failure. Interestingly, analysis of postmortem brains with <italic>FLNA</italic> mutations reported microvascular anomalies in addition to PH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ferland and Guerrini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kakita et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting the tied requirement of FLNA for cerebral cortical neural and vascular development. Similar to <italic>FLNA</italic> loss-of-function in males, mice with an engineered null mutation of <italic>Flna</italic> die embryonically of widespread hemorrhage that was accompanied by aberrant cardiovascular morphogenesis and cerebral cortical angiogenesis but not by neuronal migration defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Feng et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To reveal the mechanism of <italic>FLNA</italic> in cortical development, we conditionally abrogated Flna in NPCs and developed a mouse model that highly resembles PH associated with <italic>FLNA</italic> loss-of-function in humans. We demonstrate in this study that <italic>FLNA</italic>-associated PH primarily results from the increased neurogenesis of IPs ectopically at no expense to the number and laminar organization of neocortical neurons. Our data show that Flna acts synergistically with β-arrestin and serves as a cytoplasmic break to regulate the homeostatic communication between NPCs and the cerebral vasculature, and loss of this function results in failed dampening of growth signals between NPCs and blood vessels, leading to excessive angiogenesis and sustained epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes in RGs, which altogether alter IPs’ microenvironment and increase their proliferation and neurogenesis. These findings reveal the dependence of FLNA in coordinated cerebral neurogenesis and vascularization and demonstrate the vascular impact on IPs’ neurogenic plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of filamin results in PH without affecting neocortical neurons</title><p>We assessed the role of FLNA in cortical development by conditionally abrogating filamin A (Flna) in NPCs using either <italic>Emx1</italic>-Cre or <italic>Nes</italic><bold>-</bold>Cre lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Petersen et al., 2004</xref>). As <italic>Flna</italic> conditional mutants (<italic>Flna</italic><sup>flox/y:Cre+</sup> , referred to as Flna<sup>cKO</sup>) only showed mild phenotype in neuroependyma defects (data not shown),we considered the co-expression and possible redundant function of Flna and filamin B (Flnb) in NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sheen et al., 2002</xref>), generated compound mutants of Flna<sup>cKO</sup> and <italic>Flnb</italic>, and found the abnormal presence of nodular neurons near lateral ventricles in the brain of these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). All Flna<sup>cKO</sup>; <italic>Flnb</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and approximately 20% of Flna<sup>cKO</sup>; <italic>Flnb</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice (referred to collectively as Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> hereafter unless noted specifically) showed this phenotype. The periventricular neuronal nodules (referred to as PH hereafter) were variable in size, number, and distribution but presented exclusively in both cerebral hemispheres with mixed neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We detected PH at birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and found that the occurrence of PH was spatially associated with disruption of the neuroependymal lining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Most neurons in the PH expressed <italic>Cux1</italic>, which defines late-born excitatory neurons in upper cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), whereas very few PH neurons expressed <italic>Foxp2</italic>, which marks early-born neurons in the deep cortical layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>). Despite the presence of a large number of periventricular neurons, the neocortex of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> mice was well laminated and showed no change in either thickness or the number of cortical neurons relative to that of <italic>Flna</italic><sup>flox/y:Cre-</sup>; <italic>Flnb</italic><sup>+/-</sup> littermate controls (referred to as Ctrl hereafter unless noted specifically) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H–J</xref>). These findings are all consistent with radiological and pathological reports of PH patients with <italic>FLNA</italic> mutations, and they suggest that PH caused by filamin loss is a unique condition in which additional neurons were generated at no expense of neocortical structure.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17823.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of filamin resulted in Periventricular heterotopia without affecting neocortical neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H&amp;E stained coronal brain sections from a control (<italic>Flna<sup>flox/y Emx1Cre-</sup>;Flnb<sup>+/-,</sup></italic>Ctrl) and a <italic>Flna<sup>flox/y Emx1Cre+</sup> ;Flnb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (PH) mouse at 2 month (P60).

We found significantly more neurons were born at both E14.5 and E16.5 in PH-associated columns (total number of BrdU+ neurons in the entire depth of cortical wall normalized to the length of the ventricles), whereas BrdU+ cells in cortical columns lacking PH of the same mutant brain were not different from those in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

This resulted in an overall increase in the size of the IP population along with the level of Tbr2 protein in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices at E13.5 to E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref>, PH+, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). Although increased BrdU incorporation in Tbr2+ IPs was less obvious in PH+ regions from E14.5 to E15.5 (data not shown), a 20 hr BrdU-Ki67 co-labeling analysis at this time showed that more cells quitted the cell cycle in PH+ regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). These data, combined with a reduced number and proliferation of Pax6+ RGs in the PH+ regions, collectively suggested that the formation of PH was associated with a sequential increase in the IP pool and IPs’ cell cycle exit. This local increase in both proliferation and neurogenic activities of apicalized IPs explained how periventricular neurons were produced at little expense of their neocortical counterpart.</p><p>To confirm that neurons in PH were produced by ectopic Tbr2+ IPs directly, we performed a pseudo-fate mapping experiment and crossed the Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> mice with the <italic>Tbr2</italic><sup>eGFP</sup> line in which cells expressing <italic>Tbr2</italic> are marked by GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kowalczyk et al., 2009</xref>).

When PH was initially detected as NeuN+ clusters near the ventricle at birth, we found many of the ectopic NeuN+ neurons in PH nodules also showed GFP, indicating that PH neurons were daughters of Tbr2+ IPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Although a majority of <italic>Flna<sup>Ky</sup></italic> mutants die of hemorrhage before E15, a few that survived to E15.5 showed similar phenotypes to those Flna<sup>cKO-NPC</sup>;<italic>Flnb<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and Flna<sup>cKO-NPC</sup>;<italic>Flnb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F,G</xref>), indicating Flna is the major player though it is functionally redundant with Flnb in cortical NPCs.

Furthermore, we found the sporadic RG junctional defect involved deconstruction of multiple epithelial junctional complexes beyond AJs. Loss of tight junction (TJ) protein ZO-1 and apical junction protein Pals1 in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> mutants was observed along with AJ disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>, arrows). The broad disassembly of cell-cell junction complexes led to the dissolution of the apical F-actin belt yet remained confined and made no detectable impairment in neighboring cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>, arrows). The profound defect of mutant RGs disrupted their apical-basally polarity as revealed by disorganized basal bodies and radial glial fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The RGs in the affected regions appeared to lose the apical constriction that maintains the integrity of their counterparts in the adjacent unaffected regions. Such imbalance in in apical constriction led to the invagination of regions where RGs were intact and sometimes result in the formation of rosette-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–K</xref>, arrows and asterisks). As the VZ invagination occurred in the unaffected RGs, it suggested that it was a secondary effect caused by altered structure of those adjacent defective RGs as well as the increased proliferation and neurogenesis of neighboring IPs. These results suggest that filamin is primarily essential in RGs through which it maintains the VZ-SVZ compartmentalization by assuring RGs’ polarity and apical adhesion. Loss of filamin thereby results in the mislocalization of IPs from the normal SVZ to VZ.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17823.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Loss of multiple epithelial features of filamin mutant RGs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) panCadherin (green) and BrdU (red) double immunostained cortical section of embryos fixed 30 min after a BrdU pulse at E14.5.

Despite the severe disruption of RGs in apical domains, basal radial glial fibers in the affected regions were largely intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the phenotype of loss of filamin only involves selected RGs and is confined in the apical domain. This is fundamentally different from previously reported cortical defects resulting from loss of structural maintenance by mutations of epithelial junctional molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, or RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42.

Both filamin A and filamin B are composed of an N terminal actin binding domain (ABD) followed by 24 Ig-like repeats, the last of which mediates their homo and hetero-dimerization. The C-terminal domain of filamins is also unique in mediating numerous molecular interactions with cell signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, retroviruses producing an actin binding domain deleted FLNA (FLNA-ΔABD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kainulainen et al., 2002</xref>) and the FLNA C-terminal molecular interaction domain (FLNA-C, encompassing amino acids 2168–2647) were used to interrupt FLNA’s role in actin remodeling and cell signaling, respectively. We found the EMT phenotypes of these two mutant lines were remarkably different from vector infected controls. While the FLNA-ΔABD line showed an enhanced response to TGFβ in losing epithelial morphology, reducing junctional β-catenin, and transforming into fibroblast-like cells that produce higher levels of Fibronectin (FN) and HA, the FLNA-C cells showed impeded EMT with persistent epithelial morphology and decreased FN production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). These results not only indicate that FLNA is an EMT regulator and likely plays a role in integrating EMT inducing signals with actin remodeling but also suggest that <italic>FLNA</italic> mutations could lead to aberrant EMT in epithelial cells of multiple tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The association of PH-genesis with increased angiogenesis</title><p>Despite the direct involvement of filamin in EMT, the EMT-like phenotype in RGs of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> embryos was sporadic. This suggested the essential contribution of a non-cell autonomous factor to sustain EMT promoting changes in the mutant RGs. We therefore looked for other phenotypes in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices and found that the sporadic RG and IP defects coincided with altered angiogenesis. During cortical development, blood vessels and NPCs develop congruently and vasculogenesis not only occurs in parallel to neurogenesis but also is tightly associated with the proliferative activity of IPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Javaherian and Kriegstein, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stubbs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vasudevan and Bhide, 2008</xref>). Additional to previous reports, we found angiogenesis sprouting from pial arteries to ventricles preceded IP generation and proliferation. While blood vessels penetrated to the VZ by E12.5, they remained largely segregated from the IPs. By E13.5 to E14.5 both blood vessels and IPs showed a substantial increase in abundance, and IPs started to intermingle with blood vessels and divide more robustly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). At this stage blood vessels in the cortical VZ of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> embryos were shown to be irregular in terms of abundance, distribution and structure compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Quantitative analysis of vessel density indicated an overall increase in the vascular bed of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Although vascular endothelium cells (ECs) were intact and pericyte coverage was detectable, nascent vessels in the mutant were grossly coarse with larger caliber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). While blood vessels in control cortices form a plexus in the CP and SVZ, many vessels in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices sprouted deeply to the periventricular space where they coincided with destructed RG adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B, H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,C</xref>).

IGF2 is known to be the major growth factor provided by the embryonic circulatory system, and was found at a high level in the PH-associated periventricular blood vessels of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). As IGF2 signals through IGF1R, a receptor tyrosine kinase, we examined Igf1r and its phosphorylation in cortical tissue. Although changes in the level of Igf1r were subtle, its tyrosine phosphorylation was increased significantly in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>), supporting the notion that the stronger Erk activation and excessive angiogenesis in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices resulted from increased Igf2 signaling. The persistent Igf1r activation also suggested a role of filamin in attenuating Igf2 signaling, and loss of this function resulted in stronger Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk activation and <italic>Vegfa</italic> expression in NPCs. Therefore, the higher Igf2 signals in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices can further increase the vascular permeability via elevated Vegfa, forming a positive feedback loop that escalates Igf2 release and its constitutive signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Both increased Igf1R and Erk signaling are known to induce EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gonzalez and Medici, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindsey and Langhans, 2014</xref>). Therefore, failed dampening of their signals exacerbates the EMT-like and vascular phenotypes in all-or-none coincidence in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices.</p><p>FLNA is a multifaceted molecule with tissue context-dependent functions mediated through its molecular interactions. Out of numerous FLNA interacting proteins reported previously, β-arrestin plays an important role in both desensitizing IGF1R and controlling ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Girnita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kovacs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). β-arrestin is highly enriched in the developing cerebral cortex. To determine whether failed attenuation of mitogenic signals in Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> RGs was due to an impaired β-arrestin function, we examined the Flna-β-arrestin interaction in embryonic cortical tissue by co-immunoprecipitation. Not only was β-arrestin detected in Flna immunoprecipitates, we also showed that Flna was specifically co-precipitated with immunoprecipitated β-arrestin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>), indicating Flna is a partner of β-arrestin in cortical NPCs. Therefore, our data together suggest that the interaction and corroboration of filamin and β-arrestin play an essential role in dampening the excessive Igf2 signals and maintaining a homeostatic communication between NPCs and blood vessels in the developing cerebral cortex. Loss of filamin impairs β-arrestin’s role in down-regulating Igf2-Igfr signaling, which augments both vascular and NPC growth and activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, data from this study demonstrate that the neurogenic potential of cortical IPs can be enhanced by microenvironmental alterations in the filamin mutant cerebrum. Factors contributing non-cell-autonomously to the net gain of ectopic neurons produced by IPs include ECM changes from an EMT-like event as well as increased local angiogenesis and vascular activity. Our data indicate that the essential requirement of Flna in cerebral cortical development is to assure the homeostatic interaction among RGs, IPs, and nascent vasculature. By interacting with β-arrestin, Flna blocks the excessive communication between blood vessels and NPCs through attenuating growth signals. Therefore, loss of Flna results in constitutive activation of Igf1R to Erk signaling and increased production of Vegfa, which exacerbate both NPC and angiogenic responses in an escalating manner and cumulate to sustained EMT of RGs. These together resulted in altered niche of IPs and boosted their neurogenesis at locations where RG and vascular changes were irreversible.</p><p>One of the most surprising results of this study is that we did not detect compromised production and migration of neurons destined for the neocortex despite the remarkable destruction to the VZ and SVZ after E14.5 in PH-forming Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> cortices. The lack of impairment of neocortical neurons with the presence of PH is in line with a recent finding from a fate mapping study which suggests that NPCs destined to generate neurons in upper cortical layers become fate restricted in early corticogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Franco et al., 2012</xref>). It is also likely that RGs stop making cortical neurons directly after E13.5 so that the integrity of the apical compartment of the cortical VZ and the apical RG-RG junctions become dispensable for the generation and migration of neocortical neurons, and the bulk of neurons that migrate into the CP after E13.5 were from basally localized IPs. Overall, our findings support the notion that the neurogenic potential of NPCs can be manipulated and enhanced in vivo and there is likely a surplus of IP population that remains sensitive to microenvironmental inputs and is responsible for generating periventricular neurons in filamin mutants. It is especially appealing that the surplus NPCs and their neurogenic plasticity in the cerebrum of Fln<sup>cKO-NPC</sup> mice occur at the level of IPs, since IPs are neuronal fate-restricted progenitors that only give rise to cortical neurons. The size and diversity of the IP pool increase with the neocortical evolution. IPs are believed to be responsible for the generation of the majority of the cortical projection/excitatory neurons and play an ongoing role in postnatal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hodge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kowalczyk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, factors that may alter the plasticity of IPs would specifically and directly boost neuron production. Identifying these factors may open a portal for inducing the specific generation of neurons in cerebral tissue without affecting cells of the other lineages. This could potentially increase the likelihood of neural stem/progenitor cell mediated therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proliferation and neurogenic plasticity of IPs is highly sensitive to local tissue context, which includes ECM composition and blood supply. Increased crosstalk among vascular ECs, RGs and IPs appears essential for a positive reinforcement that creates a favorable microenvironment for IPs’ transient amplification and neurogenesis. One of the ways to establish such a microenvironment may be through blocking FLNA and its associated molecules’ specific function in dampening the growth signaling in NPCs and their neighboring cells, since this could both augment the impact of growth factors from the blood circulation and potentiate EMT-like changes to alter the local ECM and cytomechanical properties. As a fundamental and multistep process for tissue morphogenesis, EMT involves the synergistic action of a hierarchical molecular network and is estimated to alter the expression of over a thousand genes. The ECM molecules produced by the resulting mesenchymal-like cells can create a brand-new microenvironment for both NPCs and ECs. Although PH represents an abnormal condition of increased IP neurogenesis, further defining the molecular signature of the periventricular niche responsible for increased neurogenesis in the FLNA mutant brain may provide key insights into the cell molecular tools required for boosting the neurogenic potential of IPs in cerebral tissue.</p><p>Although FLNA is best known as an actin binding protein, our result challenges its simple mechanical function but instead highlights a novel mechanism in maintaining tissue homeostasis by acting as a cell signaling modulator. During cortical development, FLNA ensures proper neurovascular congruency by regulating bi-directional signaling and intercellular interaction between NPCs and vascular cells. Through collaborating with β-arrestin, FLNA serves as a cytoplasmic molecular break to attenuate the excessive growth signals and maintain the homeostasis at both cell and tissue levels. While our study reveals escalated Vegfa and Igf2 activities, imbalances in many other molecules and pathways could also be involved in promoting the NPC and vascular phenotypes in filamin deficient cortices. Besides Igf1R, β-arrestin can mediate the turnover and desensitization of many plasma membrane receptors through clathrin mediated endocytosis or by recruiting ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). FLNA has also been reported to interact with numerous membrane receptors and cell signaling adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Feng and Walsh, 2004</xref>). The extraordinarily diverse array of molecular dynamics governed by neurovascular communication and EMT-like change of filamin mutant RGs, in fact, suggest that loss of filamin results in a complex alteration in the interplay of multiple cell types and molecules, which would be extremely interesting to elucidate in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p><italic>Flna</italic> knockout (<italic>Flna</italic><sup>K/w</sup> or <italic>Flna</italic><sup>K/y</sup>), floxed (<italic>Flna</italic><sup>flox/y</sup> or Flna<sup>cKO</sup>) and <italic>Flnb</italic> knockout (<italic>Flnb<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2007</xref>).

After sequence confirmation, the mycFLNA-C was released from the TA clone by restriction digestion with Sal I and Not I, then sub-cloned into pBabe-Puro between Bam HI and Sal I with a Not I-BamH1 linker. The pBabe-myc FLNA-ΔABD was constructed in two steps: An EcoR1 – Xba I fragment of the C-terminal end of the pcDNA3-FLNA-ΔABD cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kainulainen et al., 2002</xref>) was first cloned into pBabe-Puro between EcoR I and Sal I using an Xba I-Sal I linker.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Marianne Bronner, and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alex Kuan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes how filamin abrogation induces a phenotype reminiscent of that found in a human disorder present in females that lose one copy of the X-linked Filamin A gene. The phenotype includes periventricular ectopic neuronal nodules. As in the human condition, the development and structure of the cortex is normal, indicating that the presence of ectopic neurons in those nodules is not the result of defective migration.</p><p>This is a nicely done study that provides a good model for the human disorder. It would be useful if the authors could provide a deeper understanding of the endogenous role of filamin or the pathological mechanism that initiates the defects. Open questions that would be worth addressing include: (i) insights into the mechanism that initiates this ectopic growth, (ii) explanations of why the phenotype develops so late in development and importantly, (iii) given that the loss of filamin is achieved by the use a filamin floxed alleles using Emx and Nes Cre driver lines, why the ectopic nodules are sporadic.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The expression pattern of filamin A and filamin B in mouse embryos, at E12 and E14-15 must be shown.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> showed convincing induction of VEGFa in the mutant embryonic cortex by immunoblot, but it did not provide spatial information. The author may consider using in-situ hybridization against VEGFa to test whether increased mRNAs coincide with the periventricular nodules.</p><p>3) Despite homogenous gene deletion, why is periventricular neurogenesis and ectopia a sporadic event rather than continuous? Secondly, why do these extra neurons apparently not engage in upward radial migration to disrupt the cortical lamination? Is that because of the disruption of local radial glial scaffold? Is that part of the ectopic EMT consequence? These issues should be discussed.</p><p>4) Rather than using the term &quot;extraneous&quot; (irrelevant?) cerebral neurogenesis in the title and throughout the manuscript, the authors should consider using a less colorful term, such as &quot;ectopic periventricular&quot; neurogenesis?</p><p>5) The statement that Tbr2-GFP analysis demonstrates that PH neurons are daughters of Tbr2+ IPs is not correct. Tbr2 is also transiently expressed in neurons born from RGCs. Furthermore, the BrdU analysis presented is not demonstrative that ectopic neurons are derived from IPs. Cell cycle exit analysis does not distinguish IPs from RGCs. In fact, ectopic neurons may come from RGCs, which are also ectopic. Expression analysis shows that the primary effect of filamin loss is an increase in EMT behavior of RGCs (E13/E14) rather than in IPs.</p><p>6) IPs exist in mouse cortex since E11. Therefore, if the PH phenotype is due to defects in IPs why it is only evident at E14 and only affects upper layer neurons? If the loss of filamin is initiated at later stages, would this lead to the same phenotype? This can be tested using another Cre line or by an electroporation of Cre construct.</p><p>7) IPs and Ns appear in VZ simultaneously, and alterations also involve VZ, such that the entire VZ + SVZ bend coherently toward ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, G</xref>).

Are defects in vasculogenesis also simultaneous, or they appear after ectopia is initiated?</p><p>8) The description of the phenotype as an activation of EMT is unnecessary. The affected cells are not epithelial nor are they converted into mesenchymal cells. It is clear that Snail (and Twist) are activated and repress components of cell adhesion complexes, but this does not mean that this is an EMT process.</p><p>9) Along the same lines, the authors mention that &quot;loss of epithelial characteristics of RGCs represents a transition in their identity&quot;.

What is the mechanism of Snail/Twist activation upon filamin loss? Is filamin a Snail repressor?</p><p>11) Why IPs go to VZ, instead of moving further basal? Is there any attractive cue or a particularly favorable microenvironment for them to go/stay at the VZ?</p><p>12) Why the rosette phenotype leads to PH rather than subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) as in other mutant models? What is the mechanism of rosette formation? The authors suggest that this may be through a reduced stiffness of the VZ but it is not clear how this has been measured.

We showed that Flna and Flnb were co-expressed in NPCs throughout the course of cortical development and were able to form a heterodimer. Citation of this reference is now included to support the functional redundancy of filamin A and filamin B in cortical NPCs.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> showed convincing induction of VEGFa in the mutant embryonic cortex by immunoblot, but it did not provide spatial information. The author may consider using in-situ hybridization against VEGFa to test whether increased mRNAs coincide with the periventricular nodules.</italic> </p><p>We followed this excellent suggestion, combined in situ hybridization with IHC analyses, and now present evidence for the specific association of increased Vegfa mRNA with loss of RG adhesion and periventricular angiogenesis (which are the two pivotal events that lead to PH) in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. Vegfa mRNA signals faded a little during the subsequent immunostain, but the information should be very clear.</p><p><italic>3) Despite homogenous gene deletion, why is periventricular neurogenesis and ectopia a sporadic event rather than continuous? Secondly, why do these extra neurons apparently not engage in upward radial migration to disrupt the cortical lamination? Is that because of the disruption of local radial glial scaffold? Is that part of the ectopic EMT consequence? These issues should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>The sporadic nature of periventricular neurogenesis is due to the essential vascular contribution and determined by the location of abnormal blood vessels that are not distributed continuously. As neurons in PH were generated as a surplus, they did not belong to the neocortex and might not have the correct cues or scaffold for upward migration. Additionally, RG defects only affected the apical VZ and did not appear to disrupt the bulk of basal RG fibers to disturb the normal neuronal migration as demonstrated in the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. While the EMT-like changes lead to substantial alteration in cell’s structure and biochemical context, it was a confined local event in the apical VZ, which may not affect those IPs that were already fate-restricted to generate neocortical neurons before E13.5. We appreciate these questions and added the possible early fate-restriction of late-born cortical neurons to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>4) Rather than using the term &quot;extraneous&quot; (irrelevant?) cerebral neurogenesis in the title and throughout the manuscript, the authors should consider using a less colorful term, such as &quot;ectopic periventricular&quot; neurogenesis?</italic> </p><p>We originally used the term “extraneous” and meant to indicate “additional” or “extra” generation of neurons. Thanks for the correction. But we are not sure if “ectopic” is precise either, as it only indicates the location but not the amount. To avoid confusion we chose “surplus” in the revised title. We also revised the text to indicate that there is a net gain of neurons. Please advise if this is still unclear.</p><p><italic>5) The statement that Tbr2-GFP analysis demonstrates that PH neurons are daughters of Tbr2+ IPs is not correct. Tbr2 is also transiently expressed in neurons born from RGCs. Furthermore, the BrdU analysis presented is not demonstrative that ectopic neurons are derived from IPs. Cell cycle exit analysis does not distinguish IPs from RGCs. In fact, ectopic neurons may come from RGCs, which are also ectopic. Expression analysis shows that the primary effect of filamin loss is an increase in EMT behavior of RGCs (E13/E14) rather than in IPs.</italic> </p><p>We fully agree that Tbr2 is not expressed exclusively by IPs and it is necessary to clarify how the periventricular neurons were not generated from abnormal RGCs directly. In the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, we now include data to show that in the affected (PH<sup>+</sup>) cortical columns, RGs (marked by Pax6) were very scarce and showed little proliferation activity (BrdU and phospho-Histone H3 Ser10). Therefore, the ectopic neurons were unlikely produced by the defective RGs, and the BrdU labeling and cell cycle exit activities in PH<sup>+</sup> regions were largely from aplicalized IPs. Although the mutant RGs showed changes resembling abnormal EMT, it did not appear to make them divide more. In fact, the contribution of EMT to cancer stem cell and metastasis is currently controversial, and cells that underwent EMT (mutant RGs and MDCK cells following TGFbeta treatment) showed reduced proliferation in our observations.</p><p><italic>6) IPs exist in mouse cortex since E11. Therefore, if the PH phenotype is due to defects in IPs why it is only evident at E14 and only affects upper layer neurons? If the loss of filamin is initiated at later stages, would this lead to the same phenotype? This can be tested using another Cre line or by an electroporation of Cre construct.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this excellent question and performed additional experiments to clarify this issue. IPs exist since E11, but only come into close contact with the blood vessels (which our evidence indicates is needed to induce PH) after E12.5-E13.5 as shown by the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. We hope this new figure answers the question and strengthens our finding of the vascular contribution to PH-genesis. We also added data to show that abrogating Flna in later development by GFAP-Cre (with onset of Cre expression at E13.5) can also induce PH, which supports our conclusion that the phenotype originates from NPCs/RGs but relies on the positive feedback between abnormal RGs and blood vessels.</p><p><italic>7) IPs and Ns appear in VZ simultaneously, and alterations also involve VZ, such that the entire VZ + SVZ bend coherently toward ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, G</xref>). Which is the primary defect? What triggers the onset? Are defects in vasculogenesis also simultaneous, or they appear after ectopia is initiated?</italic> </p><p>As the conditional knockout occurs in NPCs, the cell autonomous NPC/RG defect should be the primary one, however, it relies on the non-cell autonomous vascular trigger and amplification, which forms a positive feedback loop as illustrated in the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>: The loop is initiated by the failure of down-regulating the vascular signals from the mutant RGs, then results in a local change in IPs’ localization and microenvironment. We made text revisions to state this positive feedback more clearly.</p><p><italic>8) The description of the phenotype as an activation of EMT is unnecessary. The affected cells are not epithelial nor are they converted into mesenchymal cells. It is clear that Snail (and Twist) are activated and repress components of cell adhesion complexes, but this does not mean that this is an EMT process.</italic> </p><p>We have revised “EMT” to “EMT-like” for the following reasons: 1) derived from neuroepithelial, RGs retain many key features of epithelial cells such as polarity and adhesion; 2) what occurred to the mutant RGs were not only loss of adhesion and Snail/Twist expression but also increased mesenchymal ECM (HA and FN), which fulfills the definition of EMT; 3) the MDCK model demonstrates that functional deficiency of <italic>FLNA</italic> increases EMT. We hope this revision is acceptable.</p><p>We feel the EMT-like phenotype is essential for PH as it could cause a fundamental change in the local ECM (besides FN and HA) and contribute significantly to the microenvironment alteration in addition to vascular cues. Please also see the response to point 9.</p><p><italic>9) Along the same lines, the authors mention that &quot;loss of epithelial characteristics of RGCs represents a transition in their identity&quot;. Even considering that this is the case, it is not clear to which identity the cells would transition to. Is AJ loss secondary to IP + neuron intrusions into the ventricle?</italic> </p><p>The neurogenesis of IPs should be secondary to RG defects, which we think resemble EMT-like changes. These RG defects include loss of normal adhesion, polarity, and Pax6 expression but increase in the expression of Snail, Twist, FN, and HA. These mutant RGs were clearly different from normal RGs, which made us believe they went through a transition in identity. While it would be interesting to further delineate the full cell molecular characters of these defective RGs in future studies, it is clear that they could no longer maintain the VZ and SVZ compartmentation, which resulted in the abnormal localization, proliferation, and neurogenesis of IPs near the ventricle.</p><p><italic>10) Given that the loss of filamin is a pathological condition, what is the endogenous role of filamin? What is the mechanism of Snail/Twist activation upon filamin loss? Is filamin a Snail repressor?</italic> </p><p>We appreciate these questions and stated more clearly that the physiological function of filamin/<italic>FLNA</italic> is acting as a molecular break to prevent excessive signals between NPCs and the developing vasculature in order to maintain homeostasis at tissue level. Since there is so far no evidence on the direct role of filamin in transcription regulation, we believe elevated Snail/Twist reflected abnormal signal transduction and sustained EMT-like events of the mutant RGs.</p><p><italic>11) Why IPs go to VZ, instead of moving further basal? Is there any attractive cue or a particularly favorable microenvironment for them to go/stay at the VZ?</italic> </p><p>We believe the mislocalization of IPs from SVZ to VZ was secondary to RG defects. Mild adhesion defect of RGs were also observed (in a low frequency) in some Flna<sub>cKO</sub>Flnb<sub>WT</sub> embryos where IP mislocalization was not obvious. However, the variable localization of IPs and sporadic nature of the phenotype made it difficult to analyze this mutant quantitatively. In contrast, the mislocalization of IP was found to coincide with RG defects exclusively. This suggests that RGs are essential for the proper SVZ localization of IPs. Since the RG defect in the filamin mutant is not purely “structural,” it is possible that the IPs were also trapped to the periventricular space biochemically by altered ECM and vascular cues as discussed in response to points 8 and 9.</p><p><italic>12) Why the rosette phenotype leads to PH rather than subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) as in other mutant models? What is the mechanism of rosette formation? The authors suggest that this may be through a reduced stiffness of the VZ but it is not clear how this has been measured. What type of cell behavior would give rise to these rosettes?</italic> </p><p>Our data suggest that the rosette-like structure in filamin mutants was due to EMT-like defects instead of a simple loss of cell adhesion, morphology or scaffold function of the mutant RGs. These RGs were no longer Pax6+ but instead provided altered ECM, changed vascular cues, and promoted extra local IP proliferation and neuron production, which may together physically push the adjacent unaffected RGs and lead to their invagination or rosette formation. Therefore, the formation of rosette is the by-product but not the prerequisite for PH, it did not interfere with neocortical neuronal migration and thus was different from the neuronal migration arrest that results in SBH. In theory, the formation of epithelial rosette is largely driven by increased acto- myosin-dependent apical constriction and changes in epithelial morphology in normal morphogenesis. But here we face a situation in which the rosettes formed around relatively normal RGs due to defects in their neighboring cells that lost apical constriction. We agree that it was somewhat speculative to talk about the tissue stiffness since we did not measure it. To address this extremely helpful critique, we made text revision to present more clear and objective conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
