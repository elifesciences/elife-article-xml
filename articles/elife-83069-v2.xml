inflammation in OA synovitis remains unclear. The present study found that synovial macrophages infiltrated and polarized in the obesity microenvironment and identified the essential role of M1 macrophages in impaired macrophage efferocytosis using pathology analysis of obesity-associated OA. The present study revealed that obese OA patients and <italic>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice showed a more pronounced synovitis and enhanced macrophage infiltration in synovial tissue, accompanied by dominant M1 macrophage polarization. Obese OA mice had a more severe cartilage destruction and increased levels of synovial apoptotic cells (ACs) than OA mice in the control group. Enhanced M1-polarized macrophages in obese synovium decreased growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6) secretion, resulting in impaired macrophage efferocytosis in synovial ACs. Intracellular contents released by accumulated ACs further triggered an immune response and lead to a release of inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which induce chondrocyte homeostasis dysfunction in obese OA patients. Intra-articular injection of GAS6 restored the phagocytic capacity of macrophages, reduced the accumulation of local ACs, and decreased the levels of TUNEL and Caspase-3 positive cells, preserving cartilage thickness and preventing the progression of obesity-associated OA. Therefore, targeting macrophage-associated efferocytosis or intra-articular injection of GAS6 is a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated OA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>efferocytosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81902229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Haiyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81871745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Anling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003453</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020A1515011062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Haiyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Down-regulation of GAS6 by M1 macrophages resulted in impaired efferocytosis for synovial apoptotic cells, causing synovial hyperplasia and obesity-associated OA development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common, chronic, degenerative joint disease and a significant cause of joint pain and even disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunter and Bierma-Zeinstra, 2019</xref>). Epidemiological investigations have documented that obesity is one of the significant risk factors for OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martel-Pelletier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Teichtahl et al., 2015</xref>). A meta-analysis of joint replacements in obese patients in 2010 has shown that the risk of knee OA was five times higher in obese patients than in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clement and Deehan, 2020</xref>). At the same time, being ‘overweight’ (i.e., obesity) doubled the proportion of joint replacement treatments required later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franklin et al., 2009</xref>). At present, the incidence of obesity continues to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Caballero, 2019</xref>). It is estimated that by 2025, the global incidence of obesity will reach 18% in men and 21% in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, 2016</xref>). Thus, elucidating the mechanisms by which obesity promotes OA development is essential for OA prevention and treatment.</p><p>It was initially believed that obesity affects OA by changing certain mechanical factors. However, the progression of OA continues in non-weight-bearing areas, even after the line of the force is corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yusuf et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, these obesity-related mechanical factors cannot be justified in the development of OA in non-weight-bearing joints such as the hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pottie et al., 2006</xref>). Scientists have paid specific attention to the effects and roles of various pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines in obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neumann et al., 2016</xref>). Clinical data have confirmed that obese OA patients are often associated with severe chronic synovitis, which plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and progression of OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sellam and Berenbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mathiessen and Conaghan, 2017</xref>). Our previous findings have indicated that synovial macrophage polarization is significantly correlated with synovitis in OA progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daghestani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). When synovitis occurs, macrophages are stimulated by various cytokines and consequently release inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). At the same time, excess energy caused by obesity leads to changes in various cell functions, including angiogenesis and inflammatory cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collins et al., 2021</xref>). However, the effect of obesity on synovial hyperplasia and macrophage polarization in OA development has not been reported yet. We speculate that changes in tissues and organs caused by obesity may also affect synovitis, which in turn affects the process of OA.</p><p>GAS6 is a secreted glycoprotein widely expressed throughout the body. It is well known for its vital role in bridging phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells (ACs) with its receptors Tyro3, Axl, and Mer, triggering the engulfment of ACs in an inflammatory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellan et al., 2019</xref>). This macrophage-related phagocytic process is also known as ‘efferocytosis’, which is beneficial for resolving inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doran et al., 2020</xref>). Prior studies have shown that impaired efferocytosis weakens the ability to clear ACs, inducing the release of inflammatory factors and ultimately causing synovitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nepal et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, obesity-related macrophage polarization and the effect of obesity on efferocytosis remain unclear.</p><p>The present study found that obese OA patients and obese <italic>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are more prone to M1 macrophage infiltration in synovial tissue. Obese OA mice had more severe cartilage destruction and increased synovial ACs than OA mice in the control group. Down-regulation of GAS6 by M1 macrophages resulted in impaired efferocytosis for synovial ACs, causing synovial hyperplasia and obesity-associated OA development. These data suggested that targeting macrophage phagocytosis and polarization in obese patients with OA may be a potential therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synovial tissues are highly hyperplastic in obese OA patients and infiltrated with more polarized M1 macrophages than non-obese OA patients</title><p>To investigate the role of obesity in synovial tissue in OA patients, levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and body mass index were examined in different patients.

GAS6, a member of the vitamin K-dependent protein family, has been previously found to be down-regulated in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) compared to the controls (GSE53986, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noubade et al., 2014</xref>). GAS6 was investigated as a critical factor regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis by binding to its receptor Axl. The GAS6/Axl effects on OA remain unclear. The present study explored the association between synovial macrophage polarization types and the GAS6/Axl pathway in obesity-associated OA. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining analysis indicated that macrophage release of GAS6 expressed in both human and mouse normal synovial tissues tended to be diminished, especially in obesity-associated OA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed a significant decrease in GAS6 levels in the synovial fluid from obese OA patients than in non-obese individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Previous studies have shown that efferocytosis of ACs induced by macrophages is impaired in inflammatory diseases. Still, its role in obesity-associated OA and understanding of its mechanism are lacking. In addition, GAS6 has been described as a crucial bridging protein for macrophages to recognize and engulf ACs. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the high percentage of observed ACs might be due to ineffective macrophage efferocytosis caused by GAS6 suppression in OA. Primary BMDMs from <italic>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice and controls were fed carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled ACs to determine the potency of efferocytosis induced by macrophages.

Moreover, stimulation with GAS6 enhanced the phagocytotic activity of RAW264.7 cells, while inhibition of the Axl receptor by adding R428 diminished this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–K</xref>), which were further verified in BMDM primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Nevertheless, rmGAS6 had no obvious effect on the polarization of macrophages, while R428 up-regulated CD86 and iNOS in BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Interestingly, intra-articular injection of GAS6 significantly delayed synovial inflammation and cartilage destruction compared to vehicle-treated obese OA mice, manifested as lower synovitis and OARSI scores. In contrast, inhibition of Axl by R428 in C57BL/6 OA mice promoted synovial hyperplasia and cartilage destruction and enhanced synovitis and OARSI scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>).

To further explore the effect of inflammatory factors released by the stimulation of ACs on chondrocyte homeostasis dysfunction, ACs were co-cultured with BMDMs. The culture supernatant was collected after stimulation for 24 hr. The expression of MMP13 was increased after adding co-culture supernatant stimulation, together with senescence hallmarks such as p16 and p21, while COL2 were down-regulated after stimulation. However, the effect of supernatant promoting chondrocyte homeostasis dysfunction was partially alleviated when adding ACs with rmGAS6 to BMDMs, which were diminished by adding R428 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5s1sdata1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>).

The intracellular contents released by accumulated ACs further trigger an immune response and lead to a release of inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which induce the dysfunction of chondrocyte homeostasis in obesity-associated OA. Therefore, targeting macrophage-associated efferocytosis or intra-articular injection of GAS6 is a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated OA.</p><p>Obesity has always been considered a significant risk factor in the progression of OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kulkarni et al., 2016</xref>), leading to more severe OA manifestations, including cartilage loss, subchondral bone sclerosis, and synovial inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang and He, 2018</xref>). Researchers have accepted the role of synovial inflammation in the pathological progression of OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mathiessen and Conaghan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Felson et al., 2016</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism of obesity-related inflammation in the development of synovitis in OA remains unclear. <italic>Apoe</italic> plays an important role in maintaining the normal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in serum by transporting lipids in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hatters et al., 2006</xref>). Mice lacking <italic>Apoe</italic> function develop hypercholesterolemia, increased very low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein, leading chronic inflammation in vascular disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice may partially reflect clinical characteristics of obese OA patients with elevated plasma LDL cholesterol levels. The present study revealed that obese patients and <italic>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice showed a more severe cartilage destruction with enhanced OARSI scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glasson et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the lining layer of synovial tissue was more prone to hyperplasia. The number of macrophages increased significantly during the pathological development of OA in obese patients, which manifested as enhanced synovitis scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krenn et al., 2006</xref>) and increased numbers of F4/80-positive cells. These results suggest that obesity plays an essential mediating role in OA development.</p><p>Recent studies have reported that the imbalance in M1/M2 macrophage polarization plays a vital role in developing OA inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Classically, macrophages are divided into inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, though they can be interchanged or transformed into each other during various inflammatory reactions and thus function differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funes et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lumeng et al., 2007</xref> have found that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) prefer to express TNF-α, iNOS, and other M1 macrophage markers, while ATMs in non-obese individuals highly express M2 macrophage markers. However, the effect of obesity on inducing macrophage polarization during OA development remains unclear. Many bursas and adipose tissue around the knee joint are typically characterized as the infrapatellar fat pad. Some researchers believe that the transformation of macrophages is triggered by lipids released by fat cells at the onset of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether macrophage abnormalities in obesity-related knee OA affect the synovial membrane in the knee joint. We found that M1 macrophage infiltration increased in the OA synovial tissue of obese patients and <italic>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice compared to non-obese patients and C57BL/6 mice, accompanied by increased secretion of TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6. These results suggest that obesity may be a crucial factor affecting the functional status of macrophages, and targeting the polarization of macrophages in obese patients may alleviate the synovitis in OA.</p><p>The balance of progression and regression that controls the state of local inflammation has recently been in the spotlight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oishi and Manabe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feehan and Gilroy, 2019</xref>). The maintenance of efferocytosis dampens pro-inflammatory cytokine production and initiates inflammation resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boada-Romero et al., 2020</xref>). Emerging studies have mentioned the effect of macrophage polarization on phagocytic ability. Yurdagul et al. have shown that M2 macrophages retain efferocytosis properties, which are crucial for resolving inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yurdagul et al., 2020</xref>). Another study demonstrated that DEL-1 contributes to the resolution of inflammation by promoting apoptotic neutrophil efferocytosis through macrophages and the emergence of an M2 macrophage phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kourtzelis et al., 2019</xref>). Although efferocytosis has been widely studied in multiple disease models, its role in synovial inflammation and OA development has not been reported. We found that the expression of MER decreased significantly in OA synovial macrophages, especially in obesity-associated OA. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that macrophages extracted from the bone marrow of obese mice had decreased phagocytic capacity, and the phagocytic ability of macrophages for apoptotic thymocytes was reduced after stimulation with LPS (500 ng/ml). These results showed that the proportion of ACs was significantly increased in the synovium of <italic>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. This is partly due to the decreased phagocytic ability caused by the enhanced M1 macrophage polarization. We have further revealed that macrophages stimulated by ACs leading chondrocytes homeostasis dysfunction, yet administration of rmGAS6 partially alleviated the up-regulation of p16, p21, and MMP13. Intra-articular injection of GAS6 restored the phagocytic capacity of macrophages. It reduced the accumulation of local ACs and decreased the levels of TUNEL and caspase-3-positive cells, preserving cartilage thickness and preventing the progression of obesity-associated OA. These findings suggest that targeting the efferocytosis of macrophages in local inflammation of obesity-associated synovitis may maintain the homeostasis of the cartilage cavity and alleviate the obesity-related OA.</p><p>GAS6 and its receptor Axl are known to regulate apoptotic-related inflammation and may be implicated in lupus pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhen et al., 2018</xref>). The remaining ACs are a source of autoantigens and can drive autoimmunity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Szondy et al., 2014</xref>). The expression of GAS6 in the hyperplasia synovial tissues from obesity-associated OA in the present study was down-regulated and accompanied by an increase in M1 macrophage polarization. Moreover, the in vitro experiments demonstrated a decreased secretion of GAS6 protein and impaired phagocytic ability in macrophages after LPS stimulation. However, the proportion of macrophages that engulfed ACs was increased after incubation with recombinant GAS6 protein, while the phagocytic ability was significantly down-regulated after blocking the Axl receptor by adding R428. Exogenous cultured rmGAS6 with macrophages after stimulation of LPS can also decrease the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the expression of its specific receptor Axl, which may be explained by the fact that GAS6 has three receptors (Axl, Mer, and Tyro3) with different affinities. These findings suggest that GAS6 may relieve local synovial inflammation by restoring the phagocytic ability of macrophages for ACs and decrease the induction of inflammatory chemokines, which alleviate the pathological progression of OA.</p><p>To conclude, the present study found that obese OA patients and <italic>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup></italic> obese mice showed a more pronounced synovitis and enhanced macrophage infiltration in synovial tissue, accompanied by dominant M1 macrophage polarization. Obese OA mice had more severe cartilage destruction than OA mice in the control group. Enhanced M1-polarized macrophages in obese synovium decreased GAS6 secretion, impairing efferocytosis for synovial ACs and causing synovial hyperplasia and obesity-associated OA development. Therefore, these findings reveal that targeting GAS6-mediated macrophage polarization and phagocytosis in obese patients with OA may be a potential therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

A nine-point scale was used, where low scores indicated moderate synovitis and high scores represented severe synovitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krenn et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>TUNEL</title><p>The TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TUNEL Apoptosis Detection Kit [Alexa Fluor 488], Yeasen, #40307ES20) to detect cell death in the synovial membrane. The assay used the green channel at 488 nm. DAPI was applied as a nuclear counterstain in the blue channel at 461 nm. Images were taken with an <italic>Olympus BX43</italic> fluorescent microscope and <italic>Olympus DP73</italic> digital camera at ×400 magnification with cellSens software (Olympus). Exposure settings were adjusted to minimize oversaturation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Apoptosis induction and thymocyte IF staining</title><p>Murine thymocytes were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and then stimulated with 25 μmol/l dexamethasones for 3 hr to induce apoptosis, followed by washing twice and resuspension with phagocyte culture medium to a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. Then, thymocytes were labeled with CFSE dye following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Efferocytosis assay</title><p>An efferocytosis assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heo et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, RAW264.7 or BMDM cells were plated in a 6-well plate (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured overnight. RAW264.7 cell line was purchased from Pricell Life Science &amp; Technology. The cells were authenticated by STR profiling and were not contaminated by mycoplasma. The cells were then treated with LPS, rmGAS6, or R428 for 24 or 48 hr. CFSE‐labeled apoptotic thymocytes were then added at a ratio of 10:1 and incubated for an additional 120 min. The cells were extensively washed three times with PBS to remove unengulfed thymocytes. The ability of macrophages to engulf apoptotic thymocytes was quantified by flow cytometry or visualized using IF microscopy. The efferocytotic index was calculated using the following formula: (number of macrophages containing apoptotic bodies)/(total macrophages) × 100% and then normalized using the control group as 100%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Real‐time polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from RAW264.7 cells and ground cartilage from human tibial plateaus using TRIzol reagent. For mRNA quantification, 1 mg of total RNA was purified with gDNA remover and reverse transcribed using 5× HiScript II qRT SuperMix II. Each PCR reaction consisted of 10 µl of 2× ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix, 10 µM of forward and reverse primers, and 500 ng of cDNA. For miRNA quantification, 1 mg of total RNA was purified with gDNA wiper mix and then reverse transcribed using Hiscript II Enzyme Mix, 10× RT Mix, and specific stem-loop primers. Template DNA was mixed with 2× miRNA Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix, specific primers, and mQ primer R. All reactions were run in triplicate. Mouse primer sequences are listed in the Key Resources Table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</title><p>Human synovial fluid samples were collected as described above. All samples were spun down at 4500 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. Human GAS6 Quantikine Kit (R&amp;D Systems) was used to measure the concentration of GAS6 in the synovial fluid.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data were represented as the mean ± standard deviation. An unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was performed for experiments comparing two groups of data. A one-way analysis of variance was performed for data involving multiple groups, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. p values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Software, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Informed consent was obtained from all recruited patients and was identified by the ethics committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in Chinese Laboratory animal-Guideline for ethical review of animal welfare (GB/T 35892-2018).

Overall, this is a well-designed, highly clinical demand and potentially translational study.

However, some claims and conclusions were not well supported by their data. There are some issues that need to be carefully clarified and studied:</p><p>1. The design of experimental groups was defective, all C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard diet, while ApoE-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet. Both C57BL/6 and ApoE-/- mice should be fed the standard and high-fat diet respectively.</p><p>2. The source of cartilage and synovial tissue of obese OA patients described in Figure 1 should be added to the Materials and methods.</p><p>3. The authors deemed that the expression of GAS6 in chondrocytes was decreased in the obese ApoE-/- OA mice, however, in Figure 3C, its expression seemed to be increased.</p><p>4. The authors declared that GAS6 expression was inhibited in synovial macrophages, whether GAS6 is mainly expressed in synovial macrophages? Why was the expression level decreased in chondrocytes?</p><p>5. In Figure 1B, the F4/80 labeled macrophages were increased in synovial tissues of obese OA patients, however, in Figure 3A-D, the expression of F4/80 in synovial tissues of obese OA seemed to be decreased.</p><p>6. In Figure 4 H-J, the authors should add a group that is stimulated with GAS6 and R428 in RAW264.7 cells to prove that inhibition of the Axl receptor by R428 diminished the enhanced phagocytotic activity.</p><p>7. The authors declared that blocking M1 macrophage polarization could be a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated OA, however, the authors did not investigate the effect of blocking M1 macrophage polarization.</p><p>8. The authors declared that enhanced M1-polarized macrophages in obese synovium decreased GAS6 secretion, the evidence for this conclusion was weak, and the decreased GAS6 secretion maybe not be due to the polarization of macrophages.</p><p>9. To study macrophage efferocytosis, the markers F4/80 should be used, but not the M1 macrophage marker iNOS. Besides, the primary macrophage such as BMDM is better than 264.7 cells.</p><p>10. The authors thought that accumulated apoptotic cells lead to the release of inflammatory factors that induced chondrocyte homeostasis dysfunction in obese OA patients, however, additional evidence is needed to support this conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83069.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to carefully explain the rationale behind their design of the experimental groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the careful review and helpful suggestions for improving manuscript. The experimental group was divided into four groups according to disease model and genotype: C57BL/6 control group, C57BL/6 OA group, ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> control group and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> OA group.</p><p>From a critical perspective, the experimental grouping should be more rigorous in the manuscript. According to previous studies which revealed that feeding ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice with HFD accelerates the increase in LDL cholesterol levels and causes more body weight gain, compared with C57BL/6 mice fed with an HFD (references were provided in Answer 1# for Reviewer #2). We regard ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice fed with an HFD as the total variable associated with obesity, while C57BL/6 mice fed with a standard-chow diet as control. During revising the article, we reared mice and divided them into four groups, as Reviewer #3 suggested. Body weight gain was re-analyzed and provided in revised Table 4. Our statistical data also revealed a significant increase in body weight by feeding ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice with an HFD (19.81±1.33g) for 8 weeks compared with feeding C57BL/6 mice with an HFD (16.89±0.75g), which partly verified the effectiveness of inducing obesity by feeding ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice with an HFD for a short-term period. Accordingly, we selected feeding ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice with an HFD as the experimental group while feeding C57BL/6 mice with a standard-chow diet as control. Moreover, further studies were designed to explore the mechanism of obesity in the progression of OA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors also need to analyze changes in macrophage efferocytosis maker F4/80 in OA synovitis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this valuable comment. Previous studies showed that MER is closely related to the maintenance of macrophages efferocytosis. Dransfield et al. identified Mer as a receptor uniquely capable of tethering ACs to the macrophage surface and driving their subsequent internalization<sup>1</sup>. Moreover, Felton and colleagues further revealed that knocking out Mer impaired phagocytosis of mouse eosinophils by macrophages, contributing to the persistence of airway inflammation<sup>2</sup>. Cai et al. found that higher macrophage MerTK improved efferocytosis and increased the ratio of pro-resolving versus proinflammatory lipid mediators, which attenuated plaque inflammation, fibrous cap thinning, and thrombosis in atherosclerosis<sup>3</sup>. These results suggest that MER is essential for the normal functioning of macrophage efferocytosis. In this manuscript, we found a decreased expression of MER in OA hyperplastic synovial tissue, especially in obesity-associated OA. These results indicated that the efferocytosis of macrophages is impaired in obesity-associated OA.</p><p>We have now added this part of the results in Revised Results 4, which reads “MER were widely used to label macrophages undergoing efferocytosis. Immunofluorescence staining analysis indicated the expression of MER in OA synovial macrophages decreased significantly, especially in obese ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> OA and obese OA patients.” We have now included these results in the revised Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If the administration of GAS6 can also reverse OA-like feasure in human cartilage explants or human articular chondrocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this insightful comment. We have now used both human cartilage explants and primary articular chondrocytes obtained from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty to confirm the effect of GAS6 on chondrocytes. Patient consent and the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China) were obtained before the human tissue samples were harvested. No apparent proteoglycan loss or increase was found in rhGAS6 treated cartilage explant. Moreover, Western blotting showed no significant differences in the expression of COL2, MMP13, p16, and p21 in primary chondrocytes after stimulation with rhGAS6. These data are shown in revised Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 5—figure supplement 3</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors need to address the comments below.</p><p>1) If the administration of GAS6 can also reverse OA-like feasure in human cartilage explants or human articular chondrocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable comment, and thank the Reviewer very much for the opportunity to improve the manuscript.

As shown in our manuscript, F4/80-Axl double staining revealed no significant difference in the number of Axl-positive cells in the synovium of obese OA patients, obese ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> OA mice, and control subjects (previous Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Articular administration of R428 (Axl inhibitor) in C57BL/6 OA mice promoted synovial hyperplasia and cartilage destruction and enhanced synovitis and OARSI scores (previous Figure 5A and B). Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that the phagocytotic activity of RAW264.7 cells was decreased after administration of R428 (previous Figure 4H).</p><p>As the reviewer points out, more evidence is required to support the role of Axl in OA development. To demonstrate the direct role of Axl in macrophage, R428 was administrated to Raw264.7 cells to inhibit Axl. The results showed an increased expression of iNOS and CD86, together with up-regulated IL-1、IL-6, and TNF-α. These data are shown in revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The main strengths of the paper are the discovery of the underlying mechanism of obesity-associated osteoarthritis.

The source of cartilage and synovial tissue of obese OA patients described in Figure 1 should be added to the Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We have added the source of cartilage and synovial tissue from obese OA patients in the first section of Materials and methods section. It reads “Synovial tissue and synovial fluid samples of normal individuals (n = 6, age 34 ± 8.15 years, three males, three females) or obese individuals (n = 6, age 35 ± 7.36 years, four males, two females) were obtained from patients who received arthroscopic treatment for acute anterior cruciate ligament rupture or meniscus injury Other joint diseases were excluded from the study. OA synovial tissues, and synovial fluid samples were obtained from obese patients (n = 6, age 64 ± 5.75 years, two males, four females) or patients without obesity (n = 6, age 65 ± 4.26 years, three males, three females) who underwent total knee arthroplasty. OA cartilage tissues were obtained from patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty, the tibial plateau cartilage was carefully separated and cut into 1mm<sup>3</sup>, cultured in vitro.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors deemed that the expression of GAS6 in chondrocytes was decreased in the obese ApoE-/- OA mice, however, in Figure 3C, its expression seemed to be increased.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments.

The authors declared that GAS6 expression was inhibited in synovial macrophages, whether GAS6 is mainly expressed in synovial macrophages? Why was the expression level decreased in chondrocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate your careful review and helpful suggestions. Our previous results showed that both macrophages and chondrocytes expressed GAS6 protein. However, we found a decrease in chondrocyte protein expression but did not investigate its functional impact. As suggested by Reviewer 1, rhGAS6 were used to stimulate OA cartilage explants or primary chondrocytes, we found that rhGas6 may not reverse the dysregulation of anabolic and catabolic homeostasis in OA articular cartilage explants, these data are shown in revised Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 5—figure supplement 3 (referring to answer for Essential Revisions 3). Since administration of GAS6 has no obvious effect on chondrocyte metabolism, we delete this part of figures. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of the decreased expression of GAS6 deserves further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 1B, the F4/80 labeled macrophages were increased in synovial tissues of obese OA patients, however, in Figure 3A-D, the expression of F4/80 in synovial tissues of obese OA seemed to be decreased.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate your careful review and helpful suggestions. We are sorry for the ambiguity caused by the quality of images and we have chosen more representative images in revised Figure 3A-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 4 H-J, the authors should add a group that is stimulated with GAS6 and R428 in RAW264.7 cells to prove that inhibition of the Axl receptor by R428 diminished the enhanced phagocytotic activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We added the group treated with both GAS6 and R428. The phagocytotic activity was indeed diminished after stimulated with rmGAS6 and R428 compared administration with rmGAS6 alone. We have now included these results in revised Figure 4H-K.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors declared that blocking M1 macrophage polarization could be a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated OA, however, the authors did not investigate the effect of blocking M1 macrophage polarization.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate your careful review and helpful suggestions. We are sorry for the ambiguity caused by the expression. Our previous findings showed that blocking M1 polarization of synovial macrophages attenuated OA progression. In this manuscript, we revealed that M1-polarized macrophage infiltration in OA synovial tissue of obese patients is significantly increased. Nevertheless, evidence supporting the effect of blocking M1 polarization could attenuate OA development is insufficient. We have deleted such ambiguous expressions and corrected the expression in the manuscript, which reads “targeting macrophage associated efferocytosis or intra-articular injection of GAS6 is a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity-associated OA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors declared that enhanced M1-polarized macrophages in obese synovium decreased GAS6 secretion, the evidence for this conclusion was weak, and the decreased GAS6 secretion maybe not be due to the polarization of macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate your careful review and helpful suggestions. In order to explore the effect of M1 macrophage polarization on GAS6 secretion, BMDMs were treated with LPS or IL-4 for 36 hours. As is shown in revised Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, the expression of iNOS and CD86 were increased while GAS6 decreased significantly after treated BMDMs with LPS for 36 hours. These data indicated that the decreased GAS6 secretion was mainly due to the M1 polarization of macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

In Figure 4E-J, marker F4/80 (red) and CFSE (green) were used to label macrophages and apoptotic cells respectively. Moreover, as you proposed, we performed an experiment with BMDMs to illustrate the effect of rmGAS6 in regulating efferocytosis of macrophages, which were showed in Revised Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors thought that accumulated apoptotic cells lead to the release of inflammatory factors that induced chondrocyte homeostasis dysfunction in obese OA patients, however, additional evidence is needed to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. To further explore the effect of inflammatory factors released by the stimulation of apoptotic cells (ACs) on chondrocyte homeostasis dysfunction, ACs were co-cultured with BMDMs, and the culture supernatant was collected after stimulation for 24 hours. The expression of MMP13 was increased after adding co-culture supernatant stimulation, together with senescence hallmarks such as p16 and p21, while COL2 were down-regulated after stimulation. These data partly indicated that macrophages stimulated by apoptotic cells secreted chemokines leading chondrocyte homeostasis dysfunction. However, the effect of supernatant promoting chondrocyte homeostasis dysfunction was partially alleviated when adding ACs with rmGAS6 to BMDMs for 24 hours, which were diminished by adding R428. We adding these contexts in Results 5, which reads “To further explore the effect of inflammatory factors released by the stimulation of apoptotic cells (ACs) on chondrocyte homeostasis dysfunction, ACs were co-cultured with BMDMs and the culture supernatant was collected after stimulation for 24 hours.
