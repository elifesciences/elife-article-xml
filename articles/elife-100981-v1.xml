sustainable pest management combine repellent stimuli from intercrops (‘push’) and attractive stimuli from border plants (‘pull’) to repel herbivorous insects from a main crop and attract the herbivores’ natural enemies. The most widespread implementation, intercropping the legume <italic>Desmodium</italic> with maize surrounded by border grass, reduces damage from the invasive fall armyworm (FAW) <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>. While initial research indicated that <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles can dampen the attraction of FAW to maize, a recent study recovered very low volatile emission from the commonly used <italic>D. intortum</italic> and found that the <italic>D. intortum</italic> headspace did not reduce FAW oviposition on maize (Erdei et al., 2024). Here, we detect volatiles from the headspace of two <italic>Desmodium</italic> species sampled within the activity window of FAW: <italic>D. intortum</italic> and the more recently adopted <italic>D. incanum</italic>; and we present the behavior of gravid FAW moths in bioassays. We detected 25 volatiles from field-grown <italic>Desmodium</italic>, many in the headspaces of both species, including volatiles previously reported to repel lepidopteran herbivores. In cage oviposition assays, FAW moths preferred to oviposit on maize over <italic>Desmodium</italic>, but not on maize further from, versus closer to <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants that were inaccessible to the moths, but sharing headspace. In flight tunnel assays, moths approached the headspace of maize more than shared headspaces of maize and <italic>Desmodium</italic>, but pairwise differences were often insignificant. Thus, headspaces of <italic>Desmodium</italic> species include volatiles that could repel FAW moths, and gravid moths were generally more attracted to maize and its headspace than to either <italic>Desmodium</italic> species or mixed maize-<italic>Desmodium</italic> headspaces. However, our results suggest that direct effects of <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles on FAW behavior are insufficient to explain reduced FAW infestation of maize under push-pull cultivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>push-pull cropping system</kwd><kwd>pest management</kwd><kwd>plant volatiles</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Maize</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Fall armyworm</kwd><kwd>Spodoptera frugiperda</kwd><kwd><italic>Desmodium</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00k4n6c32</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/861998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Odermatt</surname><given-names>Daria M</given-names></name><name><surname>Chidawanyika</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name><name><surname>Mutyambai</surname><given-names>Daniel M</given-names></name><name><surname>Onjura</surname><given-names>Collins O</given-names></name><name><surname>Tamiru</surname><given-names>Amanuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Meredith C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>'Push-pull' agro-ecosystems appear to protect maize against the fall armyworm, but volatiles from <italic>Desmodium</italic> intercrops are not sufficient to reliably repel this herbivore, indicating that additional mechanisms contribute to protection.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sustainable intensification of agriculture is essential to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, zero hunger, and reduce hidden costs of meeting requirements of other SDGs such as 13, climate action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">FAO et al., 2020</xref>). This is particularly important in the developing Global South where larger yield gaps are observed compared to countries with greater financial resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tilman et al., 2011</xref>). Intercropping may offer sustainable solutions with potential for strong positive effects on pest and disease control as well as associated biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beillouin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The concept of ‘push-pull’ mixed cropping was first reported in 1987 as a ‘stimulo-deterrence’ strategy for the reduction of pest damage in cotton, combining a pest repellent intercrop (‘push’) interspersed with the main crop, and an attractant border crop (‘pull’) to trap pests at the field perimeter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pyke et al., 1987</xref>). As most widely practiced, current push-pull systems benefit from the attractive and repellent stimuli of perennial inter- and border crops (referred to as companion crops), thereby reducing or eliminating the need for pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pickett et al., 2014</xref>). In Kenya, the first push-pull system, introduced in 1997, was designed to reduce yield losses caused by stemborer species and comprised a combination of the main crop maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L), the intercrop molasses grass (<italic>Melinis minutiflora</italic>), and the border crop Napier grass (<italic>Pennisetum purpureum</italic>) or Sudan grass (<italic>Sorghum vulgare sudanense</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Khan et al., 1997b</xref>).</p><p>Several volatiles detected from molasses grass repelled female stem borers and simultaneously attracted their parasitoid <italic>Cotesia sesamiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khan et al., 1997a</xref>). Following the initial success of this system, there was interest in replacing molasses grass with a leguminous repellent intercrop that could improve soil quality by fixing nitrogen while providing high-quality fodder. The legumes silverleaf <italic>Desmodium</italic> (<italic>Desmodium uncinatum</italic>) and its congeneric (<italic>Desmodium intortum</italic>) were shown to repel ovipositing stem borers and furthermore to suppress parasitic <italic>Striga</italic> weeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khan et al., 2002</xref>). The first <italic>Desmodium</italic>-intercropped version of push-pull used <italic>D. uncinatum</italic> in place of <italic>M. minutiflora</italic> together with <italic>P. purpureum</italic>. As a result of screening for more drought-tolerant companion plants, a version using <italic>D. intortum</italic> combined with the border crop <italic>Brachiaria</italic> cv Mulato II was developed as ‘climate-adapted push-pull’, which has been demonstrated to increase maize yield by a factor of 2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Midega et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, a ‘third generation’ push-pull system was evaluated using the intercrop <italic>D. incanum</italic> to replace <italic>D. intortum</italic> – which does not flower and set seed in many parts of tropical Africa and thus limits adoption and spread of push-pull by limiting seed supply for the intercrop – with <italic>Brachiaria brizantha</italic> cv Xaraes as border crop, which is more resistant to herbivorous mites that attack the mulato cultivar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheruiyot et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The invasive fall armyworm (FAW), <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>, originating from a maize-specialized strain from northern and central America, has become a major threat to African maize crops since 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goergen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Day et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hailu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). It spread rapidly through East Africa, with most of the farmers in Ethiopia and Kenya encountering the FAW after the long rains in the first half of 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumela et al., 2018</xref>). The invasiveness of the moth is fueled by its relatively short life cycle of about 4 weeks and the capability of adult females to lay hundreds of eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sparks, 1979</xref>). Other traits favoring the FAW’s spread in Africa and beyond are its strong flight capacity, lack of diapause, reported survival in diverse habitats, rapid development of resistance to insecticides and viruses, and polyphagous nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wan et al., 2021</xref>). Although the FAW has a wide host range of at least 353 species across 76 plant families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Montezano et al., 2018</xref>), the high financial and yield losses in maize due to this invasive FAW strain are particularly devastating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eschen et al., 2021</xref>). The FAW is reported to outcompete resident stemborers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hailu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sokame et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mutyambai et al., 2022</xref>). The use of pesticides is a popular approach to control the FAW, posing risks to environmental and human health including acute pesticide-related illnesses, as many smallholder farmers do not use personal protective equipment while spraying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tambo et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, sole reliance on pesticides is not sufficient to manage FAW sustainably, and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, such as the promotion of natural enemies, are desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nyamutukwa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van den Berg and du Plessis, 2022</xref>). Climate-adapted and third-generation push-pull systems have been reported to reduce plant damage and yield loss caused by the FAW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Midega et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hailu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheruiyot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yeboah et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mutyambai et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>A systematic review on the chemical ecology of push-pull systems by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lang et al., 2022</xref> found only 30 publications (7 primary sources and 23 publications reporting on results from these primary sources) on the chemistry of push-pull and related mixed-cropping systems, from which 206 substances were reported to be potentially associated with push and pull effects. Of these, 101 were categorized as plant volatiles and reported by studies with a focus on plant-insect interactions (as opposed to studies with a focus on <italic>Striga</italic> control). However, none of these publications reported volatiles sampled under field conditions. Two recent papers, both published after the literature review conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lang et al., 2022</xref>, reported additional potentially bioactive substances from companion plants in maize-<italic>Desmodium</italic>-grass push-pull systems, and both publications supported the hypothesis that volatiles from the companion crop <italic>D. intortum</italic> repel the FAW and attract parasitic wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, a third recent publication by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erdei et al., 2024</xref> detected low levels of volatiles from <italic>D. intortum</italic> plants and found that the presence of <italic>D. intortum</italic> upwind from maize did not reduce oviposition on maize, while FAW larvae offered <italic>D. intortum</italic> fed on it and became trapped by its silicate trichomes; the authors thus proposed that reduced FAW infestation in maize-<italic>Desmodium</italic> intercropping settings is more likely to result from physical trapping of FAW larvae by <italic>Desmodium</italic>.</p><p>The protection mechanisms of push-pull systems are assumed to be complex and to operate across multiple interactions, protecting maize not only from FAW but also from other pests and parasitic weeds, such as <italic>Striga</italic>. However, further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which the maize-<italic>Desmodium</italic>-grass push-pull system can protect maize from FAW. A summary of the studies to date on push-pull effects on FAW can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. To our knowledge, no data on plant volatiles from the more drought-resistant <italic>D. incanum</italic> have been published so far. Therefore, this study focuses on the volatiles of <italic>D. intortum</italic> and <italic>D. incanum</italic>, aiming to capture the headspace of plants used by farmers under realistic conditions, rather than attributing the composition to specific causes such as damage. Additionally, our goal is to assess the effects of exposure to the headspaces of these plants, versus direct exposure to the plants, on the interaction of FAW with maize. We collected volatiles from plants in farmers’ fields as well as in bioassay setups under semi-field conditions and conducted oviposition and flight tunnel bioassays to assess FAW moth preferences.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Studies to date on push-pull effects on the fall armyworm (FAW) embedded in the mechanisms according to the current state of knowledge of the system.</title><p>Volatiles (and potentially other traits) of the intercrop repel the herbivorous insect and additionally attract its parasitoids, while volatiles (and potentially other traits) of the border crop attract herbivores away from the main crop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pickett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eigenbrode et al., 2016</xref>).

Nevertheless, the repellent role of volatiles from greenleaf <italic>Desmodium</italic> (<italic>D. intortum</italic>) has been investigated in only three studies, with conflicting reports of whether these volatiles repel FAW moths, and the only study reporting field measurements recovering few volatiles in relatively low abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erdei et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>We characterized volatiles sampled from both <italic>D. intortum</italic> and a recently introduced alternative <italic>Desmodium</italic> intercrop, <italic>D. incanum</italic>, growing in farmer fields or in bioassay conditions, and conducted bioassays with FAW moths to determine whether the presence or proximity of <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants or their headspace would alter moth preferences for maize. We identified up to 17–19 substances in headspace samples from <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants, often in abundance similar to or greater than volatiles measured from maize plants under comparable conditions. We observed that FAW moths preferred to oviposit on maize rather than on <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants of either species, but that close proximity to a <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant sharing the airspace did not influence FAW oviposition preferences for maize in a greenhouse cage choice assay. Consistent with this, in no-choice assays, FAW flying upwind landed closer to a maize odor source than when maize was combined with either species of <italic>Desmodium</italic>, but in dual-choice assays, FAW moths did not stay significantly closer to maize headspace sources over headspace sources from a combination of maize and <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants. We note that the choice assays (oviposition and dual-choice movement) were performed in relatively complex odor backgrounds, whereas the no-choice assay was performed with a simpler odor environment.</p><p>Furthermore, all assays were performed in a risk area for malaria and other mosquito-borne illnesses, so experimenters were protected with DEET, which has low volatility but is active in the vapor phase, where it can cause host avoidance by binding to insect olfactory receptors (although this has been mostly studied in the dipterans <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeGennaro, 2015</xref>). We reduced any potential influence on the lepidopteran in our experiments by using minimal amounts of DEET, avoiding direct contact of any DEET with experimental materials, and conducting behavioral assays without the insects being exposed to volatiles from the experimenter (experimenters were generally not present during oviposition assays, and only small amounts of DEET were used during the movement assays indoors in Nairobi).</p><p>We conclude that <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants in push-pull cultivation emit volatiles that have the potential to repel FAW (and to attract their natural enemies), but our bioassays provide only weak support for the hypothesis that these volatiles repel FAW from maize. While (perhaps subtler) effects of the <italic>Desmodium</italic> headspace might be more reliably detected using more refined experimental setups, our mixed support of this hypothesis is in line with the reports in literature thus far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We suggest that other features of the maize-<italic>Desmodium</italic>-border grass push-pull system, including the influence of border grasses as well as below-ground interactions and other traits of <italic>Desmodium</italic>, are important for protecting maize from FAW moths and their larvae. We furthermore call for field or semi-field bioassays that better capture the choice of moths exposed to push-pull versus non-push-pull fields, in contrast to individual headspace environments presented out of context, or maize plants closer to vs. further from <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants in pots.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Emission of volatiles implicated in push-pull by <italic>Desmodium</italic> intercrops</title><p>The headspace of <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants was dynamically sampled on Tenax TA adsorbent directly in push-pull fields, as well as from potted plants used for oviposition bioassays, overnight. Due to limited resources and time, we chose to focus on the volatile profiles of field-grown <italic>Desmodium</italic> rather than field-grown maize or intercropped edible legumes, as this aligned best with our aim of assessing the role of <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles. Additionally, we opted not to use individual volatile substances in bioassays because the conflicting evidence in the literature made it difficult to select meaningful blends, and testing plant emissions first was crucial for ensuring ecological relevance in our experiments. However, we recommend that future studies sample the volatiles of all plants commonly used in newly developed push-pull systems, including the edible legumes that are now more often intercropped, allowing for a contextualized comparison of volatile profiles.</p><p>We excluded all substances found in fewer than two-thirds of the field samples from further analysis. While this threshold is arbitrary and may overlook potential differences in plant stressors across fields, we chose to focus on substances commonly present in field-grown <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants. Quantitative comparisons within single substances are possible, but must be handled with care, as normalization based on the biomass and leaf area of the plants was not possible. The chosen adsorbent, Tenax TA, is known to be effective for lipophilic to medium-polarity organic compounds of intermediate molecular weight (approximately C7-C26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dettmer and Engewald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tholl et al., 2020</xref>). It is possible that headspace samples changed during storage (up to 3 months tightly closed at room temperature) as degradation or thermal rearrangements on Tenax TA material have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dettmer and Engewald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alborn et al., 2021</xref>). We extracted headspace samples using thermal desorption, which is simple and sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tholl et al., 2006</xref>), but not appropriate for some substances, such as the sesquiterpene germacrene A, which are susceptible to thermal rearrangement or degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faraldos et al., 2007</xref>). While the potted plants were kept in insect-proof greenhouses, it cannot be excluded that field plants might have been exposed to insect herbivory, though representative and healthy plants were selected for the volatile sampling. Although plants were handled carefully, it is still possible that volatile release could have resulted from physical damage.</p><p>Despite these caveats, our samples yielded a variety of volatiles with high signal:noise ratios, of which 13 had been previously reported from sampling the headspace of potted <italic>D. intortum</italic> plants onto Porapak Q for sampling durations of 24 hr or 48 hr followed by solvent extraction and GC-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erdei et al., 2024</xref> detected fewer volatiles in lower relative abundance from <italic>D. intortum</italic> using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and a saturation time of 18–24 hr to sample intact, mechanically damaged, or herbivory-induced potted plants or intact plants in Tanzanian and Ugandan fields. Our study is the only one of these that limited the window of sampling strictly to the nighttime hours corresponding to the reported activity window for the FAW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sparks, 1979</xref>). In pretests, no shorter activity window could be determined as the moths still showed mating behavior and potential oviposition at around midnight (see Appendix 1). Differences may be explained in part by different sampling techniques, as the sensitivity of SPME can be lower in comparison to dynamic headspace collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tholl et al., 2006</xref>). To our knowledge, the volatile profile of <italic>D. incanum</italic> was not previously reported. In conclusion, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>D. intortum</italic> and <italic>D. incanum</italic> emit volatiles, many of which have been previously associated with push-pull effects, the repellence of lepidopteran herbivores or the attraction of their natural enemies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Oviposition choice bioassays</title><p>FAW oviposition behavior was observed over three nights in two treatments per <italic>Desmodium</italic> species. In one treatment, FAW moths had direct contact with <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants, and in another, they had only indirect contact through aerial exposure to plants outside of, but directly next to a mesh cage. Moths always had direct contact with maize plants.</p><p>Critical consideration must be given to differences in the volatile profiles between the potted plants and those measured in farmers’ fields, which led to a separation of potted and field <italic>D. intortum</italic> in the second dimension of a PCA, and a near-separation of <italic>D. incanum</italic> in the first dimension. As the untargeted analysis was conducted based on the field <italic>Desmodium</italic> samples, any volatile substances that only occur in the potted plants were not identified or analyzed further (although full results of the GC-MS analysis are available with the source data for this publication). Oviposition on maize can alter the maize volatile profile and affect volatile emission in the following days, which is why the maize samples are divided into plants before (control) and after (infested) oviposition exposure. Of the substances occurring in field <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants, approximately half were abundant in healthy and infested potted maize plants, with only one substance, (<italic>E</italic>)-α-bergamotene, being present solely in infested maize plants. The sampling of potted plants was conducted using the same procedure as in the field, but in a greenhouse with netted walls on two sides that allowed air circulation, as used for the oviposition bioassays. Overall, this highlights the importance of studying oviposition cues and moth preferences directly in push-pull fields in the future.</p><p>In all treatments, the number of eggs laid per batch showed no difference depending on the position, which indicates that FAW moths did not adjust their behavior once they started laying eggs. This differs slightly from the outcomes reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter et al., 2023</xref>, where a reduction in egg number per batch was observed and the number of eggs, but not the number of egg batches, differed between maize vs. maize + <italic>D. intortum</italic>. However, a clear preference for maize compared to the two <italic>Desmodium</italic> species was observed in the treatments where FAW moths had direct contact with both plant species, with a large effect size of 7–8 times more eggs (as measured by number of eggs or number of batches) on maize than on <italic>Desmodium</italic>. The preference of maize over <italic>D. intortum</italic> in oviposition assays with direct contact to both plants is consistent with various publications using similar setups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erdei et al., 2024</xref>). There was little oviposition on the cage in our bioassays, which indicates that moths primarily chose between plants in our setup. This differs from the strong preference found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref> of FAW moths to oviposit directly on the mesh of a bioassay cage rather than on the plants when offered maize co-planted with <italic>D. intortum.

However, a clear preference for maize compared to the two <italic>Desmodium</italic> species was observed in the treatments where FAW moths had direct contact with both plant species, with a large effect size of 7–8 times more eggs (as measured by number of eggs or number of batches) on maize than on <italic>Desmodium</italic>. The preference of maize over <italic>D. intortum</italic> in oviposition assays with direct contact to both plants is consistent with various publications using similar setups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erdei et al., 2024</xref>). There was little oviposition on the cage in our bioassays, which indicates that moths primarily chose between plants in our setup. This differs from the strong preference found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref> of FAW moths to oviposit directly on the mesh of a bioassay cage rather than on the plants when offered maize co-planted with <italic>D. intortum. Desmodium</italic> and maize plants were planted in the same pots by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>, and therefore maize volatiles may have been affected by belowground interactions or through priming by <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles prior to or during oviposition bioassays. This is, in fact, closer to the configuration in push-pull fields but does not isolate the influence of the <italic>Desmodium</italic> headspace, as we sought to do here.</p><p>In our bioassays, no significant effect could be seen in the treatments where moths had only indirect contact with <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles coming from a <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant proximate to one maize plant, but outside of the cage. This is inconsistent with the hypothesis that <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles repel FAW moths as proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pickett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible that the distance of about 60 cm between the plants in the cages was not suitable to create a gradient of volatiles sufficient to allow moths to choose between maize plants closer to versus further from <italic>Desmodium</italic>, in which case neighboring treatments with distances of 50–100 cm could have also affected each other. Although the distance reflected the approximate spacing between <italic>Desmodium</italic> and maize plants in push-pull fields, this limitation must be considered, as the close proximity of assays may have compromised the ability to create distinct volatile environments. To our knowledge, the only comparable setup was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erdei et al., 2024</xref>, in which two maize plants were exposed to volatiles of either <italic>D. intortum</italic> or an artificial plant in a modified dual-choice assay, and moths did not show a significant preference for either maize plant.</p><p>In conclusion, we confirm a preference of FAW moths to oviposit on maize rather than on <italic>D. intortum</italic> or <italic>D. incanum</italic> when directly offered plants. However, no significant influence of the <italic>Desmodium</italic> headspace was observed. It is not to be expected that herbivores use all potential host plants equally, and preferences among host plants or for host over non-host plants can be based on different plant traits. Ovipositing FAW moths may also prefer maize over <italic>Desmodium</italic> due to other traits such as the surface texture, as proposed in the findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erdei et al., 2024</xref> that silicate trichomes on <italic>D. intortum</italic> pose a danger to FAW larvae; or chemical repellents directly on the leaf surface. Belowground interactions or priming between <italic>Desmodium</italic> and maize plants co-planted in push-pull fields may also change moths’ preference for maize, an effect which could not have been observed with our experimental design, but might explain inconsistencies with findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Dual-choice and no-choice assays</title><p>The short-term flight behavior of FAW moths was tested in a dual-choice assay setup where headspaces of a maize plant vs. maize + <italic>Desmodium</italic> were compared against each other, and a no-choice assay with a single headspace source upwind of the moth. Flight behavior showed large variation among the individual moths, but three-quarters of the moths had settled after at least 3 min or showed few changes in the last 2 min of each experiment. Although flow rates were measured at the incoming tubing of the dual-choice setup and the exhaust was placed above the center (where the moth was also introduced), this experimental setup allowed no control over the exact flows in the flight arena and the individual flows were low compared to the total arena volume. Therefore, the exact mixing of the opposing treatments is unknown, and cross-contamination between treatments was also possible. Furthermore, moths may behave differently over longer times or when given more space to maneuver, as under normal field conditions. The quarter of the moths that showed high activity indicates the difficulty of quantifying the responses of such active fliers. Interestingly, a larger proportion of moths settled after 2 min when presented with maize versus maize + <italic>D. intortum</italic> in the dual-choice assay, rather than continuing to fly. While some tendencies were apparent in this setup, none of the treatments showed any significant preference. In contrast, a significant repellent effect of <italic>Desmodium</italic> added to maize, versus maize alone, was observed in the no-choice assay as judged by final landing position. The combination of maize + <italic>D. incanum</italic> showed a greater repellent effect than maize + <italic>D. intortum</italic>. Similar repellence of moths by <italic>D. intortum</italic> headspace with or without the addition of maize was observed in no-choice assays reported in the literature when the total distance flown upwind at the end of the experiment was used as a metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sobhy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peter et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Several field studies have described positive effects of push-pull systems with the companion crops <italic>D. intortum</italic> or <italic>D. incanum</italic> on maize yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Midega et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Midega et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheruiyot et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show that 17–19 volatile substances, including plant volatiles previously indicated to repel lepidopteran herbivores or attract their natural enemies, were found in the headspaces of both companion crops <italic>D. intortum</italic> and <italic>D. incanum</italic> within the temporal activity window of FAW moths. However, we did not observe a repellent effect of <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant headspaces on FAW moths in most bioassays. FAW moths clearly preferred to oviposit on maize over <italic>D. intortum</italic> or <italic>D. incanum</italic> plants. Our results thus indicate that moths prefer maize over <italic>Desmodium</italic> and that this may be influenced by short-range mechanisms such as an unfavorable leaf surface of <italic>Desmodium</italic>. However, the main interest in the context of push-pull is how <italic>Desmodium</italic> contributes to protecting co-planted maize. A reduction of FAW damage on maize under push-pull cultivation has been demonstrated in multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Midega et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hailu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheruiyot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yeboah et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mutyambai et al., 2022</xref>). Based on the literature, effects of border crop volatiles may be important for reducing FAW damage in push-pull fields, in combination with the attraction of parasitoids by <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles and unfavorable host qualities of <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants for FAW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>Desmodium</italic> intercrop may be equally or more important for weed suppression, soil fertility, and improving maize plant health and vigor as for volatile-mediated repellence of FAW in the push-pull system. For example, recent studies showed that planting maize in soil collected from push-pull fields or co-planting it with silverleaf <italic>Desmodium uncinatum</italic> changed the composition of volatiles and defensive non-volatile substances in maize plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mutyambai et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass et al., 2024</xref>). Future studies wishing to test the importance of <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles in the system could best resolve this question by adding and subtracting <italic>Desmodium</italic> headspace, or manipulating moths’ direct access to <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants, in experimental push-pull and control fields, thus ensuring relevant context while avoiding experimental artifacts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All volatile sampling and bioassays were performed with two <italic>Desmodium</italic> species, <italic>Desmodium intortum</italic> (greenleaf <italic>Desmodium</italic>) and <italic>Desmodium incanum</italic> (often referred to as African <italic>Desmodium</italic> by the push-pull farmers in Western Kenya), referred to in the methods section collectively as <italic>Desmodium</italic> for simplicity.

For a first cycle, two single maize leaves of the landrace ’Jowi white’ were placed in wooden cages with meshed side walls (100 x 60 x 60 cm) in high cylindrical glasses filled with water, but sealed with a piece of cotton to prevent moths from entering the glasses. Moths (3–4 days old) were released in pairs of one female and one male in 10 different cages (resulting in 20 moths in total) and observed from 7 pm to 11:30 pm over two consecutive nights. The moths were re-collected in falcon tubes in the morning after the first night, sealed with a piece of cotton to allow air circulation and stored at a temperature of approximately 25 °C until they were released in the same combinations on the following evening.

To our knowledge, only one study has attempted to measure the volatiles of <italic>D. intortum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erdei et al., 2024</xref>, and no studies have measured volatiles of <italic>D. incanum</italic> in fields.

Headspace collections were also performed from potted <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants, as well as from healthy and infested potted maize plants on the research campus. Five 3-week-old maize plants, later labeled as ‘infested’, were exposed in two cages, each with three female and two male moths, for two nights prior to headspace sampling, which resulted in 1–10 batches per plant.

The inlet tubing pushed 500 mL/min charcoal-filtered air into the bags from the lower bag rim, while the Tenax TA tube was connected to an air outlet tubing through a small hole at the top of the bag.

planted in plastic pots in black cotton soil in insect-proof greenhouses in Mbita, Kenya. Maize plants (SC Duma 43, Seed Co Limited, Nairobi, Kenya) were grown from seeds with the addition of fertilizer (3 g DAP 18-46-0, Yara East Africa LTD, Nairobi, Kenya) and used at the age of 2–4 weeks with five to seven fully-grown leaves. <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants were obtained from a push-pull field on the icipe Mbita campus and kept in pots without fertilizer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Fall armyworm moths</title><p>To form the FAW colony, wild individuals were collected in the counties Siaya, Kisumu, Migori, and Vihiga in Western Kenya. Larvae were fed on artificial diet based on soy flour, wheat germ, raw linseed oil, mineral mix, sugar, aureomycin, vitamins, agar, methyl parabene, sorbic acid, and calcium propionate (Article No 870-265-3747, Southland Products Inc, Lake Village AR, USA). Moths were fed on water and, in rare cases after emergence, on 10% honey solution. The colony was occasionally restocked with wild FAW moths. Each day after hatching, moths of both sexes were transferred to a cage to allow mating until the start of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Experimental procedure</title><p>Cages (100 x 60 x 60 cm) lined with wooden floors and ceilings and netted walls were placed in greenhouses that allowed air circulation through mesh side walls (for pictures of the real setup, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, for exact positioning in the greenhouses, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>). Two plants were placed within the cage at the greatest distance possible (approximately 60 cm) in two opposite corners. For the control treatment, two maize plants were placed in the cage, while the direct <italic>Desmodium</italic> treatment consisted of one maize plant and one <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant in the cage. In two additional treatments with indirect contact, two maize plants were placed in the cage, while one <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant was placed outside the cage unreachable for the FAW moths, but in proximity to one maize plant. Three female and two male moths aged 4–5 days were released approximately 1 hr before dusk and allowed to oviposit under natural conditions of L12:D12 for three consecutive nights. Eggs were collected in five different groups depending on the position in which they were laid: either on one of the two plants, close to one of the plants within a maximum of 20 cm distance, or on the cage further than 20 cm from any plant (labeled as ‘No Decision’). Each treatment was repeated 19–21 times in total over five cycles, with up to five replicates per treatment and cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Egg count</title><p>Each batch of FAW eggs was collected with sticky tape to separate the layers and spread all eggs out to one dimension. Each egg batch was taped to white paper and photographed in a UV imaging system (Syngene, Cambridge, England) against UV light (312 nm) coming from underneath the paper. A script for semi-automatic counts in ImageJ (Version 1.54 f, National Institutes of Health, USA) was developed and used for counting the exact number of eggs per picture (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). The code is available in the data and code repository.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Dual-choice and no-choice assays</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Plants</title><p>All plants were planted from seeds without the addition of fertilizer in plastic pots in standard red soil mixed with manure (ratio of 2:1) at the icipe campus in insect-proof greenhouses in Nairobi, Kenya. Maize plants (SC Duma 43, Seed Co Limited, Nairobi, Kenya) were used at the age of 3–7 weeks with five to eight fully grown leaves. It was observed that maize plants seemed to grow more slowly in Nairobi than in Mbita, which could be explained by the generally lower temperatures in Nairobi. The seeds of <italic>D. intortum</italic> and <italic>D. incanum</italic> were collected from a push-pull field located on the icipe campus in Mbita. These seeds were subsequently propagated through the replanting of cuttings, which were periodically trimmed to ensure healthy growth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Fall armyworm moths</title><p>To form the FAW colony, wild individuals were collected in Central Kenya such as in the counties Kiambu, Muranga, and Embu and restocked with wild individuals every three months. Larvae were reared on maize leaves, while moths were only fed with water. The colony was occasionally restocked with wild FAW moths. Each day after hatching, moths of both sexes were transferred to a cage to allow mating until the start of the experiment. At least 2 hr prior to the experiment, female moths were separated from males and placed in the darkened experimental room for adjustment to temperature and humidity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Dual-choice assay: experimental procedure</title><p>The five upper leaves of a maize plant were carefully wrapped in a preheated (200 °C for at least 1 hr) and cooled roasting bag (Sainsbury’s, London, UK) with the addition of approximately the same biomass of <italic>Desmodium</italic> on one side of a dual-choice assay setup (100 x 30 x 30 cm) and compared to a single maize plant wrapped in the same manner on the other side. Maize leaves were carefully curved without damaging them to fit into the bag, while the bag was secured to the bottom edge with little tension using plastic straps supplied with the oven bags. Control treatments were conducted with a single maize plant wrapped in this way on each side. Air was pushed with the help of a Volatile Collection Kit (B. J. Pye, Kings Walden, UK) through activated charcoal filters and into the roasting bag from the lower rim of the bag at a rate of 740–820 mL/min with a PTFE tube with a diameter of approximately 2 mm. A PTFE tube with a diameter of approximately 10 mm and a length of approximately 120 cm conveyed the plant volatiles from the top of the roasting bag to one side of the dual-choice assay. Inside the dual-choice assay, the air was pumped out from the center at the 0 cm mark resulting in an air stream at the air transfer tubing of both sides of the dual-choice assay setup. Airflow was measured each day on both sides using a portable flow meter (Vögtlin Instruments GmbH, Switzerland) and ranged between 480 and 570 mL/min across different days, with a maximum difference of 4 mL/min between the two sides. The higher incoming airflow created overpressure in the bags, which prevented unfiltered air from entering the dual-choice system. One female moth at an age of 4–5 days was released through a hole in the center at 0 cm and her flight behavior was observed for 5 min. The dual-choice assay was separated into five segments of 20 cm each, and a time stamp was set every time the moth changed segments (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). All experiments were conducted between 7 pm and 1:30 am under red light. Each trial was recorded on video using a mobile phone camera (Fairphone 4, 48 MP), which captured the dual-choice assay from a front view. The videos were re-watched for data acquisition and in cases where moths were barely visible, complemented with notes from the live observation. To simplify the data analysis, the two left segments (50–30 cm left and 30–10 cm left) were combined, as were the two right segments (10–30 cm right, 30–50 cm right). An equal number of repetitions for each treatment was conducted consecutively each night, with the order of treatments randomized. Changing each set of plants took on average 15 min, while the room was ventilated for at least 30 min with ambient air between treatment changes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>No-choice assay: experimental procedure</title><p>The five upper leaves of a maize plant were carefully wrapped in a preheated (100 °C for at least 1 hr) and cooled roasting bag (Sealapack, Manchester, UK) with the addition of approximately the same biomass of <italic>Desmodium</italic> on one side of a no-choice assay setup (115 x 33 x 33 cm). Maize leaves were carefully curved without damaging them to fit into the bag, while the bag was secured to the bottom edge with little tension using plastic straps supplied with the oven bags. Maize treatments were conducted with one maize plant only, and control treatments were performed with an empty roasting bag. Air was drawn through activated charcoal filters and directed into the roasting bag via a PTFE tube (approximately 2 mm in diameter) at a flow rate of 1.5 L/min, with the air entering the bag from its lower rim. This process was facilitated using a Volatile Collection Kit (B. J. Pye, Kings Walden, UK). A PTFE tube was used, with a diameter of approximately 2 mm and a length of 120 cm, to transport plant volatiles from the top of the roasting bag to the source on the side of the no-choice assay. On the opposite side, air was evacuated at the 0 cm mark, creating a uniform air stream that flowed across the entire chamber of the no-choice assay at 30 cm/s. The higher incoming airflow created overpressure in the bags, which prevented unfiltered air from entering the dual-choice system. One female moth aged 4–5 days was released through a hole in the center at 0 cm and its flight behavior was observed for 5 min. The initial and final landing distances were noted, while the last movement was determined by videos that were recorded for each repetition. In cases where moths were not visible or only partially visible, we recorded their last clearly observed position as the final location, assuming any significant movement would have been captured on video. All experiments were carried out between 9 pm and 1 am under red light conditions. The same set of plants was used for five repetitions, with a different moth individual introduced for each repetition. Treatments were carried out on separate evenings to avoid any cross-contamination or carryover effects. All repetitions of a single treatment were conducted on the same evening, except for the maize (alone) treatment, which was carried out across two evenings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis was performed in RStudio (R version 4.5.0, RStudio version 2024.12.1). Mixed models were used to determine significant effects of FAW egg positions in the oviposition bioassays, as well as the behavior of FAW moths in the dual-choice and no-choice assays. In the oviposition and dual-choice bioassays, control treatments with two maize plants were included. Therefore, the control replications were included twice in the dataset, once with the egg count data or the duration of stay of both sides interchanged. For the oviposition bioassay, the egg counts on the maize or the <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant were compared amongst all treatments, with the inclusion of the greenhouse, the cage (combination of the cage group and the cage number), the start date, and the replication number as random effects. For the dual-choice assay, the duration of stay closer to the maize or the <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants was compared amongst all treatments, with the inclusion of the date and the replication number as random effects. For the no-choice assay, the initial flight distance and the landing flight distance were compared amongst all treatment, with the inclusion of the date and the replication as random effects.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Senior editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-100981-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of push–pull studies on FAW and detailed list of detected volatile compounds.</title><p>Sheet &quot;Overview Studies&quot;: Study = Abbreviated name of the study.

This topic is interesting and the results are valuable for understanding the push-pull system for the management of FAW, the serious pest. The methodology used in this study is valid, leading to reliable results and conclusions. I just have a few concerns and suggestions for the improvement of this paper:</p><p>(1) The volatiles emitted from D. incanum were analyzed and their effects on the oviposition behavior of FAW moth were confirmed. However, it would be better and useful to identify the specific compounds that are crucial for the success of the push-pull system.</p><p>(2) That would be good to add &quot;symbols&quot; of significance in Figure 4 (D).</p><p>(3) Figure A is difficult for readers to understand.</p><p>(4) It will be good to deeply discuss the functions of important volatile compounds identified here with comparison with results in previous studies in the discussion better.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors addressed all my concerns, and I believe that the current version is appropriate for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100981.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Odermatt</surname><given-names>Daria M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qegss47</institution-id><institution>International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nairobi</named-content></addr-line><country>Kenya</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chidawanyika</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02crff812</institution-id><institution>University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zürich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mutyambai</surname><given-names>Daniel M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02crff812</institution-id><institution>University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zürich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schmid</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Domeignoz Horta</surname><given-names>Luiz A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Onjura</surname><given-names>Collins O</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qegss47</institution-id><institution>International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nairobi</named-content></addr-line><country>Kenya</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tamiru</surname><given-names>Amanuel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02crff812</institution-id><institution>University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zürich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schuman</surname><given-names>Meredith C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03qegss47</institution-id><institution>International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nairobi</named-content></addr-line><country>Kenya</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript of Odermatt et al. investigates the volatiles released by two species of <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants and the response of herbivores to maize plants alone or in combination with these species. The results show that <italic>Desmodium</italic> releases volatiles in both the laboratory and the field. Maize grown in the laboratory also released volatiles, in a similar range. While female moths preferred to oviposit on maize, the authors found no evidence that <italic>Desmodium</italic> volatiles played a role in lowering attraction to or oviposition on maize.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is a response to recently published papers that presented conflicting results with respect to whether <italic>Desmodium</italic> releases volatiles constitutively or in response to biotic stress, the level at which such volatiles are released, and the behavioral effect it has on the fall armyworm. These questions are relevant as <italic>Desmodium</italic> is used in a textbook example of pest-suppressive sustainable intercropping technology called push-pull, which has supported tens of thousands of smallholder farmers in suppressing moth pests in maize. A large number of research papers over more than two decades have implied that <italic>Desmodium</italic> suppresses herbivores in push-pull intercropping through the release of large amounts of volatiles that repel herbivores. This premise has been questioned in recent papers. Odermatt et al. thus contribute to this discussion by testing the role of odors in oviposition choice. The paper confirms that ovipositing FAW preferred maize, and also confirmed that odors released from <italic>Desmodium</italic> appeared not important in their bioassays.</p><p>The paper is a welcome addition to the literature and adds quality headspace analyses of <italic>Desmodium</italic> from the laboratory and the field. Furthermore, the authors, some of whom have since long contributed to developing push-pull, also find that <italic>Desmodium</italic> odors are not significant in their choice between maize plants. This advances our knowledge of the mechanisms through which push-pull suppresses herbivores, which is critically important to evolving the technique to fit different farming systems and translating this mechanism to fit with other crops and in other geographical areas.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your careful assessment of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Below I outline the major concerns:</p><p>(1) Clear induction of the experimental plants, and lack of reflective discussion around this: from literature data and previous studies of maize and <italic>Desmodium</italic>, it is clear that the plants used in this study, particularly the <italic>Desmodium</italic>, were induced. Maize appeared to be primarily manually damaged, possibly due to sampling (release of GLV, but little to no terpenoids, which is indicative of mostly physical stress and damage, for example, one of the coauthor's own paper Tamiru et al. 2011), whereas <italic>Desmodium</italic> releases a blend of many compounds (many terpenoids indicative of herbivore induction). Erdei et al. also clearly show that under controlled conditions maize, silver leaf and green leaf Desmodium release volatiles in very low amounts. While the condition of the plants in Odermatt et al. may be reflective of situations in push-pull fields, the authors should elaborate on the above in the discussion (see comments) such that the readers understand that the plant's condition during the experiments. This is particularly important because it has been assumed that <italic>Desmodium</italic> releases typical herbivore-induced volatiles constitutively, which is not the case (see Erdei et al. 2024). This reflection is currently lacking in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the need for a more reflective discussion on the possible causes of volatile emission due to physical damage. Although the field plants were carefully handled, it is possible that some physical stress may have contributed to the release of volatiles, such as green leaf volatiles (GLVs). We ensured the revised manuscript reflects this nuanced interpretation (lines 282 – 286). However, we also explained more clearly that our aim was to capture the volatile emission of plants used by farmers under realistic conditions and moth responses to these plants, not to be able to attribute the volatile emission to a specific cause (lines 115 – 117). We revised relevant passages throughout the results and discussion to ensure that we do not make any claims about the reason for volatile emissions, and that our claims regarding these plants and their headspace being representative of the system as practiced by farmers are supported. In the revised manuscript we provide a new supplementary table S2 that additionally shows the classification of the identified substances, which also shows that the majority of the substances that were found in the headspace of the sampled plants of <italic>Desmodium intortum</italic> or <italic>Desmodium incanum</italic> are monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, or aromatic compounds, and not GLVs (that are typically emitted following damage).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lack of controls that would have provided context to the data: The experiments lack important controls that would have helped in the interpretation:</p><p>2a The authors did not control the conditions of the plants. To understand the release of volatiles and their importance in the field, the authors should have included controlled herbivory in both maize and <italic>Desmodium</italic>. This would have placed the current volatile profiles in a herbivory context. Now the volatile measurements hang in midair, leading to discussions that are not well anchored (and should be rephrased thoroughly, see eg lines 183-188). It is well known that maize releases only very low levels of volatiles without abiotic and biotic stressors. However, this changes upon stress (GLVs by direct, physical damage and eg terpenoids upon herbivory, see above). Erdei et al. confirm this pattern in <italic>Desmodium</italic>. Not having these controls, means that the authors need to put the data in the context of what has been published (see above).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this concern. Our study aimed to capture the real-world conditions of push-pull fields, where <italic>Desmodium</italic> and maize grow in natural environments without the direct induction of herbivory for experimental purposes (lines 115 – 117). We agree that in further studies it would be important to carry out experiments under different environmental conditions, including herbivore damage. However, this was not within the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2b It would also have been better if the authors had sampled maize from the field while sampling <italic>Desmodium</italic>. Together with the above point (inclusion of herbivore-induced maize and <italic>Desmodium</italic>), the levels of volatile release by <italic>Desmodium</italic> would have been placed into context.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that sampling maize and other intercrop plants, such as edible legumes, alongside <italic>Desmodium</italic> in the push-pull field would have allowed us to make direct comparisons of the volatile profiles of different plants in the push-pull system under shared field conditions. Again, this should be done in future experiments but was beyond the scope of the present study. Due to the amount of samples we could handle given cost and workload, we chose to focus on <italic>Desmodium</italic> because there is much less literature on the volatile profiles of field-grown <italic>Desmodium</italic> than maize plants in the field: we are aware of one study attempting to measure field volatile profiles from <italic>Desmodium intortum</italic> (Erdei et al. 2024) and no study attempting this for <italic>Desmodium incanum</italic>. We pointed out this justification for our focus on <italic>Desmodium</italic> in the manuscript (lines 435 - 439). Additionally, we suggested in the discussion that future studies should measure volatile profiles from all plants commonly used in push-pull systems alongside <italic>Desmodium</italic> (lines 267 – 269).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2c To put the volatiles release in the context of push-pull, it would have been important to sample other plants which are frequently used as intercrop by smallholder farmers, but which are not considered effective as push crops, particularly edible legumes. Sampling the headspace of these plants, both 'clean' and herbivore-induced, would have provided a context to the volatiles that <italic>Desmodium</italic> (induced) releases in the field - one would expect unsuccessful push crops to not release any of these 'bioactive' volatiles (although 'bioactive' should be avoided) if these odors are responsible for the pest suppressive effect of <italic>Desmodium</italic>. Many edible intercrops have been tested to increase the adoption of push-pull technology but with little success.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much agree that such measurements are important for the longer-term research program in this field. But again, for the current study this would have exploded the size of the required experiment. Regarding bioactivity, we have been careful to use the phrase &quot;potentially bioactive&quot; solely when referring to findings from the literature (lines 99–103), in order to avoid making any definitive claims about our own results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because of the lack of the above, the conclusions the authors can draw from their data are weakened. The data are still valuable in the current discussion around push-pull, provided that a proper context is given in the discussion along the points above.</p></disp-quote><p>We think our revisions made the specific aims of this study more explicit and help to avoid misleading claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) 'Tendency' of the authors to accept the odor hypothesis (i.e. that <italic>Desmodium</italic> odors are responsible for repelling FAW and thereby reduce infestation in maize under push-pull management) in spite of their own data: The authors tested the effects of odor in oviposition choice, both in a cage assay and in a 'wind tunnel'. From the cage experiments, it is clear that FAW preferred maize over <italic>Desmodium</italic>, confirming other reports (including Erdei et al. 2024). However, when choosing between two maize plants, one of which was placed next to <italic>Desmodium</italic> to which FAW has no tactile (taste, structure, etc), FAW chose equally. Similarly in their wind tunnel setup (this term should not be used to describe the assay, see below), no preference was found either between maize odor in the presence or absence of <italic>Desmodium</italic>. This too confirms results obtained by Erdei et al. (but add an important element to it by using <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants that had been induced and released volatiles, contrary to Erdei et al. 2024). Even though no support was found for repellency by <italic>Desmodium</italic> odors, the authors in many instances in the manuscript (lines 30-33, 164-169, 202, 279, 284, 304-307, 311-312, 320) appear to elevate non-significant tendencies as being important. This is misleading readers into thinking that these interactions were significant and in fact confirming this in the discussion. The authors should stay true to their own data obtained when testing the hypothesis of whether odors play a role in the pest-suppressive effect of push-pull.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback and agree that we may have overstated claims that could not be supported by strict significance tests. However, we believe that non-significant tendencies can still provide valuable insights. In the revised version of the manuscript, we ensured a clear distinction between statistically significant findings and non-significant trends and remove any language that may imply stronger support for the odor hypothesis than what the data show in all the lines that were mentioned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Oviposition bioassay: with so many assays in close proximity, it is hard to certify that the experiments are independent. Please discuss this in the appropriate place in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have pointed this out in the submitted manuscript in lines 275 – 279. Furthermore, we included detailed captions to figure 4 - supporting figure 3 &amp; figure 4 - supporting figure 4. We are aware that in all such experiments there is a danger of between-treatment interference, which we pointed out for our specific case. We stated that with our experimental setup we tried to minimize interference between treatments by spacing and temporal staggering. We would like to point out that this common caveat does not invalidate experimental designs when practicing replication and randomization. We assume that insects are able to select suitable oviposition sites in the background of such confounding factors under realistic conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The wind tunnel has a number of issues (besides being poorly detailed):</p><p>5a. The setup which the authors refer to as a 'wind tunnel' does not qualify as a wind tunnel. First, there is no directional flow: there are two flows entering the setup at opposite sides. Second, the flow is way too low for moths to orient in (in a wind tunnel wind should be presented as a directional cue. Only around 1.5 l/min enters the wind tunnel in a volume of 90 l approximately, which does not create any directional flow. Solution: change 'wind tunnel' throughout the text to a dual choice setup /assay.)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these criticisms and changed the terminology accordingly from ‘wind tunnel’ to ‘dual choice assay’. We have now conducted an additional experiment which we called ‘no-choice assay’ that provides conditions closer to a true wind tunnel. The setup of the added experiment features an odor entry point at only one side of the chamber to create a more directional airflow. Each treatment (maize alone, maize + <italic>D. intortum</italic>, maize + <italic>D. incanum</italic>, and a control with no plants) was tested separately, with only one treatment conducted per evening to avoid cross-contamination, as described in the methods section of the no-choice assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5b. There is no control over the flows in the flight section of the setup. It is very well possible that moths at the release point may only sense one of the 'options'. Please discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this to the discussion (lines 369 – 374). The new no-choice assays also address this concern by using a setup with laminar flow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5c. Too low a flow (1,5 l per minute) implies a largely stagnant air, which means cross-contamination between experiments. An experiment takes 5 minutes, but it takes minimally 1.5 hours at these flows to replace the flight chamber air (but in reality much longer as the fresh air does not replace the old air, but mixes with it). The setup does not seem to be equipped with e.g. fans to quickly vent the air out of the setup. See comments in the text. Please discuss the limitations of the experimental setup at the appropriate place in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We added these limitations to the discussion and addressed these concerns with new experiments (see answer 5a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5d. The stimulus air enters through a tube (what type of tube, diameter, length, etc) containing pressurized air how was the air obtained into bags (type of bag, how is it sealed?), and the efflux directly into the flight chamber (how, nozzle?). However, it seems that there is no control of the efflux. How was leakage prevented, particularly how the bags were airtight sealed around the plants?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the missing information to the methods and provided details about types of bags, manufacturers, and pre-treatments in the method section. In short, PTFE tubes connected bagged plants to the bioassay setup and air was pumped in at an overpressure, so leakage was not eliminated but contamination from ambient air was avoided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5e. The plants were bagged in very narrowly fitting bags. The maize plants look bent and damaged, which probably explains the GLVs found in the samples. The <italic>Desmodium</italic> in the picture (Figure 5 supplement, which we should assume is at least a representative picture?) appears to be rather crammed into the bag with maize and looks in rather poor condition to start with (perhaps also indicating why they release these volatiles?). It would be good to describe the sampling of the plants in detail and explain that the way they were handled may have caused the release of GLVs.</p></disp-quote><p>We included a more detailed description of the plant handling and bagging processes to the methods to clarify how the plants were treated during the dual-choice and the no-choice assays reported in the revised manuscript. We politely disagree that the maize plants were damaged and the <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants not representative of those encountered in the field. The plants were grown in insect-proof screen houses to prevent damage by insects and carefully curved without damaging them to fit into the bag. The <italic>Desmodium</italic> plant pictured was <italic>D. incanum</italic>, which has sparser foliage and smaller leaves than <italic>D. intortum</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 1 seems redundant as a main figure in the text. Much of the information is not pertinent to the paper. It can be used in a review on the topic. Or perhaps if the authors strongly wish to keep it, it could be placed in the supplemental material.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that Figure 1 provides essential information about the push-pull system and the FAW. To our knowledge, this partly contradictory evidence so far has not been synthesized in the literature. We realize that such a figure would more commonly be provided in a review article, but we do not think that the small number of studies on this topic so far justify a stand-alone review. Instead, the introduction to our manuscript includes a brief review of these few studies, complemented by the visual summary provided in Figure 1 and a detailed supplementary table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Based on the controversy of whether the <italic>Desmodium</italic> intercrop emits bioactive volatiles that repel the fall armyworm, the authors conducted this study to assess the effects of the volatiles from <italic>Desmodium</italic> plants in the push-pull system on behavior of FAW oviposition. This topic is interesting and the results are valuable for understanding the push-pull system for the management of FAW, the serious pest. The methodology used in this study is valid, leading to reliable results and conclusions. I just have a few concerns and suggestions for improvement of this paper:</p><p>(1) The volatiles emitted from D. incanum were analyzed and their effects on the oviposition behavior of FAW moth were confirmed. However, it would be better and useful to identify the specific compounds that are crucial for the success of the push-pull system.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that identifying specific volatile compounds responsible for the push-pull effect would provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of the system. However, the primary focus of this study was to address the still unresolved question whether <italic>Desmodium</italic> emits detectable or “significant” amounts of volatiles at all under field conditions, and the secondary aim was to test whether we could demonstrate a behavioral effect of <italic>Desmodium</italic> headspace on FAW moths. Before conducting our experiments, we carefully considered the option of using single volatile compounds and synthetic blends in bioassays. We decided against this because we judged that the contradictory evidence in the literature was not a sufficient basis for composing representative blends. Furthermore, we think it is an important first step to test f. or behavioral responses to the headspaces of real plants. We consider bioassays with pure compounds to be important for confirmation and more detailed investigation in future studies. There was also contradictory evidence in the literature regarding moth responses to plants. We thus opted to focus on experiments with whole plants to maintain ecological relevance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) That would be good to add &quot;symbols&quot; of significance in Figure 4 (D).</p></disp-quote><p>We report the statistical significance of the parameters in Figure 4 (D) in Table 3, which shows the mixed model applied for oviposition bioassays. While testing significance between groups is a standard approach, we used a more robust model-based analysis to assess the effects of multiple factors simultaneously. We provided a cross-reference to Table 3 from the figure description of Figure 4 (D) for readers to easily find the statistical details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure A is difficult for readers to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, it is not entirely clear which specific figure is being referred to as &quot;Figure A&quot; in this comment.

Therefore, we prefer to refrain from detailed discussions of the potential importance of individual compounds.

Later, Molasses grass was replaced by desmodiums because it is a legume that fixes nitrogen and therefore can increase nitrate levels in the soil, but most importantly because it prevents germination of the parasitic Striga weed. The possible repellent effect of desmodium on pests and attraction of natural enemies was never properly tested but assumed, probably to still be able to use the push-pull terminology. This &quot;mistake&quot; should be recognized here and in future publications. It is a real pity that the controversy over the repellent effect of desmodium distracts from the amazing success of the push-pull system, also against the fall armyworm.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these issues, which are part of the reason for our Figure 1 and why we would like to keep it.
