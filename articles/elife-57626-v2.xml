Using the multimammate mouse <italic>Mastomys coucha</italic> as preclinical model, this is the first study demonstrating seroconversion against different L1 isoforms during the natural course of papillomavirus infection. Intriguingly, positivity with the cutaneous MnPV was accompanied by a strong seroresponse against a longer L1 isoform, but to our surprise, the raised antibodies were non-neutralizing. Only after a delay of around 4 months, protecting antibodies against the short L1 appeared, enabling the virus to successfully establish an infection. This argues for a novel humoral immune escape mechanism that may also have important implications on the interpretation of epidemiological data in terms of seropositivity and protection of PV infections in general.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is not one disease but rather a collection of disorders. As such there are many reasons why someone may develop cancer during their lifetime, including the individual’s family history, lifestyle and habits. Infections with certain viruses can also lead to cancer and human papillomaviruses are viruses that establish long-term infections that may result in cancers including cervical and anal cancer, and the most common form of cancer worldwide, non-melanoma skin cancer.</p><p>The human papillomavirus, or HPV for short, is made up of DNA surrounded by a protective shell, which contains many repeats of a protein called L1. These L1 proteins stick to the surfaces of human cells, allowing the virus to get access inside, where it can replicate before spreading to new cells. The immune system responds strongly to HPV infections by releasing antibodies that latch onto L1 proteins. It was therefore not clear how HPV could establish the long-term infections and cause cancer when it was seeming being recognized by the immune system.</p><p>Now, Fu et al. have used the Southern multimammate mouse, <italic>Mastomys coucha</italic>, as a model system for an HPV infection to uncover how papillomaviruses can avoid the immune response. This African rodent is naturally infected with a skin papillomavirus called MnPV which, like its counterpart in humans, can trigger the formation of skin warts and malignant skin tumors.</p><p>Fu et al. took blood samples from animals that had been infected with the virus over a period of 76 weeks to monitor their immune response overtime. This revealed that, in the early stages of infection, the virus made longer-than-normal versions of the L1 protein. Further analysis showed that these proteins could not form the virus’s protective shell but could trigger the animals to produce antibodies against them. Fu et al. went on to show that the antibodies that recognized the longer variants of L1 protein where “non-neutralizing”, meaning that could not block the spread of the virus, which is a prerequisite for immunity. It was only after a delay of four months that the animals started making neutralizing antibodies that were directed against the shorter L1 proteins that actually makes up the virus’s protective coat.</p><p>These findings suggest that virus initially uses the longer version of the L1 protein as a decoy to circumvent the attention of the immune system and provide itself with enough time to establish an infection. The findings also have implications for other studies that have sought to assess the success of an immune response during a papillomavirus infection. Specifically, the delayed production of the neutralizing antibodies means that their presence does not necessarily indicate that a patient is not already infected by a papillomavirus that in the future may cause cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mastomys coucha</kwd><kwd>papillomavirus</kwd><kwd>immune escape</kwd><kwd>seroconversion</kwd><kwd>neutralization</kwd><kwd>virus-like particle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Yingying</given-names></name><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>031L0095B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name><name><surname>Rösl</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008672</institution-id><institution>Wilhelm Sander-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018.093.1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schäfer</surname><given-names>Miriam</given-names></name><name><surname>Hasche</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008672</institution-id><institution>Wilhelm Sander-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2010.019.1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vinzón</surname><given-names>Sabrina E</given-names></name><name><surname>Rösl</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cutaneous papillomaviruses potentially escape humoral immune response by synthesizing an alternative major capsid protein isoform during the initial course of infection that is unable to induce neutralizing antibodies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are widely distributed in nature and more than 220 types were sequenced up to date (PaVE: Papillomavirus Episteme). They cannot only be divided in mucosal and cutaneous types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bzhalava et al., 2013</xref>), but also whether the infection is acquired, for example via sexual intercourse (as for high-risk genital HPVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gravitt and Winer, 2017</xref>) or whether a commensal cohabitation (as for cutaneous HPVs) occurred shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonsson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weissenborn et al., 2009</xref>). Depending on environmental factors (e.g. chronic UV exposure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rollison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Uberoi et al., 2016</xref>), the individual immune status (e.g. systemic immunosuppression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reusser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vinzón and Rösl, 2015</xref>) or genetic predispositions (e.g. EVER1/2 mutations in <italic>Epidermodysplasia verruciformis</italic> patients) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Jong et al., 2018</xref>), commensal cutaneous papillomaviruses can induce hyperproliferative lesions (e.g. actinic keratosis) which may progress to squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hasche et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The African multimammate rodent <italic>Mastomys coucha</italic> represents a unique model system to investigate the consequences of a natural PV infection in the context of skin carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasche and Rösl, 2019</xref>). The animals become infected with <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic> papillomavirus (MnPV) soon after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schäfer et al., 2011</xref>) and seroconversion against viral proteins can be detected shortly afterwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schäfer et al., 2010</xref>). MnPV is a typical cutaneous PV that resembles human β-types by lacking an E5 open-reading frame (ORF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 1994</xref>). Characterization of the viral transcriptome in productive lesions revealed a complex splicing pattern with different promoters and transcriptional start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salvermoser et al., 2016</xref>), also described for some HPV types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sankovski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2011</xref>) or for the mouse papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xue et al., 2017</xref>). Most of these transcripts are polycistronic, allowing (at least hypothetically) the translation of several different ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salvermoser et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Using <italic>Mastomys coucha</italic> as a preclinical model, we could show that immunization with MnPV virus-like-particles (VLPs) induces a long-lasting neutralizing antibody response that completely prevents the appearance of skin lesions both under immunocompetent and immunosuppressed conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vinzón et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Mastomys coucha</italic> also represents a paradigm for SCC development in the context of MnPV infection and UV exposure, thereby reflecting many aspects found in humans where a ‘hit-and-run’ mechanism during carcinogenesis is supposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasche et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hasche et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Virions of PVs consist of 72 pentamers of the major (L1) protein together with up to 72 molecules of the minor (L2) capsid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hagensee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang and Roden, 2013</xref>). The L1 protein has the capability to spontaneously form regular structures (capsomers), triggered by a thermodynamically favored self-assembly process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McManus et al., 2016</xref>). Due to their repetitive structures, PV particles are very immunogenic and induce the generation of neutralizing antibodies that block viral entry into the host cell via binding to conformational epitopes on the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kwak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang and Roden, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Considering the cross-talk between viral infections and the immune system, PVs have developed multiple strategies to escape from immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bordignon et al., 2017</xref>). While there is plenty of information about how innate immunity as the first line of defense is circumvented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christensen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smola et al., 2017</xref>), less is known about the humoral immune response in terms of generation of protecting antibodies during the natural course of a PV infection.</p><p>In the present study, we show that MnPV, as a rodent equivalent for cutaneous PVs in humans, induces a strong seroconversion in its natural host early after infection. However, the raised antibodies are non-neutralizing and directed against a longer isoform of the L1 protein which is unable to assemble into viral particles. Only after a delay of around 4 months after infection, protecting antibodies appear. This argues for a novel PV immune escape mechanism, probably providing a selective advantage to establish an efficient infection. We characterized this mechanism in greater detail since it may also have important implications in understanding the humoral immune response during a normal infection cycle in general.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Alternative translation initiation codons of the PV L1 ORF</title><p>Based on two previous studies comparing the presence of initiation codons within the papillomavirus L1 ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Webb et al., 2005</xref>), their position was aligned according to the PV genera derivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bzhalava et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van Doorslaer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Notably, alternative ATGs can be found in various mucosal ‘high-risk’ HPV types such as 16, 18, 45, 52, 56, 58, but not in ‘low-risk’ types such as HPV6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Webb et al., 2005</xref>). Additional in-frame initiation codons can also be detected in cutaneous HPV types of several genera such as HPV1, 2, 8, 38, 41, 57 and 77, respectively, of which HPV8 and HPV38 are considered to be ‘high-risk’ cutaneous HPVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rollison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tommasino, 2017</xref>). Accordingly, due to the presence of potential alternative translation initiation sites, different L1 isoforms could be translated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, almost all outlined PV L1 proteins harbor a consensus Wx<sub>7</sub>YLPP motif within the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joh et al., 2014</xref>), independently from PV genus or cancer risk assessment, while the remaining N-terminal sequences are not very conserved. For the majority of PV types, the nearest methionine codon to this motif is located one to three amino acids upstream of the tryptophan (W) in the consensus motif. However, there are also exceptions from this rule since HPV31, 35 and 51, for instance, harbor one additional ATG followed by an interspersed in-frame TAA stop codon, thereby probably preventing the synthesis of additional L1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Webb et al., 2005</xref>). Intriguingly, the MnPV L1 ORF also contains three alternative ATGs, which are located at nucleotide positions (nt) 5704, 5725 and 5797, potentially leading to the expression of L1<sub>LONG</sub>, L1<sub>MIDDLE</sub> and L1<sub>SHORT</sub> proteins, respectively.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Alignment of L1 sequences from different PV types.</title><p>N-terminal sequences of L1 proteins from 29 PV types were aligned using Clustal Omega.

Since most serological detection methods developed to date are based on the L1<sub>SHORT</sub> isoform, firstly we examined seroconversion against L1<sub>SHORT</sub> by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-capture ELISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kricker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sehr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Waterboer et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, only few animals (8/60) exhibited measurable seroresponses against L1<sub>SHORT,</sub> initially at an age of 28 weeks. The mean seroreactivity per time point exceeded the cut-off earliest at an age of 68 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Conversely, in 27.5% of the animals, broad seroresponses against MnPV L1<sub>LONG</sub> were already detectable as early as 8 weeks of age which increased to 52.5% of the animals at 76 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the main comparison at the latest time point where most animals were still alive (68 weeks), a significant difference was observed (p&lt;0.001, two-tailed McNemar’s test, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Despite plenty of seroepidemiological studies on HPV, to our knowledge, seroresponses against different L1 isoforms have never been performed.

To address this issue, pseudovirion-based infection assays were performed. Here, only sera binding L1<sub>SHORT</sub> inhibited pseudovirion infection, while sera recognizing the L1<sub>LONG</sub> and L1<sub>MIDDLE</sub> isoforms were not neutralizing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to L1<sub>SHORT</sub>, the longer isoforms were also not able to form intact viral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, the time course of MnPV E2 seroreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) in comparison to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is indicative for viral replication and spread of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schäfer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore reasonable to assume that the delay of neutralization capacity apparently allows the virus to accumulate. Pointing in this direction is also the kinetics of seroconversion against the L2 minor capsid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), finally assembling with L1 to form new infectious progeny virions at the end of the permissive cycle. Moreover, the correlation of the different ELISAs showed an obvious consistency between VLP and GST-L1<sub>SHORT</sub> that is not maintained when VLP or GST-L1<sub>SHORT</sub> are compared with GST-L1<sub>LONG</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>As reported from mice immunized with recombinant HPV VLPs, neutralizing antibodies act via binding to linear or conformational epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Combita et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Senger et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Although most high-affinity neutralizing antibodies bind to conformation-dependent epitopes, antibodies recognizing linear epitopes can be raised against improperly maturated VLPs (used for immunization) or virions (in the course of a natural infection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Senger et al., 2009a</xref>). Similar to HPV16 L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bissett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), immunodominant epitopes could be identified within the DE and FG loops of MnPV L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), known to form highly immunogenic conformational epitopes on the surface of virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we identified a novel epitope in the N-terminal region of L1, spanning at least some of the residues exclusive for L1<sub>LONG</sub> and extending to the first amino acids from L1<sub>SHORT</sub>. Seroconversion against this peptide (referred to as L1<sub>LONG</sub>aa1-41 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) followed roughly the same kinetics as L1<sub>LONG</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and most L1<sub>LONG</sub>-positive sera recognized these 41 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, all sera only positive for L1<sub>LONG</sub>, but negative for L1<sub>SHORT</sub> did not neutralize PsVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and further lost their ability to bind to L1<sub>LONG</sub> when the antigen was denatured prior to the ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Hence, the addition of N-terminal residues to L1<sub>SHORT</sub>, obviously leads to a distinct folding of L1<sub>LONG</sub>, thereby forming a new conformational epitope, which is not present in L1<sub>SHORT</sub>-derived VLPs and natural virions that do not induce such antibodies upon immunization or infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Due to the fast kinetics of seroconversion against L1<sub>LONG</sub>, this conformational epitope is apparently the predominant immunogenic structure in L1<sub>LONG</sub> and most probably masks neutralization epitopes that would be accessible in VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, in the case of HPV16 L1, the length of the N-terminus is decisive for efficient and correct assembly of L1 into VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2000</xref>). Consistently, neither MnPV L1<sub>LONG</sub> nor L1<sub>MIDDLE</sub> formed particles in the right size and shape in insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), a finding also reported for the mouse papillomavirus MmuPV L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joh et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, while co-expression of MnPV L1<sub>SHORT</sub> and L2 results in well-shaped infective pseudovirions, L1<sub>LONG</sub> and L1<sub>MIDDLE</sub> strikingly inhibited pseudovirion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), suggesting that the N-terminus is literally hindering the assembly of both isoforms to capsids. Previously, crystallization of HPV L1 for 3D structure determination was not successful with the ‘usual’ L1 (being L1<sub>SHORT</sub>) but required its N-terminal truncation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2000</xref>), probably because the crystallization conditions lead to a folding of the N-terminus that prevents particle formation. Therefore, even the most complete 3D model 3J6R for HPV16 L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardone et al., 2014</xref>) lacks eight N-terminal residues. It was speculated that the N-terminus of L1 fills a gap in interpentameric structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) and since N-terminal deletion of eight residues has such a big impact on particle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2000</xref>) it is likely that the additional 31 residues do not fit into this gap and furthermore completely sterically hinder L1 assembly. Additionally, the extended N-terminus not only inhibits assembly, but also causes a complete new folding of L1, thereby exposing a novel immunogenic conformational epitope that induces non-protective antibodies.</p><p>Nonetheless, using <italic>Mastomys</italic>-derived cells as genuine in vitro system to monitor expression of the three MnPV L1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), we found that L1<sub>SHORT</sub> but not the larger isoforms are recognized by mAb 2D11, confirming the presence of conformational epitopes found in capsomers. Importantly, this experiment also showed that L1<sub>LONG</sub> and L1<sub>SHORT</sub> ORFs are functional in a polycistronic setting and can be translated in <italic>Mastomys</italic> cells.</p><p>PV late gene expression is tightly regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham, 2017</xref>). The MnPV transcription map obtained from skin lesions revealed L1 transcripts to be the most abundant in productive infections, which are encoded by polycistronic mRNAs (coding for E1^E4, L2 and L1) exclusively controlled by the late viral promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salvermoser et al., 2016</xref>). However, speculating about the mode of L1 isoform regulation, the following scenario could be envisioned: late PV transcripts are known to be strongly upregulated upon keratinocyte differentiation. However, due to insufficient suppressed late viral promoter activity, late transcripts can already be detected in undifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Songock et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, in contrast to mucosal types (e.g. HPV11, 16 and COPV), cutaneous papillomaviruses (e.g. HPV1, 2 and BPV1) initiate their late functions in the lower epithelial regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peh et al., 2002</xref>). Consequently, this could lead to synthesis of the highly immunogenic L1<sub>SHORT</sub> already in early stages of infection, giving rise to neutralizing antibodies, thereby counteracting the permissive cycle and in turn the viral spread. However, the predicted presence of a stronger Kozak sequence in a upstream ORF from the conventional L1 (L1<sub>SHORT</sub>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), generates an alternative longer isoform of L1 which is expressed already in basal and suprabasal layers of MnPV-induced lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) and similar to the pattern of L1 mRNA expression in MmuPV1-induced papillomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xue et al., 2017</xref>). This L1<sub>LONG</sub> isoform is also immunogenic but does not raise neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>Conversely and in agreement with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biryukov and Meyers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borgogna et al., 2014</xref>), capsid formation could only be found in the granular and uppermost layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), which are less accessible for immune effector cells. However, based on in silico prediction, the capsid-forming L1<sub>SHORT</sub> cannot be efficiently translated from polycistronic transcripts coding for E1^E4, L2 and L1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), reinforcing the existence of a transcript in which the splicing acceptor is located immediately upstream of the L1<sub>SHORT</sub> AUG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salvermoser et al., 2016</xref>). This splicing event is more tightly regulated than late promoter activity, based on a splicing silencer sequence suppressing the use of this site during mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, only the combination of splicing regulation and the presence of favored ORFs ensure L1<sub>SHORT</sub> synthesis in upper layers of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>). This may allow a better escape from immune surveillance until the regular permissive cycle is completed.</p><p>Finally, the question remains why only certain PVs produce an immunogenic L1 isoform that is not needed for its own life cycle. Considering a virus-host interaction as consequence of an evolutionary process, there is a sophisticated balance between host immune surveillance and immune escape by the respective virus to ensure virus progeny production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">French and Holmes, 2020</xref>). The temporal and spatial change of such an equilibrium in favor to infection determines the efficiency of viral accumulation and maturation as well as the spread to infect another host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rothenburg and Brennan, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The occurrence of several L1 ORFs is not a peculiarity of MnPV, but also found in different HPV genera as well as in animal papillomaviruses such as MmuPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Webb et al., 2005</xref>). It is intriguing that alternative ORFs are mostly present in mucosal ‘high-risk’ HPV types that cause clinical symptoms, but not in ‘low-risk’ types such as HPV6 and 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Webb et al., 2005</xref>). Hence, there must be a selection pressure to maintain several L1 initiation codons in these PVs types, thereby allowing the synthesis of different isoforms to get an advantage for the virus.</p><p>Naturally occurring mutations within neutralizing epitopes that reduce the antigenicity of HPV L1 and L2 proteins may contribute to humoral immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). Such L1 variants, isolated from premalignant HPV16 positive cervical tissue, showed impaired viral capsid assembly that can influence both B cell class switching and the production of non-neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, assembly-defective HPV16 VLPs impair the activation of dendritic cells that play a decisive role in activating adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2005</xref>).

For the denatured VLP-ELISA, further steps were carried out according to the VLP-ELISA protocol described above. Denatured GST-ELISA antigens were then directly coated onto the ELISA plates overnight at 37°C and further steps (blocking, washing, incubation with sera, color reaction) were carried out according to the GST-ELISA protocol. The five monoclonal MnPV anti-L1<sub>SHORT</sub> antibodies mAb2E2, mAb2D6, mAb2D11, mAb5E5 and mAb3H8 (reactivities shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) were generated via hybridoma technique from BALB/c mice vaccinated with MnPV L1<sub>SHORT</sub>-VLPs and were used together with a <italic>Mastomys</italic> serum mix (sera from five tumor-bearing animals) as controls for denaturation conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Peptide arrays</title><p>The peptide array (PEPperPRINT GmbH, Germany) was produced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stadler et al., 2008</xref>). The amino acid sequence of MnPV L1 was elongated with neutral GSGSGSG linkers at the C- and N-termini to avoid truncated peptides. Elongated antigen sequences were translated into 15 aa peptides with peptide-peptide overlaps of 14 aa. The resulting peptide microarray contained 530 different overlapping L1 peptides printed in duplicates and framed by additional HA (YPYDVPDYAG, 86 spots) control peptides. The peptide array was incubated for 10 min in PBST, followed by incubation in Rockland Blocking Buffer MB-070 (RBB; Rockland Immunochemicals, USA) for 1 hr. After short rinsing with PBST, the array was incubated for 16 hr at 4°C with <italic>Mastomys</italic> serum mix at a dilution of 1:300 in 10% RBB in PBST. The array was washed three times for 1 min with PBST and then incubated for 1 hr at RT with 0.2 µg/ml 10% RBB in PBST goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc) DyLight680 (Rockland Immunochemicals, USA). Subsequently, the array was washed three times for 1 min with PBST and rinsed with 1 mM TRIS-HCL pH7.4. As peptide controls, HA peptide spots were stained with monoclonal mouse-anti-HA IgG antibody (12CA5, kindly provided by Dr. G. Moldenhauer, DKFZ) conjugated with DyLight800 (Lightning-Link, Innova Biosciences, UK), followed by washing as described above. The antibody was diluted to 1 µg/ml in 10% RBB in PBST and staining was performed for 1 hr at RT in the dark followed by washing as described above. After drying of the array, fluorescence images were acquired with an Odyssey Infrared Imager (LICOR, USA) at a resolution of 21 µm. Scanner sensitivity was set to 7.0 for the 700 and 800 nm channels respectively, the focal plane was set to +0.8 mm. Quantification of spot intensities, based on 16-bit gray scale tiff files and microarray image analysis, via PepSlide Analyzer (SICASYS Software GmbH, Germany). A software algorithm breaks down fluorescence intensities of each spot into raw, foreground and background signal, and calculates averaged median foreground intensities and spot-to-spot deviations of spot duplicates. Averaged spot intensities of the assays with the sample were plotted against the antigen sequence from N- to C-terminus to visualize overall spot intensities and signal-to-noise ratios (intensity plot).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Pseudovirion production</title><p>Pseudovirions were produced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buck and Thompson, 2007</xref>). 293TT cells were co-transfected by calcium phosphate transfection with plasmids encoding humanized MnPV L1 isoforms (L1<sub>LONG</sub>, L1<sub>MIDDLE</sub> and L1<sub>SHORT</sub>), L2 and a reporter plasmid encoding Gaussia luciferase. The 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> ATG of L1<sub>LONG</sub> and the 2<sup>nd</sup> ATG of L1<sub>MIDDLE</sub> were mutated to GCG (alanine) to exclusively guarantee L1<sub>LONG</sub> or L1<sub>MIDDLE</sub> expression.

After incubation at 27°C for 5 hr, cells were washed twice and then cultured for 6 days in supplemented TNM-FH medium (Sigma). One ml supernatant was used for generation of a high-titer baculovirus stock by infecting 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> Sf9 cells in a T25 flask followed by virus amplification for 6 days. This step was repeated with the obtained supernatant two times with increasing cell numbers (3 ml supernatant for 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells in a T75 flask and 5 ml supernatant for 2.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells in a T175 flask).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Margaret Stanley as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Neil Christensen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates the serological response to the major coat protein L1 throughout the life cycle of a natural papillomavirus infection the multimammate mouse <italic>Mastomys</italic>. Three alternative translation initiation codons of the L1 ORF are found in <italic>Mastomys</italic>. Depending upon which ATG is used three isoforms of L1 can be expressed L1 long, L1 middle, L1 short. This study and others confirm that these isoforms are differentially expressed both temporally and spatially; only L1 short is expressed late in the infectious cycle in the upper layers of the epithelium and elicits neutralising antibody. L1 long and middle are expressed early in the infectious cycle in the lower epithelial layers but induce predominantly non neutralising antibody. The authors propose that L1 long and middle antibody responses are a viral immune evasion strategy but no mechanisms for this are described. However the study is well-conceived, the findings are novel and unexpected and will provoke interest and further experimentation.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>The reviews are favourable and the paper can be published in <italic>eLife</italic> but the authors should address the following comments and clearly identify in the text that their assertions that the responses they observe are an immune evasion mechanism is a speculation not an established fact.</p><p>1) In the correlation analyses in Figure 3 and 4, please indicate the animal's age for the sera used.</p><p>2) In Figure 4B, there appear to be only 8 data points, while the figure legend states that the sera from 60 animals were evaluated.

However, we added the information:</p><p>“All graphs include the analysis of all 682 sera taken during the study”.</p><p>The correlation analyses in Figure 4 contain fewer animals that nevertheless again represent the complete age range. We added this information:</p><p>“Correlation analyses contain sera from animals representing the complete age range”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 4B, there appear to be only 8 data points, while the figure legend states that the sera from 60 animals were evaluated. Please reconcile.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the confusion which is attributable to a technical issue: The 60 sera were applied in serial dilution steps of one to three in both Pseudovirion-based Neutralization Assay (PBNA) and VLP-ELISA. Since the titers represent the last reciprocal serum dilution above the blank (for VLP-ELISA) and the reciprocal of the highest dilution that reduces the signal by at least 50% (for neutralization assay), several sera end up at the same titer. In the graph showing the correlation between the VLP-ELISA and the neutralization assay (Figure 4B), these 60 data points subsequently overlay, ending up with only eight visible points. However, to avoid confusion, we added following statement to the legend of Figure 4:</p><p>“Please note, that for both assays all 294 sera were diluted in three-fold dilution steps. Since the titers were calculated from the dilution, data points of different sera overlay when having the same titer in both assays.”</p><p>Furthermore, we also added the following sentence in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>“The neutralization titer represents the reciprocal of the highest dilution that reduces the signal by at least 50%.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Mapping of immunodominant epitopes in MnPV L1”: Why were sera from tumor bearing animals used here? Is there any data on whether tumor-bearing and tumor free animals differ in virus antibody responses?</p></disp-quote><p>The answer of the latter question is “yes” and this was the reason why sera from tumor-bearing animals were used. As shown in our previous studies (Schäfer et al., 2011, Vinzón et al., 2014), there is a quite obvious relationship of the higher levels of antibodies against L1<sub>LONG/SHORT</sub> and the presence of skin lesions in which infectious progeny viruses are formed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 6 legend, last sentence: change to &quot;GST-L1LONGaa1-41”, as indicate correctly in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the typo and changed it to GST-L1<sub>LONG</sub>aa1-41 accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discussion paragraph seven: the N-terminus in long L1 must do more that block capsomer assembly because capsomers can induce neutralizing antibodies but long L1 cannot. It must induce a remarkable change in L1 monomer conformation.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we mentioned that point already: “Hence, the addition of N-terminal residues to L1<sub>SHORT</sub> obviously leads to a distinct folding of L1<sub>LONG</sub>, thereby forming a new conformational epitope which is not present in L1<sub>SHORT</sub>-derived VLPs and natural virions that do not induce such antibodies upon immunization or infection (Figure 6C).”</p><p>To emphasize this finding, we included the following statement: “Additionally, the extended N-terminus not only inhibits assembly, but also causes a complete new folding of L1, thereby exposing a novel immunogenic conformational epitope that induces non-protective antibodies”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discussion paragraph nine: it would be helpful to clarify whether &quot;cutaneous papillomaviruses” refers to just MnPV/MmuPV or also skin HPVs.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this information:</p><p>“Indeed, in contrast to mucosal types (e.g. HPV11, 16 and COPV), cutaneous papillomaviruses (e.g. HPV1, 2 and BPV1) initiate their late functions in the lower epithelial regions (Peh et al., 2002)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What are the authors views as to why a long/middle L1 is not capable of triggering a neutralizing ab response?</p></disp-quote><p>As already stated (see point 5), our data suggest that an extended N-terminus abrogates L1 self-assembly and prevents the formation of repetitive, highly immunogenic structures usually found on native capsids. Consequently, an extended N-terminus of L1 leads to an alternative dominant immunogenic conformation, which is not present in infectious particles. Therefore, antibodies raised against this structure have no neutralization capability when PsVs as equivalents for mature MnPV virions were tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 10B is not of publishable quality</p></disp-quote><p>Of course, this is due to embedding the figure in a.pdf-file.
