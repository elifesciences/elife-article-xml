the central nervous system (CNS). The majority of microglia rely on CSF1R signaling for survival. However, a small subset of microglia in mouse brains can survive without CSF1R signaling and reestablish the microglial homeostatic population after CSF1R signaling returns. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we characterized the heterogeneous microglial populations under CSF1R inhibition, including microglia with reduced homeostatic markers and elevated markers of inflammatory chemokines and proliferation. Importantly, MAC2/<italic>Lgals3</italic> was upregulated under CSF1R inhibition, and shared striking similarities with microglial progenitors in the yolk sac and immature microglia in early embryos. Lineage-tracing studies revealed that these MAC2+ cells were of microglial origin. MAC2+ microglia were also present in non-treated adult mouse brains and exhibited immature transcriptomic signatures indistinguishable from those that survived CSF1R inhibition, supporting the notion that MAC2+ progenitor-like cells are present among adult microglia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>adult microglial progenitors</kwd><kwd>csf1r signaling</kwd><kwd>Mac2</kwd><kwd>microglia homeostasis</kwd><kwd>myeloid cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AG054214-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54NS100717</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG051390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tau Consortium grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30 AG062043-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kodama</surname><given-names>Lay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kodama</surname><given-names>Lay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A hidden population of microglial progenitors with distinct transcriptomic signatures are among homeostatic microglia in adult mouse brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia are the primary innate immune cells in the CNS, capable of mounting inflammatory responses and phagocytosis. They can be distinguished from other CNS cell types by their distinctive ramified morphology and expression of common myeloid markers including CD11b and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1). In addition to immune functions, microglia carry out a multitude of neurotrophic functions during CNS development and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kierdorf and Prinz, 2017</xref>). Microglia also play critical pathological roles in a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hickman et al., 2018</xref>). A number of disease genes were found to be highly expressed in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>), such as <italic>Trem2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abduljaleel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jonsson et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Grn</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2006</xref>), highlighting the importance of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Unlike other CNS glial cells, microglia originate from the embryonic mesoderm and follow a convoluted developmental journey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rezaie and Male, 2002</xref>). It starts with the emergence of c-kit+ erythromyeloid progenitors in the yolk sac, known as primitive hematopoiesis, which then influx into the developing parenchyma via circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginhoux et al., 2010</xref>) in an IRF-8, PU.1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kierdorf et al., 2013</xref>). Seeded microglial progenitors persist in the CNS and continue to expand and mature until adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>). In general, developing microglia can be distinguished by well-defined developmental intervals from the yolk sac to the adult, and transcriptional programs associated with each of these stages have been meticulously mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hammond et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, homeostatic maturation in microglia requires the transcription factor MAFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>) as well as TGF-beta signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butovsky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zöller et al., 2018</xref>), and can be distinguished by homeostatic markers such as <italic>Tmem119</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>P2ry12</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, we recently discovered that adult newborn microglia follow a similar maturation path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that the developmental plasticity of microglia in the adult brain might be an underlying feature of microglial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Santambrogio et al., 2001</xref>). Unlike other tissue myeloid populations such as monocytes and macrophages, the resident microglial pool receives no significant replenishment from circulation and is internally maintained by self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mildner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ajami et al., 2007</xref>), even under conditions of acute ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruttger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>). It is thus not surprising that microglia have an extremely long half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawson et al., 1992</xref>), most recently estimated to be 7.5–15 months in the murine CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Füger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, other myeloid populations such as classical monocytes have a half-life of less than 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Furth and Cohn, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yona et al., 2013</xref>), and require constant replenishment from a CX3CR1- population in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fogg et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>CSF1R signaling is critical for microglial survival and maintenance. Loss-of-function mutations in either of its two natural ligands, CSF1, and IL-34, results in a significant reduction in microglia number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wegiel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greter et al., 2012</xref>). Null mutations in <italic>Csf1r</italic> remove 99.7% microglia, while a few morphologically-distinctive microglia near the hippocampus and piriform cortex remain intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erblich et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 (PLX) has been widely used as a research tool to acutely deplete microglia. While depletion efficiency varies, complete microglial ablation has never been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rice et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>). These studies suggest that the adult microglial pool includes a population that does not require CSF1R signaling for survival. Remarkably, the microglial pool can be rapidly regenerated after termination of PLX administration. While an earlier study proposed a hidden NESTIN+ progenitor pool responsible for repopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>), we and others found that the remaining microglia were solely responsible for microglial repopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with the notion that a subpopulation of microglia exhibit progenitor-like features. Our current study applied single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to examine this resilient microglial population after acute CSF1R inhibition with PLX. We found that among the PLX-resistant microglia, there was a subpopulation of cells with high-expression of <italic>Mac2</italic> that displayed immature microglial gene signatures. Interestingly, this subpopulation also existed in the homeostatic microglial pool. Together, our data uncovered a progenitor-like microglial state that likely contributes to the basal proliferation of microglia in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq profiling of microglia under CSF1R inhibition and early repopulation</title><p>To examine the transcriptome profiles of the CSF1R inhibitor-resistant microglial population, we performed scRNA-seq on the remaining microglia from six C57BL/6J mice (two brains/sample) that were treated with PLX diet (D0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Specifically, upregulated DEGs in MAC2– cells showed significant overlap with adult microglia (26.26% and 25.10% overlapping with A1 and A2) while downregulated DEGs overlapped with early embryonic (45.15% overlapping with E1) and yolk sac progenitors (19.71%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>).</p><p>We next performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and upstream regulator predictions using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) on the DEGs defining MAC2+ microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). Genes involved in Tnf signaling via NF-κb and interferon signaling were highly enriched in the DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>), with these pathways predicted to be activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>), whereas TREM2 signaling, a pathway required for microglial homeostatic maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butovsky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zöller et al., 2018</xref>), was predicted to be inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i</xref>). TREM2 signaling is mediated via TYROBP, which is the downstream adaptor of CSF1R signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Otero et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the downregulation of TREM2 signaling could potentially explain the resistance of MAC2+ cells to CSF1R inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>MAC2+ progenitor-like cells are present among homeostatic microglia</title><p>MAC2+ cells also existed in non-treated Ctrl brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

In the hippocampus, the MAC2+ microglial sub-population represented 0.68% of total microglia and did not require CSF1R signaling for survival. While the MAC2+ microglia shared transcriptomic features similar to those of circulating monocytes, lineage tracing revealed that the MAC2+ microglial population was self-sustained with no replenishment from the periphery. Remarkably, the MAC2+ population shared striking similarities with immature microglial progenitors during development. Finally, MAC2+ microglia appeared to be highly proliferative in the entorhinal region during adult microglial repopulation after acute ablation. Altogether, our data identified a heterogeneous progenitor-like microglial population that is resistant to CSF1R inhibition in adult mouse brain.</p><p>The existence of a CSF1R-independent microglial population in the adult CNS was suggested by previous studies. For example, regardless of the dose and duration of PLX treatment, 1–10% of the microglial population has been observed to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acharya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rice et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Csf1r</italic> KO mice, although 99% of IBA1+ microglia are lost in almost all brain regions, 13.9% microglia remain in the hippocampus and 33.7% remain in the piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erblich et al., 2011</xref>). During development, although it is well known that myeloid cells require CSF1R signaling for survival, the CD45+c-kit<sup>lo</sup> microglial progenitors which are found in yolk sac do not start to massively express CSF1R until days post coitum (dpc) 9.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kierdorf et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, expression of CSF1 ligand remains mostly quiescent until yolk sac progenitors reach the brain rudiment at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>). These findings support the notion that a CSF1R-independent microglial population in the adult CNS might reflect a similar paradigm to the developmental progenitors in which alternative survival pathways are engaged.</p><p>In characterizing the remaining microglia after acute CSF1R inhibition, we recovered a subset of cells that can be distinguished by the MAC2 antigen that was also detectable under homeostatic conditions. Unlike the vast majority of the microglial population that is sensitive to CSF1R inhibitor, the MAC2+ population modestly increased in response to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). The MAC2+ cells uncovered under either homeostasis (Ctrl) or under CSF1R inhibition/early repopulation (D0/D2) exhibited striking similarities with early microglial progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In particular, MAFB, a transcriptional factor required for microglia maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016</xref>) was significantly downregulated. Comprehensive comparison of transcriptomes revealed that MAC2+ microglia in adult brain exhibit significant overlap with those found in yolk sac and in early embryonic development, highlighting the unusual heterogeneity and plasticity of adult microglia.</p><p>MAC2, also known as Galectin-3, is a galactoside-binding protein highly expressed in myeloid cells that can be secreted to modulate a wide variety of immune functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rahimian et al., 2018</xref>). Using fate-mapping, we determined that the MAC2+ cells observed under CSF1R inhibition were not of monocytic origin, but represent a subpopulation of microglia. Expression of MAC2 is associated with an activated microglial state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lalancette-Hébert et al., 2012</xref>) and has been found to promote microglial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wesley et al., 2013</xref>). Microglia in <italic>Mac2</italic> knockout mice have far less proliferation in response to ischemic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lalancette-Hébert et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting a critical role of MAC2 in modulation of microglial proliferation. Whether deletion of <italic>Mac2</italic> diminishes the number of repopulating microglia following CSF1R inhibition remains to be determined. Interestingly, a more recent study showed MAC2 colocalizes with TREM2 in microglial processes, and stimulates TREM2-TYROBP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boza-Serrano et al., 2019</xref>). Whether activation of TREM2-TYROBP signaling is involved in the resistance of MAC2+ microglia to CSF1R inhibitor is not known.</p><p>Our findings revealed a progenitor population hidden among other microglia under steady-state conditions. Unlike other terminally differentiated myeloid cells, microglia are sufficiently self-maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ajami et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mildner et al., 2007</xref>). Under acute microglial ablation, the 1–10% remaining microglia can restore the entire empty niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>), without needing any external progenitor input. However, due to the unusual plasticity of microglia, it still remains unclear whether a specialized adult progenitor is required to maintain microglial homeostasis. It had been proposed that every microglial cell could have the ability to conduct self-renewal when needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tay et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this notion, although we found that MAC2+ cells were highly proliferative during early stage microglial repopulation, a large proportion of proliferating microglia did not express MAC2. And the number of MAC2+ cells returned to Ctrl level by D14. The overall contribution of MAC2+ microglia during repopulation is hard to determine with the current approach since MAC2 expression could be very transient, and rapidly turned off once cell cycle is complete. To determine the overall contribution of MAC2+ cells to microgliogenesis, further lineage tracing studies of the descendants of MAC2+ progenitors are needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>The Jackson laboratory</td><td>Jax: 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>CX3CR1-CreERT2</italic></td><td>The Jackson laboratory</td><td>Jax: 021160</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Rosa26-stop-DsRed</italic></td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.200636745">10.1002/eji.200636745</ext-link></td><td>MGI: 104735</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-P2RY12</td><td>Dr. David Julius, UCSF</td><td>N/A</td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal anti-TMEM119</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab209064</td><td>1:250</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal anti-IBA1</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab5076</td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rat monoclonal anti-MAC2</td><td>Cedarlane</td><td>CL8942AP</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal anti-RFP</td><td>Rockland</td><td>200-101-379</td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal anti-CD74</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab245692</td><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal anti-KI67</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab16667</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rat monoclonal <break/>APC anti-CD11b</td><td>Tonbo bioscience</td><td>20–0112</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal TruStain FcX (anti-mouse CD16/32)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>101319</td><td>1:50</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Chromium Single Cell 3ʹ GEM, Library and Gel Bead Kit v3</td><td>10x Genomics</td><td>PN-1000075</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>SYTOX Blue Dead Cell Stain</td><td>Thermofisher</td><td>S34857</td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>PLX5622</td><td>Plexxikon Inc</td><td>D11100404i</td><td>1200 mg/kg</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Graphpad prism</td><td>Graphpad, San Diego, CA</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Fiji</td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2019">10.1038/nmeth.2019</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Cell Ranger</td><td>10x Genomics</td><td>N/A</td><td>3.1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Seurat</td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4096">10.1038/nbt.4096</ext-link></td><td>N/A</td><td>3.1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Software, <break/>Algorithm</td><td>EdgeR</td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616">10.1093/bioinformatics/btp616</ext-link> <break/>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks042">10.1093/nar/gks042</ext-link></td><td>N/A</td><td>3.28.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal work was performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines, at the University of California, San Francisco and at Weill Cornell Medicine, New York.

Representative images were created using max projections from Z-stacks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Image analyses and quantification</title><p>All image analyses were performed in FIJI V1.50i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Analysis macros were written using the IJM scripting. Briefly, multi-channel images were split to each individual channel. Image segmentation was performed using the adaptive threshold approach (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/adaptivethreshold">https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/adaptivethreshold</ext-link>). Cells showing two different markers (e.g. IBA1+ and MAC2+) were selected if the cell mask from each channel showed greater than 10% overlap. Quantification including cell counting and area measurement was performed using the ‘Analyze Particles’ and ‘ROI Manager’ function in FIJI. A list of the analysis IJM code used in the study are available on Github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lifan36/Zhan-Fan-et-al-2019-scRNAseq">https://github.com/lifan36/Zhan-Fan-et-al-2019-scRNAseq</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>All experiments were performed with a minimum of at least three biological replicates. Mean values from each animal were used for computing statistical differences. Standard error of the mean (SEM) was used for error bars. Statistical analyses were performed in Graphpad prism 8.0 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA) and R (F Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Data visualization was achieved with R package ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wickham, 2009</xref>). Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. F test was used to assess homoscedasticity prior to unpaired t-test and Brown-Forsythe test was used to homoscedasticity prior to ANOVA. For data with normal distribution and equal variance, unpaired t-test was used to compare two groups. One-way ANOVA was used to compare data with more than two groups. Dunnett's multiple comparisons test was used to compare difference between designated groups. Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test was used for multiple group comparison to Ctrl. For data that failed to pass the normality test, Mann Whitney test was applied. For data with unequal variance, unpaired t-test with Welch's correction was applied. p-value and FDR are summarized as ns (p&gt;0.05); * (p≤0.05); ** (p≤0.01); *** (p≤0.001); **** (p≤0.0001).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We want to thank Dr. David Julius from University of California San Francisco for the P2ry12 antibody; Parmveer Singh from Plexxikon Inc, for supplying the PLX diet; Zlata Plotnikova for assistance with the microglia isolation; Jason McCormick and Tomas Baumgartner from Weill Cornell Medicine Flow Cytometry Core Facility for FACS assistance; Dong Xu, Xing Wang and Adrian Tan from Genomics Resources Core Facility for performing single-cell RNA sequencing; Rashad Ahmed from Scientific Computing Unit for assistance on cluster computing; Dr. Matthew Lee Settles from University of California-Davis for the scRNA-seq analysis training course; Cody Jackson from the Gladstone Histology and Light Microscopy Core for imaging assistance; and Dr. Kathryn Claiborn for editing the manuscript.

Here the authors applied single-cell RNA sequencing to examine the remaining population of microglia following acute csf1r inhibition with PLX. Several populations or states of microglia were identified, including a subpopulation that express Mac2/Galectin2. They carried out lineage tracing experiments (using Cx3CR1-CreErT2-RFP) and provide evidence that Mac2+ are proliferative and not derived from peripheral monocytes and that this population express microglia progenitor signatures that are normally present as part of the homeostatic population in control mice.</p><p>Though limited by a small number of sequenced cells and few biological replicates, the study presents interesting data about &quot;inhibitor resistant&quot; and repopulating microglia. However, there are several controls and issues related to RNA-seq analyses (validation, biological variability and reproducibility) that must be addressed to support their conclusions. Clarity is needed on data analyses and experimental design, including pseudotime analyses, as summarized below. For example, it is not clear whether clusters 4,5, and 8 are thought by the authors to be microglia, just ones that express some monocyte/granulocyte/DC genes in setting of plx5622 treatment. This is an important point to address in order to interpret the data, and the number of microglia sequenced. If these clusters are truly not microglia, then it would likely not be possible to perform the comparison between Mac2+ microglia Mac2- microglia. If they are microglia, it would be important for the authors to compellingly show this (either by analyzing current data, or showing staining of parenchymal microglia expressing some of these marker). Finally, please address or modify the claim that remaining microglia following PLX5622. treatment are &quot;Csf1r independent,&quot; which is not supported by the data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) RNA sequencing experiments: The authors do not provide quantification of biological variability nor justification across 3 conditions.</p><p>– The most problematic is that the single-cell is based off what is effectively an n=1 for each group (the D0 group had two animals but they were pooled together). This experimental design leaves no room for interpretation of any potential outliers or technical artifacts in the data. Figure 1F-N is uninterpretable as relative frequency comparisons with n=1 are not valid. Figure S2A-C are also important comparisons which need statistical comparison that is not possible with n=1. Figure 7 also cannot be interpreted due to this issue.</p><p>n=3 replicates (2 additional replicates per group) should be performed and combined with the original analysis. DEG based analysis also significantly suffers from same issue as DEG between replicates cannot be analyzed.</p><p>2) Please provide clarity and address issues related to Figures 3 and 5 and 6:</p><p>a) Figure 3: The authors analyze gene expression across cell clusters, and conclude that many clusters express genes characteristic of monocytes, granulocytes, NK cells, T cells, and dendritic cells. Supplementary data shows that NK and T cells are not found in the brain parenchyma. The authors claim that these cells must have been unintentionally captured in their CD11b+ gate, but do not provide analogous validation of the &quot;monocyte-like&quot; &quot;granulocyte-like,&quot; and &quot; dendritic cell-like&quot; clusters as being either present or absent from the parenchyma. I infer that the authors are trying to suggest that these &quot;-like,&quot; (eg, &quot;granulocyte-like&quot;) populations are real microglia that have adopted alternative gene expression patterns due to PLX5622 treatment, but this is not made clear. In-situ validation showing parenchymal microglia to express genes in these clusters would be useful but not necessary. More critically, the manuscript would be easier to interpret if the authors explicitly stated whether they believe these cells to be microglia or not, and what makes them think so from the data. As it stands, this grey area around the identity of clusters 4,5, and 8 complicates interpretation.</p><p>b) The use of pseudotime analysis in 3F/G is unclear. The T and NK cells sequenced in this study are almost certainly not on a temporal continuum of cell states with the other clusters, so trying to make inferences about them as such is of unclear validity. The authors could more clearly explain the purpose of applying pseudotime here, and their interpretation of its biological meaning given the above, or remove this analysis. Clusters 4-8 (and even cluster 3) are not in the same trajectory as microglia as they are completely different cell types. This analysis should be redone using only microglia or removed completely.</p><p>c) Figure 6: Analysis of DEG of Mac2+ cells is similarly problematic. The authors perform the analysis on all Mac2+ cells. However, the vast majority of these cells are non-microglial cells. It does not make sense include non-microglial cells in an analysis compared to homeostatic microglia. This analysis should only be performed between Mac2+ microglia Mac2- microglia. It would appear they may not be enough microglia to make this comparison in the current dataset but this only further underlines the importance of this issue.</p><p>3) Lineage tracing experiment Figure 5A-D: The authors state that there is no significant difference in RFP+ Mac2+ cells so they don't appear to be peripherally derived. However, they fail to address fact that only 80% or less of the Mac2+ cells are RFP+. Please provide quantification of microglial labeling efficiency to control for this to support this conclusion.</p><p>4) Csf1r independence: The claim (including in the title) that Mac2+ microglia survive independent of CSF1r signaling is not supported by the presented data. Using both scRNA-seq and immunolabeling, the authors convincingly demonstrate a small subset of microglia to be Mac2+. During treatment with PLX5622, this Mac2+ subset expands modestly, and the authors conclude that there is a subset of <italic>Csf1r</italic>-independent Mac2+ microglia. The interpretation that microglia surviving PLX5622 treatment, in particular Mac2+ cells, are &quot;<italic>Csf1r</italic>-independent,&quot; is not supported by the presented data, as there are many alternative explanations for why they survive. Proving Csf1r independence experimentally would require a large amount of additional work, but the authors could alternatively modify their language and claims to reflect that these cells are relatively resistant to inhibitor treatment, rather than Csf1r independent. This is a very important distinction for future studies focused on this inhibitor resilient population, as the mechanism of survival remains unknown.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;A Mac2-positive progenitor-like microglial population is resistant to CSF1R inhibition in adult mouse brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

If the authors still find that Lgals3 is specific marker of repopulated in clusters 1-4 then their main conclusion holds.

However, one key issue has arisen that needs to be addressed regarding the annotation of cluster 5 and 6 but especially cluster 6.</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>1) There are significant problems with the annotations of clusters 5 and cluster 6. They are defined in the paper as DC-like microglia and anti-microbial microglia respectively.</p><p>– Cluster 6 are almost certainly not microglia and don't appear to be myeloid in origin and are almost certainly granulocytes. As seen in SI Figure 2 and Figure 3 cluster 6 has little to no expression of P2ry12, P2ry13, Cx3cr1, Trem2, Fcrls, Aif1, or Tmem119. Furthermore, they are enriched for classic neutrophil markers S100a9, S100a8, Ngp.</p><p>– Cluster 5 are slightly trickier with the markers presented but based on the literature seem more akin to brain associated macrophages/monocytes (perivascular and meningeal) than they do to microglia, but it remains possible they represent an early precursor myeloid population. Again, as seen in SI Figure 2 and Figure 3, they have little to no expression of classic microglia or myeloid markers.</p><p>Both of these annotations impact for the conclusions of the paper as they are the clusters expressing the majority of Mac2+ cells. Thus, defining these clusters as microglia or microglia progenitors needs further validation.</p><p>Currently the authors show that Mac2+ Iba1+ cells are present by IHC and that CD74/Iba1+ cells are present via IHC. Unfortunately, neither of these confirms that these represent cells from clusters 5 and 6. There are as the authors show in SI Figure 6A Mac2+ cells in cluster 1-4 (which are microglia/myeloid) and given the lack of expression of Iba1 or other myeloid markers in clusters 5-6 it seems much more likely that the cells the authors are identifying are Mac2+ cells from cluster 1-4. Furthermore CD74/Iba1 IHC images also seem more likely to represent cells in clusters 1 or 4 as those clusters also show some expression of CD74 (SI Figure 2) while cluster 5 has very low to minimal expression of Iba1.</p><p>If the authors want to show that either of these populations are indeed microglia then more validation/experiments are necessary.</p><p>a) The authors will need to show either smFISH or combined IHC/smFISH of Iba1 with S100a8, S100a9, and/or Ngp in order to demonstrate that these cells are potentially myeloid and not granulocytes and that those numbers are similar to total numbers of Iba1/Mac2+ cells.</p><p>b) The same holds true for cluster 5. We suggest the authors use MHC genes as shown in SI Figure 2 to colocalize with Iba1 as those genes appear to be more cluster specific than CD74.</p><p>Both of these impacts the conclusions that Lgals3 is unique marker of microglia progenitor as cluster 6 seem very unlikely to be microglia and cluster 5 seem potentially possible although certainly not definitive at this stage. Therefore, when the authors perform DEG analysis between Mac2+ and Mac2- cells there are of course going to be significant results as the authors are likely comparing non-microglial cells to microglia.</p><p>However, the Mac2+/Iba1+ cells are still shown to be enriched in D0 brain by IHC that much is very clear. Therefore, the Mac2+ cells in clusters 1-4 may still be of high importance during repopulation. It is even possible that once cluster 5-6 are separated from the analysis that these Mac2+ cells that can be seen in clusters 1-4 (Si Figure 6A) will even form their own cluster in the analysis.</p><p>a) The DE analysis and clustering will need to be reperformed pending the results of smFISH and other confirmation as to the origins of cluster 5-6 (see above).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed the major concerns raised in the prior submission with additional data, clarified analyses, and text edits. Clarity, interpretability, and the strength of conclusions have greatly improved.</p><p>Concrete points:</p><p>1) It would be good to show some kind of error estimate for panel 1F (which might require normalizing to each replicate and not each treatment group), and this reviewer is not clear on how edgeR would be used to calculate a p value for this ratio, as is stated in the legend, or otherwise how what statistical test was used here?</p><p>2) It would be useful for interpretability of Figure 6A to see the absolute # of MAC2 pos cells in the homeostatic vs repopulating clusters (or to refer to the panel where this was calculated, in the case that I missed this).</p><p>Subjective points:</p><p>1) Language around Csf1r independence: The authors very effectively refined language around whether residual microglia are &quot;Csf1r independent&quot; or not. There is one sentence in the Abstract that still states that &quot;a small subset of microglia in mouse brains can survive without Csf1r signaling&quot;, this has not been proven in prior studies, including the Pollard study in Csf1r KO mice, because this study did not test whether the IBA1 pos cells observed actually &quot;survived&quot; or were transient (for example, monocytes engrafting the brain and undergoing apoptosis).</p><p>2) &quot;Progenitor signatures&quot;: The authors use the word &quot;progenitor&quot; to describe the young/embryonic microglial signatures used in comparisons in Figure 6 and supplement from the Matcovitch-Natan study, and describe MAC2+ cells as having &quot;progenitor signatures.&quot; Strictly speaking, it is my impression that &quot;progenitors&quot; only refers to the &quot;YS&quot; population, not the E1 population and thereafter (which are no longer progenitors, but instead &quot;early embryonic microglia&quot;). They also claim that &quot;progenitor-like&quot; cells are present in the homeostatic brain. I would suggest changing the language to reflect the fact that microglia are not thought to have progenitors, and rather to self renew, acting as their own progenitor. Again, this is minor, I raise it only with goal of increasing precision of language since the subject of microglial progenitors is contentious, and in lumping together true yolk sac progenitors with early microglia, this may cloud the debate.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A MAC2-positive progenitor-like microglial population is resistant to CSF1R inhibition in adult mouse brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This is a a key point to many interpretations and conclusions is that the cells in cluster 5 are indeed microglia, since they are the predominant source of mac2/lgals3 pos cells. An alternative to showing this would be to assume they are not microglia and exclude them from analyses of repopulation microglia, but the authors did not take this route.

Using both scRNA-seq and immunolabeling, the authors convincingly demonstrate a small subset of microglia to be Mac2+. During treatment with PLX5622, this Mac2+ subset expands modestly, and the authors conclude that there is a subset of Csf1r-independent Mac2+ microglia. The interpretation that microglia surviving PLX5622 treatment, in particular Mac2+ cells, are &quot;Csf1r-independent,&quot; is not supported by the presented data, as there are many alternative explanations for why they survive. Proving Csf1r independence experimentally would require a large amount of additional work, but the authors could alternatively modify their language and claims to reflect that these cells are relatively resistant to inhibitor treatment, rather than Csf1r independent. This is a very important distinction for future studies focused on this inhibitor resilient population, as the mechanism of survival remains unknown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased the statement to indicate the population to be relatively resistant, rather than independent.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>The authors have made significant improvements and clarifications in the analysis in their revised paper. However, one key issue has arisen that needs to be addressed regarding the annotation of cluster 5 and 6 (but especially cluster 6). They are defined in the paper as DC-like microglia and anti-microbial microglia respectively. Cluster 6 (and 5) are not likely microglia and don't appear to be myeloid in origin and are almost certainly granulocytes. Please address this remaining issue by providing evidence that these populations are not contaminating cells, or please exclude those cells from analysis as summarized below (Reviewer 1). If the authors still find that Lgals3 is specific marker of repopulated in clusters 1-4 then their main conclusion holds. However, as much of the analyses of differential gene expression analysis depends on these clusters, this analysis will also need to be redone with this in mind.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers comments prompted us to examine the markers for clusters 5 and 6 more carefully. Since cluster 6 cells express very low levels of <italic>Iba1</italic>, we agree with the reviewer that cluster 6 might not be of myeloid origin, thus have excluded it from additional downstream analyses. However, cluster 5 cells express appreciable levels of <italic>Iba1</italic> (Figure 1E) and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). So we believe cluster 5 is more likely to be of myeloid origin, thus have included it in our subsequent analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>See reviewer 1 and 2 comments below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I would like to thank the authors for their substantive improvements and clarifications in the analysis in their revised paper that is much improved.

Furthermore, they are enriched for classic neutrophil markers S100a9, S100a8, Ngp.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment and have excluded Cluster 6 in the revised analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Cluster 5 are slightly trickier with the markers presented but based on the literature seem more akin to brain associated macrophages/monocytes (perivascular and meningeal) than they do to microglia, but it remains possible they represent an early precursor myeloid population. Again, as seen in SI Figure 2 and Figure 3, they have little to no expression of classic microglia or myeloid markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Cluster 5 cells are distinct compared with the homeostatic microglial populations. Indeed, one of the important features of the immature, repopulating microglial cells is the downregulation of homeostatic microglial markers. However, they do express <italic>Iba1</italic> and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>, suggesting that they are most likely of myeloid lineage. Therefore, cluster 5 is included in the revised analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Both of these annotations impact for the conclusions of the paper as they are the clusters expressing the majority of Mac2+ cells. Thus, defining these clusters as microglia or microglia progenitors needs further validation.</p><p>Currently the authors show that Mac2+ Iba1+ cells are present by IHC and that CD74/Iba1+ cells are present via IHC. Unfortunately, neither of these confirms that these represent cells from clusters 5 and 6. There are as the authors show in SI Figure 6A Mac2+ cells in cluster 1-4 (which are microglia/myeloid) and given the lack of expression of Iba1 or other myeloid markers in clusters 5-6 it seems much more likely that the cells the authors are identifying are Mac2+ cells from cluster 1-4. Furthermore CD74/Iba1 IHC images also seem more likely to represent cells in clusters 1 or 4 as those clusters also show some expression of CD74 (SI Figure 2) while cluster 5 has very low to minimal expression of Iba1.</p><p>If the authors want to show that either of these populations are indeed microglia then more validation/experiments are necessary.</p><p>a) The authors will need to show either smFISH or combined IHC/smFISH of Iba1 with S100a8, S100a9, and/or Ngp in order to demonstrate that these cells are potentially myeloid and not granulocytes and that those numbers are similar to total numbers of Iba1/Mac2+ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Cluster 6 was removed for data analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The same holds true for cluster 5.

Therefore, the Mac2+ cells in clusters 1-4 may still be of high importance during repopulation.

Clarity, interpretability, and the strength of conclusions have greatly improved.</p><p>Concrete points:</p><p>1) It would be good to show some kind of error estimate for panel 1F (which might require normalizing to each replicate and not each treatment group), and this reviewer is not clear on how edgeR would be used to calculate a p value for this ratio, as is stated in the legend, or otherwise how what statistical test was used here?</p></disp-quote><p>We now included the SEM in the figure from n=3 independent samples for each condition, and further clarified how edgeR is applied to calculate the p values for the ratios in the legend as well as in the Materials and methods section: “Differential abundance analysis of cell clusters was done using the negative binomial generalized linear model (NB GLM) in EdgeR to calculate p-values. Adapting the differential abundance analysis used for mass cytometry data, we inputted counts as cells per sample instead of counts being reads per gene, and used the “glmQLFTest” function in EdgeR (Lun et al., 2016, Robinson et al., 2010).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It would be useful for interpretability of Figure 6A to see the absolute # of MAC2 pos cells in the homeostatic vs repopulating clusters (or to refer to the panel where this was calculated, in the case that I missed this).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the absolute number of MAC2 positive cells in the homeostatic (672) vs. repopulating (187+1545) microglial populations.</p><p>Here are the numbers:</p><p>Cluster 1 and 2: 672,</p><p>Cluster 3 and 4: 187,</p><p>Cluster 5: 1545.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subjective points:</p><p>1) Language around Csf1r independence: The authors very effectively refined language around whether residual microglia are &quot;Csf1r independent&quot; or not. There is one sentence in the Abstract that still states that &quot;a small subset of microglia in mouse brains can survive without Csf1r signaling&quot;, this has not been proven in prior studies, including the Pollard study in Csf1r KO mice, because this study did not test whether the IBA1 pos cells observed actually &quot;survived&quot; or were transient (for example, monocytes engrafting the brain and undergoing apoptosis).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is likely some of the IBA1 positive cells do not survive and are “transient”. As we reported in our previous study, elevated apoptosis was observed during repopulation to “prune” the excess number of microglia (Zhan et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the large number of microglia at the end of repopulation indicates the number of surviving cells far outweighs those that do not survive (undergo apoptosis). Therefore, we think it is reasonable to state that &quot;a small subset of microglia in mouse brains can survive without <italic>Csf1r</italic> signaling”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;Progenitor signatures&quot;: The authors use the word &quot;progenitor&quot; to describe the young/embryonic microglial signatures used in comparisons in Figure 6 and supplement from the Matcovitch-Natan study, and describe MAC2+ cells as having &quot;progenitor signatures.&quot; Strictly speaking, it is my impression that &quot;progenitors&quot; only refers to the &quot;YS&quot; population, not the E1 population and thereafter (which are no longer progenitors, but instead &quot;early embryonic microglia&quot;). They also claim that &quot;progenitor-like&quot; cells are present in the homeostatic brain. I would suggest changing the language to reflect the fact that microglia are not thought to have progenitors, and rather to self renew, acting as their own progenitor. Again, this is minor, I raise it only with goal of increasing precision of language since the subject of microglial progenitors is contentious, and in lumping together true yolk sac progenitors with early microglia, this may cloud the debate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for helping us to be more precise in our description. We agree that YS population is strictly progenitor population, and have changed “progenitor signature” to “immature signature” in Figure 6 and Figure 7. However, since the upregulated DEGs of MAC2+ cells in the homeostatic brain exhibit substantial YS signatures (&gt;20%), we believe that the use of “progenitor-like” is appropriate in some places since this term includes both signatures of YS and those of early embryonic development.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have addressed nearly all stated concerns raised by prior reviewers and significantly improved this manuscript. What remains unaddressed is definitive verification that cluster 5 cells (where the great majority of Mac2+ cells reside) are parenchymal microglia as opposed to border macrophages or something else. I think this remains a substantive concern as the crux of this paper as written is that Mac2+ microglia are resistant to CSF1R inhibition, and this conclusion seems to depend on whether cluster 5 cells are microglia. Some of these cells do express Cx3cr1 and Iba, and many CD74, but these markers are unfortunately not specific to microglia.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments about the second revision. The reviewers’ concern prompted us to illustrate microglial signatures of Mac2+ subclusters more explicitly.

In both Cluster-1 and Cluster-4, expression of specific microglial markers, such as <italic>Tmem119</italic> and <italic>P2y12</italic>, which are also markers for homeostatic microglia, is comparable to other subclusters in the control condition (Revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1), confirming that both subclusters are indeed microglia.

This is a a key point to many interpretations and conclusions is that the cells in cluster 5 are indeed microglia, since they are the predominant source of mac2/lgals3 pos cells. An alternative to showing this would be to assume they are not microglia and exclude them from analyses of repopulation microglia, but the authors did not take this route. Additionally, there is no significant difference in the sequencing data between Ctrl, D0, and D2 in abundance of Cluster 5 (Figure 1F). In fact based on that figure it appears that one mouse is a significant outlier for that cluster.
