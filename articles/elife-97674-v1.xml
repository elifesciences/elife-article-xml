The underlying mechanism is highly conserved: the transcription factor EMX2 is regionally expressed in just one hair cell population and acts through the receptor GPR156 to reverse cell orientation relative to the other population. In mouse and zebrafish, loss of Emx2 results in sensory organs that harbor only one hair cell orientation and are not innervated properly. In zebrafish, Emx2 also confers hair cells with reduced mechanosensory properties. Here, we leverage mouse and zebrafish models lacking GPR156 to determine how detecting stimuli of opposing directions serves vestibular function, and whether GPR156 has other roles besides orienting hair cells. We find that otolith organs in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mouse mutants have normal zonal organization and normal type I-II hair cell distribution and mechano-electrical transduction properties. In contrast, <italic>gpr156</italic> zebrafish mutants lack the smaller mechanically evoked signals that characterize Emx2-positive hair cells. Loss of GPR156 does not affect orientation-selectivity of afferents in mouse utricle or zebrafish neuromasts. Consistent with normal otolith organ anatomy and afferent selectivity, <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice do not show overt vestibular dysfunction. Instead, performance on two tests that engage otolith organs is significantly altered – swimming and off-vertical-axis rotation. We conclude that GPR156 relays hair cell orientation and transduction information downstream of EMX2, but not selectivity for direction-specific afferents. These results clarify how molecular mechanisms that confer bi-directionality to sensory organs contribute to function, from single hair cell physiology to animal behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inner ear</kwd><kwd>lateral line</kwd><kwd>hair cells</kwd><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>mechano-electrical transduction</kwd><kwd>afferent innervation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC018304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eatock</surname><given-names>Ruth Anne</given-names></name><name><surname>Cullen</surname><given-names>Kathleen E</given-names></name><name><surname>Tarchini</surname><given-names>Basile</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC015242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tarchini</surname><given-names>Basile</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIADC000085-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kindt</surname><given-names>Katie S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Abolishing opposing hair cell orientation in mouse otolith and zebrafish neuromast organs preserves segregation of afferent innervation but affects zebrafish mechanotransduction and mouse vestibular reflexes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vestibular system provides essential information about the head’s motion and orientation relative to gravity and plays a vital role in everyday life. Fundamental gaps exist in our understanding of vestibular development and function. For example, we do not fully understand how the abrupt reversal of hair cell (HC) orientation in otolith organs affects vestibular function, and whether the reversal also impacts HC mechano-electrical transduction properties or afferent neuron contacts. We explore these questions further in mouse and in the zebrafish lateral line, a sensory system where external fluid flow is detected by neuromast organs that also feature HC reversal.</p><p>Vestibular HCs reside in five sensory organs per inner ear in human, mouse and larval zebrafish: three cristae ampullaris and two otolith (or macular) organs. Within each of these organs, HCs are precisely oriented to detect mechanical stimuli based on direction. HCs are sensitive to the proportion of a stimulus aligned with the mechanosensory hair bundle’s orientation: a vector from the bundle’s short edge to its tall (kinociliary) edge. In cristae, which detect angular head motions, HCs are oriented uniformly to detect fluid flow in the plane of the attached semicircular canal. In contrast, HCs in otolith organs are oriented to respond to a range of head positions and linear motions in an approximately horizontal (utricle) or vertical (saccule) plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Within these planes, HCs show two opposing orientations across a virtual ‘line of polarity reversal’ (LPR), a conserved anatomical feature in all otolith organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denman-Johnson and Forge, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flock, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lindeman, 1969</xref>). HCs are also aligned in two opposing orientations in fish and amphibian neuromasts in the lateral-line system. Orientation reversal confers on neighboring HCs of opposing orientations opposite responses to the same local stimulus: depolarization and increased afferent spike rate in one population, but hyperpolarization and decreased spike rate in the other. This functional prediction and its utility are well established in neuromasts as the ability to sensitively detect water movements in two directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chitnis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">López-Schier et al., 2004</xref>). Beyond increasing the range of stimulus orientations detected, it remains unclear how HCs with opposing orientations and responses serve otolith organ function.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Normal striola and hair cell type organization in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagrams showing general macular organization and the regions analyzed in (<bold>B–I</bold>) (LES, MES: lateral and medial extrastriola, respectively; ANT: anterior, POST: posterior).

Zones are strikingly different regions found in all vestibular epithelia, with ‘central’ and ‘peripheral’ zones of cristae corresponding to striolar and extrastriolar zones of maculae, respectively. Afferents that innervate striolar HCs have irregular spike timing and adapting responses in contrast to afferents that innervate extrastriolar HCs which have more regular and tonic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg, 2000</xref>). Striolar afferents transmit more information about the time course of translational self-motion, while extrastriolar afferents better discriminate between different static head orientations relative to gravity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jamali et al., 2019</xref>). Correlated with these physiological differences between zones are differences in HCs and afferent morphologies. Both the striola and extrastriola are populated by type I HCs contacted by <italic>calyx afferent endings</italic> and type II HCs contacted by <italic>bouton afferent endings</italic>. Most individual afferents in both zones contact both type I and type II HCs (‘<italic>dimorphic afferents</italic>’). However, pure-calyx and pure-bouton individual afferents are only found in the striola and extrastriola, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eatock and Songer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg, 2000</xref>). In amniotes, there is no obligatory relationship between HC orientation reversal and zones. While the utricular striola is entirely medial to the LPR, the saccular striola is bisected by the LPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xue and Peterson, 2006</xref>). Moreover, central and peripheral zones of cristae bear many anatomical and physiological similarities to the striolar and extrastriolar zones, but cristae have no LPR and no abrupt variation in HC orientation, as in the organ of Corti.</p><p>Interestingly, mammalian otolith afferents have two distinct anatomical properties that segregate with the LPR. First, individual afferents are maximally excited by stimuli of one orientation and not the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldberg et al., 1990</xref>), indicating that individual afferents selectively contact HCs sharing the same general orientation, as also observed in the zebrafish lateral line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). Second, the central projections of afferent neurons innervating HCs on each side of the LPR are also distinct; afferents that innervate one HC orientation largely project to the cerebellum, while the opposite HC orientation projects to the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maklad et al., 2010</xref>). The LPR thus correlates with a striking segregation of both the peripheral and central projections of afferent neurons.</p><p>Recent work has illuminated how HCs with opposing orientations are formed during development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarchini, 2021</xref>). Early in development all organs are polarized by core PCP proteins that are enriched asymmetrically at cell-cell junctions before HCs are born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deans, 2013</xref>). In cristae, asymmetric core PCP proteins set up a default, uniform HC orientation across the epithelium. Because the asymmetric pattern of core PCP protein enrichment is unchanged across the LPR, a distinct, regional mechanism defines a HC population with an opposite orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deans et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mirkovic et al., 2012</xref>). Regional expression of the transcription factor EMX2 in the lateral utricle and posterior saccule drives the 180°-reversed orientation of HCs compared to neighboring <italic>Emx2</italic>-negative HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). Although regionally restricted, <italic>Emx2</italic> is expressed by all cell types in the sensory epithelium. Reversal is achieved cell-autonomously in HCs by an orphan GPCR, GPR156 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>). Unlike <italic>Emx2</italic>, <italic>Gpr156</italic> is transcribed throughout the sensory epithelia but is limited to HCs. In <italic>Emx2</italic>-positive HCs only, the GPR156 protein is trafficked and planar-polarized at apical junctions, where it signals through inhibitory G proteins to trigger a reversal in HC orientation. The EMX2 &gt;GPR156 reversal cascade is conserved in zebrafish neuromasts and loss of either of these proteins produces neuromasts where all HCs adopt the same, uniform orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacobo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kozak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lozano-Ortega et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, in addition to reversing HC orientation, Emx2 is required for afferent selectivity. In zebrafish <italic>emx2</italic> mutants, individual afferent fibers either innervate nearly all or very few HCs instead of innervating ~50% of HCs based on their shared orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). In mouse otolith organs, regional <italic>Emx2</italic> expression is required for local afferents that innervate HC of one orientation to project centrally to the cerebellum and not to the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji et al., 2022</xref>).

In contrast, we found that similar to Emx2, Gpr156 is required for asymmetric mechanotransduction in zebrafish neuromasts. Normal afferent segregation was maintained in both mice and zebrafish lacking GPR156 despite one HC population failing to reverse its orientation. Unchanged afferent organization in the mouse allowed us to specifically interrogate how the LPR serves vestibular function. We found that although <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice did not show overt vestibular dysfunction, performance on two tests that engage otolith organs was significantly altered.

In neonate otolith organs, we demonstrated that GPR156 is required for EMX2-positive HCs to adopt a reversed orientation compared to EMX2-negative HCs. We further showed that EMX2-positive HCs lacking GPR156 do not correct their orientation with time and remain non-reversed in young adults (P21-P28). Focusing on the utricular sensory epithelium, we showed normal macular surface area and number of HCs in all three zones (LES, striola and MES; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in adult <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mutants.

We used oncomodulin (OCM) to immunolabel striolar HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simmons et al., 2010</xref>) at 4 week of age (P28) and confirmed that striolar surface area and striolar HC density were unaffected in constitutive <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mutant utricles and saccules compared to controls (<italic>Gpr156<sup>del/+</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Each macular organ contains two main HC types, type I and type II. Therefore, we next quantified type I HCs in the LES, striola and MES zones of the adult utricle and in the anterior (ANT), striolar and posterior (POST) zones of the adult saccule. We used SPP1/Osteopontin, a marker that labels the neck region of approximately 90% of type I HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McInturff et al., 2018</xref>).

Because type I and II HCs were voltage-clamped at different holding potentials (V<sub>hold</sub> = –94 and –84 mV, respectively, see Methods), their MET currents experienced different driving forces. We normalized for driving force by converting current to conductance (G) and plotted G as a function of hair bundle displacement (X) for each HC type and genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). G(X) curves were fit with a simple Boltzmann function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, Methods), yielding values for maximum conductance (G<sub>max</sub>), the midpoint of the G(X) curve (X<sub>1/2</sub>, displacement at half-maximal I<sub>MET</sub>) and <italic>dx</italic> (slope factor), the displacement range corresponding to an e-fold increase in G for small displacements.

In summary, the peak (non-adapted) displacement sensitivity of I<sub>MET</sub> was not detectably affected in LES hair bundles of mutants.</p><p>Another salient feature of vestibular HC transduction is adaptation (response decay) during a steady hair bundle deflection. We fit the adaptation with one or more exponential decays, and also calculated its extent (% decay; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>, Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>). As reported previously for immature mouse utricular HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vollrath and Eatock, 2003</xref>), these mature mouse utricular HCs had fast and slow adaptation components. The fast component was more prominent at small displacements and the slow component dominated at large displacements; often, both were evident in the middle of the operating range. We therefore compared adaptation time constants, τ<sub>fast</sub> and τ<sub>slow</sub>, at the midpoint of the operating range (<italic>X<sub>1/2</sub></italic>). For 400 ms steps, mean values are in the range of 4–10ms and 70–140ms, respectively, and the two components are responsible for comparable extents of the total adaptation.

For this assessment, we recorded eye movements while the mouse was tilted 17° off-the vertical axis (i.e. off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR)), and then rotated at a constant velocity (50°/s for 72 s). The eye velocity evoked by this paradigm comprised two different responses: (1) a transient canal-mediated response that decayed over the first 10–15 s and (2) an otolith-mediated steady-state response in which eye velocity oscillated around a constant bias with a sinusoidal waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12G</xref>). Overall, our analysis revealed that transient OVAR responses did not differ between control and <italic>Gpr156<sup>del/del</sup></italic> mice, supporting the proposal that absence of GPR156 did not affect canal-related ocular responses.

This conclusion stands in contrast to zebrafish lateral line results, where transduction properties vary with HC orientation depending on Emx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kindig et al., 2023</xref>) and Gpr156 (this study).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Asymmetrical mechano-electrical transduction</title><p>Zebrafish lateral-line HCs use a combination of 2 mechanosensitive channels, Tmc2a and Tmc2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chou et al., 2017</xref>). In the posterior lateral line, Emx2<sup>+</sup> HCs that sense posterior flow rely on primarily on Tmc2b, while Emx2<sup>-</sup> HCs that sense anterior flow rely on both Tmc2a and Tmc2b.

In our present study we find that functional asymmetry was also lost in <italic>gpr156</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the context of mouse HC orientation, EMX2 is necessary and sufficient to enrich and polarize GPR156 at HC apical junctions and reverse HC orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kindt et al., 2021</xref>). As the Gpr156 receptor is unlikely to act transcriptionally, zebrafish Emx2 may act through Gpr156 to impact Tmc2a/2b function. For example, polarization of Gpr156 at apical junctions may limit scaffolding or transport of Tmc proteins to homomeric channels composed of Tmc2b. Overall, our work in zebrafish indicates that both Emx2 and Gpr156 are important to dictate HC orientation and the mechanosensitive properties of HCs with opposing orientations.</p><p>We did not see a clear impact of GPR156 loss on the transduction properties of <italic>Emx2</italic><sup>+</sup> HCs in the mouse utricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).

Our present findings demonstrate that GPR156 is <italic>not</italic> required for macular HCs to selectively contact different afferents across the LPR. Accordingly, we predicted that HCs that fail to reverse in the lateral utricle of <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants would lead to deficits in paradigms that test macular contributions to behavioral responses. Indeed, <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice demonstrated impaired performance on two tests that engage the otolith organs: swimming and off-vertical-axis rotation (OVAR). First, during swimming, impaired spatial orientation results from the combined altered otolith input and reduced somatosensory feedback due to the aqueous environment. Second, <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice displayed impaired sustained responses to off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR). While initial eye movement response to OVAR is mediated by stimulation of semicircular canal HCs, the canal response decays such that sustained eye movement is solely driven by the otolith stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beraneck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). Quantification of the sustained responses revealed a marked reduction in this otolith-mediated reflex response. Confirming that these deficits are specific to otolith function, the <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant mice did not show overt vestibular dysfunction such as spinning or head tilt that can arise with global dysfunction of vestibular epithelia. Further, they displayed normal performance during testing that selectively engaged superior canal organs, namely angular VOR in the light and dark. This latter finding was predicted; because HC orientation is unchanged in <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutant cristae, the coding properties of semicircular canal afferents should be unchanged and would therefore produce a normal angular VOR upon specific stimulation of canal ampullae.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Comparing vestibular phenotypes of <italic>Gpr156</italic> and <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants</title><p><italic>Gpr156</italic> does not appear to be significantly expressed in the central nervous system according to the Allen Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lein et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, <italic>Advillin-Cre</italic> tracing and dye-filling experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) showed that vestibular ganglion neurons still selectively innervated LES HCs even when lacking GPR156.

Another significant new result in the current study is to show that afferent projections segregate with HC orientation and not with zonal identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; Advillin neuron labeling), yet segregation does not depend on HC orientation since it is unchanged in mouse and zebrafish <italic>Gpr156</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>).

It should be noted however that while the <italic>Gpr156</italic> KO and <italic>Emx2-Cre; Tmie</italic> cKO models both lack a normal complement of bidirectional responses, they provide different forms of aberrant linear acceleration signals. In the <italic>Tmie</italic> cKO model, LES HC inputs to the cerebellum are missing but in the <italic>Gpr156</italic> model they are retained and of opposite nature since LES HCs fail to reverse their orientation.</p><p>Several considerations could potentially explain why the <italic>Gpr156</italic> model appears to display more severe behavioral defects compared to the <italic>Emx2</italic> models. First, HC or afferent properties were not tested in <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji et al., 2022</xref>) and may be defective.

Afferent defects in <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants were reported during embryogenesis (E16.5) and innervation could further degenerate in adults, further dampening the consequence of non-reversed HC activity in the LES.

Whole larvae were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 3.5 hr. For pre- and post-synaptic labeling all wash, block and antibody solutions were prepared with 0.1% Tween in PBS (PBST). For Emx2 labeling performed on sparse afferent labeling (see below) all wash, block and antibody solutions were prepared with PBS  + 1% DMSO, 0.5% Triton-X100, 0.1% Tween-20 (PBDTT). After fixation, larvae were washed 4×5 min in PBST or PBDTT. For synaptic labeling, larvae were permeabilized with Acetone. For this permeabilization larvae were washed for 5 min with H<sub>2</sub>O. The H<sub>2</sub>O was removed and replaced with ice-cold acetone and placed at −20 °C for 5 min, followed by a 5 min H<sub>2</sub>O wash. The larvae were then washed for 4×5 min in PBST. For all immunostains larvae were blocked overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution (2% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2% fish skin gelatin in PBST or PBDTT). Larvae were then incubated in primary antibodies in antibody solution (1% bovine serum albumin in PBST or PBDTT) overnight, nutating at 4 °C.

Researcher was not blinded to genotype. Hair bundle orientation was scored relative to the midline of the muscle somites. HC number per neuromast were quantified based on Myo7a labeling and presence of a paired/complete synapse. For quantification of Emx2 labeling, HCs were scored as Emx2 positive if they labeled with both Emx2 and Myo7a. To quality as a ribbon or presynapse, the following minimum size filters were applied to images: Ribeye b: 0.025 μm<sup>2</sup>, MAGUK: 0.04 μm<sup>2</sup>. A complete synapse was comprised of both a Ribeye b and MAGUK puntca. An unpaired presynapse consisted of only a Ribeye b puntca, while an unpaired postsynapse consisted of only a MAGUK puncta.

Briefly, individual 5–6 dpf larvae were first anesthetized with tricaine (0.03% Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate salt, SigmaAldrich). To restrain larvae, they were then pinned to a Sylgard-filled recording chamber. To suppress the movement, alpha-bungarotoxin (125 μM, Tocris) was injected into the heart. Larvae were then rinsed and immersed in extracellular imaging solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, OSM 310+/-10) without tricaine. A fluid jet was used to mechanically stimulate the apical bundles of HCs of the A-P neuromasts of the primary posterior lateral-line. To stimulate the two orientations of HCs (A to P and P to A) a 500ms ‘push’ was delivered. Larvae were rotated 180° to deliver a comparable ‘push’ stimulus to both the A to P and P to A HCs.</p><p>To image calcium-dependent mechanosensitive responses in apical hair bundles, a Bruker Swept-field confocal system was used. The Bruker Swept-field confocal system was equipped with a Rolera EM-C2 CCD camera (QImaging) and a Nikon CFI Fluor 60×1.0 NA water immersion objective. Images were acquired in 5 planes along the Z-axis at 0.5 μm intervals (hair bundles) at a 50 Hz frame rate (10 Hz volume rate). The 5 plane Z-stacks were projected into one plane for image processing and quantification. The method to create spatial ∆F heatmaps has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lozano-Ortega et al., 2018</xref>). For GCaMP6s measurements, a circular ROI with a~1.5 μm (hair bundles) diameter was placed on the center of each individual bundle. The mean intensity (∆F/F<sub>0</sub>) within each ROI was quantified. F<sub>0</sub> represents the GCaMP6s intensity prior to stimulation. We examined the GCaMP6s signal in each hair bundle to determine its orientation. The GCaMP6s responses for each neuromast were averaged to quantify the magnitude of the A to P and P to A responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Zebrafish sparse labeling of single afferents in the lateral-line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>)</title><p>To visualize the innervation pattern of single afferent neurons, a <italic>neuroD1:tdTomato</italic> plasmid was injected into zebrafish embryos at the one-cell stage.

This plasmid was pressure at a concentration of 30 ng/µl. At 3 dpf larvae were anesthetized with 0.03% ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate (Tricaine), to screen for tdTomato expression. Larvae were screened for mosaic expression of tdTomato expression in the lateral-line afferents using a Zeiss SteREO Discovery V20 microscope (Carl Zeiss) with an X-Cite 120 external fluorescent light source (EXFO Photonic Solutions Inc). After selecting larvae with tdTomato expression, larvae were prepared for immunostaining at 5 dpf, and imaged as outlined above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Zebrafish data analysis and statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses and data plots were performed with Prism 9 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). Values of data with error bars on graphs and in text are expressed as mean ± SEM unless indicated otherwise.

For 5–6 dpf larvae, each neuromast represents analysis from 12 to 20 HCs and 41–68 synapses. All replicates are biological. No animals or samples were excluded from our analyses unless control experiments failed–in these cases all samples were excluded. No randomization or blinding was used for our animal studies.

They find that Gpr156 mutant animals homogenize the orientation of hair cells without affecting the selectivity of afferent neurons, suggesting that hair-cell orientation is not the feature that determines synaptic selectivity. Therefore, the process of Emx2-dependent synaptic selectivity bifurcates downstream of Gpr156.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an interesting and solid paper.

This study thoroughly addresses the issue by analyzing the morphology, electrophysiological responses, and afferent connections of hair cells found in different regions of the mammalian utricle and the Ca2+ responses of lateral line neuromasts in both wild-type animals and gpr156 mutants. Although many features of hair cell function are preserved in the mutants-such as development of the mechanosensory organs and the Emx2-dependent, polarity-specific afferent wiring and synaptic pairing-there are a few key changes. In the zebrafish neuromast, the magnitude of responses of all hair cells to water flow resembles that of the wild-type hair cells that respond to flow arriving from the tail. These responses are larger than those observed in hair cells that are sensitive to flow arriving from the head and resemble effects previously observed in Emx2 mutants. The authors note that this behavior suggests that the Emx2-GPR156 signaling axis also impinges on hair cell mechanotransduction. Although mutant mice exhibit normal posture and balance, they display defects in swimming behavior. Moreover, their vestibulo-ocular reflexes are perturbed. The authors note that the gpr156 mutant is a good model to study the role of opposing hair cell polarity in the vestibular system, for the wiring patterns follow the expression patterns of Emx2, even though hair cells are all of the same polarity. This paper excels at describing the effects of gpr156 perturbation in mouse and zebrafish models and will be of interest to those studying the vestibular system, hair cell polarity, and the role of inner-ear organs in animal behavior.</p><p>The study is exceptional in including, not only morphological and immunohistochemical indices of cellular identity but also electrophysiological properties. The mutant hair cells of murine maculæ display essentially normal mechanoelectrical transduction and adaptation-with two or even three kinetic components-as well as normal voltage-activated ionic currents.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97674.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ono</surname><given-names>Kazuya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jarysta</surname><given-names>Amandine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Jackson Laboratory</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bar Harbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Natasha C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jukic</surname><given-names>Alma</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Hui Ho Vanessa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>McGill University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montreal</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Deans</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Utah</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Salt Lake City</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Eatock</surname><given-names>Ruth Anne</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cullen</surname><given-names>Kathleen E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>John Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kindt</surname><given-names>Katie S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tarchini</surname><given-names>Basile</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Jackson Laboratory</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bar Harbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>- The authors should think about revising the terminology used to describe electrophysiological data in zebrafish (Fig.5): &quot;posterior&quot; hair cells in a neuromast are sensitive to posterior-to-anterior flow, which is currently termed &quot;anterior&quot;. This is confusing because when &quot;posterior&quot; or &quot;anterior&quot; is used, for instance in the labels of the figure, one may get confused about whether this applies to hair-cell position or directionality of the stimulus. It would help to always use clearer terminology for the stimulus (e.g. posterior-to-anterior (P-to-A) as in Kindig 2023, or &quot;from the tail&quot;). Also, the authors may want to clarify what we should see in Fig.5 demonstrating that posterior hair cells, with reversed hair-bundle polarity, actually evince transduction of similar magnitude as anterior hair cells, with normal polarity of their hair bundles.</p></disp-quote><p>This nomenclature can indeed be confusing. Per the reviewers request we have changed the terminology to always refer to the direction of flow sensed by the hair cells. For example, HCs that respond to posterior-directed flow or anterior-directed flow. We now denote these HCs as (A to P) and (P to A), respectively in the Figure for clarity. We have modified Figure 5, the Figure 5 legend and Results (starting line 339) to reflect these changes.</p><p>In addition, in our results we now provide more context when comparing the response magnitude of the anterior-sensing hair cells in gpr156 mutants to the response magnitude of the two diVerent orientations of hair cells in controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Also, does it make sense that there is no defect in MET for mouse otolith organs with deleted GPR156, whereas there is a diVerence in the zebrafish lateral line? It would help motivate the study on mechanoelectrical transduction (see comment of Reviewer 1 below).</p></disp-quote><p>We previously discussed this point and recognized that subtle eVects remain possible in mouse (previously Discussion line 614). We have now modified the text in the Discussion to better emphasize this point (new line 627). The Eatock lab is currently working on developing calcium imaging in the mouse utricle to revisit this question in a future study. &quot;Subtle eects remain possible, however, given the variance in single-cell electrophysiological data from both control and mutant mice. Nevertheless, current results are consistent with normal HC function in the Gpr156 mouse mutant, a prerequisite to interrogate how non-reversed HCs aects vestibular behavior.&quot;</p><p>To help motivate transduction studies starting in the second Result paragraph, we added a transition at Line 205 that was indeed lacking:</p><p>&quot;Gpr156 inactivation could be a powerful model to specifically ask how HC reversal contributes to vestibular function. However, GPR156 may have other confounding roles in HCs besides regulating their orientation, similar to EMX2, which impacts mechanotransduction in zebrafish HCs (Kindig et al., 2023) and aerent innervation in mouse and zebrafish HCs (Ji et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2018).&quot;</p><p>(1) One overarching objective of this study was to use the Gpr156 KO model to discover how polarity reversal informs vestibular function (Introduction, overall summary in the last paragraph) . Pairing behavioral defects with hair cell orientation is only possible if hair cell transduction is normal, which had to be tested.</p><p>(2) The notion that experiments that produced negative results are unecessary and are not properly motivated can only apply in retrospect. At early stages we performed electrophysiology because we did not know whether transduction would be normal in absence of GPR156. We also did not know whether innervation would be normal. The fact that both appear normal makes Gpr156 KO a better model to address the importance of orientation reversal (conclusion of the Discussion line 705).</p><p>See also reply to Reviewer #1 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Fig1, panel B appears to show diVerent focal planes for Gpr156del/+ and Gpr156del/del.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1B had control and mutant panels at slightly diVerent focal planes indeed. We swapped the right (mutant) panel image and adjusted intensities in the control image to match adjustments of the new mutant image.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that this work is largely about polarity and connectivity to neurons, I do not understand the need to assess mechanosensitivity in Gpr156 mutants. Please explain in the text, as follows: &quot;After establishing normal numbers and types of mouse vestibular HCs, we assessed whether HCs respond normally to hair bundle deflections in the absence of GPR156.&quot; We did this because...</p></disp-quote><p>Please see reply above in 'Recommendations for the authors' for comment about the need to assess mechanosensitivity. We agree that this transition was lacking, and we added an explanation as recommended:</p><p>&quot;Gpr156 inactivation could be a powerful model to specifically ask how HC reversal contributes to vestibular function. However, GPR156 may have other confounding roles in HCs besides regulating their orientation, similar to EMX2, which impacts mechanotransduction in zebrafish HCs (Kindig et al., 2023) and aerent innervation in mouse and zebrafish HCs (Ji et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2018).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Anyway, the data in Figures 2, 3 and 4 seems somewhat superfluous to the main message of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see reply above in 'Recommendations for the authors'. This data may appear superfluous in retrospect but we could not claim that behavioral changes in Gpr156 mutants reflect the role of the line of polarity reversal if, for example, hair cell transduction was abnormal. We had to perform experiments to figure this out. We were further motivated as data began to emerge from the zebrafish lateral line that showed eVects on HC transduction. Although we did not get positive results on this question in the mouse, we think the diVerence between models should be included as a significant part of the narrative.</p></body></sub-article></article>
