In addition, rare nucleotide mis-incorporations into the primer strand prevent further DNA synthesis and a 3'−5' exonuclease is required to remove the misincorporated nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kunkel, 2004</xref>). In contrast, when the polymerase encounters a lesion on the template strand in the form of a modified base caused by diverse chemicals, reactive oxygen species, or UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindahl, 1996</xref>), the high-fidelity replicative DNA polymerases are stalled. To bypass these replication blocks, all cells harbor multiple specialized translesion DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodman and Woodgate, 2013</xref>) that have more open active sites and are therefore able to accommodate bulky DNA adducts and continue DNA synthesis. As a result of their more open active sites, the translesion polymerases are error prone and consequently associated with increased mutagenesis, drug resistance, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs and Fujii, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lange et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the access of the translesion polymerases to DNA needs to be tightly controlled, but how this is achieved has been the subject of debate.</p><p>The 'toolbelt' model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Indiani et al., 2005</xref>) predicts that in <italic>E. coli</italic> the replicative DNA polymerase Pol IIIα and the translesion DNA polymerase Pol IV bind simultaneously to the DNA sliding clamp β, a dimeric, ring-shaped protein that encircles the DNA and provides processivity to the replicative DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson and O'Donnell, 2005</xref>). This way, the translesion polymerase functions in a manner analogous to the proofreading exonuclease: when the replicative polymerase inserts an incorrect nucleotide into the nascent strand, it will be removed by the proofreading exonuclease, whereas when the polymerase encounters a lesion on the template strand, the DNA is transferred to the translesion polymerase that can bypass the lesion. Thus both the exonuclease and translesion polymerase act as 'tools' that enable the replicative polymerase to overcome potential roadblocks to DNA replication. The toolbelt model, which was originally based on steady-state Förster Energy Resonance Transfer (FRET) experiments that showed the simultaneous binding of the replicative and translesion polymerases to the β-clamp, has found support in several subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Indiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furukohri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heltzel et al., 2012</xref>). However, all these studies used bulk studies that due to the asynchronous nature cannot separate out the sequential steps during a reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson and van Oijen, 2013</xref>). More recently, single molecule approaches have also been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kath et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2016</xref>), but in these experiments the exchange of polymerases was inferred indirectly through the change in speed of DNA synthesis and therefore it cannot be determined whether the polymerases bind simultaneously. In addition, recent studies reveal that during DNA replication in <italic>E. coli</italic> the two binding pockets of the dimeric β-clamp are occupied by the replicative DNA polymerase Pol IIIα and the associated proofreading exonuclease ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toste Rêgo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jergic et al., 2013</xref>). The cryo-EM structure of the trimeric Pol III-exonuclease-clamp (α, ε, β) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez-Leiro et al., 2015</xref>) also shows that most of the clamp is covered, leaving no space for a second polymerase. Therefore, it remains controversial whether the replicative and translesion polymerases can co-localize on a single clamp.</p><p>Consequently, an alternative view to the toolbelt model is that the translesion DNA polymerases compete for binding to clamp-DNA through 'mass action', as evidenced by the fact that the bypass of a N<sup>2</sup>-acetylaminofluorene guanine adduct by Pol V or Pol II depends on the relative concentrations of the two polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becherel and Fuchs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujii and Fuchs, 2004</xref>), and that the concentrations of Pol IV and Pol V are dramatically increased during the bacterial SOS DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sutton, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the model, the DNA sliding clamp plays a pivotal role in controlling access of the translesion polymerases to the DNA. However, the control for access to the clamp-DNA is complicated by the fact that on the lagging strand, DNA synthesis is discontinuous and every ~1000 base pairs a new clamp is loaded, followed by the binding of the replicative DNA polymerase. Due to its closed circular shape, the clamp must be loaded and unloaded onto the DNA by the dedicated clamp loader complex (γ/τ-complex in bacteria, RFC in archaea and eukaryotes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hedglin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelch et al., 2012</xref>). Once the clamp is loaded onto primed DNA, the replicative polymerase associates and initiates DNA synthesis. How the repeated loading and unloading of the clamp and replicative polymerase Pol IIIα on the lagging strand is coordinated, while simultaneously preventing the untimely association of the translesion polymerases has not been studied so far.</p><p>Here, we use co-localization single molecule spectroscopy (CoSMoS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>) to directly visualize the loading of the <italic>E. coli</italic> clamp loader (γ/τ-complex), the DNA sliding clamp β, the replicative DNA polymerase Pol IIIα, the proofreading exonuclease ε, as well as the exchange with the translesion polymerases Pol II and Pol IV. The multi-color CoSMoS experiments enable us to follow the binding and dissociation of multiple proteins in real-time on a single DNA molecule, which makes it the most suitable method to discriminate between simultaneous or sequential binding of different molecules on a DNA substrate. Our work shows that the translesion polymerases Pol II and Pol IV do not form a stable complex with the replicative polymerase Pol IIIα on the clamp-DNA and therefore the clamp does not function as a molecular toolbelt. Furthermore, we find that the sequential activities of the replication proteins clamp loader, clamp, and Pol IIIα are highly organized while the exchange with the translesion polymerases Pol II and Pol IV is disordered and determined by mass action through concentration-dependent competition for the hydrophobic groove on the surface of the β-clamp. Hence, our results provide a unique insight into the temporal organization of the events in DNA replication and translesion synthesis, and contrast the highly organized replication events with stochastic polymerase exchange during translesion synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Preparation of DNA substrates and fluorescently labeled proteins</title><p>The ring-shaped <italic>E. coli</italic> β-clamp is capable of threading and unthreading itself on free DNA ends and therefore we attached a primer-template DNA substrate to a glass surface and blocked its free end with monovalent streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subsequently, the binding of fluorescently labeled proteins to DNA was followed by two- or three-color total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (see Materials and methods) with a frame rate of 0.44 and 0.66 s (s), respectively, on ~800 well separated DNA molecules per field of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Proteins were fluorescently labeled via maleimide-cysteine crosslinking or enzymatically via an N-terminal Ybbr tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yin et al., 2006</xref>), and the fluorescently labeled proteins retained wild-type activity as indicated by polymerase processivity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Therefore, the loader and clamp bind DNA as a pre-formed complex. Shortly after DNA binding, the loader dissociates while the clamp remains bound to the DNA for the remainder of the data acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As the two lifetimes of the loader and clamp are vastly different it was not possible to accurately measure both in one experiment. Therefore, for the clamp lifetime, we first loaded the clamp, washed away the loader and then started data collection using 10 s intervals between measurements to avoid bleaching of the fluorophore. The clamps remain bound for more than 23 min (τ<sub>on</sub> = 1429.7 ± 177.0 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), excluding the time it takes to load the clamps, wash away the loader, and start data collection (~3 min). In contrast, the lifetime of the loader is very short lived. To accurately measure the loader lifetime, only one fluorescent channel was used to decrease the frame rate to 0.086 s. The lifetime of the isolated loader on DNA is 1.20 ± 0.05 s, which is shortened to 0.41 ± 0.01 s in the presence of the clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The rapid release of the loader from clamp-DNA is dependent on ATP hydrolysis as evidenced by the fact that in the presence of the poorly hydrolysable analog ATPγS, the loader and clamp still bind to the DNA together but also release together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The loader and clamp bind to the DNA briefly (<italic>τ</italic><sub>on</sub> = 2.7 ± 0.2 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which contrasts with the long lifetimes for the loaded clamps on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, our analysis is in agreement with the model that the clamp holds the loader in a conformation that suppresses ATPase activity and subsequent DNA binding triggers ATP hydrolysis and the release of the loader from clamp and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hedglin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kelch et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32177.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Different mechanisms for clamp loading and unloading.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative trace showing a clamp loading event on DNA in the presence of ATP.

Furthermore, unlike clamp loading, the unloading of a clamp does not require ATP hydrolysis: the nucleotide requirement of the unloading process was tested by first loading clamps onto DNA and then washing away the ATP and free proteins. Next, the loader was re-introduced in the absence of ATP, resulting in many unloading events with similar kinetics to those observed in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–L</xref>). About half (53%) of the binding events of the loader to the pre-loaded clamp do not result in unloading of the clamp.

Shortly after the clamp is loaded onto DNA, Pol IIIcore associates with the clamp-DNA, producing long lasting binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>) with a lifetime of 15.7 ± 1.1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). During DNA replication, the <italic>E. coli</italic> replisome synthesizes DNA with up to 100,000 base pairs per binding event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanner et al., 2009</xref>), which contrasts with the relatively short binding times of Pol IIIcore we measure on clamp-DNA. Therefore, we tested the effect of nucleotides on the lifetime of Pol IIIcore on DNA, using only two of the four nucleotides to prevent the Pol IIIcore from extending the primer strand and dissociating at the end the DNA substrate. The omission of two nucleotides is often used in DNA replication assays to induce 'polymerase idling' at a primer terminus as a result of opposing polymerase and exonuclease activities. To our surprise however, addition of dATP and dTTP (0.5 mM each), has no significant effect on the lifetime of Pol IIIcore on clamp-DNA (<italic>τ</italic><sub>on</sub> = 16.1 ± 1.0 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This is also in agreement with the observation that an actively synthesizing Pol IIIcore has a lifetime of ~10 s in the presence of all four nucleotides on a 48.5 kb λ DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jergic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanner et al., 2008</xref>). Together, this shows that Pol IIIcore has a similar lifetime on clamp-DNA regardless of whether it is stationary, idling or actively synthesizing DNA.</p><p>During DNA replication, Pol IIIcore is tethered to the rest of the replisome via the clamp loader protein τ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Studwell-Vaughan and O'Donnell, 1991</xref>). Thus far, to separate clamp loading from polymerase loading, we have used a clamp loader complex comprising the subunits γ, δ, an δ' (γ<sub>3</sub>δ<sub>1</sub>δ'<sub>1</sub>). γ is a shorter product of τ that is fully active in clamp loading, but does not interact with the polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dallmann et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2000</xref>). To measure the effect of full length τ on clamp loading and polymerase loading, we also measured clamp and polymerase loading with the τ clamp loader complex (τ<sub>3</sub>δ<sub>1</sub>δ'<sub>1</sub>), in which each of the three τ proteins had a Pol IIIcore complex bound (see Material and Methods). Here, we find that clamp, loader, and Pol IIIcore arrive at the DNA together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Unlike the γ clamp loader complex, the τ clamp loader complex does not dissociate immediately, as it remains bound for ~15 s and now leaves together with Pol IIIcore (τ<sub>on</sub> = 14.8 ± 0.9 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–I</xref>). We believe this is a result of the τ clamp loader complex and Pol IIIcore trading places on the clamp-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). The presence of the τ, however, does not affect the lifetime of Pol IIIcore on clamp-DNA, as the lifetime of the τ clamp loader - Pol IIIcore complex is similar to that of Pol IIIcore alone.</p><p>However, during the simultaneous synthesis of leading and lagging strand, the polymerases on either strand are linked together by the multiple τ proteins of the clamp loader complex, which prevents the polymerase from diffusing away and enables it to quickly resume DNA synthesis.

To study the molecular mechanism of polymerase switching, we directly visualized the binding of Pol IIIcore and the translesion DNA polymerase Pol IV on clamp-DNA.

In all events where Pol IIIcore and Pol IV co-localize on the clamp-DNA, the polymerases arrive and leave independently of one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

The β-clamp is dimeric and thus has two binding grooves. Interestingly, Pol IIIcore contains two β-binding sequences: one in the polymerase subunit α (QADMF, residues 920–924) that is absolutely required for clamp binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dohrmann and McHenry, 2005</xref>), and a second sequence in the exonuclease subunit ε (QTSMAF, residues 182–187) that stabilizes the Pol IIIcore complex and stimulates processive DNA synthesis and exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toste Rêgo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jergic et al., 2013</xref>).

We therefore wondered whether the lifetime of Pol IIIcore is affected by the nature of the DNA substrate. For this, we compared the lifetimes on three different DNA substrates: a matched, a mismatched, and a substrate containing a N<sup>2</sup>-furfuryl-dG lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosz et al., 2006</xref>). These three DNA substrates should elicit very different outcomes, i.e. extension on a matched DNA substrate, mismatch removal by the exonuclease ε on a mismatched substrate, or polymerase switching on a DNA lesion. Surprisingly, the lifetime of Pol IIIcore on clamp-DNA is not altered by the presence of either a mismatch or the lesion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). This indicates that Pol IIIcore does not 'discriminate' between the different DNA substrates.

In contrast, the translesion polymerases appear to gain access to the DNA in a more stochastic, concentration dependent manner. This implies that the cell needs a mechanism in order to tune the outcome of this competition towards the replicative polymerases during normal DNA synthesis and the translesion polymerases in the presence of DNA damage. Indeed, during DNA synthesis, two or three Pol IIIcores are tethered to the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McInerney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2010</xref>), increasing the effective concentration of the replicative polymerase at the replication fork.

Movies were acquired using Micromanager software on a Nikon (Kingston Upon Thames, United Kingdom) Eclipse Ti-E microscope with ApoTirf 100X/1.49 Oil, 0.13–0.20 WD 0.12 objective. The lasers used were 150 mW 488 nm, 150 mW 561 nm (both Coherent Sapphire Ely, United Kingdom) and 100 mW 638 nm (Coherent Cube) controlled by an acousto-optic tunable filter (Gooch and Housego, Ilminster, United Kingdom). Movies were acquired on an Andor (Belfast, United Kingdom) iXon (EM) + CCD camera at 20–40 mW laser power and an exposure of 50 millisecond (ms) per frame for a thousand frames with rapid alternation between the three laser channels (180 ms/change). Thus the frame rate is 660 ms for a 3-color experiment, 440 ms for a 2-color experiment, and 86 ms for a single color experiment (as there is no need to change the laser channels). The total duration of the movies for a 3-color experiment was 650–670 s, which gives an acquisition rate of 220 milliseconds per frame when the lag in the filter wheel was taken into consideration. Each field of view (54 μm × 54 μm, pixel size 105 × 105 nm) had an average density of 5900 DNA molecules of which 700–900 molecules were well separated and picked for analysis. The DNA-Atto 488 signal was bleached in order for this channel to be re-used for Pol IIIα-Atto 488.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The acquired movies were fed into the Imscroll analysis GUI developed by Jeff Gelles and Larry Friedman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedman and Gelles, 2015</xref>) to find the individual landing events and their dwell times.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Single-molecule studies contrast ordered DNA replication with chaotic translesion synthesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that your approach is novel and the messages touch about timely topics of broad interest. However, three major issues were raised. (1) Controls showing that the labeled components are functional in DNA synthesis are missing. (2) Bolstering their claims by adding much more data and analysis, instead of just showing one or few example time traces, is also a must. (3) Many more additional experiments are needed, for example including clamp loader that bridges pol III and clamp, and measurements that demonstrate the necessity of clamp interaction.</p><p>Your paper is being rejected because we do not feel that you would be able to perform all requested additional experiments (most critically point 3 above) that the reviewers found essential in two months, which is the time scale of additional work that <italic>eLife</italic> considers reasonable. However, if you are able to perform key experiments requested, I will be happy to consult the same reviewers with the new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Zhao et al. investigate the binding of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA polymerases to the sliding clamp using single-molecule co-localization microscopy. The authors argue that replicative and translesion polymerase do not simultaneously interact with the clamp (toolbelt model), but exchange on the clamp in a concentration-dependent manner. This manuscript addresses a critical question in the field, albeit with a rather limited scope. Most importantly, clamp loader (with and without τ) is omitted from the polymerase co-localization experiments. Τ bridges clamp and polIII, and may further stabilize the &quot;dual-polymerase&quot; clamp complex in vivo. This will be a critical addition to the manuscript. Second, there are no biochemical controls indicating activity of fluorescently tagged enzymes. Statistical analysis is also lacking and in a few cases the key results are argued based on a single CosMoS trace. Overall, the manuscript feels more like the start of an interesting paper than a significant contribution to the field. I recommend that the authors make the following major edits to be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Include biochemical controls to confirm that clamp loader and polymerases are not perturbed by the fluorescent tag.</p><p>2) Include experiments with clamp loader, pol III and pol IV. Compare clamp loader with and without τ. Are more &quot;dual polymerase&quot; species seen with τ? There is growing evidence for multi-τ clamp loaders in vivo (from Sherratt lab and others).</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: Clamp on-rates (~0.6 s) are limited by the experimental resolution (0.6 s / frame). The underlying rates may be significantly faster; the authors may be measuring slow events. Time resolution needs to be increased to make any claims here.</p><p>4) Once a clamp is loaded, clamp loader can catalyze unloading (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,J</xref>).

The authors argue that replicative and translesion polymerase do not simultaneously interact with the clamp (toolbelt model), but exchange on the clamp in a concentration-dependent manner. This manuscript addresses a critical question in the field, albeit with a rather limited scope. Most importantly, clamp loader (with and without τ) is omitted from the polymerase co-localization experiments. Τ bridges clamp and polIII, and may further stabilize the &quot;dual-polymerase&quot; clamp complex in vivo. This will be a critical addition to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, all experiments were performed in the presence of the γ clamp loader complex (i.e. γ<sub>3</sub>δδ', without τ), with the exception of the clamp unloading and the three-polymerase experiment, which were performed after washing away the clamp loader.</p><p>In the current version we have now also included the τ clamp loader complex (τ<sub>3</sub>δδ'), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In summary, when using the τ clamp loader complex that is pre-loaded with Pol IIIcore, we find that the clamp loader, Pol IIIcore, and clamp arrive at the DNA together. Unlike the γ clamp loader that leaves immediately after clamp loading, the τ complex remains present as it is attached to Pol IIIcore that takes its place at the clamp.</p><p>The lifetime of Pol IIIcore is not altered in the presence of τ. As the τ clamp loader and Pol IIIcore arrive together, there is a dramatic shift in the competition between Pol IIIcore and Pol IV in favour of Pol III, as shown in the table below (Author response <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

If I understood the oligo table correctly, the next nucleotide to be incorporated is dATP or dTTP. Including these nucleotides may show changes in how the polymerase interacts with the templates.</p></disp-quote><p>In the initial manuscript, we chose not to use as dATP and dTTP as their incorporation would shorten the ssDNA overhang by 5 nucleotides and potentially change the interaction with the polymerase (in many crystal structures of polymerase-DNA complexes, the polymerase binds to 3-4 nucleotides of the single stranded overhang of the template strand. Our DNA substrate has a 6 nt overhang). Moreover, Pol IIIcore synthesizes DNA at speeds of 1000 nt/s, so the addition of 5 nucleotides could only add 5 milliseconds to the ~16 second lifetime of Pol IIIcore on clamp-DNA. Finally, the end product of incorporation of the five nucleotides would be the same as the starting DNA substrate with dCTP and dGTP, i.e. a primer that cannot be extended. Nonetheless, we have performed the idling experiment with dATP and dTTP and found that as for dCTP and dGTP, the lifetime of Pol IIIcore is comparable on all three DNA substrates (matched, mismatched, and lesion).

In our experiments, we have measured Pol IIIcore and Pol IV at 6, 30, and 150 nM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). (Measuring higher protein concentrations results in increased background and non-specific binding to the glass slide.) At the measured concentrations it is clear that Pol IV can frequently switch places and/or co-localize with Pol IIIcore. Addition of τ favors the binding of Pol IIIcore to the DNA, although the frequency of co-localization with Pol IV is comparable to that of the isolated Pol IIIcore. In the cell, Pol IIIcore is connected to the rest of the replisome, implying that the local effective concentration will favor Pol IIIcore binding even more.

As expected, the reduced clamp binder of ε results in shorter lifetimes of Pol IIIcore on clamp-DNA, and the improved clamp binder of ε gives longer lifetimes of Pol IIIcore on clamp-DNA.

However, we have replaced &quot;chaotic&quot; with &quot;stochastic&quot; in the title, and have toned down the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref> are confusing.
