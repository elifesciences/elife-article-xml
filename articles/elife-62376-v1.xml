However, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows for investigating whole-brain dynamics during behavior and task engagement, concurrent measures of alertness (such as EEG or pupillometry) are often unavailable. Here, we extract a continuous, time-resolved marker of alertness from fMRI data alone. We demonstrate that this fMRI alertness marker, calculated in a short pre-stimulus interval, captures trial-to-trial behavioral responses to incoming sensory stimuli. In addition, we find that the prediction of both EEG and behavioral responses during the task may be accomplished using only a small fraction of fMRI voxels. Furthermore, we observe that accounting for alertness appears to increase the statistical detection of task-activated brain areas. These findings have broad implications for augmenting a large body of existing datasets with information about ongoing arousal states, enriching fMRI studies of neural variability in health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>arousal</kwd><kwd>behavioral variability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K22 ES028048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Catie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS112252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Englot</surname><given-names>Dario J</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Catie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS108445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>Victoria L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS110130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgan</surname><given-names>Victoria L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodale</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Time-varying states of alertness that shape behavioral responses may be detected from fMRI signal patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain function and behavior vary naturally over time. Behavioral responses can change even across repeated presentations of the same stimulus, and altered levels of neural variability may index individual differences in cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dinstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Kempen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen, 2018</xref>). One major determinant of behavioral and neural variability is the brain’s continuously fluctuating level of arousal, referring to the dimension of functional states linked with phenomena including alert wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep. Growing evidence indicates that levels of arousal closely interact with processes underlying decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Kempen et al., 2019</xref>), visuomotor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makeig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poudel et al., 2018</xref>), perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mather and Sutherland, 2011</xref>), and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foucher et al., 2004</xref>), motivating incorporation of arousal levels into models of healthy and pathological brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Englot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Motelow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Salomon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nashiro and Mather, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jawinski et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Functional MRI allows for investigating how behavioral variability may be underpinned by the activity in distinct spatial locations, or across large-scale functional networks, in the human brain. For example, variations in attentional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref>), motor, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fox et al., 2006</xref>), and perceptual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sadaghiani et al., 2009</xref>) responses, have been linked to fluctuations in spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, observed both in focal regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fox et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sadaghiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hesselmann et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hesselmann et al., 2008b</xref>) and in large-scale network structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sadaghiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sadaghiani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boly et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coste et al., 2011</xref>). Temporal variation in spontaneous fMRI signals and connectivity have also been found to be altered in neuropsychiatric disorders as well as in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nomi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calhoun et al., 2014</xref>). However, relatively few fMRI studies have examined the specific role of dynamically fluctuating arousal states in shaping ongoing neural or behavioral variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dinstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu and Falahpour, 2020</xref>). One barrier stems from practical challenges linked with gathering established measures of arousal (such as pupillometry and EEG) during routine fMRI scans – including the need for additional setup time, MRI-compatible hardware, and post-processing for removal of MR-related artifacts. Therefore, the ability to estimate fluctuations in brain arousal from fMRI data itself would broaden the ability to study dynamic interactions between arousal, behavior, and large-scale brain activity. It could also improve the mechanistic interpretation of fMRI analyses, particularly in populations known to have altered arousal and autonomic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen-Zion and Ancoli-Israel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hegerl et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Prior work on the detection of arousal states from fMRI alone has demonstrated that distinct EEG-defined sleep stages may be classified based on fMRI correlation patterns calculated across 1–2 min sliding windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tagliazucchi and Laufs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tagliazucchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altmann et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, it was found that many subjects can begin to lose wakefulness even within the first few minutes of an fMRI scan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tagliazucchi and Laufs, 2014</xref>). Focusing on levels of arousal across the waking state, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2016</xref> identified dynamic connectivity patterns, calculated in 40 s sliding windows, whose expression at each window tracked slow variations in subjects’ performance in an auditory vigilance task. In a complementary line of work, we recently developed an approach for extracting continuous fluctuations in arousal from fMRI data alone, this time at the frame-by-frame (TR) temporal resolution of fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). The extracted ‘fMRI arousal index’ was found to correlate with intracranial electrophysiological arousal and spontaneous eye opening/closing in macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>), as well as with scalp EEG in human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falahpour et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that the higher temporal resolution of this approach may also provide the opportunity of capturing arousal-dependent behavioral variability during task performance, in a temporally localized manner. If such a measure can indeed track trial-wise neural state changes, it may also open the possibility of incorporating arousal states into analysis of the many task fMRI datasets that lack EEG or pupillometry measures.</p><p>To examine this possibility, here we simultaneously record EEG, fMRI, and behavioral responses and examine whether this time-resolved marker of alertness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falahpour et al., 2018</xref>) – derived from fMRI data alone – can be harnessed to track trial-to-trial variations in responses to sensory stimuli. We investigate whether an fMRI index of the ongoing arousal state, estimated within a short (5 s) interval before each trial, is predictive of a subject’s response to the upcoming stimulus. We also probe the impact of including fMRI-derived arousal covariates in standard statistical analyses of fMRI task activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>fMRI-derived alertness index tracks continuous variations in EEG alertness</title><p>In this study, we use an approach for inferring fluctuations in alertness from fMRI data alone, at the temporal resolution of the fMRI scan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falahpour et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, this is carried out by taking the running spatial projection of a spatial map linked with alertness (‘template map’) onto each successive fMRI volume in the new scan, resulting in a continuous time course of estimated alertness sampled at each fMRI volume (TR). A schematic of this approach is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, with further details in Methods.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>fMRI-based inference of alertness fluctuation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A spatial template, created a priori (here, using resting-state scans with simultaneous EEG–fMRI), is projected onto each successive volume of a different, auditory task fMRI scan (not used in the template creation) via spatial correlation.

The event-locked EEG spectrogram showed clear evidence that hit and miss trials were accompanied by distinct arousal states, with the hit spectrogram showing greater power in the alpha band (8–12 Hz, consistent with increased arousal, particularly at stimulus onset) and the miss spectrogram showing greater power in the lower frequency bands commonly associated with increased drowsiness or sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>fMRI alertness index differentiates between auditory task response (hit) and misses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Event-locked EEG spectrogram for hits and misses.

To examine this possibility, we performed a standard general linear model (GLM) analysis of the auditory task responses (convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function [HRF]) and quantified the impact of including the fMRI alertness index as a covariate of no interest. For all analyses, a regressor capturing the onset of missed stimuli (convolved with a canonical HRF) was also included as a covariate of no interest. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, a model that included only the event-related task responses resulted in weak activation in the expected bilateral auditory and left motor regions, along with negative BOLD signal change in a number of cortical regions, with some resemblance to the pattern of correlations with EEG arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Including the fMRI alertness index as a covariate reduced the negative responses and increased t-scores in bilateral auditory cortex, left motor cortex (the region expected to be associated with right-handed button presses), and the contralateral cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

During periods of drowsiness and light sleep, large-amplitude and extensive fMRI signal changes have been observed in which much of the cortex is modulated together, and certain subcortical structures (including the thalamus) display opposing fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falahpour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Olbrich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moosmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Poudel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feige et al., 2005</xref>). These inversely related signals may be the hemodynamic correlates of subcortical arousal modulation, and perhaps reflect inhibition of incoming sensory signals to the cortex by the thalamus in a feedback role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sherman and Guillery, 2002</xref>). Here, we use the temporal expression of an EEG arousal-linked fMRI signal pattern (‘template’) to estimate a subject’s alertness fluctuation across the course of an fMRI scan. In addition to finding that such an fMRI-based inference of alertness correlates with electrophysiological arousal, consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falahpour et al., 2018</xref>), the use of binaural tones here enabled us to investigate its bidirectional interaction with sensory stimuli.</p><p>In the pre-stimulus interval, the fMRI alertness index was indicative of upcoming behavioral responses. This finding extends a body of prior work linking fMRI spontaneous activity with behavior and perception (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sadaghiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sadaghiani et al., 2015</xref>), and it is also interesting to consider the potential links between the present findings and large-scale network patterns that have been previously shown to predict vigilance or tonic alertness. In particular, higher levels of pre-stimulus activity in the default-mode network and/or salience (cingulo-opercular) network, and lower levels in task-positive/dorsal attention networks, have been associated with auditory stimulus detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sadaghiani et al., 2009</xref>) and faster reaction times in visual psychomotor vigilance task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thompson et al., 2013</xref>). In line with these observations, our template map – derived from EEG spectral power fluctuations – is negative in areas spanning dorsal attention network and had weak positive correlations in the anterior cingulate cortex, a key node of the salience network; however, we did not see group-level positive effects in the default-mode network. Future work may investigate the degree to which shared and distinct physiological mechanisms account for these observations, as well as the extent to which arousal interacts with other neural sources of behavioral variability, such as mind wandering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kucyi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Given that broad regions of cortex together exhibited correlated negative responses to arousal, we also investigated whether a much smaller set of voxels may suffice for extracting an alertness measure from fMRI. Indeed, we found that retaining even just 1% of positive voxels and 1% of the negative voxels produced only a 5.7% decrease in performance on average (in terms of correlation with EEG alertness). In addition, the pre-stimulus alertness index – estimated from this highly reduced template – replicated the main effect of behavioral response seen with that estimated from the whole-brain template. This effect suggests that a joint pattern of positive and negative voxels may be most critical for decoding arousal with the present approach, consistent with our prior results in macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). However, unlike in the macaque study, where the strongest positive voxels in the template (i.e., those which had the greatest positive correlation with alertness) were localized to thalamus, here we found the strongest positive correlations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), though weaker positive clusters were also found in mediodorsal thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex. One potential difference may come from the manner in which the template map was derived – here from the EEG alpha/theta ratio during eyes closed, and in the macaque study from spontaneous eye opening/closure. Positive correlations between an arousal index and CSF have been seen in prior human EEG–fMRI studies that use a continuous EEG power ratio (alpha to theta and delta bands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falahpour et al., 2018</xref>) and discrete EEG-defined vigilance staging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Olbrich et al., 2009</xref>), where ventricular signals in the latter were suggested to potentially relate to effects of heart rate (HR) on fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Munck et al., 2008</xref>). A pattern very similar to the reduced template, with opposing gray-matter and ventricular signals, was also reported to comprise the first principal component of the global fMRI signal that is modulated by sleep depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McAvoy et al., 2019</xref>). An inverse relationship between CSF and gray-matter signals has also been found to correlate with EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fultz et al., 2019</xref>), and both EEG and autonomic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Özbay et al., 2019</xref>), during sleep. One mechanistic explanation offered recently is that widespread fMRI signal changes, generated by either neuronal or autonomic activity, lead to antagonistic fMRI signal changes in the downstream venous vasculature, in part due to a disjoint timing and amplitude relationship of blood volume and blood oxygenation effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Özbay et al., 2018</xref>). Further work will be necessary to establish potential links between these observations and those of studies which have observed CSF fMRI signals in other EEG frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kiviniemi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A general challenge in understanding the effects of arousal in fMRI stems from the complex assortment of neural, metabolic, and physiological factors contributing to BOLD fMRI signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duyn et al., 2020</xref>). Fluctuations in arousal are closely coupled with physiological changes, such as changes in HR and respiratory patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Özbay et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is hard to disentangle these various effects with certainty. However, when the goal is to detect vigilance changes from fMRI, systemic physiological effects in fMRI signals may, in fact, contribute useful state-related information. In additional experiments, we found that projecting out low-frequency fluctuations in HR and RV generally reduced the correlation between the fMRI and EEG alertness measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and Materials and methods), suggesting that retaining low-frequency systemic physiological components may present useful information when the goal is to extract arousal fluctuations from the fMRI data. The whole-brain template derived here also overlaps very closely with a spatial pattern linked with sympathetic arousal in stage-2 sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Özbay et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Özbay et al., 2018</xref>) as well as in drowsy wakefulness and stage-1 sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2018</xref>), whereby gray-matter regions (predominantly primary sensory cortex) are anti-correlated with BOLD signal in deep white matter and CSF. Our template map may, therefore, reflect in part the concurrent modulation of central and peripheral arousal, and their systemic physiological correlates.</p><p>Beyond providing information about ongoing arousal levels, an fMRI-derived alertness index may also allow for more precisely identifying task-evoked activation. While it is widely recognized that natural drifts in wakefulness are common during fMRI, few studies explicitly model dynamic arousal fluctuations in standard fMRI task analyses, as concurrent EEG and pupillometry is relatively uncommon during routine fMRI scans. Here, we observed that including the fMRI alertness index as a covariate increased the statistical significance of task-active sensory and motor regions as well as canonical salience network regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Menon and Uddin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crottaz-Herbette and Menon, 2006</xref>), and reduced widespread cortical deactivations. Regarding the latter, it is also worth noting that when only the task stimuli are modeled, the resulting activation map bears some resemblance to the vigilance template itself, showing similar patterns of negative BOLD signal changes and positive signals in white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This phenomenon might be explained by task-induced arousal and autonomic fluctuations, which are mitigated when including an arousal covariate. However, an important caveat is that the ‘true’ activation state of the brain is not known; for instance, here one cannot be certain whether diminishing the negative responses with an alertness covariate is also removing local neural effects. We also note that this analysis was not intended to suggest an optimal set of nuisance covariates, but to provide an indication of how covarying for measures of alertness may impact fMRI analyses. Future work may investigate this phenomenon in a wider range of task contexts.</p><p>A major goal of template-based alertness estimation is to provide an avenue for researchers to infer fluctuation in alertness from fMRI data when external measures such as EEG and pupillometry are not available in the scanner, which is the case for most existing fMRI data and publicly shared databases. Given a template map trained on a set of EEG–fMRI data (such as this one), researchers could apply it to other fMRI datasets to extract time courses of alertness fluctuation. The present results suggest that, in addition to correlating with an electrophysiological alertness index, this fMRI alertness index may be sensitive to brain states that modulate behavioral responses. Nonetheless, the approach currently has several limitations. One is that it currently detects primarily <italic>relative</italic>, rather than absolute, levels of alertness across a scan. Since spatial correlation is used to determine a frame-by-frame alertness measure, the fMRI alertness index is restricted between −1 and 1. In addition, as fMRI signals are often detrended to remove scanner artifacts, such an index may not detect slower baseline shifts in alertness. In addition, we and others observe inter-subject and inter-scan differences in the performance of fMRI alertness estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falahpour et al., 2018</xref>). Such differences may partially reflect the degree of alertness fluctuation present in the fMRI data itself (with greater modulation of alertness lending itself to better prediction), but these questions are currently under investigation.</p><p>One key limitation of this study is the small sample size. As a result, the effect sizes of the current results may be overestimated, and findings may not generalize well to the population from which they are sampled. Future work should be carried out with this approach using larger sample sizes as well as other experimental conditions. Nonetheless, there are several factors that increase our confidence in the present results: our scans are long (24.5 min per scan), and the replication analyses carried out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref> further support the generalizability of this approach. Furthermore, although the present study centered on predicting task-related behavioral responses, we also performed an analysis in which the template was constructed from the task scans, and the fMRI alertness index was evaluated on the held-out resting-state scans, obtaining comparable results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Another limitation is that here, we only considered a template-based approach and a lasso regression model to predict alertness. It is possible that other approaches could be used to extract dynamic measures from alertness from fMRI. However, our current results with these two models support the notion that vigilance can be robustly estimated from fMRI data, and indicate that there may be multiple approaches for extracting this information. Further investigation of alternate linear models for vigilance prediction would be an interesting area to develop in future work, including the use of other regularization methods as well as parcellation atlases for deriving input time series.</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that time-resolved predictions of alertness, directly estimated in fMRI data without the need for simultaneous EEG, may capture inter-trial behavioral responses and continuous internal state variations. These findings have implications for broadening the study of brain arousal, and its interactions with cognitive and perceptual variability, in the large number of fMRI studies that lack external vigilance measures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and data acquisition</title><p>Simultaneous EEG–fMRI data were acquired from 14 healthy, right-handed adult subjects (eight females, aged 26 ± 4 years). All subjects provided written informed consent, and human subjects protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the National Institutes of Health and Vanderbilt University. From these subjects, scans acquired in the eyes-closed resting state and/or with a sparse auditory task (described below) were considered for analysis. One scan was excluded due to a buffer overflow error in the EEG data acquisition. This yielded a total of 23 scans (11 resting-state scans and 12 auditory task scans), each lasting 24.5 min. Further details about the scans corresponding to each subject are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>MRI data were acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a Siemens 64-channel head/neck coil. A high-resolution, T1-weighted structural image (TR = 2200 ms, TE = 4.25 ms, flip angle = 9 deg, inversion time = 1000 ms, matrix = 256×256, 160 sagittal slices, 1 mm isotropic) was acquired for anatomic reference. BOLD fMRI data were acquired with a multi-echo, gradient-echo EPI sequence, with the following parameters: flip angle = 75 deg, TR = 2100 ms, echo times = 13.0, 29.4, and 45.7 ms, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>, slice gap = 1 mm, matrix size = 82×50, 30 axial slices, acceleration factor = 2. The duration of each scan was 24.5 min (700 volumes). Scalp EEG was acquired simultaneously with fMRI using a 32-channel MR-compatible system (BrainAmps MR, Brain Products GmbH) at a sampling rate of 5 kHz and was synchronized to the scanner’s 10 MHz clock to facilitate reduction of MR gradient artifacts. EEG channels were referenced to FCz. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and respiration belt signals were also acquired during the scans (Biopac, Goleta, CA). The PPG transducer was placed on the left index finger, and MRI scanner (slice) triggers were recorded together with the physiological and EEG signals for data synchronization.</p><p>For the resting-state scans, subjects were instructed to keep their eyes closed and to stay awake as best as possible. For the auditory task, binaural tones were delivered (VisuaStim Digital; Resonance Technology, Northridge, CA) with randomized inter-stimulus intervals. For the auditory task, data were drawn from scans having either of two versions of this task, where the two versions differed only in the timing of tone delivery. In one version (corresponding to half of the scans), the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) ranged between 29 and 41 s (41 trials per scan); in the other version, tones were presented with ISI ranging from 8 to 88 s, from which we retained only those which occurred at least 24 s after the previous stimulus (and at least 10 s prior to the subsequent stimulus), resulting in 29 trials per scan. Subjects were asked to make a right-handed button press as soon as possible upon hearing a tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lim and Dinges, 2008</xref>). Auditory tones were delivered via earbuds placed over subjects’ ear plugs. During the task scans, subjects were also instructed to keep eyes closed. One rationale for using an eyes-closed auditory task (e.g., as opposed to an eyes-open or visual task) is that it avoids the possibility of subjects missing a stimulus due to variation in their gaze.</p><p>Although the instruction was for subjects to stay awake, the long scans were designed to elicit variability in vigilance state – particularly, reduced wakefulness and drifts between wakefulness and light sleep. A random half of the resting-state and task data were independently sleep staged by two certified technologists at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Standard sleep scoring was carried out in 30 s epochs, according to standard AASM criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2007</xref>). These ratings indicated that, across all scans combined, 85.6% of epochs were rated as ‘wake’, suggesting that subjects were mostly alert. It is therefore likely state sleep was not a major factor in our experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>fMRI and EEG pre-processing</title><p>Within each scan, the time series of 700 volumes corresponding to each of the three echo times were processed in the following way. For all three of these echo time series, the first seven volumes were dropped to allow magnetization to reach steady state. Then, motion coregistration (six-parameter rigid body alignment) and slice-timing correction were carried out using the functions <italic>3dvolreg</italic> and <italic>3dTshift</italic> in AFNI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni">https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni</ext-link>). For motion coregistration, the alignment parameters were estimated only for the time series of the second (middle) echo, and the resulting parameters were applied to the time series of all three echoes. Maximum frame-to-frame displacement was also calculated, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. Following this initial processing, multi-echo ICA denoising was carried out using <italic>tedana</italic> 0.0.9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elizabeth and Salo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kundu et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, this procedure aims to separate fMRI signal components generated from BOLD mechanisms from those arising from non-BOLD signal sources (such as scanner drifts and head motion). Spatial ICA is performed on the multi-echo fMRI data, and the resulting components are sorted using automated criteria to determine those which exhibit linear scaling in their percent-signal-change as a function of echo time (‘BOLD’ components) and those which do not (‘non-BOLD’ components). The data are then re-constructed using only the former. A more complete description of this approach can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>, and several studies have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing artifacts including head motion, and aliased cardiac pulsatility and breath-to-breath respiratory artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kundu et al., 2013</xref>), the latter of which are otherwise handled with methods such as RETROICOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glover et al., 2000</xref>). However, fMRI variance due to low-frequency respiratory volume (RV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birn et al., 2006</xref>) and cardiac rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shmueli et al., 2007</xref>) fluctuations are unlikely to be removed by this procedure, as they arise from a BOLD mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kundu et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we calculated RV and cardiac rate signals but did not initially project them out of the data, as their impact was investigated in the analysis (see Methods). Following multi-echo denoising, fMRI data were nonlinearly registered to a standard-space MNI152 template using SPM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>), followed by fourth-order polynomial detrending and spatial smoothing (FWHM 3 mm) in AFNI.</p><p>For the EEG data, reduction of gradient and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts was carried out using BrainVision Analyzer 2 (Brain Products, Munich, Germany), with parameters and procedures described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moehlman et al., 2019</xref>. Briefly, gradient artifact reduction followed the average artifact subtraction technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2000</xref>) using slice triggers. Following gradient artifact correction, EEG data were downsampled to 250 Hz. BCG artifact correction proceeded in two steps. First, an artifact template locked to cardiac R-peaks was subtracted from the data, after accounting for an estimated temporal offset between the R-peak and the BCG artifact. Second, independent component analysis (ICA) was performed on the template-subtracted data, and components likely related to residual BCG were removed by re-constructing the data (via inverse ICA) without the artifactual components. Putative BCG artifact components were manually determined based on the presence of temporal deflections locked with the cardiac cycle, a spatial topography consistent with BCG artifact, and a relatively large contribution to the global field power. For this study, we removed at most two components per scan, to avoid removing potential signals of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>EEG-based alertness index</title><p>A measure of alertness was computed from the EEG signal (averaged over channels P3, P4, Pz, O1, O2, Oz) within the 2.1 s interval of each fMRI time point (TR) by taking the ratio of the root mean square (rms) amplitude in the 8–12 Hz range over the rms amplitude in the 3–7 Hz range (alpha/theta ratio). Various EEG-based metrics have been associated with wakefulness; however, many are related to the ratio of power in middle frequency bands (i.e., alpha, beta) to the power in lower frequency bands (i.e., delta, theta) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Olbrich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klimesch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oken et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jobert et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horovitz et al., 2008</xref>). The alpha/theta ratio has previously been used in several human EEG–fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horovitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laufs et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The EEG alpha/theta time course was temporally aligned to the fMRI time course by removing the first seven timepoints.

The resulting signal is referred to as the ‘EEG alertness index’. For the analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, we use the raw (not hemodynamically filtered) version of the EEG alpha/theta ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>fMRI-based alertness index</title><p>A template-based fMRI-based estimate of alertness was calculated according to the approach in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Falahpour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Briefly, this approach centers on the use of a voxelwise spatial pattern (‘template’ map), indicating the degree to which a given voxel increases or decreases its activity in concert with fluctuations in alertness, as measured using EEG. Given such a template map (derived from a set of scans where concurrent EEG is available), one may then apply it to derive a time course of alertness in a new scan using the fMRI data alone (i.e., even if that new scan does not contain simultaneous EEG). To allow for unbiased estimates of performance, the template map was constructed using the set of resting-state scans, and its performance was analyzed in the set of auditory task scans. To create the template, the preprocessed fMRI data from each subject’s <italic>resting-state</italic> scan was temporally correlated, on a voxelwise basis, with the subject’s corresponding EEG alertness index, resulting in a voxelwise spatial map of Pearson's correlation coefficients. The resulting correlation maps underwent a Fisher-Z transformation, and were averaged across subjects to create a single, average template map (‘vigilance template’). Given this group-average vigilance template (3D spatial map), a time course of alertness (‘fMRI alertness index’) was estimated for each <italic>auditory task</italic> scan’s fMRI data without using the EEG, as auditory task scans were not used in forming the template map. After temporal z-scoring, a time course of alertness (‘fMRI alertness index’) was estimated for each task scan by projecting the vigilance template, on a volume-by-volume (TR-by-TR) basis, onto each volume of the task scan. To validate the correspondence between the fMRI alertness index and the EEG alertness index on the task data, we calculated the temporal cross-correlation between these two waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). A null distribution was generated by taking 1000 random permutations (by shuffling the assignment of EEG and fMRI alertness time courses between subjects) across the task scans. Their collective means and standard errors were compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.</p><p>To further investigate the reproducibility of fMRI alertness prediction, subjects were divided into two non-overlapping subgroups for both resting and task conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We then created a template from the resting-state data of one group and applied it to the task data of the other (non-overlapping) group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, to test whether a model trained on task data can be used to predict vigilance in resting state, we also performed the reverse, constructing our template this time with the task scans from each subject group, and evaluating the fMRI alertness index on the held-out resting-state scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Relationship between EEG/fMRI alertness and behavioral responses</title><p>To investigate the fMRI alertness index (and its comparison to EEG) in relation to trial-by-trial behavioral responses, we extracted segments of these waveforms in the [−5 s to 10 s] interval around each stimulus onset. To achieve more precise alignment with the stimulus onsets, these time courses were first interpolated 2.5-fold to a 0.84 s temporal grid to obtain a finer sampling axis. Each segment was then sorted according to whether it was a ‘hit’ (button press response) or a ‘miss’ (no button press response or a response of &gt;5 s). This resulted in a total of 310 hits and 90 misses, pooled across scans. The ‘hits’ were further separated based on the subject’s reaction time into a slow hit (&gt;565 ms, n = 155) and a fast hit (&lt;565 ms, n = 155), where the threshold was defined by the median across all subjects’ pooled trials. This threshold is close to the 500 ms value commonly used to define performance lapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lim and Dinges, 2008</xref>).</p><p>For the time courses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, temporal segments of the fMRI alertness index corresponding to ‘hits’ were first averaged across trials within each subject, and the mean and standard error across subjects at each time point are depicted by the shaded error bars. The same was repeated for ‘misses’. For further analyses across behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), time points of the fMRI (or EEG) data segments for each trial were averaged within the indicated interval of interest (e.g., ‘pre-stimulus’); then, within each scan, these values were averaged across trials of a given type (e.g., ‘miss’), resulting in one value per scan (per trial type). Comparison between trial types within the pre-stimulus interval were carried out using paired t-tests. Modulation of the fMRI alertness index (or EEG alpha/theta power) across fast, slow, and missed responses was assessed using a one-way ANOVA, with post hoc multiple comparisons analyses using the Tukey–Kramer method. Cohen’s d was used to assess effect sizes. An additional analysis was performed investigating the use of intra-individual threshold divisions as a comparison, considering the 10% fastest and slowest trials for each subject (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Based on these findings, we wanted to observe the impact of thresholding the template to smaller and smaller numbers of voxels in human subjects. This was performed sequentially from the full template down to 1% of the voxels with the strongest positive and negative correlation with the fMRI alertness index. Starting from the full template map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), at each iteration a new template was created by reducing the voxel sets to the fraction of highest positive and negative correlations from the following percentages: 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 10%, 5%, and 1%. The fMRI alertness index derived from the reduced voxel template was compared via temporal cross-correlation over all time points to the EEG alertness index for all subjects, over a set of lags from −10 to 10 TRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript evaluates multimodal fMRI-EEG data to estimate and assess attention in the fMRI signal based on its correlation with the EEG signal. The study of attention using fMRI is a well-studied topic, including somatosensory, visual, and auditory paradigms. Still, this study adds to the literature by using multimodal data to create the fMRI model. The discussed method follows prior work on the same approach and explores using a subset of voxels and applications as an fMRI signal regressor.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Conceptually, improved methods for addressing alertness confounds are a valuable contribution. The evaluation of the alertness index via the auditory task is a useful contribution. In terms of specific contributions, the reduction in the required spatial map, from the whole brain to a thresholded set of voxels, is an interesting methodological contribution. However, perhaps the main methodological contribution can be achieved more effectively using a direct approach, e.g., using a lasso model to predict the EEG alertness score using the fMRI time series. The lasso is considered a relatively standard statistical model, so it is not clear that the slight reduction in complexity is worth the loss in performance. At the very least, the authors should compare this approach to the presented thresholded correlation.</p><p>2. Reproducibility should be described more clearly. Reviewers recommend using cross-validation, dividing the data into 2 sets. The models can be built separately on each set, then compared. Also, one set's model can be used to evaluate prediction in the other set, and thus calculate sensitivity and specificity for this model. This would be complementary to the permutation testing already performed, as permutation testing is somewhat limited because these signals appear highly periodic (e.g., Figure 2) and thus can likely mismatch easily.</p><p>3. For the rsfMRI, participants were instructed to stay awake. Was this evaluated? There is a concern that participants might fall asleep during the 24.5m duration of the scan.</p><p>4. The auditory fMRI task made use of different tones. How were these tones delivered? Where earbuds used?</p><p>5. In the processing, it is stated that motion coregistration has been performed. Was there a quality check for excessive movement? When a participant moves more than the voxel size, the data are often discarded.</p><p>6. While testing hit/miss is clear, testing reaction times are limited to faster or slower than a single time (565 ms). As the study describes this method's use on an individual basis, consider intraindividual methods previously published, e.g., those from Thompson et al. 2013 (Citation 19), which includes separation by individual means, and also a separation of individuals into fast and slow groups.</p><p>7. A reaction time threshold of 565ms was used, but it remains unclear what the reason is for splitting the trails in an equal number of fast and slow trails. A reaction time of 565ms is still fast, and there can be a lot of variation between the fast and slow trails. A non-response was recorded if there was no button press within 5s. Therefore, perhaps fast can also be stated as below 2.5s and slow above 2.5s. The reference to Lim and Dinges (2008) indeed used a threshold at 0.5s but in a different setting.</p><p>8. A sample of 14 participants was investigated in this study. Would this sample be sufficient to prove the point of predicting fMRI results? There is no apriori sample size calculation, and therefore, it remains unknown if the data are sufficient to prove the point. In fMRI, usually larger samples up to 80 and more used to reduce variability/noise in the measurement.</p><p>9. The authors seem to indicate that the alertness metric could be used in resting-state fMRI data. Can't this be tested on either the authors' data or a publically available database? All that is needed is data with an index of alertness (such as eye-tracking) or even self-report of alertness/sleepiness.</p><p>10. Figure 5B shows positive (red) correspondence in a ventricle. This makes one wonder if this method is picking up on the EEG-linked CSF fluctuations reported elsewhere, e.g., Kiviniemi, V. et al. (2016). J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 36(6): 1033-1045. Can the authors discuss this?</p><p>11. What software was used for the processing of the data? Is the code available online? Please share via GitHub. Also, it remains unclear which statistical software was used for the statistical analyses.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;fMRI-based detection of alertness predicts behavioral response variability&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

To examine this point, we now compare the template-based approach to a lasso model. Just as we had done with the template method, here we train the lasso model on the resting-state fMRI scans and evaluate the performance on the task scans. For the lasso, we tested two models: one using a 268-region atlas (Shen et al., 2013) to parcellate the fMRI data into ROI time series as input to the model, and one using the fMRI time series from all voxels. For each approach, we trained a lasso model on the resting state data (temporally concatenated across subjects), using 10-fold cross-validation to choose the regularization parameter λ. We then applied the resulting coefficients (β weights) to the task fMRI data, to estimate an alertness time course for each task scan.</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 2 shows the correlation between the lasso-estimated fMRI arousal index and the EEG alertness index in each of the task scans. For comparison, correlations resulting from the fMRI alertness index estimated from the template-based approach are also shown. This figure shows that although our template method performed slightly better, the lasso model gave similar predictions, especially when using the 268-region atlas ROIs as input. This finding supports the notion that vigilance can be robustly estimated from fMRI data, and indicates that there may be multiple approaches for successfully extracting this information. Moreover, the initial feature reduction using a 268-region atlas seemed to improve the prediction beyond using a voxelwise lasso model. We believe that further investigating alternate linear models for vigilance prediction is an interesting area that we plan to develop in future work, including the use of other regularization methods such as ridge regression and elastic net, as well as alternate atlases for ROI definition. We now include these results as supplementary material, and have added the following to the Results (p.16), Discussion (p.22), and Methods (p. 33):</p><p>Results pg 16: “Finally, to investigate how this template-based method compares against a more conventional temporal regression approach, we also constructed lasso regression models (see Methods for further details). […] Further, the lasso model that was trained on fMRI time series from a 268-region atlas (Shen et al., 2013) was superior to that which used the time series from all voxels as input.”</p><p>Discussion p. 22: “Further, in this study we only considered a template-based approach and a lasso regression model to predict alertness. […] Further investigation of alternate linear models for vigilance prediction would be an interesting area to develop in future work, including the use of other regularization methods as well as parcellation atlases for deriving input time series.”</p><p>Methods p. 33: “While our primary analyses used a spatial template-based prediction approach, we also examine an alternate, temporal (lasso) regression model. Just as with the template method, here we train the lasso model on the resting-state fMRI scans, and evaluate the performance on the task scans. […] We then applied the resulting lasso coefficients to the task data, to estimate an alertness time course in each task scan.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This would be complementary to the permutation testing already performed, as permutation testing is somewhat limited because these signals appear highly periodic (e.g., Figure 2) and thus can likely mismatch easily.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we could more clearly show the reproducibility of our results. First, we’d like to clarify that our permutation testing was carried out by shuffling across-scans, rather than shifting signals within scans, to avoid issues of periodicity. I.e., the EEG signals (entire time series) were randomly mismatched with the fMRI data of the other subjects. We have now clarified this in the manuscript on p.28. We would also like to highlight that our original analysis used a hold-out validation scheme, in which we trained the model (derived the template) from the set of resting-state scans and applied it to the task scans. However, although disjoint sets of scans were used for training and testing, some of the same subjects contributed both a resting-state and a task scan, as detailed in our original Supplementary Table (Supplementary File 1). To further probe the reliability and across-subject generalizability of our approach, we have now divided the subjects into two separate groups, and examine the performance when training/testing on all 4 possible combinations. As shown below, we find that these various train-test splits have similar performance. We have added this to our Results and Methods sections on p. 7 and p. 29-30, respectively:</p><p>Results: “To probe the across-subject reproducibility of fMRI alertness prediction within our dataset, we performed an additional cross-validation analysis in which subjects were divided into two distinct groups. Model training was performed on the resting-state data from one group, and evaluated on the task data of the other group. Cross-correlations between the estimated resting-state fMRI alertness index and the measured EEG alertness index were comparable to the original results (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Methods: “To further investigate the reproducibility of fMRI alertness prediction, subjects were divided into two non-overlapping subgroups for both resting and task conditions (Supplementary File 2). […] Further, to test whether a model trained on task data can be used to predict vigilance in resting state, we also performed the reverse, constructing our template this time with the task scans from each subject group, and evaluating the fMRI alertness index on the held-out resting-state scans (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For the rsfMRI, participants were instructed to stay awake. Was this evaluated? There is a concern that participants might fall asleep during the 24.5m duration of the scan.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the instruction was for subjects to stay awake, the long scans were designed to elicit variability in vigilance state – particularly, reduced wakefulness and drifts between wakefulness and light sleep – in order to estimate the fMRI pattern that tracks alertness fluctuations as well as evaluate its use for detecting alertness in situations during which the subject may be drowsy or lightly sleeping during a task. However, the point raised by the reviewers is important for several reasons: (i) characterizing sleep stage would give a clearer picture of the data from which our present results are generated, and (ii) it is an open question whether a template map derived from data that includes N1 or N2 sleep is just as effective as one derived from the wakeful but drowsy state.</p><p>Half of our resting state and task data have been independently sleep scored by two certified sleep techs at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Standard sleep scoring was carried out in 30-second epochs, according to standard AASM criteria. These ratings indicated that, across all of the staged scans combined, 85.6% of epochs were rated as ‘awake’, suggesting that subjects were mostly alert. On pg. 24 in Methods, we now include:</p><p>“Although the instruction was for subjects to stay awake, the long scans were designed to elicit variability in vigilance state – particularly, reduced wakefulness and drifts between wakefulness and light sleep. […] It is therefore likely state sleep was not a major factor in our experiments”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The auditory fMRI task made use of different tones. How were these tones delivered? Where earbuds used?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information into our Methods (p. 24): “Auditory tones were delivered via earbuds placed over subjects’ ear plugs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the processing, it is stated that motion coregistration has been performed. Was there a quality check for excessive movement? When a participant moves more than the voxel size, the data are often discarded.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is important to consider head motion. We first note that our data is collected via multi-echo acquisition, and the multi-echo ICA denoising approach described in Kundu et al. (2012, 2013) was applied. This approach has been demonstrated to be very effective in reducing head motion effects (Kundu et al., PNAS 2013) by isolating BOLD from non-BOLD components based on the echo-time dependence of fMRI percent signal change. However, we have now also performed quality checks for excessive movement. For each scan, we have calculated the maximum frame-to-frame displacement, finding that only two subjects had a maximum displacement that exceeded our voxel size (3 mm), see Supplementary File 3. We additionally find that removing these subjects had no effect on the main results, (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). This has now been added into the Methods section (p.25) and Results (p. 12):</p><p>p. 25: “Maximum frame-to-frame displacement was also calculated, as shown in Supplementary File 3.”</p><p>p. 12: “Finally, while multi-echo ICA has proven effective in reducing head-motion effects (Kundu et al., PNAS 2013), we also ensured that scans with frame-to-frame head motion exceeding our voxel size (3 mm; corresponding to 1 resting-state and 1 task scan; Supplementary File 3) did not impact the major findings of this study. Removing these high-motion scans from the analysis had minimal impact on the correspondence between the fMRI alertness index with EEG and behavior (Figure 4—figure supplement 4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. While testing hit/miss is clear, testing reaction times are limited to faster or slower than a single time (565 ms). As the study describes this method's use on an individual basis, consider intraindividual methods previously published, e.g., those from Thompson et al. 2013 (Citation 19), which includes separation by individual means, and also a separation of individuals into fast and slow groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have updated our explanation of our threshold selection in our methods which was found by taking the median of all trials. Our use of 565ms as the threshold came from the median across all pooled reaction times. However, we agree that it is also interesting to look at intra-individual thresholds. So now, for each scan, we also took the fastest and slowest 10% of trials (as has been used in psychomotor vigilance tasks; Loh et al., 2004), and report those results in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The paired t-test was still significant. One difference in the bar plots (compared to Figure 4B-C) is that the ‘slow’ (yellow) alertness index is closer to that of the ‘miss’ (blue). This would make sense, given that this analysis considers the slowest 10% of trials; this pattern is also evident in the EEG, lending further confidence to our result. We also considered a between-subjects split (i.e., assigning entire subjects into a ‘fast’ or ‘slow’ group based on their median RT), but failed to find a significant separation (p&gt;0.05, two-sample t-test). One potential reason is because the variance of reaction times within some subjects were quite large.</p><p>We have now described the new findings in Results p.9-10 and Methods p.31 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. A reaction time threshold of 565ms was used, but it remains unclear what the reason is for splitting the trails in an equal number of fast and slow trails. A reaction time of 565ms is still fast, and there can be a lot of variation between the fast and slow trails. A non-response was recorded if there was no button press within 5s. Therefore, perhaps fast can also be stated as below 2.5s and slow above 2.5s. The reference to Lim and Dinges (2008) indeed used a threshold at 0.5s but in a different setting.</p></disp-quote><p>We’d like to reference essential revision 6 for the first part of this comment. We have considered that there are alternate ways to find the threshold and have now also performed an intra-individual separation into fast and slow trials. With regard to the 2.5s threshold, we have now also considered this, but find that across all subjects and trials, there was only one reaction time slower than 2.5s (histogram of reaction times Figure 4—figure supplement 5; now described in the Methods on p. 31). Thus, it appears that our alertness index can discriminate between slow/fast reaction times even amongst a set of relatively fast reaction times, supporting its sensitivity as a marker of underlying brain state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. A sample of 14 participants was investigated in this study. Would this sample be sufficient to prove the point of predicting fMRI results? There is no apriori sample size calculation, and therefore, it remains unknown if the data are sufficient to prove the point. In fMRI, usually larger samples up to 80 and more used to reduce variability/noise in the measurement.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewers’ concern about sample size, and have now pointed this out as a limitation in the Discussion. Nonetheless, there are several factors that increase our confidence in the present results. First, our scans are long (24.5 min per scan) and 310 total trials were available for mining behavioral responses. Second, the additional analyses suggested by the reviewers (see Comment 2 above) also support the generalization ability of the approach. Third, we also note that our subject sample size is on par with other multi-modal (EEG-fMRI) studies that have examined vigilance effects in fMRI and, importantly, whose results have since been replicated in independent studies. These include Falahpour et al., 2018 (10 subjects, used to investigate the same template-based vigilance prediction on resting-state fMRI; similar effects are replicated in our current study), and Olbrich et al., 2009 (15 subjects, used to evaluate fMRI activity associated with vigilance stage changes [with similar effects replicated in Ong et al., 2015]). Similarly, Hesselmann et al. 2008 used 12 subjects to study the ability to predict behavior from pre-trial fMRI activity, and Poudel et al. 2014 used a subset of 14 subjects to map activity associated with microsleeps. Regardless, we do agree that our subject size is a limitation and we are looking to expand on this for future studies. We have added this into the Discussion on pg. 22:</p><p>“Another limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size, and future work will be carried out with this approach using larger sample sizes as well as other experimental conditions. Nonetheless, there are several factors that increase our confidence in the present results: our scans are long (24.5 min per scan), and the replication analyses carried out in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 4 further support the generalizability of this approach.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The authors seem to indicate that the alertness metric could be used in resting-state fMRI data. Can't this be tested on either the authors' data or a publically available database? All that is needed is data with an index of alertness (such as eye-tracking) or even self-report of alertness/sleepiness.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now tried to clarify in this paper that this alertness metric has been successfully applied to resting-state data in previous work (Falahpour et al., 2018 in humans; Chang et al., 2016 in macaques). The main goal of the present study was to investigate the ability of this alertness metric to predict behavioral response variability throughout a task, and at a fine temporal resolution (i.e., looking in a 5s pre-stimulus window before the trial). In doing so, our resting-state scans served as a “training set” from which we created the template, and all evaluation was applied to the held-out (task) scans. However, as the reviewers point out, we can also examine the performance on resting-state fMRI using the current dataset. We have now provided an additional analysis in which we construct the template with the task scans and evaluate the alertness prediction on the held-out resting-state scans (see reply to Comment 2 above, and Figure 2—figure supplement 3). In addition, another recent study (Gu et al., 2020) used the same approach independently to calculate vigilance in resting-state Human Connectome Project data, and found it agreed well with self-reported sleepiness levels. We have added this to pg. 22:</p><p>“Further, although the present study centered on predicting task-related behavioral responses, we also performed an analysis in which the template was constructed from the task scans, and the fMRI alertness index was evaluated on the held-out resting-state scans, obtaining comparable results (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 5B shows positive (red) correspondence in a ventricle. This makes one wonder if this method is picking up on the EEG-linked CSF fluctuations reported elsewhere, e.g., Kiviniemi, V. et al. (2016). J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 36(6): 1033-1045. Can the authors discuss this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, we agree it would be great to discuss this point. In experiments with widespread BOLD changes, we have often seen an antipolar change in or near CSF, and in deep white matter (especially periventricularly). One potential mechanism is that these changes in CSF signals are at least in part due to changes in CBV, where CBV increases result in CSF volume decreases or vice versa (e.g., Ozbay, P.S. Neuroimage 2018, 176: 541). This is expected in peri-venous CSF spaces that are abundant in peri-ventricular white matter, within the ventricles near choroid plexus. In these regions, signal changes associated with CSF volume changes may substantially precede (and outweigh) BOLD effects. It has been reported that conditions that lead to vasoaction also change the EEG baseline shifts (Nita D.A. J Neurophysiol 2004, 92:1011), and this has also been suggested in the work of Kiviniemi et al. One difference between our study and the work of Kiviniemi et al. is that the latter used DC EEG data, whereas our fMRI arousal template was based on EEG band limited power, which effectively discarded the DC signal. Therefore, we believe our template may be picking up other mechanisms, but future work is necessary to examine this in more detail.</p><p>We have added a brief discussion of this possibility on p. 19.</p><p>“A plausable mechanistic explanation offered recently is that widespread fMRI signal changes generated by either neuronal or autonomic activity lead to antagonistic fMRI signal changes in the downstream venous vasculature, in part due to a disjoint timing and amplitude relationship of blood volume and blood oxygenation effects<sup>56</sup>. Further work will be necessary to investigate potential links between these observations and those of studies which have observed CSF fMRI signals in other EEG frequencies (Kiviniemi et al., 2016). ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

While concerns about the sample size remain, the reviewing editor believes that this manuscript can be accepted as the contributions are primarily methodological.</p><p>The reviewing editor requests that the authors address the sample size limitations more directly in the main manuscript. In addition to the justification given in the response, consider adding language to the manuscript that clarifies that the findings may not generalize to the population from which they have sampled. Authors should also consider mentioning that their small sample likely overestimates the effect size of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be helpful to address this point more directly in the manuscript. We now mention both points suggested by the Reviewing Editor: (1) that findings may not generalize to the population; (2) the small sample size may have led to overestimation of effect size. This material is now included on p. 22 of the revised submission:</p><p>“One key limitation of this study is the small sample size. As a result, the effect sizes of the current results may be overestimated, and findings may not generalize well to the population from which they are sampled. Future work should be carried out with this approach using larger sample sizes as well as other experimental conditions.”</p><p>Additional note: During the last review period, we had also come across 3 relevant references that we also wish to cite.
