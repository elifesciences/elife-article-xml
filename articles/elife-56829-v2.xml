reproduce, and in obtaining this essential nutrient they transmit deadly pathogens. Although crucial for the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, blood feeding remains poorly understood due to technological limitations. Indeed, studies often expose human subjects to assess biting behavior. Here, we present the biteOscope, a device that attracts mosquitoes to a host mimic which they bite to obtain an artificial blood meal. The host mimic is transparent, allowing high-resolution imaging of the feeding mosquito. Using machine learning, we extract detailed behavioral statistics describing the locomotion, pose, biting, and feeding dynamics of <italic>Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles stephensi,</italic> and <italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic>. In addition to characterizing behavioral patterns, we discover that the common insect repellent DEET repels <italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic> upon contact with their legs. The biteOscope provides a new perspective on mosquito blood feeding, enabling the high-throughput quantitative characterization of this lethal behavior.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Scientists often sacrifice their own skin to study how mosquitos drink blood. They allow mosquitos to bite them in laboratory settings so they can observe the insects’ feeding behavior. By observing blood feeding, scientists hope to find ways to prevent deadly diseases like malaria, which is transmitted by bites from mosquitos carrying the malaria parasite. These studies are not only unpleasant for the volunteers, they also have important limitations. For example, it is too risky to use pathogen-infected mosquitos that could make the volunteers sick.</p><p>A device called the biteOscope developed by Hol et al. may give scientists and their skin a reprieve. The device has a transparent skin-like covering that attracts mosquitos and supplies them an artificial blood meal when they bite. The device captures high-resolution images of the insects’ behavior. It is small enough to fit in a backpack when disassembled, costs about $900 to $3,500 US dollars, and is suitable for use in the laboratory or in the field. Using machine-learning techniques, Hol et al. also developed an automated system for analyzing the images.</p><p>The researchers tested the device on four types of disease-transmitting mosquitos. In one set of experiments, <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitos were recorded interacting with a biteOscope partially coated with an insect repellent called DEET. The images captured by the biteOscope showed that the mosquitos are attracted to the warm surface and land on the part coated with DEET. But when their legs come in contact with the repellent, they leave.</p><p>The biteOscope provides scientists a new way to study blood feeding, even in mosquitos infected with dangerous pathogens. It might also be used to test new ways to prevent mosquitos from biting and spreading disease. Because the device is portable and relatively inexpensive, it may enable larger studies in a variety of settings.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mosquito</kwd><kwd>ethology</kwd><kwd>blood feeding</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>imaging</kwd><kwd>contact-dependent sensing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award at the Scientific Interface</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hol</surname><given-names>Felix JH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PiQMosqBite</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hol</surname><given-names>Felix JH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rubicon</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hol</surname><given-names>Felix JH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE35-0004-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambrechts</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE35-0003-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambrechts</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambrechts</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2-AI124336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prakash</surname><given-names>Manu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000200</institution-id><institution>United States Agency for International Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grand Challenges: Zika and Future Threats</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hol</surname><given-names>Felix JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Prakash</surname><given-names>Manu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new tool to visualize blood-feeding mosquitoes in high resolution and quantitatively characterize their behavior sheds light on contact-dependent sensing and blood-feeding dynamics of several medically relevant mosquito species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood feeding is essential for the reproduction of many mosquito species, and in the process, mosquitoes transmit myriad pathogens to their (human) host. Yet, despite being the focal point of pathogen transmission, many aspects of blood feeding remain ill understood. The initial step in obtaining a blood meal, flying toward a host, is relatively well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dekker and Cardé, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Breugel et al., 2015</xref>). The steps that unfold after a mosquito has landed on a host, however, are much less understood. Once landed, mosquitoes exhibit exploratory bouts during which the legs and proboscis frequently contact the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jones and Pilitt, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Jong and Knols, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clements, 2013</xref>). An increasing body of literature reports the presence of receptors involved in contact-dependent sensing on the legs and proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sparks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matthews et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dennis et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that these appendages evaluate the skin surface and thus serve an important role in bite-site selection. Yet, the role and mechanism of contact-dependent sensing in blood feeding is largely unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benton, 2017</xref>). In addition to the body parts that come in contact with the skin surface, the skin piercing labrum also serves as a chemosensory organ, guiding blood feeding in currently unknown ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Werner-Reiss et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jove et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition to external cues, an animal’s (internal) physiology may also affect its behavior. Nutrition, hydration, and pathogen infections, for instance, have been hypothesized to affect blood feeding behavior, for example by altering feeding avidity (i.e. number of feeding attempts) or the size of the meal taken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rossignol et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choumet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cator et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vantaux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hagan et al., 2018</xref>). These topics, however, remain a matter of debate, due to a lack of (standardized) assays to measure mosquito behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stanczyk et al., 2017</xref>). Quantitative mapping of <italic>Drosophila</italic> behavior provides an important perspective, suggesting that innovative experimental approaches and computational tools can fuel the acquisition of new insights (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moreira et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, apart from olfactometers and other flight chambers, very few assays to characterize the blood-feeding behavior of mosquitoes exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geier and Boeckh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Verhulst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Breugel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murray et al., 2020</xref>). Due to this paucity of assays, studies often expose human subjects to quantify the number of landings and/or bites, or the time it takes to complete a blood meal, and score experimental outcomes by hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jones and Pilitt, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ribeiro, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moreira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeGennaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dennis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>). The use of humans as bait constrains the number and type of experiments that can be done (e.g. prohibiting the use of infected mosquitoes) and limits the type, detail, and throughput of measurements that can be made. Furthermore, the opaque nature of skin prevents the visualization of the stylets after piercing the skin leaving this aspect of blood feeding almost entirely unstudied, except for one notable study using intravital imaging of dissected mouse skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choumet et al., 2012</xref>) and two much earlier descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gordon and Lumsden, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffiths and Gordon, 1952</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we developed the biteOscope, an open platform that allows the high-resolution and high-throughput characterization of surface exploration, probing, and engorgement by blood-feeding mosquitoes. The biteOscope consists of a rudimentary skin mimic: a substrate that attracts mosquitoes to its surface, induces them to land, pierce the surface, and engage in blood feeding. The bite substrate can be mounted in the wall of a mosquito cage allowing freely behaving mosquitoes access. By virtue of its transparent nature, the substrate facilitates imaging of mosquitoes interacting with it, including the visualization of the skin piercing mouthparts of the mosquito. We developed a suite of computational tools that automates the extraction of behavioral statistics from image sequences, and use machine learning to track the individual body parts of behaving mosquitoes. These capabilities enable a detailed characterization of blood-feeding mosquitoes. We demonstrate that the biteOscope is an effective instrument to study the behavior of several medically relevant species of mosquito and describe behavioral patterns of the two main vectors of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya virus (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>), and two important malaria vectors (<italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic> and <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>). The biteOscope allows detailed tracking of the complex interactions of mosquitoes with a substrate and can be used to characterize behavioral alterations in the presence of chemical surface patterns. Using this capability, we provide evidence that DEET repels <italic>Anopheles coluzzii</italic> upon contact with their legs, demonstrating the utility of body part tracking to understand behaviors mediated by contact-dependent sensing. We anticipate that the biteOscope will enable studies that increase our understanding of the sensory biology and genetics of blood feeding, and the effects external (environmental) and internal (physiology) variables have on this behavior. Given its relevance for pathogen transmission, dissecting the interplay between the mosquito sensory system and host-associated cues during blood feeding is of clear interest, and may suggest new avenues to interfere with blood feeding, and eventually curb pathogen transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The biteOscope</title><p>To allow mosquitoes to engage in blood feeding and feed to full repletion, a device needs to attract mosquitoes, allow them to explore and pierce the surface, and subsequently imbibe a blood meal. To design a tool that can easily be used in a variety of ‘mosquito labs’ (including (semi-)field settings), we sought to recapitulate this behavioral sequence using readily available and low-cost laboratory materials. Heat is a dominant factor in short-range mosquito attraction and can be used to attract mosquitoes to a surface and elicit probing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Healy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corfas and Vosshall, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zermoglio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Greppi et al., 2020</xref>). We constructed a bite substrate using an optically clear flask filled with water as a controllable heat source (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An artificial blood meal is applied on the outside of the flask and covered using Parafilm (a commonly used membrane in laboratory blood feeders) creating a thin fluid cell on which mosquitoes can feed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To elicit blood feeding in a transparent medium, we use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a strong phagostimulant, which, together with an osmotic pressure similar to that of blood and the presence of sodium ions, is sufficient to induce <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes to feed to full engorgement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galun et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duvall et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Anopheles</italic> also require sodium ions and a tonicity similar to blood to feed to full engorgement, but interestingly their feeding rate on artificial meals is independent of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galun et al., 1985</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The biteOscope.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the set up.

For the majority of data presented here, we used a 4.3 × 4.3 cm field of view (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) which allows up to 15 mosquitoes to explore and feed simultaneously while providing images at a resolution where small body parts like the stylets can easily be resolved. Depending on experimental requirements, the field of view (and correspondingly assay throughput) can be much larger at the expense of resolution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, for example, shows a 13 × 13 cm field of view. Individual mosquitoes can be easily tracked at that resolution, yet the visualization of small body parts is challenging.

As expected, rather short trajectories do not lead to engorgement, yet less intuitive is the observation that exploratory trajectories that do not lead to engorgement rarely exceed the duration of successful feeding trajectories (8% of non-feeding trajectories takes longer than the mean time to engorge). This suggests that a mosquito’s search for blood has a characteristic timescale that is independent of success, and when blood is not found within the time a typical meal takes, the search is aborted.</p><p>We further explored this observation using individual <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> which were offered a bite substrate with a meal of PBS with or without ATP. As PBS alone does not lead to engorgement, mosquitoes offered the PBS only feeder never engorged whereas mosquitoes interacting with the PBS + ATP feeder engorged to full repletion in the majority of cases (55%). High-resolution trajectory analysis enables us to dissect behavioral patterns that lead to (non-)feeding; a trajectory here is defined as landing, the ensuing behavioral sequence, followed by leaving the bite substrate by walking or flying (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Videos 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">10</xref> for two example trajectories). The velocity of a mosquito’s centroid can be used to classify locomotion behaviors (stationary, walking, flight) with high accuracy (89% see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods for details). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> presents ethograms of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> on these two bite substrates, and in agreement with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, shows that trajectories on feeders without ATP (non-feeding) have an approximately equal maximum duration as trajectories leading to full engorgement on the feeder with ATP. While mosquitoes do not increase the duration of exploratory trajectories when not feeding to repletion, the number of exploratory bouts mosquitoes undertook on the PBS only substrate was significantly higher compared to the PBS + ATP case (Wilcoxon rank-sum test p &lt; 0.05), resulting in a slightly longer total exploration time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests that mosquitoes not finding their desired resource increase the frequency with which they initiate searches rather than the duration of individual searches. This observation may be interpreted in the context of the dangers associated with blood-feeding: while on a host, a mosquito runs the risk of being noticed and subsequently killed. When not finding blood, it may therefore be beneficial to abort the search and evacuate from a risky, yet unproductive situation to try elsewhere. The trade-off between exploiting a potential resource versus exploring other options has been shown to depend on the internal state of individuals in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Katz and Naug, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that such mechanisms play a role here too. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> furthermore shows a strong behavioral heterogeneity between individual mosquitoes. While all individuals are from the same mosquito population (and raised and maintained under identical conditions) and interact with the same bite substrate, there is a clear heterogeneity in the number of times a mosquito visits the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, middle panel), the amount of time she spends exploring the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel), and the behaviors they engage in. Automatic classification of locomotion behaviors, shows that some individuals often land on the surface to engage in short interactions, while other individuals undertake much longer trajectories. These long trajectories, in turn, vary in the amount of stationary versus locomotion behaviors. The richness of these data highlight the potential of the biteOscope to quantitatively characterize the intricacy of individual behaviors hidden in population averages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Feeding behavior of individual <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Ethograms of individual <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> interacting with a bite substrate offering a PBS only meal, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<bold>A</bold>), and a meal consisting of PBS + 1 mM ATP, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>9</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<bold>B</bold>).

Body part tracking is powerful to address a variety of questions, for example by determining points of surface contact of specific appendages, or to estimate the pose of an animal, which when tracked over time can be translated into a behavioral sequence. We used a recently developed deep learning framework, DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>), to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the head, proboscis, abdomen, abdominal tip, and six legs of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Due to their morphological similarity, the same CNN can be used to track the body parts of both <italic>Aedes</italic> species with a mean accuracy of 11 pixels (275 micrometer, see Materials and methods for details) in a 4.3 × 4.3 cm field of view. Tracking stylet insertions into the artificial meal during probing and feeding using DeepLabCut was challenging, and therefore not included.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref> shows body part tracking results of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and reveals the choreography of three distinct behaviors. Anterior grooming is characterized by circular motion of the forelegs followed by the proboscis, while the middle legs remain stationary (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). During walking, the tips of all six legs oscillate along the body axis while the proboscis explores laterally (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>), while during probing, the fore and middle legs pull toward the body and the proboscis remains stationary (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>). Inference is done on raw images and the obtained coordinates thus subject to movement of the mosquito. To correct for this, the coordinates are translated and rotated to align along the body axis taking the abdominal tip as the origin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–I</xref> shows time series of the obtained egocentric coordinates and their corresponding wavelet transforms. The three behaviors each are associated with distinct periodic movements: smooth periodic motion of the forelegs during anterior grooming (x, and y coordinates), punctuated oscillations along the body axis during walking (x coordinate), and faster jerky movement during probing (x, and y coordinate of forelegs, y coordinate of middle legs). These trajectories can be used in concert with locomotion and body-shape features as inputs for behavioral classification algorithms. The data outputted by our computational pipeline is ideally suited for classification in either a supervised (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>) or unsupervised (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calhoun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tao et al., 2019</xref>) approaches (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Body part tracking reveals movement patterns of specific behaviors.</title><p>Color coding of plots in panels A-F are displayed at the bottom of the figure.

Through this approach, we addressed the open question if <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> is repelled by N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) upon contact. DEET has been in use as an effective insect repellent for decades and is thought to act on mosquitoes through several mechanisms that are either olfactory- or contact-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeGennaro, 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afify et al., 2019</xref> recently observed that volatile DEET does not activate olfactory neurons in <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> and reported that <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> does not avoid DEET by smelling it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afify et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afify and Potter, 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afify et al., 2019</xref> proposed that DEET may prevent <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> from locating humans by masking odorants emanating from potential hosts.

The middle panel is an example of ‘touch and go’ contact in which a mosquito lands on the DEET area, contacts it with several legs and proboscis, and takes off.

The 34 trajectories in which <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> visited the DEET area consisted of 25 ‘touch and go’ events in which an individual approached the DEET surface in flight, landed, and immediately took off after first contact (residence time on DEET surface &lt;0.5 second, see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref> for a typical ‘touch and go’ event played at 1/4 speed). In the remaining nine trajectories, <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> landed outside the DEET area and moved onto it (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>), the reverse scenario in which a mosquito would land on the DEET surface and move onto the non-coated surface was never observed. We performed body part tracking on the trajectories where <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> moved from the non-coated surface to the DEET-coated surface and developed analysis software that scores how often a specific body part visits an arbitrarily shaped region of interest. We observed that the legs of individuals came in contact with the DEET surface in all cases, whereas the proboscis only came in contact with the DEET surface in 5/9 cases (in cases where no proboscis contact was observed, the entire proboscis remained outside the boarders of the DEET-treated area). Together, these observations demonstrate that <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> are indeed repelled upon contact with DEET, and indicate that this behavior is mediated by sensilla on the legs, and likely not the proboscis. While contact-dependent sensing (e.g. by tarsal neurons) seems the most plausible mechanism to explain this contact-dependent avoidance, we cannot rule out that physical properties of the DEET coating play a role as well.</p><media id="video11" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-56829-video11.mp4"><label>Video 11.</label><caption><title><italic>An coluzzii</italic> landing on the DEET-coated surface and immediately taking off.</title><p>Video playing four times slower than real time.

The elimination of the need for a human subject opens new avenues of research, for example allowing blood-feeding studies with pathogen-infected mosquitoes, enabling precise surface manipulations and characterization of the associated behavior, and facilitates the use of high-resolution imaging and machine-learning-based image analysis. Through these innovations, the biteOscope increases experimental throughput and expands the type of experiments that can be performed and measurements that can be made. We developed computational tools that allow the behavioral monitoring of mosquitoes at an unprecedented level of detail. Behavioral research on other animals, including fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Werkhoven et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>) shows that high spatiotemporal resolution data describing the posture of animals can be very informative to dissect behavioral trajectories and compare behavioral statistics across individuals and experimental treatments. While the details of computational approaches differ, a common theme is the two dimensional embedding of a high-dimensional representation of an animal at a given time point (e.g. body part coordinates and derived features), data points in two dimensions can subsequently be clustered to reveal behavioral classes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for an illustration of this concept using tSNE to embed the data represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Translating such advances in computational ethology to mosquito research is a very promising avenue for future research.</p><p>We used the biteOscope to describe behavioral patterns of four medically relevant mosquito species and anticipate that such datasets will provide a useful ‘behavioral baseline’ for future studies quantifying the effect of a mosquito’s physiology on blood feeding behavior. The role of pathogen infections is particularly interesting in this respect, as infections may alter feeding behavior, for example by affecting the structural integrity of the salivary glands or other tissues, or inducing systemic change through the immune system or infection of neural tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rossignol et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Girard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cator et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turley et al., 2009</xref>). A quantitative understanding of such behavioral alterations, however, is lacking. Gaining such insights is of high epidemiological relevance, as mathematical models suggest that (pathogen induced) changes in bite behavior can have important implications for pathogen transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cator et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abboubakar et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to pathogen-induced behavioral changes, there are many other promising lines of inquiry, including the behavioral influence of the microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dickson et al., 2017</xref>), which, in other insects such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, influences locomotor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schretter et al., 2018</xref>) and food choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leitão-Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> research furthermore shows interesting examples of collective behaviors mediated by for example olfaction or direct contact between animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ramdya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lihoreau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramdya et al., 2017</xref>), it would be interesting to explore if mosquitoes also take advantage of collective intelligence when searching for food or avoiding noxious stimuli. Tools enabling high-throughput behavioral monitoring may also be useful to characterize population intervention strategies aimed at curbing pathogen transmission, such as <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infected <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, or <italic>Anopheles</italic> genetically engineered to be refractory to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection. Quantifying the behavioral effects of such interventions is an important step toward assessing the competitiveness of engineered mosquitoes in the field. As the biteOscope enables novel high-throughput experiments with a variety of mosquito species, we anticipate that it will prove useful for the characterization of various behaviors relevant to pathogen transmission.</p><p>By tracking the individual body parts of <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>, we discovered that they are repelled by DEET upon leg contact—a mechanism that may work in concert with other ways in which DEET prevents anopheline mosquitoes to locate humans. Our findings regarding <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> are in agreement with observations in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> which are also repelled by DEET upon leg contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeGennaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dennis et al., 2019</xref>). However, in contrast to <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>, olfactory neurons of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are activated by volatile DEET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis and Rebert, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeckh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stanczyk et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has been reported to avoid volatile DEET in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stanczyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afify and Potter, 2020</xref>) (in contrast, an earlier study reported attraction of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> by DEET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dogan et al., 1999</xref>]). Together, these observations suggest that contact-based repellency may be conserved across <italic>Anopheles</italic> and <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and thus may be a potentially interesting target for the design of new repellents. It is less clear, however, what degree of conservation exists for the olfactory modes of action, as the only study comparing the olfactory effects of volatile DEET on <italic>Anopheles</italic> and <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in the same assay, suggests that the former is not repelled at all by volatile DEET, while the latter showed moderate repulsion (these behavioral responses may be concentration dependent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afify and Potter, 2020</xref>). This observation, together with the observation that volatile DEET activates olfactory neurons in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> while it does not seem to do this in <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>, suggest that volatile DEET may modulate the response of olfactory neurons to attractive stimuli (‘scrambling of the odor code’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pellegrino et al., 2011</xref>]) and/or trigger repulsion in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, while these mechanisms seem less appropriate for <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>. In addition to effects on olfactory signaling, DEET has also been suggested to decrease the amount of volatile odorants emanating from hosts through chemical interactions between DEET and the odorants resulting in the masking of a host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afify et al., 2019</xref>). As in this scenario the amount of attractive odorants reaching a mosquito is reduced, it may affect the behavior of a variety of species. The observation that both <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> avoid DEET upon leg contact, while the effects of volatile DEET may partly overlap and partly differ, may guide efforts aimed at uncovering the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Our results highlight the use of body part tracking in assigning roles to the various sensory appendages the mosquito body has. The recent surge in genetic tools available to manipulate mosquitoes is shedding light on the genetic elements that mediate pathogen transmission relevant behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matthews et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ingham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Greppi et al., 2020</xref>). Combining such molecular level insights with detailed behavioral tracking and chemical surface patterning, may enable a deep understanding of how contact-dependent sensing drives blood feeding, and other important phenotypes such as insecticide resistance and egg laying preferences.</p><p>When studying animal behavior in the lab a trade-off exists between the level of experimental control and detail of observation on the one hand, and an accurate representation of natural conditions and behaviors on the other. In case of the biteOscope, an engineered bite substrate opens up a variety of possibilities including surface modifications and high-resolution imaging impossible on human skin, yet the bite substrate does not offer the full set of cues (and thus behavioral responses) a human host would. It would therefore be interesting to add more human-associated cues, for instance using materials that resemble the texture of skin, or by coating the bite substrate with attractive human odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okumu et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to more closely mimicking human hosts by presenting olfactory stimuli, surface coatings could be used to dissect the role of contact-dependent gustatory behaviors on the skin surface in bite site selection. It is important to note that many of the factors that may change behavior mentioned above (e.g. infections/nutritional status or components of the microbiome) are best assessed in a relative manner, for example comparing non-infected to infected individuals. Comparing cohorts of mosquitoes undergoing different experimental treatments puts less emphasis on the absolute attractiveness of the bite substrate and thus mitigates potential issues related to the fact that a synthetic bite substrate is likely less attractive than a real live host.</p><p>We took advantage of the possibility to elicit engorgement on a transparent meal to facilitate imaging. It seems feasible to add a dye to the meal to provide visual cues to the mosquito without interfering with image quality. Using whole blood, however, is challenging in the current system. It would therefore be worthwhile to explore the use of microfluidics to incorporate blood flow into the bite substrate while maintaining optical access. A recent study took advantage of the biteOscope to quantify stylet contact with artificial meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jove et al., 2020</xref>), combining such efforts with artificial vasculature presents exciting opportunities to characterize the role of the stylets in the search for blood.</p><p>The biteOscope is designed with a variety of possible users in mind. It has a relatively modest price tag (900–3500 USD depending on the configuration), uses readily available materials and components, and when disassembled fits in a backpack—characteristics we hope will facilitate adoption. Beyond the lab, we foresee interesting applications of the behavioral tracking of mosquitoes in (semi-)field settings, and expect that innovative tools that provide high-quality quantitative data will enable discoveries in this space. We anticipate that the techniques and computational tools presented here will provide a fresh perspective on mosquito behaviors that are relevant to pathogen transmission, and enable researchers to gain a detailed understanding of blood feeding without having to sacrifice their own skin.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>(<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> )</td><td>KPPTN</td><td>Lambrechts lab, Institut Pasteur</td><td/><td>Thailand, G18</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>(<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>)</td><td>D2S3</td><td>BEI resources</td><td/><td>Puerto Rico x Nigeria cross</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>(<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>)</td><td>Liverpool</td><td>Vosshall lab, Rockefeller University</td><td/><td>West Africa</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>(<italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>)</td><td>BP</td><td>Lambrechts lab, Institut Pasteur</td><td/><td>Vietnam, G23</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>(<italic>An. stephensi</italic>)</td><td>Sda500</td><td>CEPIA, Institut Pasteur, Paris</td><td/><td>Pakistan</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>(<italic>An. coluzzii</italic>)</td><td>N’Gousso</td><td>CEPIA, Institut Pasteur, Paris</td><td/><td>Cameroon</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>biteOscope code</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hol, 2020</xref> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/felixhol/biteOscope">github.com/felixhol/biteOscope</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/biteOscope">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/biteOscope</ext-link>).</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>DeepLabCut</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mathis et al., 2018</xref></td><td/><td>version 2.0.9</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mosquito rearing and maintenance</title><p>The mosquito species/strains used in this study are described in Key resources table.

To facilitate mounting of the bite substrate, an opening having the same dimensions as the bite substrate was cut in the floor or one of the walls of the cage (all design files are available on Github). We noted that orientation of the bite substrate affects both the landing rate of mosquitoes (e.g. <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> had a lower landing rate on vertically mounted substrates compared to those mounted in the floor) and their orientation (on vertical surfaces mosquitoes aligned with gravity, head up bottom down). While this suggests that orientation is an interesting parameter to explore, all experiments presented here were performed with floor-mounted substrates to prevent behavioral biases possibly associated with vertically mounted substrates. The bite substrate was made using a 70-mL culture flask (Falcon 353109) filled with warm water maintained at 37 by a Raspberry Pi taking the input of a waterproof temperature probe (DS18b20, Adafruit) to control a Peltier element (digikey) used for heating.

In addition to the mean performance across all body parts, prediction accuracies per groups of body parts (core: head, proboscis, abdomen, abdominal tip, (and palps for <italic>Anopheles</italic>); and legs: tips of all six legs) was 1.7 pixels (43 μm) for core body parts, and 1.6 (40 μm) for the tips of legs for the best performing <italic>Aedes</italic> model; and 5.2 pixels (130 μm) and 3.7 pixels (93 μm) for core and legs for the best performing <italic>Anopheles</italic> model. Trained models are available on GitHub.</p><p>We used cropped image sequences (described above) for inference. To facilitate downstream analysis of body part tracking data, body part coordinates can be aligned along the body axis (defined along the abdominal tip and center of the abdomen) yielding coordinates invariant of body orientation or movement. The wavelet transforms shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are obtained by applying the Morlet continues wavelet transform to this data. Two-dimensional embedding of the aligned body part coordinates and their wavelet transform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) was done by scaling the data (subtracting the mean and scaling to unit variance) and using t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (tSNE) in two dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Experiment-specific procedures</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Feeding experiments</title><p>Population experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were performed with 15–30 individuals in a 10 × 10 × 10 cm cage. Groups of mosquitoes were recorded for up to 1 hr and replaced by a new group for a subsequent recording (mosquitoes were not re-used and discarded after experiments). We noticed that activity is typically highest in the first 15–30 min of an experiment, depending on the question being addressed multiple short experiments may therefore yield more data compared to a single long experiment. Individual <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were recorded for 10 min per mosquito and discarded after the experiment. Movement status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) was classified using the velocity derived from tracking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>DEET experiments</title><p>As DEET dissolves Parafilm and plastics, a glass surface was placed on top of the heated culture flask (no artificial meal was present during DEET experiments). The glass surface was partly coated with 50% N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) using a cotton swab. Groups of 20 <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> females (14 days old) were released into a 10 × 10 × 10 cm cage with the DEET-coated substrate mounted in the floor. Images were acquired at 40 frames per second for 1 hr. Mosquito and body part tracking was performed as described above. The landing rate was calculated by summing the number of trajectories that started on the surface in question (DEET coated versus non-coated) and normalizing this value by the area of the surface. The dwell time was calculated as the average duration of all trajectories on the surface in question. The duration of trajectories moving from the non-coated surface to the DEET-coated surface was split proportionally to the time spend on the respective surface, trajectories moving from the DEET-coated surface to the non-coated surface were not observed indicating that the dwell time on the DEET surface was not limited by the size of the surface.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Emilie Giraud, Gregory Murray, Haripriya Vaidehi Narayanan, Shailabh Kumar, William Gilpin, Hongquan Li, Leslie Vosshall, Veronica Jove, and all members of the Prakash and Lambrechts labs and the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity for valuable discussions; and Catherine Lallemand, Sylvain Golba, and Patricia Baldacci for help with the rearing of mosquitoes.

Your article has been reviewed by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript describes an experimental framework for studying female mosquito foraging and feeding behavior. By combining previously established stimuli promoting female feeding behavior, with image-based tracking, computer vision algorithms, and deep learning, the setup is able to record trajectories from multiple mosquitos within an acrylic box containing an area that contains an artificial meal which the mosquitos can reach by piercing a parafilm membrane. The authors provide data allowing them to quantify different parameters which are of high relevance to future studies of the neurobiology controlling mosquito blood-feeding and hence the potential transfer of pathogens. As proof of principle, they explore the impact of DEET on <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> behavior, which leads them to suggest that chemosensory neurons in the legs but not the proboscis are required for the deterring effect of DEET.</p><p>This manuscript is of great importance to the field as it represents an important technical advance that will support further studies of mosquito blood-feeding, a disease-transmitting behavior. The method is super useful, but the technical description and the discussion of the data is a bit superficial. Also, the method is limited to clear liquids, this technical limitation that is difficult to overcome and as such should be acknowledged and discussed in the manuscript. While the different aspects of the method are not novel on their own, the experimental framework is intriguing both in terms of the technical aspects as well as the potential to other researchers in the field. Importantly, the authors make the hardware design as well as the software openly available. The manuscript is well written and concise. However, the reviewers raised some major concerns that will need to be addressed.</p><p>The Title:</p><p>The mention of blood-feeding in the title is misleading. It should reflect the experimental setup. Therefore, blood-feeding should be replaced by feeding. Temperature is not a good proxy for blood.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have completely avoided a large literature on the difference between the effects of DEET alone versus DEET and human odor. The authors need to review the literature on this topic more thoroughly and address their interpretation of their data. There is substantial data suggesting that DEET cannot repel mosquitoes in the vapor phase without human odor or other attractive odors. For a review on the topic, the authors should read &quot;The mysterious multi-modal repellency of DEET&quot; (https://doi.org/10.1080/19336934.2015.1079360). It is also untrue that there is evidence presented that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes can sense DEET without human odor in the vapor phase in DeGennaro et al., 2013. The section on DEET needs to be revised to address these issues and those below to fairly describe the authors results in context. DeGennaro et al., 2013 also should be referenced when discussing the separation between contact and olfactory actions of DEET in the mosquito as that was one of the key findings of the publication.</p><p>2) It is not clear whether Anopheles mosquitoes are any different that Aedes mosquitoes in regard to the effect of DEET in the vapor phase. There is not enough evidence presented in the paper to come to this conclusion for the reasons listed above.</p><p>3) There is some literature that states that ATP is not a phagostimulant in Anopheles species (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3032.1985.tb00029.x). ATP works well in Aedes species to stimulate blood-feeding behavior. In this manuscript, the authors conclude that ATP has no effect on Anopheline feeding when compared to Aedes aegypti. Key components of the feeding solution are important to induce engorgement, but not the ATP. The authors should provide their arguments about the choice of the feeding solution used in the study place their findings in the context of earlier literature.</p><p>4) Another major concern is the lack of description and validation of the behavioral classification methods used in the manuscript. In its current form the authors do not explain how they segment the behavior of the animals into approach/take off, stationary, walking, exploration, engorged etc. The quality of the analysis will largely depend on how well these classifications capture the actual behavior. Likewise, the authors never benchmark their algorithms. It is critical that the authors quantify how often their algorithm misses or wrongly assigns a specific behavior. Given that the quantification of the engorgement volume is a key parameter it would be especially important to focus on that aspect of behavior (e.g. how is, for example, full engorgement defined?). Ideally, the authors would validate the video-based quantification of the ingested volume by measuring the actual ingested volume experimentally. But given the difficulty in performing experiments at the moment, a validation of the video data using manual annotations and acknowledging the limitation in terms of quantifying actual volume should suffice.</p><p>5) The authors should also validate and benchmark the performance of the deep learning-based detection of the appendages.</p><p>6) The authors mostly analyze movies from experiments with multiple animals. It is widely acknowledged that reliably tracking the identity of multiple animals is challenging. The authors should benchmark their algorithm and provide an error rate for assigning the correct identity to animals. This is key for the correct interpretation of the results.</p><p>7) While the use of a membrane to visualize the actual feeding behavior of mosquitoes is a key aspect of the setup, the authors did not fully exploit it. It would be important to go beyond the anecdotal data in the first figure and show analyses of the piercing and stylet behavior highlighting this key aspect of the setup.</p><p>8) Some of the statements in the manuscript are rather anecdotal and would be better supported by including their quantification in figures. Furthermore, statistical analysis needs to be described in more details for Figure 3, i.e. include exact p-values in the figure. It also seems that the number of samples (n=9-10) is relatively low for making solid interpretations. Finally, some of the numbers described in the main text do not match the caption label for Figure 2.</p><p>9) The quantitative analysis shown in Figure 5 is insufficient, especially because it does not fully support the statements made in the main text. How is the landing rate (and dwell time etc.) calculated? Are these values normalized to the area coated by DEET and inhomogeneities for mosquito landing observed on the arena? Furthermore, the authors should control or at least discuss the possibility that aversiveness is being caused by physical attributes of the coated surface (i.e., slippery surface).</p><p>10) The authors' efforts to make the setup openly available including parts descriptions and code repository are highly appreciated. However, reproducibility and openness could be further improved by making the software easier accessible and understandable by structuring the code in the repository and documenting it, because currently, it does not explain which files to use to reproduce the findings. I also could not find the source data of Figure 2 and Figure 3 as described in the data availability statement. Data from all figures should be made available, clearly labeled, code should be provided for reproducing all figures, and well documented for others to use.</p><p>11) The Discussion section is rather superficial. A more thorough comparison of how the observed behavior compares to feeding and foraging behavior of other animals, especially insects would be a valuable addition. Also, discussing the limitations of the method would be advisable. The authors should openly recognize and discuss how prudent is an extrapolation of questions around vectorial capacity and host-vector interactions from a minimalist system with synthetic skin, blood, and without human-specific attractants to 'real world'. If the authors believe that it would not be difficult to augment the experimental setup with a human odor (synthetic or real) or any other attractant, then the text should state this clearly.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>While the current experimental design of the BiteOscope provides advantages to tracking mosquito feeding behavior on humans or animals, a key question which remains unanswered is to which extent the behavior observed on the membrane is comparable to the behavior on a living host. Except for the actual blood feeing behavior, tracking animals foraging on a host should be feasible. It would be an extremely important addition to compare the behavior of mosquitoes in such a naturalistic setting with the behavior on the membrane. Understandably, in the current COVID situation performing experiments is challenging. Therefore, the authors should at least discuss this caveat and consider performing such experiments in follow-up work.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;BiteOscope, an open platform to study mosquito blood-feeding behavior&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This version of the manuscript is substantially revised. It addresses my prior concerns. In particular, I would point to the improved discussion of DEET and how the results presented in this paper fit into our understanding of DEET-mediated repellency. This paper will be of interest to <italic>eLife</italic>'s broad readership and is ready for publication in its current form.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have done a superb job at revising the manuscript and addressing the concerns of the reviewers. Especially given the difficult times.we are all facing. I especially appreciate the thorough validation of the algorithms and the improved description of the methods and the curation of the code on GitHub.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is much improved but I'd like some feedback on the DEET story before going any further.</p><p>This is a system with many different elements each of which has resolution limits, and the bulk of the reviewers' comments were directed towards getting them recognised and acknowledged. The authors have addressed everything and, in most cases, they seem to have edited and have altered the manuscript sufficiently.</p><p>Nonetheless it is ultimately an imaging system and even the best pictures never tell the complete story. For me, a few issues remain.</p><p>Blood feeding – given the artificial membrane, the absence of blood/ necessity for clear liquid and presumably subsequent digestion (e.g. peritrophic mem from. Line brane formation?), this is 'biting' behaviour rather than bloodfeeding? This is likely to be relevant to many of the applications listed in the Discussion section.</p><p>Similarly, is engorgement an accurate term for what's being measured? Engorgement = fed to repletion, but here that is not always the case and mosquitoes are simply 'fed'.</p><p>Also, I wondered whether viewing from directly beneath the ventral abdomen is the most reliable position to measure an abdomen expanding with ingested volume of fluid – i.e. does the abdomen of all individuals expand similarly in every time (e.g. parous vs. nullipars?); what about 3D?</p><p>DEET – I found the authors' reply confusing (which read as if Afify and Potter provided more convincing evidence than the authors had.) but the text in the revised manuscript text was much clearer. Nonetheless, I still have reservations: the contact vs. non-contact observations are fine but is this conclusion justified? Can imaging [alone] provide the evidence to solve this question?</p><p>1) If the two genera differ in responses to DEET vapour, then in the real world' Anopheles coluzzii would land frequently on DEET-treated skin, whereas Aedes aegypti would rarely/never land. I have no data but having used DEET as a repellent for over 30 years in Africa and elsewhere, I remember Anophelines being repelled completely.</p><p>2) In the insecticide world, we use the terms 'contact-irritancy' and 'repellent-induced response', the latter being a change occurring prior to, or without contact. Both are usually bundled together for convenience, often viewed as being a question of exposure dosage from low/vapour to high/contact. I've always had doubts, increasingly so with the recent papers by Ingham et al.</p><p>Is it possible that the different responses reported for the 2 genera are the result of different response thresholds, with Aedes being more sensitive at lower levels (vapour) than Anopheles?.… also, have the olfactory neurons in Anopheles coluzzii been explored (which is not mentioned)?</p><p>3) Can results from experiments with DEET in the absence of host stimuli be reliable or indicative of anything other than the mosquito can/cannot detect it?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56829.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript describes an experimental framework for studying female mosquito foraging and feeding behavior.

However, we note that full engorgement (the significant swelling of the abdomen when imbibing blood) only occurs when female mosquitoes feed on blood, while on nectar mosquitoes imbibe a much smaller volume (the volume of a typical nectar meal versus a blood meal in Ae. aegypti differs by a factor of 3 to 4 (Jove et al., 2020)). Furthermore, the piercing of a membrane and subsequent insertion of the stylets is a hallmark of blood feeding (Jove et al., 2020). As our method induces these hallmarks of blood feeding (and not nectar feeding) using a liquid that contains the essential components to elicit engorgement (osmotic pressure similar to blood, sodium ions, ATP) and a membrane that the stylets need to pierce to obtain the meal, we feel it is more accurate to refer to it as a method to study blood feeding as opposed to using the more general term ‘feeding’ (which would include e.g. nectar feeding).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have completely avoided a large literature on the difference between the effects of DEET alone versus DEET and human odor.

We have revised this part of the Results section thoroughly and have added a section on DEET in the Discussion section to accurately place our observations in the context of the current literature. We now cite DeGennaro et al., (2013) when discussing contact-dependent repulsion of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and have removed the reference to DeGennaro et al., (2013) when discussing the sensing of DEET by <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the absence of human odor, as indeed DeGennaro et al., (2013) do not report on this.</p><p>We now furthermore discuss (Discussion section) a recent study comparing olfactory behaviors in response to DEET across several species by Afify and Potter (Afify and Potter, 2020) reporting that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are repelled by DEET in the vapor phase presented in the absence of human odors. In contrast to previous studies that were difficult to interpret because they could not discriminate between olfactory-mediated repulsion and contact-dependent repulsion (e.g. Syed and Leal, (2008)), Afify and Potter, (2020) prevented mosquitoes from coming into contact with DEET to measure a purely olfactory response and observed that volatile DEET (100% concentration, presented alone) repelled <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<italic>An. coluzzii</italic> did not respond to DEET in this assay, while <italic>Cx. Quinquefasciatus</italic> showed stronger repulsion compared to <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>). We realize that this finding (reported by Afify and Potter, (2020)) contrasts with the statement brought up in the review report: “There is substantial data suggesting that DEET cannot repel mosquitoes in the vapor phase without human odor or other attractive odors”. However, we believe that this discrepancy may reflect the fact that many studies reporting on the effects of DEET do not assay repulsion by volatile DEET per se, yet test the absence of attraction in the presence of volatile DEET when mosquitoes face a choice between attractive odor alone versus attractive odor presented <italic>with</italic> DEET. In addition to Afify and Potter, (2020), we now also cite Stanczyk et al., (2013) which measured attraction of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to a heat source covered with either DEET or solvent impregnated cloth. No human odor was presented during this experiment and the heat source with impregnated cloth was placed outside the mosquito cage (0.5 cm from the mesh) to prevent contact. Stanczyk et al., (2013) observed a strongly reduced attraction of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to the DEET treated heat source, compared to the control heat source treated with solvent (í 30~ attracted to the control, 0% to the DEET treated heat source).</p><p>We also note that, in contrast to these two studies reporting repulsion of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> by volatile DEET without the presence of attractive odors (Stanczyk et al., 2013; Afify and Potter, 2020), an earlier study (Dogan et al., 1999) reported attraction of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> by volatile DEET alone. We now mention this diversity of results in the Discussion section and additionally point to (DeGennaro, 2015) for a review of the multi-modal repellency of DEET.</p><p>In summary, to place our observations regarding DEET repellency in context we now discuss:</p><p>1) Contact-based repellency by DEET observed in:</p><p>- <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> (our results)</p><p>- <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (DeGennaro et al., 2013; Dennis et al., 2019).</p><p>2) Olfactory responses to volatile DEET; we note that not all of these may be exhibited by a mosquito species, and (a subset of) these could potentially act in concert:</p><p>- Avoidance of DEET, also in the absence of human odors (the ‘smell and avoid’ hypothesis) e.g. observed in (Stanczyk et al., 2013; Afify and Potter, 2020)</p><p>- Inhibition of attraction to human odorants either through modulation of the olfactory system by ‘scrambling of the odor code’ (e.g. the ‘confusant’ hypothesis) and/or ‘smell and avoid’, for example observed in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (DeGennaro et al., 2013)</p><p>- ‘Masking’ of odorants by DEET through direct chemical interactions between DEET and odorants, e.g. described in <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> (Afify et al., 2019)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear whether Anopheles mosquitoes are any different that Aedes mosquitoes in regard to the effect of DEET in the vapor phase. There is not enough evidence presented in the paper to come to this conclusion for the reasons listed above.</p></disp-quote><p>The DEET experiments described in our manuscript sought to assess if <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> was repelled upon direct contact with DEET (and we conclude this is indeed the case). For effects in the vapor phase we refer to the literature and in response to point #1 have expanded this discussion. We cite a study by Afify and Potter, (2020) that observed a difference between <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>An. Coluzzii</italic> responding to DEET in the vapor phase: <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> was not repelled by 100% DEET whereas <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> showed moderate repulsion. See Afify and Potter, (2020).</p><p>Several studies report the activation of olfactory neurons in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> antennae by volatile DEET presented alone without human body odors (Davis and Rebert, 1972; Boeckh et al., 1996; Stanczyk et al., 2010). Activity-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in olfactory neurons of <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> on the other hand, suggests that volatile DEET presented alone does not activate olfactory neurons in the <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> antennae (Afify et al., 2019). This indicates that DEET in the vapor phase has a different effect on activation of the olfactory neurons of <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, and the repulsion assay by Afify and Potter, (2020) suggests this may have distinct behavioral effects.</p><p>Our experiments focussed on the contact-dependent effects of DEET on <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>, and it is interesting to note that our observations in <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> are very similar to those of DeGennaro et al., (2013) and Dennis et al., (2019) reporting on contact-dependent repulsion in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. In contrast to the similarities in contact-dependent repulsion by DEET, the literature discussed above (and in response to point #1) suggests that the olfactory responses to volatile DEET may to differ to some degree between the two species. To place our results in context, we now discuss these observations extensively in the Results section and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is some literature that states that ATP is not a phagostimulant in Anopheles species (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3032.1985.tb00029.x). ATP works well in Aedes species to stimulate blood-feeding behavior. In this manuscript, the authors conclude that ATP has no effect on Anopheline feeding when compared to Aedes aegypti. Key components of the feeding solution are important to induce engorgement, but not the ATP. The authors should provide their arguments about the choice of the feeding solution used in the study place their findings in the context of earlier literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of the study by Galun et al., (1985) demonstrating that ATP is not required to induce engorgement in several <italic>Anopheles</italic> species. However, as we did not perform feeding experiments with <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes without the presence of ATP, we did not discuss this study in the manuscript. We agree with the reviewers that this could be of interest to the readers and now cite Galun et al., (1985) on line 101 mentioning that ATP may not be required to induce engorgement in <italic>Anopheles</italic>.</p><p>All feeding experiments presented in the manuscript were performed using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 1 mM ATP as the artificial meal (with the exception of ‘PBS only’ experiments presented in Figure 3). We based our choice for the artificial meal on Galun et al., (1963) and Duvall et al., (2019) which demonstrate that eliciting the feeding response in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> requires sodium ions and an osmotic pressure close to blood. Galun et al., (1963) observed the highest percentage of feeding mosquitoes using 10 mM ATP in 150 mM NaCl (the same concentration as typical in PBS) and Duvall et al., (2019) observed robust feeding using 1 mM ATP in 120 mM NaHCO3. We chose 1 mM ATP in PBS as the artificial meal as it is a commonly used buffer that fits the criteria described by Galun et al., (1963) and Duvall et al., (2019). As Galun et al., (1985) report engorgement of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes on 150 mM NaCl (neutralized with NaHCO3) that is independent of ATP, we chose for consistency across our experiments and used the same formulation for experiments with <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes.</p><p>A separate study led by the Vosshall lab in which we collaborated characterizing blood detection in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> stylet (currently under review and available on bioRxiv (Jove et al., 2020)) used the biteOscope and showed that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> also engorge on a simplified saline meal consisting of 1 mM ATP in 110 mM NaCl and 20 mM NaHCO3 (compared to PBS: 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 3 mM Na2HPO4). We have verified that <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, and <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> also feed robustly on this simpli1ed formulation and now mention the possibility to use 1 mM ATP in 110 mM NaCl and 20 mM NaHCO3 in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another major concern is the lack of description and validation of the behavioral classification methods used in the manuscript. In its current form the authors do not explain how they segment the behavior of the animals into approach/take off, stationary, walking, exploration, engorged etc. The quality of the analysis will largely depend on how well these classifications capture the actual behavior. Likewise, the authors never benchmark their algorithms. It is critical that the authors quantify how often their algorithm misses or wrongly assigns a specific behavior. Given that the quantification of the engorgement volume is a key parameter it would be especially important to focus on that aspect of behavior (e.g. how is, for example, full engorgement defined?). Ideally, the authors would validate the video-based quantification of the ingested volume by measuring the actual ingested volume experimentally. But given the difficulty in performing experiments at the moment, a validation of the video data using manual annotations and acknowledging the limitation in terms of quantifying actual volume should suffice.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that adding additional details on the accuracy of the behavioral classification methods is a very useful addition to the manuscript. We performed a thorough benchmarking of our locomotion behavior classification and engorgement detection algorithms and have now included the results of this analysis in the text as indicated below and as Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Locomotion behavior classification</p><p>The classification of locomotion behaviors is based on the velocity derived from centroid tracking. In the original manuscript we mentioned velocity based locomotion classification very briefly in the Discussion section. Following the suggestions of the reviewers, we now include information regarding the performance of our classifier of locomotion behaviors as presented in Figure 3A and B of the manuscript. To quantify performance, we manually labeled the behavior of <italic>Ae. Albopictus</italic> mosquitoes exhibited in 1124 frames of the dataset presented in Figure 3 of the manuscript, and compared the labeled behaviors to the computationally detected behaviors. The overall accuracy of behavioral classification was 89%, with a per class accuracy of 90% (stationary), 89% (walking), and 97% (flight), with accuracy defined as: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>, with TP denoting true positives, TN true negatives, and O the number of observations. The classification of locomotion behaviors depends on the velocity thresholds set to distinguish flight, walking, and stationary behaviors, we therefore performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate the dependence of the classification accuracy on the thresholds used. Figure 2 shows the results of this analysis, demonstrating that classification accuracy peaks at 89% accurate classifications using a stationary – walking threshold of 2 mm/s and a walking – flight threshold of 12 mm/s, and is superior to 80% accurate for a range of parameters. We now include this information in the Results section and the Materials and methods section, and have included the figure detailing the threshold-dependence of classification accuracy as Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Engorgement detection</p><p>We now included a thorough characterization of the performance of the engorgement detection algorithm, and have included additional details in the Materials and methods section regarding the computational detection of full engorgement. To determine engorgement, we fit an active contour model to the mosquito’s body (with appendages computationally removed) and we use the area of the fitted shape as a proxy for engorgement. As can be seen in Video 7 and panels 1 and 2 of Figure 1H of the manuscript, the abdominal width increases during imbibing and saturates when a mosquito is fully engorged. After full engorgement, mosquitoes retract their mouthparts from the artificial blood meal and often remain stationary for a period to excrete excess liquid. In anophelines this is clearly visible as a growing droplet at the abdominal tip, whereas in <italic>Aedes</italic> this is less pronounced yet occasionally droplet excretion can be seen. For a mosquito to be computationally defined as engorged, two conditions need to be met:</p><p>1) The abdominal area needs to expand by 1.3 fold, where fold expansion is calculated as the ratio of the 90th percentile of abdominal area measurements and the 10th percentile of abdominal area measurements in the first 10 seconds of the trajectory.</p><p>2) The ninetieth percentile of abdominal area measurements needs to exceed 2.4 mm2 for <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>, or 3.0 mm2 for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion (as indeed our ability to do experiments is severely limited during the Covid-19 crisis), we estimated the performance of the engorgement detection algorithm by validating all data presented in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Visual inspection of all video data indicated that the overall sensitivity of engorgement detection <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">TP</mml:mtext><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.81</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="0.222em"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>130</mml:mn><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, with a sensitivity of 0.97 (<italic>n</italic> = 29) and 0.76 (<italic>n</italic> = 101) for <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, respectively. The overall specificity was <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">TN</mml:mtext><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>101</mml:mn><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. We now include these numbers in the manuscript on lines 136-137 and details regarding the benchmarking in subsection “Detecting engorgement”.</p><p>We note that the sensitivity for detecting engorgement is lower for <italic>Anopheles</italic> compared to <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (0.76 versus 0.97). Two possible reasons may be the source of this discrepancy: (1) <italic>Anopheles</italic> excrete excess liquid during feeding to a much larger extent than <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, resulting in a less pronounced dilation of the abdomen making it harder to detect the dilation, (2) we noticed a higher density of mosquitoes on the bite substrate in experiments conducted with <italic>Anopheles</italic> compared to <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, the higher density more often leads to mosquitoes that physically touch resulting in challenging situations for the detection algorithm as the active contour model may fit the body shape less accurate when mosquitoes touch. Figure 3 shows the relation between the average number of mosquitoes present on the bite substrate versus the accuracy of engorgement detection. A lower number of mosquitoes on the substrate results in higher accuracy, yet at similar mosquito densities the algorithm performs better on <italic>Aedes</italic> than on <italic>Anopheles</italic>, likely due to a larger increase in abdominal area during feeding in <italic>Aedes</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should also validate and benchmark the performance of the deep learning-based detection of the appendages.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript we described the accuracy of the deep learning-based tracking of appendages in subsection “Pose estimation, behavioral classification, and contact-dependent sensing”, and the Discussion section stating an average accuracy of the detection of body parts of 10 pixels (250 <italic>µ</italic>m) and 8 pixels (200 <italic>µ</italic>m) for <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic>, respectively (average distance between manually labeled and computationally predicted body part location). We now include additional benchmarking and details regarding the performance of deep learning-based body part detection in subsection “Body part tracking”.</p><p>In order to assess the robustness of the trained model, we created multiple shuffles of the training data set. ‘Shuffle’ here refers to the generation of a training set from a pool of manually labeled images: labeled images are randomly split into a ‘train’ and a ‘test’ set, the random split differs per shuffle allowing one to assess the ‘robustness’ of training.</p><p>Below we report the accuracy of body part detection defined as the mean average Euclidean error between the manual labels and the ones predicted by the algorithm. Averaged over 4 shuffles of the training set <italic>Aedes</italic> body parts were detected with a mean accuracy of 11 pixels, (275 <italic>µ</italic>m). The mean accuracy of predicting <italic>Anopheles</italic> body parts averaged over 2 shuffles of the training set was 6 pixels (150 <italic>µ</italic>m). In addition to the mean performance across all body parts, we now also include accuracies per groups of body parts for the best performing model (core: head, proboscis, abdomen, abdominal tip, (and palps for <italic>Anopheles</italic>); and legs: tips of all 6 legs). In the best performing model for detecting <italic>Aedes</italic> body parts the mean distance between manual labels and predicted positions was 1.7 pixels (43 <italic>µ</italic>m) for core body parts, and 1.6 (40 <italic>µ</italic>m) for the tips of legs. The best performing model for <italic>Anopheles</italic> body parts had an accuracy of 5.2 pixels (130 <italic>µ</italic>m) and 3.7 pixels (93 <italic>µ</italic>m) for core and legs, respectively. We now include these metrics in the manuscript in subsection “Body part tracking” (and briefly in the Results section). We furthermore provide the final trained models on Github https://github.com/felixhol/biteOscope (mentioned subsection “Body part tracking”). Depending on the exact imaging conditions of users, these trained models may work without modification on newly acquired data, in other cases the provided models can be used as a convenient starting point for training on new datasets. In the latter case, starting from the pre-trained models will reduce the required training time substantially making training on a standard computer without GPU feasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors mostly analyze movies from experiments with multiple animals. It is widely acknowledged that reliably tracking the identity of multiple animals is challenging. The authors should benchmark their algorithm and provide an error rate for assigning the correct identity to animals. This is key for the correct interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that correctly tracking the identity of multiple mosquitoes that are simultaneously present on the bite substrate is an important aspect of our image analysis pipeline. It indeed is a great suggestion to present the validation in the manuscript.</p><p>In order to assess the performance of our mosquito tracking algorithm, we created videos in which the results of the tracking algorithm are overlaid on the raw imaging data. The validation videos indicate the location where the centroid of a mosquito is detected and plot the numeric ID assigned to a mosquito. We verified the tracking results of 111 individual trajectories across 12293 images resulting in an error rate of 0.045 (5/111). The validation dataset includes data from both <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> experiments and consists of images having a variety of densities ranging from 0.05 – 0.4 mosquitoes per cm2. The most common error (4/5) is caused by erroneously assigning identities when mosquitoes cross (e.g. an individual moving over another one and thus overlapping in the image). Interestingly, the validation videos make it straightforward to correct ID swap errors by manually re-assigning the correct identity to the track. A rather minor amount of manual interventions therefore results in nearly perfect tracking. We now include information regarding the performance of the tracking algorithm in subsection “Automatic characterization of the blood feeding behavior of multiple species” and Subsection “Computaional tools”. We include an example validation video, Video 1—figure 1, and provide code to create the validation videos in the Github repository.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) While the use of a membrane to visualize the actual feeding behavior of mosquitoes is a key aspect of the setup, the authors did not fully exploit it. It would be important to go beyond the anecdotal data in the first figure and show analyses of the piercing and stylet behavior highlighting this key aspect of the setup.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that visualizing the stylet of a probing/feeding mosquito presents very interesting opportunities. This imaging capability for instance was of value to one of the ‘early adopters’ of the biteOscope (the lab of Leslie Vosshall) in a study that characterizes the sensory perception of blood in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mouthparts. In this study mosquitoes were presented membrane feeders containing a variety of artificial meals and the question was raised whether the stylet came into contact with all meals presented, or only with those that elicited engorgement (i.e. are non-appetitive meals rejected based on evaluation by the stylet, or by other means). We used the biteOscope to answer this question and demonstrated that the stylet indeed came in contact with all meals and evaluates the meal before engorging. This study in which we collaborated is currently under review and available on bioRxiv (Jove et al., 2020). We now discuss this use-case of stylet imaging in the Discussion section.</p><p>We believe that there are many more questions that can be addressed by directly visualizing the stylet of a feeding mosquito and anticipate that computationally detecting stylet insertion would be a very valuable tool. As the reviewers note’ it would be convenient to use DeepLabCut to detect the stylet. We have indeed tried this however, our efforts have not produced an algorithm that detects the stylet with high enough accuracy to be useful. The reason for this is (at least) two fold: (1) the stylet appears as a rather subtle feature in images, having low contrast (compared to other body parts) and adopting a variety of conformations complicating reliable detection; and (2) the stylet is only visible during probing and feeding and therefore only appears in a minor subset of images resulting in a low number of training images (and a high rate of false positive detections at the tip of the proboscis). We are currently exploring other deep learning methods (not based on DeepLabCut) for stylet detection and hope that this will result in a high-confidence stylet detection algorithm. Given the challenging nature of this problem, and the range of (computational) capabilities we currently present, we feel that high-accuracy computational detection of the stylet is beyond the scope of the current work.</p><p>In addition to a number of behavioral statistics, our current computational pipeline saves cropped videos of all individually tracked mosquitoes and we mention in subsection “Computational tools” that these videos may serve as a convenient starting point for manual annotation of stylet piercing as has been done in Jove et al., (2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Some of the statements in the manuscript are rather anecdotal and would be better supported by including their quantification in figures. Furthermore, statistical analysis needs to be described in more details for Figure 3, i.e. include exact p-values in the figure. It also seems that the number of samples (n=9-10) is relatively low for making solid interpretations. Finally, some of the numbers described in the main text do not match the caption label for Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the points raised above, we have performed several analyses (see points 4–6 above) and now include additional quantification in the manuscript. Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we now include the exact <italic>p</italic>-values in the caption of Figure 3. We furthermore noticed that some data points were accidentally excluded from panel 3 of Figure 3C (bout length), we have updated this graph to include all data points. The conclusions regarding this Figure are not affected by this. We agree that using a larger number of individual mosquitoes (9–10 for the data presented in Figure 3) would give our statistical analysis more power. However, the differences between the two experimental conditions are large enough to observe statistically significant differences between the treatments with the current number of samples. Furthermore, we discuss the data from Figure 3 (single mosquito experiments) in relation to the results from Figure 2E which have a much larger <italic>n</italic> (population experiments, <italic>n</italic> = 111 trajectories for <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 1184 trajectories for all species together) and note that these different data sets are in agreement. It will be interesting to follow up on these findings at a larger scale once we can resume experiments post Covid-19. We thank the reviewers for pointing out a typo in the <italic>n</italic> quoted in the text discussing Figure 2. The caption of Figure 2 indeed specified <italic>n</italic> = 349, whereas the main text read <italic>n</italic> = 350 trajectories for the <italic>An. coluzzi</italic> experiment. The correct number is <italic>n</italic> = 349 and we have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The quantitative analysis shown in Figure 5 is insufficient, especially because it does not fully support the statements made in the main text. How is the landing rate (and dwell time etc.) calculated? Are these values normalized to the area coated by DEET and inhomogeneities for mosquito landing observed on the arena? Furthermore, the authors should control or at least discuss the possibility that aversiveness is being caused by physical attributes of the coated surface (i.e., slippery surface).</p></disp-quote><p>The landing rate was calculated by summing the number of trajectories that started on the surface in question (DEET coated versus non-coated) and normalizing this value by the area of the surface (we now explicitly mention normalization by the surface area in subsection “DEET repels <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> upon contact with legs”). The dwell time was calculated as the average duration of all trajectories on the surface in question. The duration of trajectories moving from the non-coated surface to the DEET coated surface was split proportionally to the time spent on the respective surface. Trajectories moving from the DEET coated surface to the non-coated surface were not observed indicating that the dwell time on the DEET surface was not limited by the size of the surface. We now include this information in subsection “DEET experiments”. Following the reviewers’ suggestion we now also discuss the possibility that physical attributes of the DEET coating may influence the mosquitoes’ interaction with the surface in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors' efforts to make the setup openly available including parts descriptions and code repository are highly appreciated. However, reproducibility and openness could be further improved by making the software easier accessible and understandable by structuring the code in the repository and documenting it, because currently, it does not explain which files to use to reproduce the findings. I also could not find the source data of Figure 2 and Figure 3 as described in the data availability statement. Data from all figures should be made available, clearly labeled, code should be provided for reproducing all figures, and well documented for others to use.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that making our setup and code openly available is important, and the reviewers are right in pointing out that the ‘user friendliness’ of the Github repository at the time of initial submission could be improved. We have now restructured the repository to make it easier to navigate. In the repository, we provide a README file that specifies the function of each algorithm and we have commented the code extensively indicating the function of code blocks and variables that should be modified to provide experiment specific details (e.g. directories where data is stored). We furthermore provide test data in the repository to enable testing of the code by new users. In addition to these improvements with respect to accessibility of the code, we now also provide design files for laser cutting the mosquito cages. Data will be available on Github upon acceptance of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The Discussion section is rather superficial. A more thorough comparison of how the observed behavior compares to feeding and foraging behavior of other animals, especially insects would be a valuable addition. Also, discussing the limitations of the method would be advisable. The authors should openly recognize and discuss how prudent is an extrapolation of questions around vectorial capacity and host-vector interactions from a minimalist system with synthetic skin, blood, and without human-specific attractants to 'real world'. If the authors believe that it would not be difficult to augment the experimental setup with a human odor (synthetic or real) or any other attractant, then the text should state this clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>Following these suggestions, we have thoroughly revised the Discussion section. We now include a more extensive discussion of feeding and foraging behavior in other animals and methods to study those behaviors in the Discussion section. In addition, we point out several interesting opportunities for future research where the biteOscope could be a useful tool (Discussion section). We furthermore discuss several limitations of our setup and the interesting possibility to add odorants to the setup to more closely mimic a real host (Discussion section). We note that a synthetic bite substrate will likely never by exactly as attractive as a real host, yet we also that many factors that may change behavior (e.g. infections/nutritional status or components of the microbiome) are best assessed in a relative manner, e.g. comparing non-infected to infected individuals. We indicate that comparing cohorts of mosquitoes undergoing different experimental treatments puts less emphasis on the absolute attractiveness of the bite substrate and thus mitigates potential issues related to the fact that the a synthetic bite substrate is likely less attractive than a real live host. We discuss the potential use of non-clear liquids in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>While the current experimental design of the BiteOscope provides advantages to tracking mosquito feeding behavior on humans or animals, a key question which remains unanswered is to which extent the behavior observed on the membrane is comparable to the behavior on a living host. Except for the actual blood feeing behavior, tracking animals foraging on a host should be feasible. It would be an extremely important addition to compare the behavior of mosquitoes in such a naturalistic setting with the behavior on the membrane. Understandably, in the current COVID situation performing experiments is challenging. Therefore, the authors should at least discuss this caveat and consider performing such experiments in follow-up work.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we now briefly discuss the comparison of behavior in our synthetic system to behavior on a real living host in the Discussion section.

The authors have addressed everything and, in most cases,, they seem to have edited and have altered the manuscript sufficiently.</p><p>Nonetheless it is ultimately an imaging system and even the best pictures never tell the complete story. For me, a few issues remain.</p><p>Blood feeding – given the artificial membrane, the absence of blood/ necessity for clear liquid and presumably subsequent digestion (e.g. peritrophic mem from. Line brane formation?), this is 'biting' behaviour rather than bloodfeeding? This is likely to be relevant to many of the applications listed in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this comment (and the Editor’s suggestion) we have changed the title of the manuscript which now states ‘biting behavior’ instead of ‘blood feeding behavior’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, is engorgement an accurate term for what's being measured? Engorgement = fed to repletion, but here that is not always the case and mosquitoes are simply 'fed'.</p><p>Also, I wondered whether viewing from directly beneath the ventral abdomen is the most reliable position to measure an abdomen expanding with ingested volume of fluid – i.e. does the abdomen of all individuals expand similarly in every time (e.g. parous vs. nullipars?); what about 3D?</p></disp-quote><p>We presented a validation of our engorgement detection algorithm in the first revision of our manuscript, and as suggested by the reviewers, we used manual annotations to validate all video data and calculate the sensitivity (0.97 for <italic>Aedes</italic> and 0.76 for <italic>Anopheles</italic>) and specificity (1.0 for both) of engorgement detection. This validation was mentioned in subsection “Automatic characterization of the blood feeding behavior of multiple species”, and subsection “Detecting engorgement”. While 3D imaging and/or adding another camera (e.g. a side view) could add another way of assessing engorgement status, we feel that this would significantly complicate the optical set up while the sensitivity and specificity of our detection algorithm are already quite high. We furthermore note that the artificial meal we use (phosphate buffered saline + 1 mM ATP) has been used to study blood feeding in several other studies. Notably, Duvall et al., (2019) and Jove et al., (2020) compare the weight of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes fed on sheep blood to the weight of mosquitoes fed on saline + ATP and both studies report no significant difference in the post-feeding weight of mosquitoes feeding on either meal (please see Figure 1C of (Duvall et al., 2019) and Supplemental Figure S1F and H of (Jove et al., 2020)). As weight is a good proxy for ingested volume, these observations indicate that there is no significant difference between the ingested volume when using sheep blood versus our artificial meal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>DEET – I found the authors' reply confusing (which read as if Afify and Potter provided more convincing evidence than the authors had.) but the text in the revised manuscript text was much clearer. Nonetheless, I still have reservations: the contact vs. non-contact observations are fine but is this conclusion justified? Can imaging [alone] provide the evidence to solve this question?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if our response was confusing, yet are glad to read that the manuscript text is clear. We would like to stress that we report on a different aspect of DEET repellency than Afify and Potter did: We tested if <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> is repelled upon <italic>contact</italic> with DEET (a hypothesis not tested before), whereas Afify and Potter studied olfactory responses to <italic>volatile</italic> DEET (i.e. responses in the <italic>absence</italic> of contact). As we study a different aspect of DEET-mediated repellency, our results are complimentary to, instead of more/less convincing than, those of Afify and Potter. In the Discussion section we mention studies by Afify and Potter, and others to place our observations regarding contact-dependent repellency in the broader context of the several modes in which DEET may repel mosquitoes. We extensively discuss our results concerning DEET in relation to the prior literature as this was an explicit request in the initial review report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) If the two genera differ in responses to DEET vapour, then in the real world' Anopheles coluzzii would land frequently on DEET-treated skin, whereas Aedes aegypti would rarely/never land. I have no data but having used DEET as a repellent for over 30 years in Africa and elsewhere, I remember Anophelines being repelled completely.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting observation which may be explained by the various possible modes of action of DEET (these different modes of action are discussed in the Discussion section). Our results show that <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> is repelled by DEET upon contact, and DeGennaro et al., (2013) and Dennis et al., (2019) report that this is also the case in Ae. aegypti. Regarding olfactory responses to volatile DEET in the absence of contact, several studies suggest that the olfactory response to volatile DEET of these two species differs (Davis and Rebert, 1972; Boeckh et al., 1996; Stanczyk et al., 2010, 2013; Afify et al., 2019) which may result in differences in olfactory behavioral responses to volatile DEET: <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has been observed to avoid volatile DEET in the absence of attractive cues, whereas <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> does not seem to avoid volatile DEET in the absence of attractive cues (Afify and Potter, 2020). A third mode of action of DEET is “masking” in which DEET acts directly on the odorants emanating from a host: through chemical interactions DEET decreases the odorants volatility and thereby reduces the amount of attractive odorants capable of activating mosquito olfactory receptors and thus inhibiting behavioral responses (Syed and Leal, 2008). A recent study (Afify et al., 2019) observed that the olfactory neurons of <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> are not activated by DEET, and also showed that the neuronal response to otherwise attractive compounds (e.g. 1-octen-3-ol) was strongly inhibited when the volatile attractive compound was co-presented with volatile DEET (i.e. compound that normally elicit a strong response in olfactory neurons did not elicit a strong neuronal response when presented together with volatile DEET). This observation suggests that DEET interacts directly with odorants and through masking indeed may inhibit behavioral responses (such as flying towards a host). Together, our results and prior literature thus suggest that DEET has (at least) two effects on <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>: contact-based repellency, and the masking of odorants. It is thus likely that DEET has kept reviewer #3 safe from anopheline bites through the combined effect of odorant masking and contact-dependent repulsion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the insecticide world, we use the terms 'contact-irritancy' and 'repellent-induced response', the latter being a change occurring prior to, or without contact. Both are usually bundled together for convenience, often viewed as being a question of exposure dosage from low/vapour to high/contact. I've always had doubts, increasingly so with the recent papers by Ingham et al.</p><p>Is it possible that the different responses reported for the 2 genera are the result of different response thresholds, with Aedes being more sensitive at lower levels (vapour) than Anopheles?.… also, have the olfactory neurons in Anopheles coluzzii been explored (which is not mentioned)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion, yet as our DEET assay was designed to primarily test for contact dependent behaviors, our data do not allow us to draw conclusions regarding the concentration dependency of olfactory (and other non-contact) behaviors. As mentioned above, prior literature suggests that at the same concentration volatile DEET has distinct effects on the olfactory neurons of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>An. coluzzii</italic>.</p><p>Following the reviewers suggestion we now mention that these effects may be concentration dependent in the Discussion section.</p><p>The olfactory neurons of <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> have indeed been studied. It may be a misunderstanding that this was not mentioned as we discussed studies reporting on the response of the olfactory neurons of <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> to DEET in subsection “DEET repels <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> upon contact with legs” and Discussion section. In summary, prior literature shows that the olfactory neurons of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are activated by DEET (Davis and Rebert, 1972; Boeckh et al., 1996; Stanczyk et al., 2010) whereas the olfactory neurons of <italic>An. coluzzii</italic> are not activated by DEET (Afify et al., 2019; Afify and Potter, 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can results from experiments with DEET in the absence of host stimuli be reliable or indicative of anything other than the mosquito can/cannot detect it?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. However, we note that in our assay we do provide heat which is an important factor in short-range host attraction. Our results are therefore best interpreted in the presence of a host stimulus (heat).</p></body></sub-article></article>
