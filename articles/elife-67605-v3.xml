While the self-assembly of TDP-43 by its structured N-terminal and intrinsically disordered C-terminal domains has been widely studied, the mechanism by which mRNA preserves TDP-43 solubility in the nucleus has not been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that tandem RNA recognition motifs of TDP-43 bind to long GU-repeats in a cooperative manner through intermolecular interactions. Moreover, using mutants whose cooperativity is impaired, we found that the cooperative binding of TDP-43 to mRNA may be critical to maintain the solubility of TDP-43 in the nucleus and the miscibility of TDP-43 in cytoplasmic stress granules. We anticipate that the knowledge of a higher order assembly of TDP-43 on mRNA may clarify its role in intron processing and provide a means of interfering with the cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding proteins</kwd><kwd>neurodegenerative diseases</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007149</institution-id><institution>Genopole</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SATURNE 2018-SABNP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bouhss</surname><given-names>Ahmed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Association pour la recherche sur la SLA (ARSLA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>eOTP 19SATSAB02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rengifo-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Juan Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University Evry UEVE</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRR- Action 2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bouhss</surname><given-names>Ahmed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Région Ile-de-France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SESAME grant n°15013102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clément</surname><given-names>Marie-Jeanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007149</institution-id><institution>Genopole</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>El Hage</surname><given-names>Krystel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The RNA-mediated higher order assembly of TDP-43, a protein associated with neurodegenerative diseases, preserves its solubility by reducing the risk of multivalent interactions between low complexity domains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In comparison to other proteins, many RNA-binding proteins (RBP) harbor low-complexity domains (LCD) that initiate weak multivalent interactions leading to the assembly of liquid-like membraneless organelles, notably in the mammalian cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xue et al., 2019</xref>). Membraneless organelles induced by RBPs are involved in critical cellular functions such as the biogenesis and processing of mRNAs in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swain et al., 2016</xref>). Since TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a nuclear mRNA-binding protein with a self-attracting LCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tollervey et al., 2011</xref>), was associated to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neumann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sreedharan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vogler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chou et al., 2018</xref>), the notion that deregulated RBP assemblies may be responsible for RBP aggregation has made its way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patel et al., 2015</xref>). In support to this, the majority of pathological mutations associated with TDP-43 are located in its self-adhesive C-terminal LCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Deerlin et al., 2008</xref>). Many structural analyses focused on pathological TDP-43 mutations have also indicated a critical role of the TDP-43 LCD in the aggregation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conicella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guenther et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conicella et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>However, despite the link between the TDP-43 LCD and several neurodegenerative diseases, the precise mechanism leading to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 remains obscure. The known mutations located in the TDP-43 LCD, associated with neurodegenerative diseases, still allow normal cognitive functions in adults before aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patel et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, other mutations leading to a more severe phenotype may be useful to probe the structural basis leading to aggregation in cells and to identify possible means to interfere with a putative gain and (or) loss of functions of TDP-43 inclusions in neurons. In recent in vitro studies, the dimerization of the structured N-terminal was proposed to promote a head-to-tail aggregation of TDP-43, together with the self-adhesive LCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afroz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Loughlin and Wilce, 2019</xref>). Here, we consider the role of mRNA which is the principal partner of TDP-43 in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Polymenidou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lukavsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>). Under physiological conditions, TDP-43 is mostly associated with nuclear RNA, considered as a negative regulator of TDP-43 condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maharana et al., 2018</xref>). A high ratio of RNA/protein in the nucleus promotes dynamic and reversible higher order assemblies of RBPs such as TDP-43, while lower nuclear RNA levels causes excessive phase separation and the formation of cytotoxic aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maharana et al., 2018</xref>). In the nucleus, TDP-43 binds to GU-rich sequences in introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tollervey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Polymenidou et al., 2011</xref>), with a high affinity through its tandem RRM domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lukavsky et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, transcripts with long introns display multiple GU-rich binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Polymenidou et al., 2011</xref>). TDP-43 multimerization on long GU-rich repeats may ensure the proper packaging of introns to facilitate their processing by the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ishiguro et al., 2017</xref>). In the cytoplasm, dynamic liquid-like mRNA-rich compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buchan and Parker, 2009</xref>), called stress granules, appear after a wide variety of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colombrita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dewey et al., 2011</xref>) including oxidative stress and hypoxia which may occur during aging in neurons. As proposed in recent studies, the recruitment of TDP-43 in mRNA-rich stress granules may preserve the solubility of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zacco et al., 2019</xref>), like nuclear RNA under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maharana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with the notion that mRNA keeps TDP-43 in a soluble state, the specific binding of TDP-43 RRM1–2 to GU-rich RNA limits TDP-43 aggregation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">French et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, a pathological mutation, K181E, located in the linker between RRM1 and RRM2 domains, leads to TDP-43 aggregation and to a reduced affinity for its RNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In other models, the recruitment of TDP-43 in stress granules rather plays a negative role in neurodegenerative diseases by acting as crucibles in which TDP-43 is concentrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Langdon and Qiu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Treeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">François-Moutal et al., 2019</xref>). However, since stress granules are dynamic and reversible compartments, the genesis of insoluble TDP-43 inclusions may as well take place outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gasset-Rosa et al., 2019</xref>) or inside stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGurk et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we devised that an unaltered binding of TDP-43 to mRNA retains TDP-43 in a soluble state to prevent its aggregation whatever in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. We then wondered whether a specific structural organization of TDP-43 in association with mRNA may contribute to preserve TDP-43 solubility under physiological conditions. To explore this idea, we dissected the binding of multiple TDP-43 to a long RNA and then discovered the cooperative binding of the tandem TDP-43 RNA Recognition Motifs (RRM1–2), to long GU repeats. A cooperative binding to RNA is not unique to TDP-43 but is also found in many other RBPs. Indeed, most RBPs have a low specificity for short sequences of few nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Singh and Valcárcel, 2005</xref>). A cooperative association of RBPs to RNA may enable their specific recognition of longer RNA sequences, for example, as evidenced through the cooperative association of Unr and Sxl RBPs to the 3’UTR of <italic>msl2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hennig et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, cooperativity may secure the attachment of RBPs on their mRNA targets. Here, through a structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy of the intermolecular interface between two RRM1–2 monomers, we identified the residues driving the cooperative binding of TDP-43 on long GU-rich sequences. We then probed whether TDP-43 mutants with an impaired cooperative binding to mRNA are imperfectly miscible with wild type TDP-43 in a cellular context. To this end, we analyzed the mixing/demixing between wild-type TDP-43 and selected mutants in cells, using microtubules as nano-platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maucuer et al., 2018</xref>). Our integrative approach reveals an intermolecular interaction between the loop 3 of RRM1 and a pocket centered around the V220 in RRM2 thus providing the missing link responsible for the cooperative binding of TDP-43 to mRNA. We also showed that the disruption of the cooperative binding of TDP-43 promotes the assembly of mRNA-poor TDP-43 aggregates in the nucleus and antagonizes the presence of TDP-43 in mRNA stress granules in the cytoplasm. In light of the results presented here, we propose a mechanistic model in which TDP-43, through its cooperative binding to mRNA, prevents the structured N-terminal and C-terminal LCD domains from inducing TDP-43 aggregation. Unravelling how TDP-43 preserves its solubility to enable normal processing of nuclear mRNA could also provide means to interfere with the pathologic transition leading to protein-pure amyloids or to correct splicing defects in neurons of patients affected by TDP43-positive neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RRM1–2 of TDP-43 binds to long nucleic acid targets in a cooperative manner and forms protein multimers</title><p>To understand through which molecular mechanisms TDP-43 targets pyrimidine-rich introns in cells as revealed by CLIP experiments, we considered whether a cooperative association of TDP-43 may take place in long GU-rich repeats to secure the binding of several TDP-43 proteins. The structure of TDP-43 is generally represented with three distinct functional domains: a structured N-terminal domain (NTD), two central RRMs, and a long unstructured C-terminal (LCD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mompeán et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuo et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

However, so far, only structural data about the binding of a single RRM1–2 to short eight nt-long RNA sequences are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lukavsky et al., 2013</xref>). We then used cross-linking and gel mobility shift assays combined to ITC measurements to document the binding of multiple TDP-43 to long GU-rich repeats.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Biochemical characterization of TDP-43 fragments bound to oligonucleotide targets.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of TDP-43 domains.

DNase treatment did not disrupt the complexes preformed in the presence of GT repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, a direct protein–protein interaction may probably take place in the presence of 24 GT repeats.</p><p>To further characterize the higher order assembly of TDP-43 bound to 24 GT repeats, gel mobility shift assays were performed with RRM1–2 in the presence of 24 GT repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In addition, isolated RRM1 (Q101-K192) and RRM2 (K176-G277) were prepared to compare their interactions with GT repeats with those of tandem RRM1–2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). RRM1 or RRM2 fragments bind to GT repeats progressively and in an uncooperative manner. However, RRM1–2 forms, abruptly and discretely, successive multimeric intermediates with increasing protein concentrations, a hallmark of a cooperative association. As RRM1 has a high affinity for GT repeats and can also form multimers, RRM1 may drive, by itself, the binding of RRM1–2 to GT repeats through discrete steps. However, RRM1 alone, in contrast to RRM1–2, does not show a discrete binding to 24 GT repeats, suggesting a significant role of RRM2 domain to generate stable RRM1–2 multimers.</p><p>Whereas electrophoretic mobility assays and cross-linking analyses reveal the formation of TDP-43 multimers on 24 GT repeats, an assessment of its cooperative binding is missing. Therefore, we applied isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The ITC titration curves of RRM1–2 with 12 GT repeats display two distinct plateaus reflecting the binding of one and two proteins, while only one plateau is observed with 6 GT repeats indicating the binding of only one RRM1–2. In addition, the enthalpy difference (ΔH) resulting from the binding of two RRM1–2 to 12 GT repeats (~ −80 kcal/mol) is more than twice the ΔH value measured when only one RRM1–2 binds to 6 GT repeats (~ –33 kcal/mol), which most probably indicates an energy benefit due to a cooperative binding. In comparison to RRM1–2, RRM1 or RRM2 fragments can possibly form dimers with 6 GT repeats and at least tetramers with 12 GT repeats but no clear plateaus were observed in ITC curves to reveal the presence of stable multimers. To score the cooperative binding of TDP-43 to GT repeats, we measured the ratio Kd<sub>1</sub>/Kd<sub>2</sub>. Kd<sub>1</sub> and Kd<sub>2</sub> represent the dissociation constants of the first and second proteins interacting respectively with GT repeats, as measured by ITC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown, 2009</xref>). Since Kd<sub>2</sub> is significantly lower than Kd<sub>1</sub> for RRM1–2 (Kd<sub>1</sub>/Kd<sub>2</sub> &gt;100, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), RRM1–2 binds to 12 GT repeats with a higher affinity when another RRM1–2 monomer is already associated to GT repeats, which characterizes a marked cooperativity. Interestingly, the ratio Kd<sub>1</sub>/Kd<sub>2</sub> was not significantly higher for isolated RRMs, RRM1 and RRM2 fragments (Kd<sub>1</sub>/Kd<sub>2</sub> = 8.9 and 0.05, respectively) than for RRM1–2 (Kd<sub>1</sub>/Kd<sub>2</sub> = 128).</p><p>Together, biochemical and ITC data provide compelling evidence of a cooperative binding of TDP-43 RRM1–2 to GT repeats.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NMR spectroscopy reveals residues possibly involved in the cooperative binding of TDP-43 to RNA</title><p>To provide insights into the structural mechanism leading to the cooperative association of RRM1–2 to GU or GT repeats, we performed a comparative analysis by NMR spectroscopy of RRM1, RRM2, and RRM1–2 residues in interaction with GU sequences of different length (6, 12, and 24 GT repeats). In agreement with the results from ITC experiments, a single RRM1–2 binds to 6 GU repeats mostly through conserved RNA-binding residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lukavsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Twelve GU repeats induce additional chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) and peak broadenings, consistent with the binding of two RRM1–2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). These effects were specific to RRM1–2 as compared to RRM1 or RRM2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Given the presence of CSPs for several RRM1–2 residues located in RRM1 and RRM2 domains, the possibility that RRM1 would by itself generate the TDP-43 multimerization can again be ruled out. Moreover, CSPs revealed that interactions with nucleic acids through conserved RNA-binding residues are preserved when RRM1–2 interacts with 12 GU repeats. Thus, both RRM1 and RRM2 bind to RNA, despite the lower affinity of RRM2 than RRM1 for RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of TDP-43 residues involved in its dimerization on GU-repeats.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) NMR spectra of free and bound RRM1–2. <italic>Left</italic>, superimposition of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N SOFAST-HMQC spectra of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled RRM1–2 in the free (orange) and (GU)<sub>6</sub> RNA-bound (turquoise) forms.

Indeed, unstructured residues may be particularly sensitive to environmental changes following RRM1–2 multimerization without being directly involved in any interaction. Other methods have therefore to be used to decipher which of the identified residues actively participate in the cooperative binding phenomenon of RRM1–2 to RNA, notably in a cellular context.</p><p>To probe the putative functional role of the selected residues, after our NMR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), in the cooperative binding of TDP-43, we took advantage of a method that we recently developed, namely the microtubule bench (MT bench). MT bench makes use of microtubules as intracellular platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maucuer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boca et al., 2015</xref>) to analyze the spatial distribution of two different RBPs along microtubules and quantify their mixing/demixing. Given our working hypothesis, disrupting the cooperative binding of RRM1–2 to RNA may lead to the demixing between wild type and mutant of TDP-43. To use this method, wild-type and mutant TDP-43 proteins fused to a microtubule-binding domain are co-expressed in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The two TDP-43 proteins are then confined on the microtubule network in cells to probe their interplay. Of note, the confinement of wild-type TDP-43 on microtubules in HeLa cells was already analyzed and led to the formation of reversible mRNA-rich compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maucuer et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we noticed the wetting of microtubules with other liquid-like mRNA-rich compartments in the cytoplasm, i.e. stress granules, when wild-type TDP-43 was confined on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maucuer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To analyze the role of the 28 TDP-43 residues selected from our structural analysis, the mixing of 34 TDP-43 mutants with wild-type TDP-43 was probed with the MT bench assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a positive control, a mutation in the TDP-43 N-terminal domain involved in TDP-43 self-association (E17A) leads to a significant demixing of E17A mutant with wild-type TDP-43, which emphasizes the sensitivity of the method to detect an impaired TDP-43 multimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In RRM domains, four mutations in the RRM1 sequence, T103A/S104A, K140A/T141A, T141A/G142A, and G146A, and three mutations in the RRM2 sequence, M202A, D205A, and V220A, lead to a remarkable demixing between wild-type and mutant of TDP-43. The other TDP-43 mutants do not significantly change the mixing of TDP-43 mutants with wild-type TDP-43, attesting for the stringency of our method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Interestingly, the active mutations leading to a significant demixing are mostly located away from the intramolecular interface between RRM1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Indeed, residues K140, T141, G142, and G146 are located in the long RRM1 loop 3, indicating its possible role in the liquid-liquid phase separation orchestrated by TDP-43.</p><p>In summary, the MT bench assay identified nine residues out of the 28 residues selected by NMR which impact significantly the mixing of TDP-43 with itself in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). However, as M202, D205, and V220 are located quite far apart from each other, a possible interacting surface in RRM2 cannot be delineated (the Cα-Cα separation distance is 7.7, 8.8, and 11.9 Å for [D205; V220], [M202; D205], and [M202; V220], respectively; and their side chains are oriented in opposite directions). We therefore sought additional data to document this point.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The intermolecular interface between RRM1–2 involves an interaction between RRM1 loop 3 and an RRM2 pocket around V220</title><p>With the aim to delineate an intermolecular interface, we first decided to use TDP-43 mutants that would be defective in their cooperative association to mRNA in gels shift and ITC assays. A comparison between wild-type and mutant RRM1–2 could then help to identify an interface by using a comparative NMR analysis. We focused our attention on the RRM1 loop 3, as many residues located in this region are critical for the mixing of TDP-43 mutants with wild-type form in cells. The two mutants, T141A/G142A and G146, were selected based on the strongest effect on their demixing with wild-type TDP-43 in cells and the Q213A mutant was added as a negative control. After their production and purification, all the three mutant proteins were soluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The double mutant in RRM1 loop 3, T141A/G142A, strongly affects the binding of TDP-43 to 24 GT repeats as compared to wild-type and Q213A RRM1–2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). RRM1–2/DNA complexes arise at similar RRM1–2 concentrations for G146A and wild-type RRM1–2, thus indicating that G146A has a similar affinity for GT repeats than wild-type RRM1–2. However, G146A binds to 24 GT repeats with a reduced cooperativity compared to both wild-type RRM1–2 and Q213A mutant. For instance, below saturating concentrations of RRM1–2, we noticed an increase occurrence of lower molecular weight complexes in the case of G146A compared to wild-type RRM1–2 and Q213A (see for example at 20 pmol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Characterization of TDP-43 mutants with an impaired cooperative binding to RNA.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) EMSA experiments were performed by using increasing protein concentrations of T141A/G142A, G146A, and Q213A mutants and 10 pmol of a stem-loop DNA to assess multimerization changes on RRM1–2 (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

The SAXS analysis further confirmed the formation of a complex indeed comprising two units of RRM1–2 proteins bound to 12 GU repeats. We then generated a molecular dynamics (MD) model of the RRM1–2 dimer in the presence of 12 GU repeats as described in Methods. The starting configuration consists of an RNA (GU)<sub>12</sub> oligonucleotide which binds to two RRM1–2 units in a 5′-to-3′ direction from RRM1 to RRM2 in the case of both two monomers. We also used an RNA linker of two nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lukavsky et al., 2013</xref>), here GU, between RRM1 and RRM2 for each RRM1–2 monomer. The first monomer binds to this RNA from G in position 1 (G1) to G9, the U in position 10 remains free and the second monomer binds from G11 to G19 in the same configuration as the first monomer. The model shows how the protein dimer drives and stabilizes the RNA in a configuration displaying a bend at G13 with an average bending angle of 97.5° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The calculated plot deduced from the MD model fits the experimental SAXS curve with a χ<sup>2</sup> value of 1.28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

The RRM2 pocket groove is built from residues belonging to the β2 strand (M218, D219, and V220) and the α1 helix (E204, D205, and R208).

The analysis of the higher order assembly of TDP-43 by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) also confirms the presence of granular TDP-43 structures in the absence of GT-repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). However, in the presence of increasing concentrations of 24 GT-repeats, a larger amount of TDP-43 was detected in the supernatant (three independent replicates). In addition, smaller TDP-43-rich structures than aggregates of TDP-43 alone, in the absence of GT-repeats, were detected by AFM. In agreement with the critical role of GT-repeats in preserving TDP-43 solubility, DNase treatment of pre-incubated TDP-43/GT-repeats complexes resulted in the appearance of spherical TDP-43 aggregates by AFM and a larger amount of TDP-43 in the pellet. Moreover, 6 GT-repeats that can bind only one TDP-43 monomer and 48 nt-long poly(dA) oligonucleotides for which TDP-43 has a lower affinity failed to solubilize full-length TDP-43 to the same extent as did 24 GT repeats under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). When the solubility of G146A mutant was probed by sedimentation assays, 24 GT repeats increased the solubility of G146A but to a lesser extent than wild-type TDP-43. In agreement with this result, 24 GT repeats were less potent to limit the formation of granular structures of G146A compared to wild-type TDP-43 (see arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>GT-repeats increase the solubility of full-length wild-type TDP-43 but to a lesser extent the solubility of G146A mutant.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) <italic>Higher panel:</italic> Sedimentation assays of full length recombinant TDP-43 and the G146A mutant in the absence or presence of 24 GT repeats.

Two interactions have been associated with homotypic TDP-43 interactions leading to TDP-43 self-assembly in the test tube. First, the weak and multivalent interactions between the long and unstructured LCD mediate liquid–liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conicella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conicella et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). Second, the dimerization of the N-terminal domain is associated to a head-to-tail aggregation of TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afroz et al., 2017</xref>). While TDP-43 self-attraction also occurs under physiological conditions in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afroz et al., 2017</xref>), the reversibility and dynamics of the formed multimers is generally preserved. The idea of a high RNA concentration in the nucleus which would prevent the formation of large assemblies of RBPs such as FUS and TDP-43 has been already well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maharana et al., 2018</xref>). RNA may indeed buffer high-order assemblies of RBPs at high concentration in vitro by dispersing proteins thus reducing the occurrence of self-interactions. However, whether this mechanism takes place in the nucleus remains unclear. The general high-level protein occupancy along mRNA sequences in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baltz et al., 2012</xref>) may not allow free mRNA to buffer TDP-43 in the nucleus.</p><p>To decipher the mechanisms by which mRNA keeps TDP-43 soluble, we noticed that the binding of RBPs to mRNA is polarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lukavsky et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of TDP-43, RRM1 and RRM2 bind the 5′ side and the 3′ side, respectively. If we consider that multimers of TDP-43 are resulting from the concomitant and adjacent bindings of TDP-43 along mRNA, the orientation of TDP-43 therefore ensures that consecutive N-terminal domains can hardly dimerize and that consecutive LCD domains are spatially separated to reduce multivalent interactions. Thus, the hypothesis by which the polarized and cooperative binding of TDP-43 to mRNA would contribute to prevent TDP-43 aggregation does therefore make sense. In addition, cooperativity can be essential as the binding of TDP-43 to mRNA facilitates the binding of the next TDP-43 unit nearby whereof preventing a long and flexible RNA linker between two consecutive TDP-43 to accommodate a head-to-tail TDP-43 multimer structure. Here, we present a compelling evidence of a cooperative binding of TDP-43 RRM1–2 to long GU repeats. Based on an integrative structural analysis combining NMR spectroscopy, SAXS and MD, we have also identified the intermolecular RRM1–2 interface responsible for the cooperativity process. This intermolecular interface, which occurs upon RNA binding, is formed through an interaction network involving on one hand the β2 strand and α<sub>1</sub> helix from RRM2 of the first monomer constituting a pocket, and on the other hand, the RRM1 loop 3 of the second monomer. Through our mutation screening, we notably identified a single mutation, G146A, which prevents the cooperative binding of RRM1–2 to GU repeats in vitro while preserving the affinity of RRM1–2 to RNA. In vitro, we also found that 24 GT repeats can preserve TDP-43 solubility in agreement with the buffering activity of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maharana et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the increased TDP-43 solubility observed in the presence of 24 GT repeats was significantly reduced for the G146A mutant, which suggests a link between TDP-43 solubility and its cooperative binding to RNA. In cells, mutations impeding the cooperative binding of RRM1–2 to mRNA strikingly leads to the appearance of TDP-43 condensates mostly located in the nucleus under oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). The condensates of TDP-43 mutants, whatever nuclear or cytoplasmic, are poorly enriched in mRNA, reflecting that mRNA could no longer prevent TDP-43 self-attraction. We hypothesized that the absence of mRNA is not due to the lower affinity of TDP-43 mutants for short RNA, as demonstrated by ITC and NMR experiments, but to an impaired cooperative binding of TDP-43 to long RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The results presented here are in agreement with a mechanistic model based on an ordered assembly of TDP-43 mediated by its RRMs along its mRNA targets, which could constitute a steric barrier limiting short range self-interactions between consecutive N-terminal domains and LCDs. TDP-43/mRNA complexes therefore preserve their dynamics and solubility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, this model does not exclude self-interactions between non-consecutive TDP-43 involving N-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>) or LCDs, in physiological conditions, to generate the formation of mRNA-rich dynamic assemblies in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). An impaired cooperativity may promote an anarchic attachment of TDP-43 along mRNA leading to an increased occurrence of interactions between the N-terminal domains and LCDs, which may in turn promote the head-to-tail aggregation of TDP-43. As the compact head-to-tail assembly leaves little room for the dynamic interaction of RRM1–2 with mRNA, a transition toward the formation of mRNA-poor TDP-43 condensates could be facilitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8b</xref>). However, as recently shown, the chaperone activity of HSP70 could prevent RNA-free TDP-43 aggregation to form reversible anisosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). The relative contribution of HSP70 and mRNA chaperone activities to prevent TDP-43 aggregation should thus deserve further investigations. In addition, TDP-43 phosphorylation events, notably those occurring in the C-terminal domain, were detected in the cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions in brains of ALS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hasegawa et al., 2008</xref>). Phosphorylation in RRM domains may also occur to regulate the binding to GU-rich RNA and the splicing of introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2017</xref>). It would be of interest to probe whether specific TDP-43 phosphorylation events interfere with its cooperative association to mRNAs and then up- or down-regulate TDP-43 aggregation in cells.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of TDP-43 assemblies in the presence of mRNA.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Under physiological conditions, an inter-protein interaction (yellow with hatches) involving RRM2 and RRM1 prevents self-attractions of both the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the low complexity domain (LCD) between adjacent TDP-43.

(<bold>c</bold>) The reduced access of mRNA to RRMs in the head-to-tail assembly may explain the transition towards a mRNA-free TDP-43 aggregation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67605-fig9-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding pathological mutations found in TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Van Deerlin et al., 2008</xref>), most of them lie in the C-terminal low complexity domain and the three located in RRM-1 and -2 (P112H, D169G, and K181E) are not directly involved in the cooperative binding of TDP-43. The dramatic phenotypes leading to neurodegeneration only appear after aging. We may speculate that interfering strongly with cooperativity may thus alter the early stages of neuron development. However, we cannot exclude that some pathological mutations in RRM-1 and -2 may slightly interfere with the cooperative binding of TDP-43 to promote neurodegeneration. Additional work is needed to document this point. Importantly, whatever the link between pathological mutations and TDP-43 cooperativity, strategies aiming to interfere with the cooperative binding of TDP-43 to mRNA could be considered to reduce a risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases in adult patients.</p><p>Besides its role in preventing TDP-43 aggregation in cells, the cooperative binding of TDP-43 to mRNA may have physiological functions, consistent with the clusters of TDP-43 detected by CLIP analysis along intronic sequences. The cooperativity may enable to direct TDP-43 on long mRNA sequences, particularly for the processing of long introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tollervey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Polymenidou et al., 2011</xref>). Analyzing the cooperative behavior of TDP-43 on other sequences than pure GU-repeats could be of interest to understand the formation of intronic TDP-43 clusters in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhardwaj et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, understanding TDP-43 cooperativity may provide a structural basis for an RNA chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ishiguro et al., 2017</xref>), possibly to prevent the formation of UGGAA RNA foci in microsatellite expansion disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ishiguro et al., 2017</xref>) and, more generally, to reduce the occurrence of pathogenic RNA–RNA interactions in introns. In addition to homotypic interactions among TDP-43 proteins, TDP-43 could also interact with other RBPs along introns which themselves have domains of low complexity. In a more general framework, it is thus possible that homotypic and heterotypic cooperativities between RBPs may preserve RBP solubility, which may be required to ensure the proper processing of mRNA and to avoid pathological aggregations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein production and purification</title><p>The recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-tagged RRM1, RRM2, and RRM1–2 fragments from human TDP-43 were overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3).</p><p>Cells carrying plasmids, pTDP-RRM1_101–192, pTDP-RRM2_176–277, and pTDP-RRM1-2_101–277 (encoding for the recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-tagged RRM1, RRM2, and RRM1–2 fragments from human TDP-43, respectively) were grown at 37°C in 2YT-ampicillin medium (1 L culture) (non-labeled proteins) or in minimal medium M9 supplemented with <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (labeled proteins).

All structural parameters (radius of gyration <italic>R<sub>g</sub></italic> [Å], maximal extension <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> [Å], and molar mass M [kDa]) were extracted from averaged SAXS experimental curves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>All SAXS intensity calculations were obtained from an ensemble fit conducted on 1000 conformations sampled along the MD trajectory and separated by 100 ps, using GAJOE from the suite EOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tria et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernadó et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Stress granule experiments</title><p>Stress granules experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Singatulina et al., 2019</xref>). HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% of FBS in the presence of penicillin and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) (GIBCO Life Technologies). Cell cultures were maintained at 37°C in an incubator controlled at 5% of CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were allowed to grow on 12 mm round coverslips. The plasmids were constructed to express, in mammalian cells, the full-length TDP-43 wild type or mutants bearing an HA tag peptide on N-terminal. For transfection experiments, cells were incubated with 0.6 µg of the plasmid by using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (1 µL/sample) as vehicle. Briefly, the complete coding sequence of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> TDP-43 and the indicated mutants were amplified taking the corresponding plasmids, used in microtubule bench experiments, as template (see above). FspBI/XhoI sites were introduced on the primers which were used for cloning into the pcDNA3HA vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lyabin and Ovchinnikov, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Oxidative stress: HeLa cells were treated with puromycin (2.5 µg/ml) 20 min at 37°C and then with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (300 µM) during 30 min at 37°C in a CO<sub>2</sub> controlled chamber. After treatment, cells were washed twice with warm-PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then incubated with 70% ethanol during 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation in presence of 1 M Tris–HCl pH 8.0 for 5 min.</p><p>In situ hybridization: To visualize mRNA, HeLa cells were incubated with a poly-dT oligonucleotide coupled with Cyn-2 (Molecular Probes Life Tech.) for 2 hr at 37°C. Washings were carried out using 4× and then 2× SSC buffer (1.75% NaCl and 0.88% sodium citrate, pH 7.0). To visualize TDP-43 protein, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with an anti-HA primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted (10<sup>–3</sup>) in 2× SSC buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After washings, cells were incubated with a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (10<sup>–3</sup>) coupled to Alexa Fluor Plus 594 (Molecular Probes Life Tech.) for 90 min at room temperature. For nuclei visualization, cells were incubated 30 s with DAPI (0.66 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich).</p><p>Image and statistical analysis: mRNA, TDP-43, and nuclei fluorescence emissions were collected at 500, 600, and 460 nm, respectively, with an oil immersed 63×/1.4 NA objective with a Nikon microscope. Exposure times were set up at 700 ms for all emissions wavelengths. Image analysis were processed with a line width of 3 nm (Line tool, ImageJ) used to record fluorescence intensities. Values were then analyzed in order to statistically distinguish the distribution of TDP-43 protein in stressed cells: TDP43-poor stress granules, TDP-43 condensates, and TDP43-rich stress granules containing mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maucuer et al., 2018</xref>). Cytoplasm and nuclear enrichment for mRNA-containing TDP-43 stress granules was also considered for both wild-type and mutant forms.</p><p>Hela cells were purchased from ATCC (ATCC CCL-2) and were free from mycoplasma contamination. The cell line identity was tested and authenticated (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>SAXS experimental conditions and deduced parameters from collected data.</title><p>Characteristic dimensions, Rg and Dmax, and molar mass (MMcorrelation volume) were obtained from data analysis.

been espoused, but never measured or well established. This paper provides an important step in reconstituting the functional vs. dysfunctional network.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The cooperative binding of TDP-43 to GU-rich RNA repeats antagonizes TDP-43 aggregation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please follow the recommendation of Reviewer 1 and reorganize the manuscript as requested. The proposal is to focus on one salient point per paragraph, a clear description of what is being measured and why, followed by a summary of the findings or a suitable segue to the next paragraph. Similar sentiments were expressed by Reviewer 2 as well.</p><p>2) The reviewers found the data regarding cooperative binding to be interest and both reviewers believe that these data will be of interest to a broad audience. However, the approach used to quantify cooperativity poses some challenges for a broad readership. Please consider the investment of space to explain how cooperativity is being quantified, and how these interpretations emerge from the data.</p><p>3) Does the impairment of cooperative binding have a direct bearing on the formation of TDP-43 condensates / aggregates? That comes through as one of the main messages, but what was deemed to be missing was a direct illustration of this connection. The question that arises is why is cooperative binding essential for inhibiting aggregation? Does this have to do with the threshold concentrations for cooperative binding vs. that of phase separation? If so, then suitable linkage thermodynamics might provide the appropriate framework. Further, since residues responsible for cooperative binding have been identified, it is recommended that the advice of reviewer 2 be heeded in dissecting how mutations of these residues might impact cooperative binding and hence aggregation.</p><p>Addressing these three points in a suitably revised manuscript would be essential for moving forward with the revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Rengifo-Gonzalez, Juan Carlos et al. performed studies to elucidate TDP43-RNA binding interactions and found that tandem TDP43 RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) bind to GU-repeats in a cooperative manner. Additionally, they utilized NMR spectroscopy structural analysis, in combination with mutagenesis experiments, to identify that this cooperative binding is driven by the interaction between the loop 3 of RRM1 and a pocket centered around the V220 in RRM2. The authors go on to examine the relationship between TDP43-RNA binding and the formation of TDP43-positive inclusions characteristic of ALS/FTLD, and they conclude that disruption of TDP43 cooperative binding promotes the assembly of mRNA-poor TDP43 aggregates.</p><p>The authors successfully demonstrate that TDP43 cooperatively binds GU-rich sequences and identify the residues responsible for that interaction, which addresses an outstanding question in the TDP43 field and is likely of interest to potential readers. However, the work could be improved by additional evidence that impaired cooperative TDP43 binding is relevant to the formation of TDP43 aggregates. No distinction is made between cooperative binding to RNA and TDP43 RNA binding in general, and TDP43 overexpression in HeLa cells under two forms of stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and puromycin) is a highly artificial model of stress granule, not aggregate, formation. It is also not clear what the unique TDP-43 assemblies formed by the mutants are, and how they relate to typically TDP-43 aggregates seen in disease. These studies would benefit from a more relevant model of TDP43 aggregation to identify the relevance and functional consequences of TDP43 cooperative binding on aggregate formation.</p><p>While this manuscript contains novel insights on TDP43 cooperative binding that are likely of interest to the field, these findings are not presented clearly.

The proposal is to focus on one salient point per paragraph, a clear description of what is being measured and why, followed by a summary of the findings or a suitable segue to the next paragraph. Similar sentiments were expressed by Reviewer 2 as well.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been rewritten as proposed by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers found the data regarding cooperative binding to be interest and both reviewers believe that these data will be of interest to a broad audience. However, the approach used to quantify cooperativity poses some challenges for a broad readership. Please consider the investment of space to explain how cooperativity is being quantified, and how these interpretations emerge from the data.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we quantified the cooperative binding of TDP-43 by using the ratio of two Kds defining the cooperativity constant as describe by Brown (Int J Mol Sci, 2009). The dissociation constant Kd1 accounts for the affinity of the first RRM1-2 monomer that binds to GU repeats and Kd2 accounts for the affinity of the second binding event. A ratio kd1/kd2 &gt;1 means that the second binding event has a higher affinity than the first one (positive cooperativity). A table recapitulating the cooperativity score has been added to Figure 1. It should be easier to understand by a broad audience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does the impairment of cooperative binding have a direct bearing on the formation of TDP-43 condensates / aggregates? That comes through as one of the main messages, but what was deemed to be missing was a direct illustration of this connection. The question that arises is why is cooperative binding essential for inhibiting aggregation? Does this have to do with the threshold concentrations for cooperative binding vs. that of phase separation? If so, then suitable linkage thermodynamics might provide the appropriate framework.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been rearranged to clearly enlighten how our data on the cooperative binding of TDP-43 to mRNA may matter to keep TDP-43 soluble. Notably, we show that the presence of GT repeats preserves TDP-43 solubility in vitro but to a lesser extent for the G146A mutant (Figure 6a and b). The linkage associating the thermodynamics and the role of cooperative binding of TDP-43 to RNA in liquid-liquid phase separation is an interesting question that deserves, in our view, a study on its own with a theoretical and experimental approach. We prefer here to keep a simple message: the observed increase in TDP-43 solubility is due to the separation distance between self-adhesive N-terminal domains and C-terminal domains when TDP-43 proteins are cooperatively associated along GU-rich tracks. We tried to better highlight this point in Figure 9a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, since residues responsible for cooperative binding have been identified, it is recommended that the advice of reviewer 2 be heeded in dissecting how mutations of these residues might impact cooperative binding and hence aggregation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the reviewer 2 advice. So far, pathological TDP-43 mutations in ALS patients such as K181E do not correspond to the critical residues for TDP-43 cooperative binding to RNA. In our view, cooperativity-deficient mutants induced a marked phenotype following TDP-43 expression in HeLa cells. Most probably, mutations that would occur naturally would be lethal or would not allow the brain development in adults. However, although K181E was not selected in our screening in HeLa cells, it is indeed possible that mutation such as K181E may slightly impact TDP-43 cooperativity which may be sufficient to promote TDP-43 aggregation in adult neurons in ALS patients. It remains however to be demonstrated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Addressing these three points in a suitably revised manuscript would be essential for moving forward with the revised version.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The authors successfully demonstrate that TDP43 cooperatively binds GU-rich sequences and identify the residues responsible for that interaction, which addresses an outstanding question in the TDP43 field and is likely of interest to potential readers. However, the work could be improved by additional evidence that impaired cooperative TDP43 binding is relevant to the formation of TDP43 aggregates. No distinction is made between cooperative binding to RNA and TDP43 RNA binding in general, and TDP43 overexpression in HeLa cells under two forms of stress (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and puromycin) is a highly artificial model of stress granule, not aggregate, formation. It is also not clear what the unique TDP-43 assemblies formed by the mutants are, and how they relate to typically TDP-43 aggregates seen in disease. These studies would benefit from a more relevant model of TDP43 aggregation to identify the relevance and functional consequences of TDP43 cooperative binding on aggregate formation.</p><p>While this manuscript contains novel insights on TDP43 cooperative binding that are likely of interest to the field, these findings are not presented clearly. The text is very difficult to follow, primarily because the rationale and conclusions for each section are not clearly stated.

We also further improved the comprehension of the figures by using a table added to figures 1 and 4. Kd<sub>1</sub> and kd<sub>2</sub> are the dissociation constants accounting for the affinities of the first and second TDP-43 proteins that bind to GU repeats. A cooperativity should induce a higher affinity of the second than the first protein that binds to GU repeats (kd<sub>2</sub>&lt;kd<sub>1</sub>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, we suggest a different model system to study the impact of impaired cooperative binding on TDP43 aggregation.

As indicated in the manuscript, stress granules may have a positive or neutral impact on TDP-43 aggregation in the cytoplasm. Though this is a very interesting subject of research, the presence of stress granules in neurons of ALS patients is not yet certain. Here we used cellular stress because we obtained a robust aggregation in cells expressing TDP-43 mutants. However, as suggested by reviewer 2, we also performed an analysis of TDP-3 aggregation in the cytoplasm after the expression of TDP-43 mutants without additional stress. Though most cells display a homogenous distribution of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 7—figure supplement 18), we measured a significant aggregation of TDP-43 mutants. In contrast with wild type TDP-43, aggregates of TDP-43 mutants are distinct from stress granules and are resistant to cycloheximide pretreatment. These new data are shown in the revised manuscript (Figure 7, a new figure).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] There are a several areas of improvements that could be considered by the authors:</p><p>a) first of all, and most importantly, it would have been very interesting to see what happens to the cooperativity in the presence of substrates other than UG-repeats.

In the case of CLIP34nt, we observed three distinct plateaus supporting the binding of three protein units. Due to the number of binding events (at least three) during titration, the fitting of the experimental data becomes more challenging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) . Data fitting, using a one set of sites model (Malvern), reveals that RRM1-2 displays a significantly lower affinity for CLIP34nt than GT repeats with an apparent Kd of 270 nM (Bhardwaj et al. (ref 64) have reported a value of 112 nM by using EMSA). The lower affinity of TDP-43 for CLIP34nt compared to (GT)12 repeats (more than 2 orders of magnitude) can be explained by a strong preference of this protein for GT or GU base repeats which are little represented in CLIP34nt.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Binding of RRM1-2 to CLIP24nt oligonucleotide.</title><p>The binding profile was monitored by ITC and the titration curve was fitted (bottom).
