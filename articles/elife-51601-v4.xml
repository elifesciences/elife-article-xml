to fulfill their specialized functions. We examined whether mitochondrial fusion is important for metabolic tailoring during spermatogenesis. Acutely after depletion of mitofusins <italic>Mfn1</italic> and <italic>Mfn2</italic>, spermatogenesis arrests due to failure to accomplish a metabolic shift during meiosis. This metabolic shift includes increased mitochondrial content, mitochondrial elongation, and upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). With long-term mitofusin loss, all differentiating germ cell types are depleted, but proliferation of stem-like undifferentiated spermatogonia remains unaffected. Thus, compared with undifferentiated spermatogonia, differentiating spermatogonia and meiotic spermatocytes have cell physiologies that require high levels of mitochondrial fusion. Proteomics in fibroblasts reveals that mitofusin-null cells downregulate respiratory chain complexes and mitochondrial ribosomal subunits. Similarly, mitofusin depletion in immortalized spermatocytes or germ cells in vivo results in reduced OXPHOS subunits and activity. We reveal that by promoting OXPHOS, mitofusins enable spermatogonial differentiation and a metabolic shift during meiosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM127147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM119388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>David C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cell and Molecular Biology Training Grant (GM07616T32)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varuzhanyan</surname><given-names>Grigor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship (DGE-1144469)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varuzhanyan</surname><given-names>Grigor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graham</surname><given-names>Robert LJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hess</surname><given-names>Sonja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005471</institution-id><institution>Beckman Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graham</surname><given-names>Robert LJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hess</surname><given-names>Sonja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2 P50 AI150464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ladinsky</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial fusion enables a metabolic transition during spermatogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The first mitochondrial fusion gene, <italic>fuzzy onions (fzo),</italic> was discovered in 1997 in a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> mutant exhibiting male sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hales and Fuller, 1997</xref>). During early spermatid development in flies, mitochondria aggregate and fuse to become two giant organelles that wrap around each other to form the Nebenkern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuller, 1993</xref>). Mutations in <italic>fzo</italic> abolish mitochondrial fusion in spermatids, resulting in a morphologically aberrant Nebenkern and sterility. The reason for this stage-specific fusion event and how mitochondrial fusion promotes male fertility in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are unknown.</p><p><italic>Fzo</italic> is the founding member of an evolutionarily conserved family of mitochondrial fusion proteins known as the mitofusins (Mfns). In humans, there are two homologs known as <italic>MFN1</italic> and <italic>MFN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Santel and Fuller, 2001</xref>). Fusion acts as a major quality control mechanism for mitochondria by enabling mixing of matrix components and promoting their homogenization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan, 2012</xref>). In the absence of fusion, mitochondria diverge, become functionally heterogenous, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are diminished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weaver et al., 2014</xref>). Mitochondrial fusion also affects mitochondrial transport and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gomes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kandul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Misko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rambold et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, spermatogenesis is a cyclical process that involves differentiation of spermatogonia into spermatocytes, which undergo meiosis to form haploid spermatids and ultimately spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Griswold, 2016</xref>). Throughout this process, germ cells differentiate in intimate association with nursing Sertoli cells. In addition to providing differentiation cues and metabolites for the developing germ cells, Sertoli cells form the blood-testis barrier (BTB) that separates the seminiferous epithelium into the basal (towards the periphery) and apical (towards the lumen) compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stanton, 2016</xref>). Spermatogonia reside within the basal compartment and are comprised of both undifferentiated and differentiating cells. Undifferentiated spermatogonia constitute a dynamic and heterogeneous population that includes the self-renewing stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Rooij, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lord and Oatley, 2017</xref>). Differentiating spermatogonia give rise to spermatocytes that cross the BTB and complete meiosis. After two meiotic divisions, each spermatocyte produces four haploid spermatids that transform into the specialized sperm cells capable of fertilization.</p><p>Several observations in humans and mice illustrate the importance of mitochondrial function during spermatogenesis. Some patients with mtDNA disease have sperm defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Demain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Folgerø et al., 1993</xref>), and sperm from some infertile males harbor mtDNA mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baklouti-Gargouri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kao et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lestienne et al., 1997</xref>). Mouse models with a pathogenic mtDNA deletion exhibit spermatogenic arrest during the zygotene stage of Meiotic Prophase I (MPI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakada et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, a mouse model that is unable to utilize mitochondrial ATP exhibits spermatogenic arrest during the leptotene stage of MPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brower et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, mouse models that accumulate mtDNA mutations exhibit male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kujoth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Trifunovic et al., 2004</xref>). Much less is known about the role of mitochondrial dynamics in male fertility. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of mitofusin (<italic>dMfn</italic>) was recently shown to regulate lipid homeostasis and maintenance of germline stem cells in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sênos Demarco et al., 2019</xref>), A clinical study found that low Mfn2 expression in sperm is associated with asthenozoospermia (reduced sperm motility) and reduced sperm mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fang et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, Mfn1 is required for spermatogenesis in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), but the precise stage of the defect as well as the role of Mfn2 remain unknown. To clarify the role of mitochondrial fusion during male germ cell development, we deleted <italic>Mfn1, Mfn2,</italic> and both <italic>Mfn1</italic> and <italic>Mfn2</italic> from the male germline and examined all stages of spermatogenesis. Our results show that mitochondrial fusion is required for spermatogonial differentiation and a metabolic shift during meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitofusins are essential for mouse spermatogenesis</title><p>To investigate the role of mitofusins during male germ cell development, we removed <italic>Mfn1</italic>, <italic>Mfn2</italic>, or both <italic>Mfn1</italic> and <italic>Mfn2</italic> from the male germline by combining the previously described conditional alleles of <italic>Mfn1</italic> and <italic>Mfn2</italic> with the male germline-specific <italic>Stra8-Cre</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sadate-Ngatchou et al., 2008</xref>). We designate these mice as S8::Mfn1, S8::Mfn2, and S8::Dm (<italic>double mutant</italic>), respectively, and compared them with age-matched, wild-type (WT) littermates. Our mating scheme also incorporated the conditional <italic>Rosa26<sup>PhAM</sup></italic> allele, which encodes a mitochondrially-targeted, photo-activatable fluorescent protein, mito-Dendra2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pham et al., 2012</xref>). mito-Dendra2 served as a <italic>Cre</italic> reporter to label the mitochondrial matrix selectively in germ cells. With histological analysis of testis sections, we verified that mito-Dendra2 is restricted to the male germline and absent from the intimately associated Sertoli and interstitial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Stra8-Cre</italic> expression is reported to begin at post-natal day 3 (P3) in undifferentiated spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sadate-Ngatchou et al., 2008</xref>), including the majority of early stem-like GFRα1-positive spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hobbs et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this, our examination of the mito-Dendra2 Cre reporter clearly demonstrated excision in all germ cell types, including the vast majority of GFRα1-expressing spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>All three mitofusin-deficient mouse lines were healthy and showed no changes in weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, they had obviously smaller testes compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), suggesting an essential role for mitochondrial fusion during spermatogenesis. Indeed, there is significant reduction of spermatozoa in the epididymides of S8::Mfn1 and S8::Mfn2 mice, with the defect more severe with loss of <italic>Mfn1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The residual spermatozoa in both mutant lines often display mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced mitochondrial content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Mutant spermatozoa also exhibit morphological defects, particularly kinking near or in the midpiece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>), and almost a complete loss of motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). S8::Dm mice have the smallest testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and strikingly, a complete absence of epididymal spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).

First, we scored seminiferous tubules based on the most differentiated cell type they contained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and S2A). As expected for the P24 time point, the majority of control seminiferous tubules (87 ± 6%) contained germ cells differentiated up to the spermatid stage, and the remaining tubules (13 ± 6%) contained cells differentiated up to pachytene/diplotene. In contrast, the majority of seminiferous tubules from P24 S8::Dm mice contained cells differentiated only up to the leptotene/zygotene stage (55 ± 2%), indicating a meiotic defect during early MPI. While some mutant seminiferous tubules contained cells differentiated up to the pachytene (22 ± 3%) and spermatid (14 ± 14%) stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), these cell types were depleted to less than 20% compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>To better characterize the meiotic defect, we performed chromosomal spreading of isolated germ cells and scored with γH2AX and SCP3, which mark double stranded breaks (DSBs) and the synaptonemal complex that forms between homologous chromosomes, respectively. Using this assay, we could visualize individual chromosomes and thus distinguish between all substages of MPI: leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Consistent with data from testis sections, we found that S8::Dm mice have a reduction of pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes and an abundance of both leptotene and zygotene cells, pinpointing the meiotic defect to the zygotene-to-pachytene transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). There were no obvious chromosomal abnormalities in S8::Dm mice. To check whether loss of either mitofusin alone was sufficient to block meiosis, we performed histology and chromosomal spreading in S8::Mfn1 and S8::Mfn2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that loss of <italic>Mfn1</italic> alone was sufficient to cause a similar defect in meiosis, resulting in accumulation of spermatocytes in the leptotene and zygotene stages, and reduced production of spermatids. In contrast, S8::Mfn2 mice had normal progression through MPI at P24. Because <italic>Stra8-Cre</italic>-mediated excision occurs in all germ cell types, including spermatogonia that give rise to meiotic spermatocytes, our results demonstrate that MPI is the most sensitive stage of spermatogenesis to disruption of mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mitofusins are required for a metabolic shift during meiosis</title><p>Given the MPI abnormality in fusion-deficient mice, we wondered whether mitochondria show any special features during this stage of spermatogenesis. We quantified mitochondrial content in meiotic spermatocytes by measuring mito-Dendra2 fluorescence in immunolabeled testis sections. In P24 WT mice, we found that pachytene/diplotene cells contained over three times more mitochondrial signal compared with leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Pachytene/diplotene spermatocytes are much sparser in S8::Dm mutant animals, but when present, these cells have less than half the mitochondrial content found in WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To better visualize mitochondrial morphology during MPI, we performed meiotic spreading and immunostained against the outer mitochondrial membrane marker Tom20. We found that WT pachytene/diplotene spermatocytes, compared with leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes, contain elongated and highly clustered mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Thus, spermatocytes in P24 S8::Dm mice arrest in spermatogenesis just before the increased mitochondrial biogenesis, elongation, and clustering that occurs in pachytene/diplotene.

Lactate is oxidized to pyruvate and transported into mitochondria to fuel OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vanderperre et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore examined whether meiotic spermatocytes, relative to spermatogonia, have higher expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, MPC1.

Our study reveals that spermatocytes require mitochondrial fusion as they undergo an acute upregulation of OXPHOS during MPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Analysis of the single mutant mice showed that <italic>Mfn1</italic> but not <italic>Mfn2</italic> is essential for this transition. We show that this transition coincides with increased mitochondrial density, mitochondrial elongation, and upregulation of OXPHOS activity, which are all blocked in fusion-deficient spermatocytes. The increased OXPHOS in pachytene spermatocytes is likely required to fuel ATP-consuming biochemical reactions involved in homologous recombination and DSB repair. Consistent with this idea, the metabolic environment of spermatocytes changes as they initiate MPI and traverse the blood-testis barrier. In this isolated compartment, spermatocytes are segregated from the vasculature and interstitial fluid and thus rely on metabolites secreted by the nursing Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boussouar and Benahmed, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stanton, 2016</xref>). As a result, spermatocytes switch their energy dependence from glucose to lactate and pyruvate, which are preferred substrates for OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bajpai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grootegoed et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nakamura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rato et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement with upregulation of OXPHOS during pachytene, others and we have found high expression of the mtDNA-encoded COXI protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, middle panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>) and mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saunders et al., 1993</xref>) in pachytene spermatocytes. Furthermore, we find that spermatocytes, compared with pre-meiotic spermatogonia, switch on expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, MPC1, presumably to accommodate the greater flux of pyruvate into the OXPHOS pathway. Changes in pyruvate metabolism, driven by MPC expression, have been shown to regulate differentiation of stem cells in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Flores et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schell et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our findings are in agreement with previous indications that mitochondrial morphology, cristae structure, and OXPHOS activity change during MPI. Round spherical mitochondria with orthodox cristae in early MPI convert in pachytene to more elongated mitochondria with condensed cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Martino et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meinhardt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seitz et al., 1995</xref>), an ultrastructure associated with active OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hackenbrock, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mannella, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, mitochondrial function has been shown to be important for this particular developmental stage. Arrest in early MPI occurs in mouse models with a pathogenic mtDNA deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakada et al., 2006</xref>) or inability to utilize mitochondrial ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brower et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, mouse models that accumulate mtDNA mutations exhibit male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kujoth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Trifunovic et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the Mfn1 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), we show that mitofusins are required not only in spermatocytes, but also in differentiating spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). S8::Mfn1, S8::Mfn2, and S8::Dm mice exhibit a progressive loss of all differentiated germ cell types, including the differentiating spermatogonia that give rise to spermatocytes. The age-dependent loss is likely caused by the progressive depletion of mitofusin gene products due to the iterative nature of spermatogenesis. At P24, during the first round of spermatogenesis, germ cells may contain residual levels of mitofusin activity sufficient to mitigate effects on spermatogonia. As a result, the major defect is found during MPI, which is more sensitive to ATP depletion because of the metabolic shift described above. With long-term mitofusin loss in adult mice, even the less sensitive differentiating spermatogonia are affected. Mitochondrial fusion, however, is dispensable for self-renewal of undifferentiated spermatogonia, even though these cells display mitochondrial heterogeneity with loss of mitofusins. Undifferentiated spermatogonia, differentiating spermatogonia, and spermatocytes therefore show progressively increasing requirements for mitochondrial fusion. These results are consistent with a paradigm in various (but not all) stem cell systems, wherein stem cells compared with differentiated cells are less dependent on mitochondrial OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen and Chan, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The two major phenotypes of S8::Dm mice—meiotic failure and spermatogonial differentiation—are also observed with loss of <italic>Mfn1</italic> alone. This observation suggests that these defects should be attributed to loss of mitochondrial fusion, rather than non-fusion functions, like ER-mitochondria tethering, that have been attributed to Mfn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>). To further test that our spermatogenesis defects are due to loss of mitochondrial fusion, it will be helpful to analyze mice lacking other mitochondrial dynamics factors, particularly <italic>Opa1</italic>.</p><p>To elucidate the cellular mechanism for the spermatogenic arrest we performed proteomics in MEFs and found downregulation of respiratory chain complex I and IV subunits, mitochondrial translation proteins, and the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, MPC2.

In our study, full inhibition of mitochondrial fusion by deletion of both mitofusins uncovers their role in maintaining the respiratory chain and mitochondrial translation. Finally, we find an increase in the respiratory chain complex I and IV assembly factors as well as mitochondrial import proteins in <italic>Mfn1/Mfn2</italic>-null MEFs. These increases may be indicative of a compensatory stress response to the cellular dysfunction caused by mitochondrial fusion deficiency. Importantly, the metabolic derangements revealed by proteomics in MEFs extend to a spermatocyte cell line and to spermatocytes in vivo. Thus, our findings provide a rationale for how mitochondrial fusion safeguards mitochondrial function and male fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of S8::Dm mice and characterization of Stra8-Cre expression</title><p>All mouse experiments were approved by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Briefly, testes were decapsulated and placed into 10 cm petri dishes containing 3 ml MEM-α. Seminiferous tubules were loosened under a dissecting microscope with forceps, and the interstitial cells were washed away. The seminiferous tubules were transferred to a fresh 10 cm petri dish containing 300 µl MEM-α and the tubules were torn between two fine forceps for 3–5 min. A cell suspension was made with an additional 1 ml MEM-α using a P1000 pipette and the large tubular remnants were removed by centrifugation at 500 rpm (27 RCF) for 1 min. The cells were concentrated by centrifugation for 7 min at 1000 rpm (106 RCF), and 500 µl of the supernatant was discarded. Upon re-suspending cells, 600 µl of Hypotonic Buffer was added to 600 µl of the cell suspension and incubated for 7 min at RT.

Pre-fixed pieces of tissue were rinsed with fresh cacodylate buffer and placed into brass planchettes (Type A; Ted Pella, Inc, Redding, CA) prefilled with 10% Ficoll in cacodylate buffer. Samples were covered with the flat side of a Type-B brass planchette and rapidly frozen with a HPM-010 high-pressure freezing machine (Leica Microsystems, Vienna Austria). The frozen samples were transferred under liquid nitrogen to cryotubes (Nunc) containing a frozen solution of 2.5% osmium tetroxide, 0.05% uranyl acetate in acetone. Tubes were loaded into an AFS-2 freeze-substitution machine (Leica Microsystems) and processed at −90°C for 72 hr, warmed over 12 hr to −20°C, held at that temperature for 8 hr, then warmed to 4°C for 2 hr. The fixative was removed, and the samples were rinsed 4x with cold acetone, and then were infiltrated with Epon-Araldite resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Port Washington PA) over 48 hr.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Mitochondrial fusion is required for multiple stages of mouse spermatogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Picard (Reviewer #2); Tsutomu Endo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers have made so many suggestions for making the manuscript more complete, that we do not see any way all these comments can be addressed in the time frame of a major revision. Of course, if you wish to make all suggested changes and resubmit, the same reviewers could look through the manuscript again. However, such a resubmission will be treated as new and we could not guarantee that other new questions will not arise during review.</p><p>As you can see from the appended reviews, it was the reviewers' opinion that:</p><p>1) The presented data nicely documents the spermatogenesis problem related to the absence of mitofusins, but that the data are essentially phenomenological in that they do not show how and why exactly mitofusin deletion causes spermatogenesis defect at the molecular level.</p><p>2) Given the fact that mitofusins, especially mitofusin 2, is believed to be implicated in functions other than mitodynamics (e.g. MAM), it is crucial that you document and compare the spermatogenesis phenotype(s) for the single knockout lines that you already have.</p><p>3) It is not clear whether the reported problem in spermatogenesis is due to a generic mitodynamic alteration or specifically linked to some intrinsic property of mitofusins. It would thus be critical that you show if deletion of OPA (may be difficult given the multiple isoforms) or overexpression of DRP1 can phenocopy the effects of mitofusin deletion on spermatogenesis.</p><p>4) While the idea to run a proteomic experiment to gain insights into the molecular underpinning of the observed defect is exciting, neither the results nor the selection of the cell type (i.e. MEFs) are particularly compelling. Indeed, the reported proteomic changes are quite generic and MEFs do not respect the cell-specific context of spermatocytes.</p><p>5) Several comments also focused on the quality of the EM and the data generated with these images in terms of apoptosis and mitochondria cristae, which will need to be corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this new manuscript the authors seek to determine the role of mitofusins in spermatogenesis. This work is prompted by the observation that low Mfn2 expression is associated with reduced sperm motility and Mnf1 defects are associated with alerted spermatogenesis. However, at this time, very little is known about the link of mitofusins with spermatogenesis. Using conditional knockout mouse line deficient in either or both Mfn, the authors found that mutant mice exhibited small testis with reduced spermatozoa in the epididymides with the following severity arcos the different null lines: Mfn2 &lt; Mfn1 &lt; Mfn1/2. In light of this finding the authors then demonstrated in absence of Mfn the tubules of the double knockout mice were almost devoid of post-meiotic spermatids, which they demonstrate to be due to a blockage at the zygotene to pachytene transition. The authors demonstrate that at the pachytene stage, mitochondria are more clustered, their content is higher and their length is greater in spermatocytes, than at the zygotene stage. In keeping with these differences, spermatocytes in the double knockout mice have less mitochondria and they are more fragmented. Moreover, compared to the mitochondria in the wild-type mice spermatocytes, in the knockout mice many mitochondria lack MPC1 which is necessary to import the Sertoli cell-derived lactate used by spermatocytes to fuel OXPHOS. Together with functional OXPHOS measurements, the authors concluded that the above findings indicate that during the zygotene to pachytene transition, mitochondria undergo a metabolic shift, which requires a presence of Mfns. The authors also demonstrated that if the defect of Mfn is chronic, they observed a major depletion in germ cells, which likely die by activation the molecular program of apoptosis. Lastly, the authors utilize SILAC in MEFs isolated mitochondria from the double knockout mice. This proteomic approach revealed that the lack of Mfns is associated with a downregulation of several mitochondrial respiratory chain and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, as well as TFAM. Conversely several protein import factors were upregulated in these mutant cells. In light of these results the authors conclude that they elucidate how Mfns promote fertility.</p><p>Overall this study is well conducted and the results clear and, for the most part convincing. The methods are appropriate although the statistical treatment of the data may require some clarification (see below). The enthusiasm for this work is however reduced, as for this reviewer, as the author's strong conclusion is not supported by the data, and this is discussed below.</p><p>1) While the rationale for this work is somewhat tenuous (relying on limited number of observations), the set of investigations presented herein provide a strong case for the hypothesized role of Mfns in spermatogenesis. Yet, the data are essentially phenomenological and do not, in this reviewer's opinion, &quot;…elucidate how Mfns promote fertility&quot; nor provide clear molecular data to explain how Mfns interfere with spermatogenesis. What the authors show is that in absence of Mfns, there is a block in the spermatogenesis if Mnfs are deficient but why that is, unless overlooked, is not demonstrated.</p><p>2) It is also unclear whether the deficit in Mfn1 or Mfn2 alone cause the same problem, even if the first set of experiments suggest so.</p><p>3) If we focus on Mfns role in mitochondrial dynamics, one may wonder if the effect of Mfns deficit reported here are specific of these proteins or if altering any other mitochondrial dynamic factors would cause the same set of mitochondrial and spermatogenesis problems.</p><p>4) If one accepts that Mfn, especially Mfn2, is also involved in other mitochondrial functions than dynamics (e.g. tethering of the mitochondrial-associated membrane), it would be important to at least discuss these other possibilities.</p><p>5) The illustration of apoptosis even in EM are to this reviewer not convincing. Would it be possible to select more convincing images or perform additional experiments using functional markers of apoptosis such as activated caspases or cleaved fragments from substrate of activate caspase?</p><p>6) Most bar graphs show several groups (and several variables, e.g. time and genotype) suggesting that several t-tests were run per data set.

By using a mouse model, the authors show that germ cell-specific depletion of mitofusins (Mfn1, Mfn2, or both Mfn1 and 2) results in defect in meiotic spermatocytes. Moreover, the authors show that long-term depletion of mitofusins causes depletion of mitotic spermatogonia, suggesting the function of mitochondria fusion in spermatogonia. In general, mitochondria function is important in male germ cells after they complete spermatogenesis, as sperm; sperm middle piece contains mitochondria and play a role in energy production for their progressive motility. The emerged concept that mitochondria function is required for early spermatogenesis, especially in spermatogonia and spermatocytes, is novel and exciting. The work represents significant contribution to the better understanding of spermatogenesis, meiosis, and cell biology. The experiments are well conducted. However, the manuscript writing can be improved to convince readers that the authors' logic, flow, and their conclusions are correct.</p><p>1) The authors show that Stra8-Cre/Mfn1 and Mfn2 double mutant (S8::Dm) mice have a reduction of pachytene/diplotene spermatocytes and an abundance of leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes (Figure 2), and conclude that mitofusins are required for zygotene-to-pachytene transition. However, abnormal meiotic spermatocytes are usually arrested at middle pachytene stage: this checkpoint mechanism is known as &quot;mid-pachytene arrest&quot; or &quot;(seminiferous) stage IV arrest.&quot; Thus, mitofusins might be required for meiotic progression but not for zygotene-to-pachytene transition. The term &quot;zygotene-to-pachytene transition&quot; should be rephrased into &quot;meiotic progression.&quot; Otherwise, the authors should show the data that reduction of pachytene spermatocytes occurs at early pachytene stage, but not at middle/late pachytene stages.</p><p>2) The authors use Stra8-Cre reporter mice for the germ cell-specific depletion of Mfn1 and/or Mfn2. However, endogenous Stra8 is expressed in late, but not in early stage of undifferentiated spermatogonia including stem cells (Endo et al., 2015, DOI:10.1073/pnas.1505683112; Teletin et al., 2019). Once late undifferentiated spermatogonia express Stra8, the cells are irreversibly destined for differentiation and cannot contribute to the population of undifferentiated spermatogonia or stem cells. Thus, the authors cannot exclude the possibility that mitofusins have major function in undifferentiated spermatogonia. The authors should revise the manuscript, where function of mitofusins in undifferentiated spermatogonia is shown or discussed. Otherwise, the authors should show the evidence that Stra8-Cre is expressed in stem cells, and mitofusins are depleted in these cells, by co-immunostaining with any one of stem cell markers (ID4 or GFRα1).</p><p>3) The authors use flow cytometry to isolate &quot;diploid spermatogonia&quot; and &quot;tetraploid MPI spermatocytes&quot; for the measurement of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity (Figures 3F and Supplementary Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 2). When germ cells are isolated by DNA content (2C, 4C, or 1C), it is unclear if the mitotic spermatogonia underwent DNA replication (4C) is included in the fraction of &quot;diploid spermatogonia&quot; or &quot;tetraploid MPI spermatocyte.&quot;</p><p>4) In S8::Dm mice, the number of seminiferous tubules contained differentiating spermatogonia is about 30% of control (Supplementary Figure 2B), and the number of seminiferous tubules contained leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes is about 55% of control (Figure 2E). It seems that the reduced number of differentiating spermatogonia is recovered at leptotene/zygotene stage. Interpretation of the data should be incorporated in the manuscript.</p><p>5) Figures 2F-G: It is unclear if the spermatocytes of S8::Dm mice at each stage of MPI (leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene) are normal or not. The authors should clarify this point. Chromosome spread images in S8::Dm mice can be shown if needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51601.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] As you can see from the appended reviews, it was the reviewers' opinion that:</p><p>1) The presented data nicely documents the spermatogenesis problem related to the absence of mitofusins, but that the data are essentially phenomenological in that they do not show how and why exactly mitofusin deletion causes spermatogenesis defect at the molecular level.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding molecular mechanism is important. In new data, we have extended our proteomic data to a spermatocyte cell line (Figures 7 and Figure 7—figure supplements 1-3) and germ cells in vivo (Figures 8 and Figure 8—figure supplements 1-3). In brief, we show that mitofusin loss results in reduced levels of OXPHOS subunits and OXPHOS activity. These metabolic defects prevent two key transitions during spermatogenesis: spermatogonial differentiation and meiosis. The new data are described in greater detail in the response to reviewer #1 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the fact that mitofusins, especially mitofusin 2, is believed to be implicated in functions other than mitodynamics (e.g. MAM), it is crucial that you document and compare the spermatogenesis phenotype(s) for the single knockout lines that you already have.</p></disp-quote><p>Mitofusin 2 has indeed been implicated in mediating connections between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. The revised manuscript has detailed analysis of the single mitofusin mutants. The key point of the new data is that loss of Mfn1 alone results in defects in both meiosis and spermatogonial differentiation, thereby mimicking the main features of the double knockout (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplements 1-44). These observations argue against an Mfn2-specific function being responsible for the double knockout phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear whether the reported problem in spermatogenesis is due to a generic mitodynamic alteration or specifically linked to some intrinsic property of mitofusins. It would thus be critical that you show if deletion of OPA (may be difficult given the multiple isoforms) or overexpression of DRP1 can phenocopy the effects of mitofusin deletion on spermatogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>In correspondence with the editors, it was decided that analysis of a completely new mouse knockout (like an <italic>Opa1</italic> knockout) would be beyond the scope of this work, as long as we address the issue of the single mitofusin mouse knockouts. It was also suggested that we acknowledge in the Discussion that the link to mitochondrial fusion is based on the analysis of mitofusins only. We have done this by analyzing the single mitofusins knockouts in detail (as mentioned above) and including the following in the Discussion:</p><p>&quot;The two major phenotypes of S8::Dmmice – meiotic failure and spermatogonial differentiation – are also observed with loss of <italic>Mfn1</italic> alone. […] To further test that our spermatogenesis defects are due to loss of mitochondrial fusion, it will be helpful to analysis mice lacking other mitodynamics factors, particularly <italic>Opa1</italic>.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While the idea to run a proteomic experiment to gain insights into the molecular underpinning of the observed defect is exciting, neither the results nor the selection of the cell type (i.e. MEFs) are particularly compelling. Indeed, the reported proteomic changes are quite generic and MEFs do not respect the cell-specific context of spermatocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the objection to assuming that data from MEFs will apply to spermatocytes. In the revised manuscript, we have added two new lines of work that extend the proteomic data from MEFs into a spermatocyte cell line (Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplements 1-3) and spermatocytes in vivo (Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplements 1-3). In both systems, we show reduced and heterogenous expression of OXPHOS subunits. In addition, we go beyond the protein level to show functional consequences, such as reduced OXPHOS activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Several comments also focused on the quality of the EM and the data generated with these images in terms of apoptosis and mitochondria cristae, which will need to be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We have thought about the reviewer's concern about the use of EM data to show apoptosis. It is difficult to use EM to quantify apoptosis, unless large numbers of micrographs are used. Because the main issue concerns apoptosis, we decided to firm up our data on apoptosis by performing additional TUNEL staining, which is the most common way to quantify apoptosis. The new data are shown in Figure 5E, F, and the additional analysis has resulted in stronger statistical significance.</p><p>We have also reanalyzed the data on mitochondrial cristae, and these changes are discussed in the response to reviewer #2. In particular, we show that the vesiculated cristae structures all connect to the inner membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Overall this study is well conducted and the results clear and, for the most part convincing. The methods are appropriate although the statistical treatment of the data may require some clarification (see below). The enthusiasm for this work is however reduced, as for this reviewer, as the author's strong conclusion is not supported by the data, and this is discussed below.</p><p>1) While the rationale for this work is somewhat tenuous (relying on limited number of observations), the set of investigations presented herein provide a strong case for the hypothesized role of Mfns in spermatogenesis. Yet, the data are essentially phenomenological and do not, in this reviewer's opinion, &quot;…elucidate how Mfns promote fertility&quot; nor provide clear molecular data to explain how Mfns interfere with spermatogenesis. What the authors show is that in absence of Mfns, there is a block in the spermatogenesis if Mnfs are deficient but why that is, unless overlooked, is not demonstrated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is important to identify the molecular mechanism underlying the block in spermatogenesis. The revised manuscript addresses this issue by extending insights from the proteomics in MEFs into a spermatocyte cell line and spermatocytes in vivo. We found the GC-2spd(ts) spermatocyte cell line to be highly sensitive to mitofusin knockdown (more so than MEFs). Knockdown of Mfn1 and Mfn2 results in mitochondrial fragmentation (Figure 7A, B) and reduction of Complex I subunit NdufB8, Complex Isubunit SDHB, Complex II subunit UQRC2, Complex IV subunit MTCOI, and Complex V subunit ATP5A (Figure 7C, D). In addition to these reductions in protein levels, we find a reduction in OXPHOS activity as measured by Seahorse experiments (Figure 7E-G). Similar knockdown in MEFs was not sufficient to cause OXPHOS changes in MEFs (Figure 7—figure supplement 3D), suggesting that the spermatocyte cell line is particularly vulnerable to loss of mitochondrial fusion.</p><p>We found similar defects in mutant spermatocytes in vivo (Figure 8). Spermatocytes have reduced and heterogeneous expression of Complex I subunit NdufB6, Complex IV subunit MTCOI, and the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier MPC1 (Figure 8A, B). We also obtained evidence of reduced OXPHOS activity through histochemical analysis of COXIV/SDH activity (Figure 8C, Figure 8 Figure supplement 3A-B).</p><p>These results show that loss of mitofusins results in reduced levels of OXPHOS subunits and reduced OXPHOS activity in spermatocytes. Combined with the observation that meiosis in spermatocytes is normally accompanied by a metabolic shift characterized by increased mitochondrial content and OXPHOS activity, these findings provide a compelling mechanistic explanation for the spermatogenesis defect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is also unclear whether the deficit in Mfn1 or Mfn2 alone cause the same problem, even if the first set of experiments suggest so.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we provide much more detailed analyses of the Mfn1 and Mfn2 single mutants. We find that loss of Mfn1 alone results in the two major phenotypes of the double mutant: a defect in meiosis and spermatogonial differentiation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-B, Figure 4—figure supplement 4A-B). Loss of Mfn2 alone results only in the latter phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If we focus on Mfns role in mitochondrial dynamics, one may wonder if the effect of Mfns deficit reported here are specific of these proteins or if altering any other mitochondrial dynamic factors would cause the same set of mitochondrial and spermatogenesis problems.</p></disp-quote><p>In a discussion with the editors, it was agreed that analysis of additional mouse knockouts (such as an Opa1 knockout) is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we acknowledge in the Discussion the importance of studying other proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion to further resolve this issue:</p><p>&quot;The two major phenotypes of S8::Dm – meiotic failure and spermatogonial differentiation – are also observed with loss of <italic>Mfn1</italic> alone. This observation suggests that these defects should be attributed to loss of mitochondrial fusion, rather than non-fusion functions, like ER-mitochondria tethering, that have been attributed to Mfn2 (De Brito and Scorrano, 2008). To further test that our spermatogenesis defects are due to loss of mitochondrial fusion, it will be helpful to analysis mice lacking other mitodynamics factors, particularly Opa1.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If one accepts that Mfn, especially Mfn2, is also involved in other mitochondrial functions than dynamics (e.g. tethering of the mitochondrial-associated membrane), it would be important to at least discuss these other possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, the fact that Mfn1 single knockout reproduces the two key features of the double mitofusin knockout rules out the possibility that the phenotypes are due to an Mfn2- specific function, like ER-mitochondria tethering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The illustration of apoptosis even in EM are to this reviewer not convincing. Would it be possible to select more convincing images or perform additional experiments using functional markers of apoptosis such as activated caspases or cleaved fragments from substrate of activate caspase?</p></disp-quote><p>Because the key point is to provide more definitive evidence for apoptosis, we decided to obtain better TUNEL data. We performed additional TUNEL staining of testis sections, and the new data in Figure 5E, F shows clearly that apoptosis is increased in the mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Most bar graphs show several groups (and several variables, e.g. time and genotype) suggesting that several t-tests were run per data set.

Even better, in light of the data, would it not be better to use a 1 or 2-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc test?

Furthermore, we show that despite <italic>Stra8-Cre</italic> expression in these early undifferentiated spermatogonia, the mutant cells show Ki67 staining. In addition, the number of GFRα1- positive spermatogonia are increased in the mutant (Figures 4F, G). Thus, these data indicate that mitofusins are dispensable for proliferation of early, undifferentiated spermatogonia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors use flow cytometry to isolate &quot;diploid spermatogonia&quot; and &quot;tetraploid MPI spermatocytes&quot; for the measurement of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity (Figures 3F and Supplementary Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 2). When germ cells are isolated by DNA content (2C, 4C, or 1C), it is unclear if the mitotic spermatogonia underwent DNA replication (4C) is included in the fraction of &quot;diploid spermatogonia&quot; or &quot;tetraploid MPI spermatocyte.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. To address this issue, we used molecular markers to characterize the identity of the 4N population after sorting. Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows that the vast majority (&gt;95%) of 4N cells express the MPI-specific SCP3 marker. Thus, the contribution of replicating spermatogonia to the 4N population is insignificant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In S8::Dm mice, the number of seminiferous tubules contained differentiating spermatogonia is about 30% of control (Supplementary Figure 2B), and the number of seminiferous tubules contained leptotene/zygotene spermatocytes is about 55% of control (Figure 2E).

In the revised manuscript, we have re-formatted the data presentation so that the two sets of data referred to are in the same plot (Figure 2E) and can be readily compared.

However, the difference was not statistically significant, and we point this out in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figures 2F-G: It is unclear if the spermatocytes of S8::Dm mice at each stage of MPI (leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene) are normal or not.
