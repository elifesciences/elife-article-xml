We find RORβ is required in the cortex for L4 aggregation into barrels and thalamocortical afferent (TCA) segregation. Interestingly, barrel organization also degrades with age in wildtype mice. Loss of RORβ delays excitatory input and disrupts gene expression and chromatin accessibility, with down-regulation of L4 and up-regulation of L5 genes, suggesting a disruption in cellular specification. Expression and binding site accessibility change for many other TFs, including closure of neurodevelopmental TF binding sites and increased expression and binding capacity of activity-regulated TFs.

Structure to function mapping is particularly striking in sensory input to L4 of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catania and Kaas, 1995</xref>). L4 neurons are distinctive in their propensity to form cellular aggregates, or modules, that receive segregated thalamic inputs and represent features of the sensory periphery. Whisker barrels in the rodent somatosensory cortex are a prototypical example, but other somatosensory modules within L4 are also present in the cortices of insectivores, carnivores and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krubitzer and Seelke, 2012</xref>), and columns receiving segregated input are present in the visual cortices of carnivores and primates, and in other cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mountcastle, 1997</xref>). At the same time, gene expression studies in mouse and human show that L4 neurons also have a distinctive transcriptional identity that includes expression of RORβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>). Despite these two striking features, little is known about the relationships between transcriptional identity, the mechanisms that establish and regulate that identity, and features of L4 cytoarchitecture.</p><p>Researchers have long used the rodent whisker pathway to study cytoarchitecture development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hand and Strick, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). The whisker map is organized into microcolumnar units called barrels located in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). In mice, L4 cortical neurons assemble into columns that form barrel walls and input is relayed via thalamocortical afferents (TCAs), which cluster in the center of barrel hollows. Each whisker is projected through corollary maps in the brainstem and ventrobasal thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Van Der Loos, 1976</xref>) before reaching S1.</p><p>Many proteins and pathways are required for presynaptic organization of TCAs and/or postsynaptic organization in L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li and Crair, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erzurumlu and Gaspar, 2012</xref>). Much of what we know has focused on the requirement of input activity and intact signaling pathways. Genetic disruption of synaptic transmission via glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iwasato et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iwasato et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hannan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Datwani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballester-Rosado et al., 2016</xref>), or serotonin pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cases et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Salichon et al., 2001</xref>) perturb some aspect of barrel organization. Several related signal transduction pathways are also required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Majid et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Watson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lush et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Barrel formation is also regulated transcriptionally. Transcription factors (TFs) such as Bhlhe22/Bhlhb5 and Eomes are involved in the early stages of cortical arealization and barrel development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joshi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elsen et al., 2013</xref>). Downstream of these early developmental processes activity-dependent TFs, including Lmo4, NeuroD2, and Btbd3 regulate aspects of barrel organization in response to TCA inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ince-Dunn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kashani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Matsui et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the TFs retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα) and beta (RORβ), are also implicated in barrel formation. RORα and RORβ are expressed in regions of the somatosensory barrel map, with RORα expressed in brainstem, thalamus and cortex, and RORβ in thalamus and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nakagawa and O'Leary, 2003</xref>). Recently, RORα was shown to be required in the thalamus and cortex for proper TCA segregation and barrel wall formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vitalis et al., 2018</xref>). Mis-expression of RORβ in neocortex is sufficient to drive cortical neuron clustering and TCA recruitment to ectopic barrel-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jabaudon et al., 2012</xref>). Together these studies have identified multiple TFs with major roles in early barrel development that likely set the stage for more downstream terminal differentiation TFs and activity-regulated TFs to hone the network. Early cortical development, TCA pathfinding, and activity dependent gene regulation are prolific areas of research. However, the later stages of neuronal specification and the molecular mechanisms of TFs involved in barrel development are currently underexplored. TFs such as Bhlh5 and Eomes have broad roles and are widely expressed in the cortex while the more narrowly expressed TFs such as Btbd3 are downstream of activity input leaving a gap in our understanding of the intermediate steps that connect cortical development to activity driven processes. Given the restricted layer-specific expression of RORβ and its up-regulation concomitant with the final stages of barrel formation and the onset of input activity, we hypothesized it would be a good candidate to study transcriptional mechanisms connecting cellular specification in L4 with cytoarchitecture and network development.</p><p>We show that in addition to being sufficient, RORβ is also required for both pre- and postsynaptic barrel organization. Without RORβ in the cortex, L4 neurons fail to migrate tangentially and do not organize into barrel wall structures. This also reduced TCA segregation shortly after barrel formation would have normally occurred. Interestingly, TCA segregation also declined as animals aged. Without RORβ, L4 gene expression and chromatin accessibility were disrupted, with L4-specific genes down-regulated and L5-specific genes up-regulated suggesting a disruption in terminal cellular identity. This involved complex changes in the expression and/or chromatin accessibility at binding motifs for many TFs in addition to RORβ, including developmental regulators and activity-regulated TFs. L4 neurons also received delayed excitatory input, a key step in barrel development. Lastly, we identify a putative direct gene target of RORβ, <italic>Thsd7a</italic>, that is down-regulated without RORβ and is required for maintained TCA organization in adulthood. Together these data characterize the role of RORβ across multiple levels to connect molecular and transcriptional mechanisms to cortical organization and place RORβ as a key regulator of a complex developmental transition orchestrating terminal L4 specification and initiating activity responsiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Cortical barrels in mice are complex structures. Cell-sparse barrel hollows are where thalamic projections are concentrated. Barrel walls are formed by cortical cell aggregates that surround the TCAs. Barrel septa consist of the intermediate spaces between barrel walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970</xref>). To assess the impact of RORβ loss on barrel organization we used two staining methods. Barrel walls were visualized by Nissl staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van der Loos and Woolsey, 1973</xref>) and barrel hollows were visualized by vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), which is strongly expressed in TCAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fremeau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liguz-Lecznar and Skangiel-Kramska, 2007</xref>), or as clusters of reporter expressing afferents from VPM neurons. This strategy allowed clear identification of changes in either structure independently. Cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining was also used in some conditions, but the presence of CO signal in both barrel walls and TCAs made it less useful.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>RORβ is required for postnatal barrel wall formation and influences segregation of thalamocortical afferents (TCAs)</title><p>To begin exploring RORβ function in barrel organization, we used a global, constitutive knock-out (KO), which contains a GFP expression cassette knocked-in to the <italic>Rorb</italic> locus. <italic>Rorb<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> mice express GFP in RORβ expressing cells allowing identification of barrel cortex without significant disruption to barrel structures or neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Rorb<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> mice were used as controls (Ctl), while <italic>Rorb<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> mice disrupt both copies of <italic>Rorb</italic> to generate a KO.

Nissl staining of barrel walls at P7, P30, and P60 showed that RORβ is required for barrel wall formation. Representative images of Nissl and GFP are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> where the lack of barrel wall organization is clearly visible at P7 and remains disrupted at P30. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> quantifies this effect as the contrast between barrel hollows and barrel wall/septa fluorescence intensity. Contrast was calculated as (barrel - septa) / (barrel + septa) where septa includes barrel walls (see methods for details). Quantification demonstrated a near complete lack of contrast in KO barrel cortex supporting a lack of cortical organization.</p><p>While TCAs have been shown to instruct cortical cell organization we hypothesized the lack of barrel walls might reciprocally affect TCA organization. TCAs visualized by VGLUT2 staining showed an intact pattern of barrel hollows at P7 in KO animals, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. However, careful quantification of the VGLUT2 contrast between hollows and septa showed a significant decrease in the KO suggesting loss of RORβ and/or the lack of barrel walls had a mild but measurable effect on TCA segregation. Interestingly, as animals aged into adulthood TCA segregation also declined in control as well as <italic>Rorb</italic> KO animals. Disorganization in the <italic>Rorb</italic> KO was characterized by both loss of quantifiable VGLUT2 contrast as well as the qualitative barrel patterning most obvious at P60 between Ctl and KO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Both genotype and age significantly affected VGLUT2 contrast (genotype p=4.5e-07 and age p=2.6e-06 by two-way ANOVA) but did not interact significantly. Comparing pairwise across ages we find a significant decline in TCA organization between P7 and P20 controls, with no significant change from P20 to P60. This suggests that while both age and loss of RORβ significantly reduced contrast, loss of RORβ did not significantly change the time course of TCA desegregation.</p><p>To examine whether loss of VGLUT2 contrast could be due to late arrival of VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> inputs from outside the VPM we injected AAV expressing mCherry under the hSyn promoter specifically into the VPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The VGLUT2 barrel-septa contrast was comparable to the barrel-septa contrast in the VPM-specific mCherry filled afferents at P30 strongly suggesting loss of VGLUT2 contrast with age is due to loss of TCA organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>).

To examine the effect of RORβ loss on layer-specific transcriptional identity we assessed the layer specificity of genes differentially expressed between control and <italic>Rorb</italic> KO (DEGs). The Allen Brain Atlas was used to manually screen all DEGs for layer-specific expression in the neocortex. Genes were considered layer-specific if the in-situ hybridization (ISH) signal appeared at least three-fold higher in one layer (considering layers 2 and 3 together). Many genes had complex specificities showing enrichment in two or more layers. These were not included for simplicity. Grouping DEGs based on the layer they are normally expressed within, we see that DEGs which should be expressed in upper layers were generally down-regulated and DEGs that should be expressed in deep layers were generally up-regulated in the <italic>Rorb</italic> KO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>. The strongest effects were loss of many L4 genes and increased expression of many L5 genes. While many L4 and L5 genes were affected, this was not a global identity switch. Many L4 and L5 genes identified from the Allen Brain Atlas were not differentially expressed. In order to assess the statistical significance of the down-regulation of L4 genes and up-regulation of L5 genes we used the Allen Atlas differential search function to contrast L4 to L5 of primary somatosensory cortex (SSp) and included all genes with &gt;1.5 fold change and expression threshold &gt;1.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). Of the 102 L4-specific genes 26% were down-regulated in the KO, a single gene was up-regulated, and the remainder were unchanged. Conversely, up-regulated genes were overrepresented (19%) among the 240 L5-specific genes, and a fisher exact test revealed that these overrepresentations were highly significant (p&lt;2.2e-16).

To assess this possibility, two software algorithms (MEME and HOMER) were used to identify de novo enriched motifs from the DNA sequences of differential ATAC peaks separating closed and opened regions. This unbiased analysis also identifies which enriched sequences match known TF binding motifs. RORβ was the top motif from closed regions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Considering only expressed TFs, the potent neurogenic factors NeuroD1 and Ascl1 were also among the top motifs in closed regions. In regions that opened, the top motifs from expressed TFs were Nfil3, Hlf, Jun, Fos, Trps1, Mef2a/c/d and Irf2. Similar analysis was performed on ATAC peaks near up or down-regulated DEGs as well as L4 and L5 DEGs. To confirm enrichment and identify motif locations we used MEME FIMO and HOMER to scan for instances of a given set of motifs. This was done for all expressed TFs either enriched in the de novo motif analysis or differentially expressed, for which high quality motif models existed. Motif instances were cross-validated by retaining only those found by both MEME and HOMER. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> plots the odds ratio of motifs significantly enriched compared to control regions.

We tested for enrichment of motifs in ATAC regions near DEGs compared to motifs in control regions. We also tested whether DEGs with a nearby motif were significantly enriched compared to a control group of genes that did not change expression in the <italic>Rorb</italic> KO. In essence, we tested whether motifs were enriched around certain DEGs and whether a significant portion of those DEGs had a nearby motif. To reduce false positives, only motifs with significant enrichment in both tests are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>.</p><p>Genes down-regulated at P30 showed significant enrichment of nearby RORβ motifs suggesting RORβ is important for gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Motifs for Nr4a1 and Nfil3 were enriched near up-regulated DEGs at P2 and P7 respectively consistent with an early role for these TFs in activating expression. Foxo1 motifs were enriched near genes down-regulated at P2 and P7. Consistent with a role in early gene regulation, Foxo1 was highly expressed at P2 and declined with age in control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, in the KO, Foxo1 remained significantly elevated at P7 eventually decreasing to levels comparable to control at P30. The close proximity of Foxo1 binding sites to down-regulated genes and its elevated expression at younger ages suggests it may act as a repressor that is normally silenced just after barrel formation to allow proper gene induction in L4 neurons. Without RORβ, silencing of Foxo1 is delayed allowing it to aberrantly repress targets at younger ages.</p><p>Interestingly, we did not find RORβ motifs enriched near L4 genes suggesting the shift in layer-specific gene expression is a downstream effect of RORβ loss. While RORβ does not appear to directly regulate layer-specific genes, Zfp281 motifs were enriched near L4 genes in the de novo motif search and confirmed by specific mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

NeuroD1 motifs were also enriched in regions that closed suggesting it might act as an inhibitor of L5-specific genes as these genes increased expression when NeuroD1 sites closed. Nfe2l consists of a family of TFs that share a binding motif. Nfe2l1 was expressed at younger ages and increased in the adult while Nfe2l3 was highly expressed at P2 and silenced by P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). <italic>Rorb</italic> KO did not significantly disrupt expression of either, but the motif was enriched in regions that opened suggesting Nfe2l1 and/or three may be novel activators of L5-specific genes.</p><p>The TF motifs enriched near up-regulated DEGs were noteworthy for possible relationships with neuronal activity. Nr4a1 is an activity induced TF that regulates the density and distribution of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Nfil3 and Hlf bind and compete for similar DNA motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitsui et al., 2001</xref>), and may also be involved in activity-regulated transcription.

In addition, motifs for the classic immediate early genes, Jun and Fos, were enriched in regions that opened. These observations led us to examine the expression of other activity-regulated TFs.

Reduction in VGLUT2 contrast in the <italic>Thsd7a</italic> KO could be due to increased TCA localization in the septa and/or decreased TCA localization in the barrels.

Studies have long approached the question of what drives cortical organization from the perspective of network activity and, in the case of barrel cortex, from the perspective of key structures and pathways needed to relay sensory input. More recent studies characterizing transcription factors required for barrel organization point to the importance of molecular mechanisms regulating transcriptional programs. However, many of these TFs are part of the pathways that carry sensory input or are fundamental regulators of broad developmental programs. It was unclear whether a TF such as RORβ, a highly restricted marker of L4 identity, could influence macro-scale processes such as module formation. Indeed, we show that while RORβ is clearly regulating only a fraction of the phenotypic and transcriptional properties of L4 neurons, it is necessary for terminal specification of L4 identity and proper organization of L4 cytoarchitecture.</p><p>Specifically, RORβ is required in the cortex for barrel wall formation and full TCA segregation. This differs from earlier work focusing on the role of TCA patterning and activity as instructive for barrel wall formation. Instead, we find that loss of RORβ specifically in the cortex affects TCA segregation shortly after barrel walls should have formed, suggesting that bidirectional signaling between L4 neurons and TCAs is involved in establishing proper organization. That such signaling occurs was first suggested by cortex-specific knockout of NMDA receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Iwasato et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). A second study highlighting this role of cortical influence on TCA organization knocked out the metabotropic glutamate receptor <italic>Grm5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballester-Rosado et al., 2016</xref>) in cortical neurons. In contrast, cortex-specific knockout of another member of the ROR family of transcription factors, <italic>Rora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vitalis et al., 2018</xref>) disrupts the cellular organization of cortical barrels, but appears to leave TCA segregation intact.</p><p>While loss of RORβ function affected TCA segregation from the time of formation we note that loss of the putative RORβ gene target, <italic>Thsd7a</italic>, primarily affected TCA segregation in adults despite maximal expression at P7. While additional studies are needed, we speculate one possible explanation could be that Thsd7a functions around the time of barrel formation to establish long lasting TCA structures that only manifest aberrant phenotypes later in life. Alternatively, the moderate expression level of Thsd7a at P30 may be sufficient for a role in adult maintenance. In either case, a role for Thsd7a in the nervous system has not been described previously. In endothelial cells, Thsd7a localizes to the membrane of the leading edge of migrating cells where it functions to slow or inhibit migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Perhaps in somatosensory cortex it inhibits movement of nearby projections such as dendrites or axons allowing cortical neurons to ‘corral’ TCAs in barrel hollows. <italic>Thsd7a</italic> is not the only potential downstream target of RORβ worthy of further investigation. Pcdh20 has a role in L4 identity in regulating appropriate laminar positioning of L4 cells. Without Pcdh20, cells migrate to L2/3 instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oishi et al., 2016</xref>). In RORβ KO cells, <italic>Pcdh20</italic> is down-regulated but cells still migrate to L4 suggesting a possible novel role for Pcdh20 downstream of RORβ function.</p><p>Our observation that barrel organization declined with age in wildtype animals is very interesting and possibly the first description of this phenomenon in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rice, 1985</xref>). It suggests continued plasticity or degradation of maintenance mechanisms over time. Few studies have examined plasticity within this structure in adulthood. This is in part because studies have shown a decline in the capacity to rewire sensory input to the cerebral cortex with age in certain systems. In the visual system, loss of sensory input has been shown to alter TCAs during a critical postnatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonini and Stryker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erzurumlu and Gaspar, 2012</xref>). It is thought that once this critical period closes, TCA organization is fixed. Thus, developmental processes in the visual and somatosensory systems are assumed to stabilize TCAs and restrict learning and memory related changes to plasticity among cortical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fox, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feldman and Brecht, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Paola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karmarkar and Dan, 2006</xref>). However, there is some evidence to support a shift in this model of adult plasticity in both the visual and somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khibnik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wimmer et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, Oberlaender et al. showed that a mild form of sensory deprivation induced by whisker trimming in 3 month old rats substantially altered TCAs in barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oberlaender et al., 2012</xref>). However, because adult TCA plasticity has garnered limited attention, we currently lack genetic studies examining the molecular mechanisms behind these processes. The natural decline in barrel organization and the mechanism of Thsd7a influence on TCA segregation merit further investigation as exciting new contexts to study both the functional roles of cortical organization and the impact of age.</p><p>Recent studies are revealing that neuronal identity in certain structures remains plastic during early postnatal periods. For example, mistargeted L4 neurons that migrate to layer 2/3 take on characteristics of their surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oishi et al., 2016</xref>) and misexpression of some TF can alter the identity of postnatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rouaux and Arlotta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rouaux and Arlotta, 2013</xref>). We find that loss of RORβ disrupts the transcriptional identity of L4 neurons, which lose expression of many L4 genes and aberrantly express many L5 genes. While this shift to a more L5-like transcriptional profile is not a global identity switch, it suggests L4 identity continues to be refined relative to deeper layer profiles late into postnatal development.</p><p>The complex expression changes observed likely occur through a multi-tiered reorchestration of gene regulation. Up-regulation of known L5 TFs such as Bcl11b/Ctip and Etv1 at P2 may help drive an early diversion down an L5-like trajectory. Regulatory signatures detected in adult neurons such as closure of binding sites for Zfp281 enriched near L4 genes and opening of Nfe2l1/3 motifs enriched near L5 genes may represent the tip of the developmental iceberg. In addition, our stringent motif analysis aimed to keep false positives low may also miss relevant regulators with more minor roles. While we detect changes in binding capacity for many TFs, including RORβ, the complexity of dysregulation spread out across early postnatal development means there are certainly additional mechanisms driving this shift in cellular identity to be discovered. Here we combine the power of genetic knock-out strategies with multiple molecular profiling assays to interrogate the transcriptional network influenced by RORβ. We found RNA-seq paired with ATAC-seq provided a rich picture of the transcriptional changes occurring in <italic>Rorb</italic> KO neurons and insight into both developmental and adult functioning. Changes to the transcriptional network involved both differentially expressed TFs and TFs whose only perturbation was increased or decreased access to binding sites. Without these complementary perspectives, proteins such as Zfp281 and Nfe2l1/3 TFs might have been overlooked.</p><p>We identify several other TFs worthy of further investigation for their role in cortical development. Ascl1 and NeuroD1 are potent TFs that can induce transdifferentiation of mouse embryonic perinatal fibroblasts or microglia into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matsuda et al., 2019</xref>). NeuroD1 binds a different motif than NeuroD2, which is known to regulate barrel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ince-Dunn et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting a distinct role. In addition, Trps1 was strongly up-regulated by RORβ loss at P7 and P30, and it was enriched in regions that opened. Its role in neurons is not clear, but it has been characterized as a transcriptional repressor that inhibits cell migration making it a tempting target to explore the lack of L4 neuron migration necessary to form barrel walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to disrupted layer identity, we also detect a significant disruption in the potential for <italic>Rorb</italic> KO cells to transcriptionally respond to activity connecting cellular identity, module formation and molecular responsiveness to input. In the adult <italic>Rorb</italic> KO, many activity-regulated TFs were up-regulated, with the exception of Btbd3, and their DNA motifs showed increased accessibility. Around P7, when activity is critical for instructing cortical reorganization, we see reduced mEPSC frequency in L4 <italic>Rorb</italic> KO neurons, which is rectified by P10. Some of the transcriptional changes in the <italic>Rorb</italic> KO may be a form of compensation for the lack of input at P7. Failed up-regulation of Htr1b and down-regulation of <italic>S100a10</italic>/p11 may also be an attempt to increase activity in KO neurons. More is known about the role of Htr1b in TCAs where it is transiently expressed and, when stimulated, inhibits thalamic neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett-Clarke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rhoades et al., 1994</xref>) and disrupts barrel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Young-Davies et al., 2000</xref>). TCA inhibition is thought to be the mechanism by which excess 5-HT disrupts barrels. While it is difficult to infer the role of Htr1b and p11 without characterizing cellular localization in S1 L4 neurons, down-regulation of p11 resulting in less Htr1b localizing to the membrane coupled with reduced Htr1b expression could relieve inhibition in L4 <italic>Rorb</italic> KO neurons. Barrel formation and the ability to respond to activity inputs corresponds with increased RORβ expression and this increase is attenuated when TCA inputs are eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pouchelon et al., 2014</xref>). Together this suggests terminal differentiation and migration of neurons within L4 to form barrel walls are closely synchronized to excitatory input and require RORβ for proper establishment.</p><p>Although few other studies have examined the transcriptional targets and molecular mechanisms of TFs that regulate barrel formation, our study suggests RORβ is likely involved in the later stages of cellular specification and implicates several new TFs. RORβ also appears to function by distinct mechanisms from TFs previously characterized to regulate barrel formation. Loss of Bhlhe22 disrupts both barrel wall formation and TCA segregation but results in down-regulation of Lmo4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joshi et al., 2008</xref>) unlike <italic>Rorb</italic> KO, which increased Lmo4. Interestingly, Eomes is required for barrel wall organization but does not appear to affect TCA segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elsen et al., 2013</xref>). Lhx2 and RORα are more broadly expressed than RORβ. <italic>Lhx2</italic> KO results in moderate down regulation of RORβ suggesting it is also likely upstream of RORβ in barrel development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Loss of Lhx2 greatly reduced TCA branching producing smaller barrels and barrel field. This phenotype is very similar to <italic>Rora</italic> KO barrels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vitalis et al., 2018</xref>) suggesting RORα’s mechanism may be more similar to earlier developmental TFs than to RORβ. Disruption of barreloid development in <italic>Rora</italic> KO thalamus is also consistent with a role in earlier stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vitalis et al., 2018</xref>). However, <italic>Rora</italic> was down-regulated in our <italic>Ror</italic>b KO dataset suggesting it may also have a role downstream of RORβ. Several additional TFs appear to be downstream of RORβ. For example, Btbd3 is important for dendritic orientation and is down-regulated in the <italic>Rorb</italic> KO. It may be that dendritic orientation occurs after L4 cells have migrated to form barrel walls and provide an organized reference point for orientation. Thus, we have characterized in depth the molecular and transcriptional mechanism of RORβ as it orchestrates a critical juncture in barrel development where terminal differentiation and activity inputs are integrated to drive cellular organization in the cortex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

All genotypes and age groups contained roughly even numbers of males and females. A minimum of two slices containing at least five intact barrels between rows B-D were quantified per animal. Experimenters were blinded to age and genotype during imaging and quantification. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually by a blinded researcher around 5–6 intact barrels from rows B, C, or D using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). An ROI including the total space around selected barrels up to the edges of adjacent barrels was drawn to be used for calculating septa intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). For <italic>Thsd7a</italic> KO and controls, three additional ROIs were drawn in the region adjacent to barrel cortex with low VGLUT2 signal to be used as background to normalize barrel and septa intensity. Custom MATLAB code was used to quantify the average fluorescence in ROIs. Septa intensity was calculated as septa total ROI intensity - sum(barrel ROIs). Contrast = (barrel - septa) / (barrel + septa). For absolute barrel or septa intensity, measurements were normalized to background regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) within each tissue section. This was not necessary for contrast calculations because contrast is a ratio. Contrast and normalized barrel and septa intensity were averaged for two slices per animal. Two-way ANOVA was used to test for a significant effect of genotype and/or age as well as for an interaction between the two variables. Independent sample t-test was used to test for significant differences between genotypes at each age. No power analysis was performed and numbers of replicates performed were the minimum needed to demonstrate reproducibility, consistent with practices in similar published studies.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Example of quantification method.</title><p>Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in Fiji by a researcher blinded to genotype and age.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-52370-fig9-v3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>AAV injection into VPM</title><p>50 nl of AAV-hSyn-mCherry (Addgene 114472-AAV8, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_114472">Addgene_114472</ext-link>) was delivered by stereotactic injection to the dorsal VPM of P18-20 animals.

Antigen retrieval was carried out in an autoclave set to a 5 min ‘fast’ cycle, 121°C, 15 psi. After protease III digestion, probe solutions containing 313301-C2 (<italic>Fezf2</italic>) or 484781 (<italic>Tox</italic>) also contained 10% NGS and 3% BSA to allow the probe binding step to also serve as the IHC blocking step.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The three reviewers were split on the significance of the current study as written but all felt there were two findings in particular that, if they could be strengthened, would be of broad interest. These points were 1) the layer 4 to layer 5 &quot;identity switch&quot; of the RORb knockout neurons and 2) the degeneration of the organization of thalamocortical axons with age and/or <italic>Thsd7</italic> knockout. The reviewers raised concerns about interpretation of the data supporting each of these findings, and felt that additional experiments would be required to support either claim. These concerns are most clearly articulated in the comments of reviewer #3 below but were voiced by all three reviewers during the discussion period.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Alternative methods in addition to FACS purification by GFP and sequencing are needed to confirm that the layer 5 gene expression programs are indeed occurring in what would have been layer 4 RORb+ neurons.</p><p>2) Complementary methods in addition to vGLut2 staining are needed to characterize the arborization of TC axons in aging and in the <italic>Thsd7</italic> knockout mice to confirm that this organization are disrupted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses the circuit functions of the layer 4 neuron marker RORb. The premise of the study is that layer 4 neurons are somewhat unique in their morphological arrangement into sensory input defined cellular aggregates and the authors presuppose that there is a transcriptional basis for this. Prior studies support this idea and already a number of transcription factors are known that link thalamocortical inputs with the organization of sensory barrels. Here the authors add RORb to this list, knocking it out and showing disruption of barrel formation. Global knockout of RORb was shown to reduce barrel formation (though barrels are still visible). Conditional knockout showed that RORb was required in the cortex (Emx1-cre) prior to barrel formation to have this effect. In both cases the effects get worse with age, though RORb knockout by CamKII-cre, after the barrels have formed, appeared to have no effect. The authors took advantage of the fact that the constitutive knockout allele expresses GFP to purify cells from S1. They compared RNA-seq data against Allen Brain in situ data for layer 4 markers and saw an apparently transformation of the cell fate in the KO neurons, with a down regulation of layer 4 markers and upregulation of layer 5. Using ATAC-seq to find the transcriptional mechanisms of these changes the authors found RORb motifs in many differentially-accessible regions comparing WT and KO, though not near the layer 4 genes. Many other sites contained binding sites for activity-sensing TFs, consistent with the known role of sensory input in barrel development. Finally the authors explore one potential target, <italic>Thsd7a</italic>, which also seems to disrupt some aspects of barrels.</p><p>The work is well done, the studies are rigorous, and the manuscript is well written. However it is not clear that the story is highly novel or significant. Several TFs (as the authors cite) are already known to couple barrel development with sensory input. The authors find some interesting information about RORb's specific functions in this process, but it is not clear that fundamental new insights emerge from the data. Overall I see the manuscript as being of great interest to specialists, but of limited interest to the broader audience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying RORβ's involvement in barrel formation and thus provides a tantalizing link across gene expression, chromatin accessibility, excitatory activity, and cellular organization in L4.

Thus, overall, this work represents a significant contribution to our understanding of a complex cortical developmental process. The body of the manuscript is well written, though I would urge the authors to carefully review the figure legends which contain errors and require some editing. In general, the conclusions drawn by the authors are supported by the data. The tests chosen for statistical analysis seem appropriate and sufficiently rigorous.</p><p>1) It would have been nice to see the progression from the molecular to the cellular level extended to the functional level to complete the whole picture, for instance by using a behavioral test of whisker function to see whether these molecular and cellular changes translate to a meaningful functional phenotype.</p><p>2) The mini EPSC frequency appears to stabilize in Rorb KO mice by P10, yet at P30 the authors observed changes in the expression of many activity-dependent TFs. To strengthen the claim that the changes in excitatory activity are consistent with the observed transcriptional changes, it would seem appropriate to perform the mini EPSC experiment at the P30 time point when most of the activity-dependent TFs show up-regulated expression.</p><p>3) It is unclear why normalization was only used when quantifying changes in barrel-septa contrast in the <italic>Thsd7a</italic> experiment (Figure 7). It seems prudent to use this approach in all the other experiments (Figures 1-3).</p><p>4) Figure 3D lacks an appropriate negative control for comparison at P60 (i.e. CamK2a-cre alone). This is especially important since the authors demonstrate an age-related desegregation of TCA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Using conditional KO strategies authors show that the transcription factor RORb is required in the cortex but not in thalamus for barrel formation; then, based on extensive genomic analyses of RORb+ neurons from layer 4 (L4) neurons , they find that RORb+ neurons loose some L4 molecular characteristics while acquiring new L5 characteristics. Finally they analyse 2 target genes of RORb looking for morphological change in barrel organisation.</p><p>Overall these data are interesting and well analysed; on one hand they confirm the role of RORb in L4 barrel formation ; this has had been proposed based on expression data and on gain of function experiments (Jabaudon et al., 2012). On the other hand, they bring an interesting controversy on the role of RORb in acquiring L4 molecular identity. L4 is generally considered to be part of the upper cortical plate neurons, and to share developmental origin and molecular identity with L2/L3 neurons (Oishi et al., 2016 ).</p><p>The following weak points need however to be addressed.</p><p>1) The most original claim of the study is that L4 neurons acquire L5 identity in <italic>Rorb</italic>-KO. However, this based solely on changes in gene expression, which are not really compelling, because effects are not consistent and vary strongly with age. To support their conclusion, authors need to provide further evidence on the laminar distribution of L4 and L5 /L6 molecular markers (e.g. Cux1, Brn2b, ctip2,...;). Additionally it would be important to know whether L4 neurons acquire new morphological characteristics, of L5 neurons such as pyramidal shape and sub-cerebral projections. Because GFP is expressed in the RORb deficient neurons these could be easily traced and analyzed.</p><p>2) The changes in gene expression in RORb KO vary most between P2 and P7: L5 markers (e.g. ctip2 and Fez1) are up regulated only at P2. Could there be some contamination of the P2 samples with L5 (in which RORb is also expressed), despite efforts in the dissection?</p><p>3) Another strong claim is that segregation of TCAs degrades with age. However, this is based exclusively on Vglut2 immunostaining with low resolution. This is questionable as the cortex matures, since Vglut2 staining becomes much more diffuse, possibly because of the arrival of other VGluT2<sup>+</sup> cortical inputs than TCAs. In fact the difference between WT and RORb- KO becomes is less clear as animals age (Figure 2B) and authors note &quot;loss of RORb did not significantly change the time course of TCA desegregation”. Thus without complementary approaches it is hard to make such strong conclusions. Previous studies showing desegregation of TCAs in the barrel cortex, secondary to cortex-specific deletions have used complementary methods such as tracing reconstructions of TCA axon terminals in the cortex (Ballester-Rosado, 2000, Lee et al., 2005).</p><p>4) For similar reasons as above, the phenotype of the barrel phenotype of <italic>Thsd7</italic>-KO is not really convincing. Although some higher resolution images are shown, these are not confocal, and would not allow rigorous measures of VGluT2<sup>+</sup> terminals.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Cortical <italic>Rorb</italic> is required for layer 4 transcriptional identity and barrel integrity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The observation that barrel organization declines with age in wildtype mice is an interesting one that provides new avenues of research. Thus, overall, this work represents a significant contribution to our understanding of a complex cortical developmental process.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a revised manuscript, and in a previous round of review the reviewers requested a plan from the authors outlining how they would address what were seen as two major concerns. These were the claim from RNA-seq data that Layer 4 neurons were expressing Layer 5 gene programs, and the use of vGlut2 labeling to assess inputs to barrel cortex. The authors proposed to offer new data to address each of these points, using quantitative in situ to validate the RNA-seq and a viral tracing method to complement the vGLut2 staining evaluation of the organization of inputs in barrel cortex.</p><p>The authors did provide these data, however two of the reviewers felt that these new figures needed more clarification. In particular the way the authors presented and interpreted the viral input labeling experiment was a source of significant confusion. Comments from the reviewers on these two new datasets are below and these need to be addressed with text/figure revisions and/or tempering of claims.</p><p>Barrel cortex viral input labeling:</p><p>– The fact that the TC barrelless phenotype increases with age is not supported by the additional evidence provided. Furthermore, the quantification in Figure 2B actually shows the opposite trend: using measures of VMAT2 intensity in barrel hollows/septae the Ctrl/KO difference is most marked at P7 and P20, it seems less marked at P30 and it is no longer significant at P60. Therefore I would suggest not highlighting this in the Abstract and Discussion without better evidence.</p><p>– Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1, compare TC tracing (very nice) with Vglut2 to show this is similar, but they do not illustrate/compare data from the ctrl and KO on the same or graph. The mean control values (n = ?) are represented by the dashed line; but then the SEM and stats need to be added. These 2 figures could be combined into one clearer figure.</p><p>– I do not understand the authors' interpretation of Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. First, what is the y-axis in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 – barrel septal contrast of what? VGlut2? Comparing the absolute contrast levels of two methods of labeling inputs at a single time point or in a single genotype would not seem to mean much. I was assuming when they suggested this method that the authors would compare the Cherry signal in WT and KO to show it reproduced the lower signaling in the KO relative to WT like they saw with vGLut 2. I thought they would do a similar experiment and look at cherry labeling over time in the WT to show it decreases similar to the vGlut2 labeling. Those comparisons would seem to have been needed to address the concerns that were raised by the reviewers about the vGlut2 signal.</p><p>RNAscope in situ quantification:</p><p>– What is the time point for the in situ in Figure 5A? Why is the difference in Fezf2 expression so large in this sample whereas it is negligible at all time points in Supplementary Figure 4B? What did Tox look like in the sequencing data – it would be good to include it in Supplementary Figure 4B. The authors should also show the images for Tox in the supplementary figure because this is important to the validation. Finally, I do not understand what Figure 4E is trying to show or what the authors are concluding. There is no quantification so it is not possible to judge whatever conclusion was intended.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52370.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Alternative methods in addition to FACS purification by GFP and sequencing are needed to confirm that the layer 5 gene expression programs are indeed occurring in what would have been layer 4 RORb+ neurons.</p><p>2) Complementary methods in addition to vGLut2 staining are needed to characterize the arborization of TC axons in aging and in the Thsd7 knockout mice to confirm that this organization are disrupted.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript addresses the circuit functions of the layer 4 neuron marker Rorb.

Prior studies identified transcription factors required for barrel development and laminar fate but stopped short of revealing the underlying transcriptional networks. Here, we begin to open the black box by which loss of a single transcription factor, through a cascade of changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility, can shape activity-dependent cortical development. Our study dives deeper into the transcriptional regulation of barrel development than previous studies. The mechanisms we highlight have broader implications for understanding the complexity of transcriptional networks governing cellular identity and the diversity of transcriptional mechanisms altered by a single TF. Additionally, our description of TCA desegregation in adulthood and the increase in adult desegregation after <italic>Thsd7a</italic> KO, two findings further supported by additional VPM-specific experiments, opens up the barrel cortex to study mechanisms involved in age-related plasticity and cytoarchitecture maintenance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying RORB's involvement in barrel formation and thus provides a tantalizing link across gene expression, chromatin accessibility, excitatory activity, and cellular organization in L4.

We have added more detail regarding this aspect to the Materials and methods (subsection “Imaging and fluorescence quantification”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3D lacks an appropriate negative control for comparison at P60 (i.e. CamK2a-cre alone).

There is a slight downward trend but the variance is too high and our N is too small to determine whether this is significant at the thresholds we’ve set. We do detect a significant change in TCA segregation comparing P7 to P20. We have added a more detailed description to the Results to make this distinction clearer (subsection “RORβ is required for postnatal barrel wall formation and influences segregation of thalamocortical afferents (TCAs)”).</p><p>Given that the <italic>Rorb<sup>f/f</sup></italic> CamK2a-cre does not affect TCA organization, it is very unlikely that the CamK2a-cre alone will have an effect.

Because GFP is expressed in the RORb deficient neurons these could be easily traced and analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that we are not claiming that loss of RORβ leads to a fate-switch in which all aspects of L4 identity are lost and all aspects of L5 identity are gained. Instead, we believe the data argue for a more nuanced view of “identity” comprised of multiple transcriptional circuits, only some of which are disrupted by loss of RORβ. This issue is likely in part due to a lack of clarity in our description. Our use of the phrase “shift in identity” understandably, but also unintentionally, evokes the concept of fate switching. We have edited the manuscript to make it clear (subsection “RORβ is required for expression of a layer 4 gene profile and repression of layer 5 genes”, Discussion) that we don’t think loss of RORb causes L4 neurons to take on a L5 identity. We have also added an analysis of additional layer-specific genes identified from the Allen Brain Atlas demonstrating that while many L4 and L5 genes are dysregulated, many are not (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). Additionally, we don’t find any strong evidence that the L4 neurons have acquired L5 morphology. Instead, we propose that loss of RORb disrupts L4 specification, a process which appears to involve repression of L5 genes. In fact, we think RORb’s role is more likely in fine-tuning L4 identity after fate selection, and upregulation of deeper layer genes is a symptom of dysregulated L4 specification rather than a large-scale identity switch. We apologize for our lack of thoughtfulness in word choice and phrasing while describing these transcriptional changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The changes in gene expression in RORb KO vary most between P2 and P7: L5 markers (e.g. ctip2 and Fez1) are up regulated only at P2. Could there be some contamination of the P2 samples with L5 (in which RORb is also expressed), despite efforts in the dissection?</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with reviewer #3 that age is a factor in upregulation of L5 genes, we do not agree with the assessment that P2 and P7 showed the most change between control and KO. The red line graphs of Figure 4B show that the younger ages show more variation in L5 genes changes with several genes down regulated at younger ages but ultimately upregulated at P30. The P30 adult time point shows the most consistent upregulation with the bulk of the L5 DEGs increased, and for several genes, also with the largest fold increase. We have added a line showing the mean LFC across the group of genes in Figure 4B to make this conclusion easier to assess. While Ctip2 does show the strongest upregulation at P2, FezF2 (Fez1 is not a DEG in our dataset) is only upregulated at P30.</p><p>The reviewer is insightful to suggest possible difficulty in the P2 microdissection. While we think the most compelling RNA-seq evidence is at P7 and P30 we performed RNAscope in situ hybridization to confirm upregulation of two L5 genes, FezF2 and Tox (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D). As an additional control, we analyzed expression changes in all of the genes differentially expressed between layers 4 and 5 of somatosensory cortex according to the Allen Brain Atlas (analysis and criteria in Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Most genes (74 L4 and 190 L5) did not, on average show a change between WT and <italic>Rorb</italic> KO. This would be unexpected if the changes seen in the genes shown in Figure 4 were due to contamination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another strong claim is that segregation of TCAs degrades with age. However, this is based exclusively on Vglut2 immunostaining with low resolution. This is questionable as the cortex matures, since Vglut2 staining becomes much more diffuse, possibly because of the arrival of other VGluT2<sup>+</sup> cortical inputs than TCAs. In fact the difference between WT and RORb- KO becomes is less clear as animals age (Figure 2B) and authors note &quot;loss of RORb did not significantly change the time course of TCA desegregation”. Thus without complementary approaches it is hard to make such strong conclusions. Previous studies showing desegregation of TCAs in the barrel cortex, secondary to cortex-specific deletions have used complementary methods such as tracing reconstructions of TCA axon terminals in the cortex (Ballester-Rosado, 2000, Lee et al., 2005).</p><p>4) For similar reasons as above, the phenotype of the barrel phenotype of Thsd7-KO is not really convincing. Although some higher resolution images are shown, these are not confocal, and would not allow rigorous measures of VGluT2<sup>+</sup> terminals.</p></disp-quote><p>To complement our VGLUT2 staining quantification and to address comments 3 and 4, we injected AAV carrying an mCherry reporter gene driven by the hsyn promoter (AAV-hSyn-mCherry) into VPM to anatomically label TCAs. We use VLGUT2 staining to define barrels and compared the barrel-septa contrast calculated from mCherry expression in VPM axons to that calculated from VGLUT2. Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 show that the contrast calculated from VPM-specific mCherry expressing axons was similar to the contrast calculated from VGLUT2 staining. This supports our interpretation that VPM TCA organization degrades with age and without functional <italic>Thsd7a</italic>, rather than as a result of the arrival of other VGLUT2<sup>+</sup> cortical inputs as the cortex matures.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a revised manuscript, and in a previous round of review the reviewers requested a plan from the authors outlining how they would address what were seen as two major concerns. These were the claim from RNA-seq data that Layer 4 neurons were expressing Layer 5 gene programs, and the use of vGlut2 labeling to assess inputs to barrel cortex. The authors proposed to offer new data to address each of these points, using quantitative in situ to validate the RNA-seq and a viral tracing method to complement the vGLut2 staining evaluation of the organization of inputs in barrel cortex.</p><p>The authors did provide these data, however two of the reviewers felt that these new figures needed more clarification. In particular the way the authors presented and interpreted the viral input labeling experiment was a source of significant confusion. Comments from the reviewers on these two new datasets are below and these need to be addressed with text/figure revisions and/or tempering of claims.</p><p>Barrel cortex viral input labeling:</p><p>– The fact that the TC barrelless phenotype increases with age is not supported by the additional evidence provided. Furthermore, the quantification in Figure 2B actually shows the opposite trend: using measures of VMAT2 intensity in barrel hollows/septae the Ctrl/KO difference is most marked at P7 and P20, it seems less marked at P30 and it is no longer significant at P60. Therefore I would suggest not highlighting this in the Abstract and Discussion without better evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>The paper does not argue that the effect of Rorb KO increases with age. Instead, we find that segregation of afferents declines with age and this effect is separate from the more profound loss of segregation seen in the knockout. This was highlighted by reviewer #2 in the prior set of reviews: “The observation that barrel organization declines with age in wildtype mice is an interesting one that provides new avenues of research. Thus, overall, this work represents a significant contribution to our understanding of a complex cortical developmental process.” To try to make this point clearer, we have altered the sentence in the Abstract which previously read “Interestingly, barrel organization also degrades with age.” to read: “Interestingly, barrel organization also degrades with age in wildtype mice.” We have also clarified this portion of the Discussion by changing: “Our observation that barrel organization declined with age is very interesting and possibly the first description of this phenomenon in mice (Rice, 1985)” to “Our observation that barrel organization declined with age in wildtype animals is very interesting and possibly the first description of this phenomenon in mice (Rice, 1985).” Please also note that we are careful to state in the Results that the change with age is common to both control and KO animals and that “while both age and loss of RORβ significantly reduced contrast, loss of RORβ did not significantly change the time course of TCA desegregation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1, compare TC tracing (very nice) with Vglut2 to show this is similar, but they do not illustrate/compare data from the ctrl and KO on the same or graph. The mean control values (n = ?) are represented by the dashed line; but then the SEM and stats need to be added. These 2 figures could be combined into one clearer figure.</p></disp-quote><p>The prior round of reviews included the following request from reviewer #3:</p><p>“3) Another strong claim is that segregation of TCAs degrades with age.

Specifically, in the prior round of reviews Essential revision #2 reads “Complementary methods in addition to vGLut2 staining are needed to characterize the arborization of TC axons in aging and in the <italic>Thsd7</italic> knockout mice to confirm that this organization are disrupted.”</p><p>Based on our understanding of these requests we submitted a revision plan that included the a response as follows:</p><p><italic>“</italic>To complement our vGLUT2 staining quantification we propose to inject anterograde tracers into the VPM of adult wild-type and <italic>Ths7a</italic> KO animals. We will then quantify the barrel-septa contrast both of vGLUT2 staining and the axonal label. We will also use high resolution confocal microscopy to document the presence of axonal terminals in the septa. If the loss of vGLUT2 contrast in the older adults and <italic>Ths7a</italic> KO is primarily due to loss of TCA localization to barrel hollows we should see a comparable loss of contrast in the VPM anterograde tracer. On the other hand, if the loss of vGLUT2 contrast is due to ingrowth of other vGluT2<sup>+</sup> afferents, the TCA and vGLUT2 contrast will be mismatched and axonal labeling in the septa will be absent.”</p><p>We did carry out these experiments and illustrate them in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1. The number of animals for these experiments (4 for both figures) is stated in the legends. We did not propose to directly compare <italic>Rorb</italic> KO animals to wildtype animals or to produce a complete time course. While we did not produce a full time course for Figure 2—figure supplement 1, we replot the Vglut2 contrasts obtained for P7 for reference and for P30 to show that both measures of Vglut2 contrast are similar despite the experiments having been carried out many months apart. We felt it was important to show that the new experiments involving surgical and viral methods did not significantly alter Vglut2 contrast. The key result shown by these experiments is that TCAs specifically originating in the VPM do not show a difference in contrast compared to total Vglut2 staining. This data rules out the alternative interpretation of non-thalamic afferents raised by the reviewer in the first round of comments. If loss of Vglut2 contrast was due to the arrival of other VGluT2<sup>+</sup> inputs we would not see such close alignment of Vlglut2 contrast and mCherry contrast at P30.</p><p>As the reviewer suggests, we have restated the N’s for the control data in the legends and have given the statistics in the two legends as well. We have also added the SD to the figures as requested.</p><p>We do not believe it would be clearer to combine the two figures into one since they come at very different points within the manuscript and address different questions. Figure 2—figure supplement 1 addresses the decline of barrel segregation with age in normal mice, while Figure 8—figure supplement 1 addresses the loss of barrel-septa contrast in the <italic>Ths7a</italic> KO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I do not understand the authors' interpretation of Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. First, what is the y-axis in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 – barrel septal contrast of what? VGlut2? Comparing the absolute contrast levels of two methods of labeling inputs at a single time point or in a single genotype would not seem to mean much. I was assuming when they suggested this method that the authors would compare the Cherry signal in WT and KO to show it reproduced the lower signaling in the KO relative to WT like they saw with vGLut 2. I thought they would do a similar experiment and look at cherry labeling over time in the WT to show it decreases similar to the vGlut2 labeling. Those comparisons would seem to have been needed to address the concerns that were raised by the reviewers about the vGlut2 signal.</p></disp-quote><p>The y-axis in both figures compares the contrast of VGlut2 to the contrast of mCherry contained within VPM axons. Unlike intensity, contrast is not an absolute measure, but a relative one. It measures the fractional difference between labeling within the barrel compartment relative to that within the septal compartment as a measure of the segregation of axons. A direct comparison of the spatial contrast (segregation) between Vglut2 labelled axons and mCherry-labelled axons in the same tissue was precisely the point of this experiment. What this figure shows clearly is that both methods of labeling axons produce a nearly identical measure of contrast. In other words, the original concern that “Vglut2 staining becomes much more diffuse, possibly because of the arrival of other VGluT2<sup>+</sup> cortical inputs than TCAs” can be ruled out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>RNAscope in situ quantification:</p><p>– What is the time point for the in situ in Figure 5A?</p></disp-quote><p>The in situ was performed at P30 which is stated in the Materials and methods.

We have replotted the data from Supplementary Figure 4B so that the close agreement between the sequencing and in situ can be better appreciated.

This now comprises a new Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, I do not understand what Supplementary Figure 4E is trying to show or what the authors are concluding. There is no quantification so it is not possible to judge whatever conclusion was intended.</p></disp-quote><p>The former Supplementary Figure 4E supports the point that not all L4-specific and L5-specific genes are affected by the knockout, which one would expect if the change we observe were simply due to L5 contamination (a concern raised by reviewers in the first round of comments). This panel is now moved to Main Figure 4E. We have added a statistical analysis (Fisher exact test) to show that although only a subset of L4 and L5 genes are affected, downregulation of L4 genes and upregulation of L5 genes are highly overrepresented (Figure 4F). As explained in the legend and the text, these include all of the genes with 1.5 L4:L5 fold-change and expression &gt; 1.6 as identified by the Allen Brain Atlas differential search. Since these genes exclude the 31 L4 genes and 50 L5 differentially expressed genes shown in Figure 4A-C, they are by definition, not statistically altered by the knockout, as shown by the similarity of the mean fold-change (black line) to the gray line indicating no change. Therefore, this new analysis aims to make two points: (1) the data are not consistent with simple contamination of Rorb KO samples by L5 cells, and (2) provide additional statistical support for the conclusion that L4 and L5 genes are significantly altered. We have added clarification of these results to the legend and to the Results subsection “RORβ is required for expression of a layer 4 gene profile and repression of layer 5 genes”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
