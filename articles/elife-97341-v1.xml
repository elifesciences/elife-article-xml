medication for the prevention of transplant rejection and the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis. It is also incorporated in coronary stent coatings to prevent restenosis and in topical preparations for the treatment of skin disorders. Rapamycin’s in vivo activities are generally ascribed to its binding to the protein FKBP12, leading to potent inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) by the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The specific rapamycin-induced interaction between domains from mTOR and FKBP12 is also frequently employed in cell biological research, for rapid chemically-induced protein dimerization strategies. Here, we show that rapamycin activates TRPM8, a cation channel expressed in sensory nerve endings that serves as the primary cold sensor in mammals. Using a combination of electrophysiology, Saturation Transfer Triple-Difference (STTD) NMR spectroscopy, and molecular docking-based targeted mutagenesis, we demonstrate that rapamycin directly binds to human TRPM8. We identify a rapamycin-binding site in the groove between voltage sensor-like domain and the pore domain, distinct from the interaction sites of cooling agents and known TRPM8 agonists menthol and icilin. Related macrolide immunosuppressants act as partial TRPM8 agonists, competing with rapamycin for the same binding site. These findings identify a novel molecular target for rapamycin and provide new insights into the mechanisms of TRPM8 activation, which may assist in the development of therapies targeting this ion channel. Moreover, our findings also indicate that caution is needed when using molecular approaches based on rapamycin-induced dimerization to study ion channel regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Whereas the conformational changes that lead to cold-induced activation of TRPM8 remain largely elusive, the binding sites of menthol analogs and icilin have been resolved in high detail, based on site-directed mutagenesis studies and high-resolution cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diver et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voets et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yin et al., 2022</xref>).

The various biological and therapeutic effects of rapamycin are primarily attributed to inhibition of mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR). Rapamycin binds to the protein FKBP12, leading to an inhibitory interaction of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex with the FRB (FKBP12-rapamycin binding) domain of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Wiederrecht, 1996</xref>). The ability of rapamycin and rapamycin analogs to rapidly and efficiently bring FKBP12 and the FRB domain in close contact has also been successfully engineered for the rapid chemical dimerization and translocation of signaling enzymes or receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muthuswamy et al., 1999</xref>), including (TRP) ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Varnai et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>While performing experiments involving rapamycin-induced membrane translocation of a phospholipid phosphatase, we serendipitously discovered that rapamycin by itself potently activates TRPM8, both in TRPM8-expressing HEK cells and in mouse somatosensory neurons. Using whole-cell and inside-out patch-clamp recordings and Saturation Transfer Triple-Difference (STTD) NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that channel activation is caused by direct binding of rapamycin to TRPM8, rather than via an effect on mTOR activity. Based on site-directed mutagenesis guided by molecular docking, we provide evidence for a rapamycin-interaction site in the groove between S4 and S5, distinct from the known interaction sites for menthol or icilin. We also show that related macrolides such as the immunosuppressant everolimus act as partial TRPM8 agonists and compete with rapamycin for the same binding site. Our results identify TRPM8 as a novel molecular target for rapamycin and provide new insights into the mechanisms of TRPM8 activation, which may assist in the development of drugs targeting this ion channel. Finally, our results imply that direct activation of TRPM8 may need to be taken into account when using rapamycin-based dimerization approaches to study cellular processes in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapamycin activates TRPM8</title><p>When performing Fura-2-based intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) measurements in HEK293 cells stably expressing human TRPM8 channels (HEK-M8 cells), we observed that rapamycin (10 µM) caused a robust increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, comparable in amplitude to the response evoked by the prototypical TRPM8 agonist menthol at a concentration of 50 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The basic principle of the classical, one-dimensional saturation transfer difference <sup>1</sup>H NMR (1D STD-NMR) is that resonances are saturated by selective irradiation, and this saturation spreads over the whole protein molecule and its bound ligands via spin diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyer and Peters, 2003</xref>). The signal attenuation of ligand <sup>1</sup>H resonances upon binding is evident in the saturation transfer difference (STD) spectrum, which is obtained by subtraction of two spectra, one recorded with and the other without the saturation of protein resonances. We calculated the difference of STD spectra (double-difference STD, STDD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Claasen et al., 2005</xref>), one recorded on a cellular sample with rapamycin added (sample 1, STD-1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) and the other without rapamycin (sample 2, STD-2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The resulting double-difference spectrum (STDD-1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) reports both TRPM8-specific and non-specific binding interactions of rapamycin. To remove the STD signals arising from non-specific interactions of rapamycin, we recorded two more STD spectra on cells lacking TRPM8 expression (naïve HEK293 cells), namely in the presence (sample 3, STD-3) and absence (sample 4, STD-4) of rapamycin, yielding the second double-difference (STDD-2) spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, the difference of STDD-1 and STDD-2 spectra yielded the triple-difference spectrum (STTD), which is free of interfering signals arising from any non-specific interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To address the effect of the inherent variability of cellular samples on peak heights, STD effects were normalized based on the comparison of independent <sup>1</sup>H experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Three STTD replicates were computed, unambiguously confirming direct binding to TRPM8 in two datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). The signals assigned in the STTD spectra (numbered according to the schematic structure of rapamycin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) unveil the rapamycin H atoms that correspond to the binding epitopes of the molecule to TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that rapamycin binds to TRPM8, acting as a direct channel agonist independently of mTOR.</p><p>In earlier work, we have classified TRPM8 agonists into two types based on their effect on the channel’s gating kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janssens et al., 2016</xref>). According to this classification, Type I agonists such as menthol induce a slowing of the gating kinetics, which is most prominently observed as slowly deactivating tail currents following repolarization, whereas Type II agonists such as AITC cause an acceleration of the kinetics of channel activation upon depolarization, with little or no effect on the kinetics of deactivating tail currents. These differences in kinetics can be explained by a gating model where type I agonists cause a relative stabilization of the open state, whereas type II agonists rather destabilize the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janssens et al., 2016</xref>). Whole-cell current recordings in HEK-M8 cells revealed a pronounced effect of rapamycin on the kinetics of current relaxation in response to voltage steps (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In particular, rapamycin caused a concentration-dependent slowing of the time course of voltage-dependent activation and deactivation, resulting in long-lasting tail currents upon repolarization from a strongly depolarizing voltage step to +120 mV, and these effects were more pronounced than for menthol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Overall, these characteristics classify rapamycin as a type I agonist, stabilizing the channel’s open conformations. Notably, rapamycin and menthol had a synergistic effect on channel gating: application of menthol (50 μM) in the continued presence of rapamycin (10 μM) caused a further slowing down of channel deactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Rapamycin binds to a unique binding site on TRPM8</title><p>Site-directed mutagenesis studies and high-resolution cryo-EM structures have delineated binding sites for several TRPM8 ligands, including agonists such as icilin, AITC, cryosim-3 and the menthol analog WS-12, as well as antagonists such as AMTB or TC-I 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diver et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voets et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). These compounds all bind in the cavity between the four alpha-helices of the voltage sensor-like domain (S1-S4), with the exception of the type II agonist AITC, which binds outside the voltage sensor-like domain at a site between S3 and the S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Since rapamycin, like menthol, acts as a type I agonist, and both compounds contain a substituted cyclohexyl moiety, we initially examined the possibility that rapamycin would interact with the menthol-binding site.

In agreement with this notion, initial experiments revealed that mutations in the menthol binding site that strongly reduce responses to menthol, icilin, Cooling Agent 10, WS-3, or cryosim-3 (Y745H and R842H; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voets et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malkia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beccari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plaza-Cayón et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palchevskyi et al., 2023</xref>) did not affect the channel’s sensitivity to rapamycin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Initial pilot dockings revealed several potential rapamycin interaction sites, either at the bottom of the voltage sensor-like domain or in the groove between the voltage sensor-like domain and the pore region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on these initial results, we made a series of point mutations at strategic residues in these potential rapamycin interaction sites and used Fura-2-based [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> measurements to test these mutants for their responses to menthol (50 µM) and rapamycin (10 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). All mutant channels yielded robust calcium responses to at least one of the two agonists, indicating that they expressed as functional channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Wild type and most mutants showed maximal responses (Δ[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) to at least one of the agonists of &gt;1 µM. One exception was mutant F847A, which did not respond to menthol but showed a consistent but relatively small (Δ[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>≈ 200 nM) to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To assess potential changes in sensitivity to rapamycin or menthol, we calculated the rapamycin response ratio, defined as the calcium response to rapamycin over the sum of the calcium responses to rapamycin and menthol (Δ[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i,rapamycin</sub>/(Δ[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i,rapamycin</sub> + Δ[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i,menthol</sub>)). As such, mutants that respond to rapamycin but fully lack a response to menthol have a response ratio of 1, while mutants that respond to menthol but fail to respond to rapamycin have a response ratio of 0. For the wild-type channel, which robustly responds to both agonists, this analysis yielded a response ratio of 0.59±0.02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Several mutants yielded a significantly higher response ratio compared to wild type, indicating reduced menthol sensitivity. These included the previously described mutants Y745H and R842H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Voets et al., 2007</xref>), which show robust responses to rapamycin but no responses to menthol (response ratios &gt;0.95; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). These residues, located in the middle of S1 and S4, respectively, point towards the center of the cavity within the voltage sensor-like domain, where they interact with ligands such as cryosim-3 and the menthol analog WS-12. Mutants R851Q and V849M, located at the cytosolic entrance to the cavity within the voltage sensor-like domain, also show a significantly reduced menthol response combined with a robust rapamycin response (response ratios of 0.77±0.03, and 0.98±0.02, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The results from these mutations are fully in line with the notion that menthol activates TRPM8 by binding in the middle of the cavity within the voltage sensor-like domain, and that mutations in the binding site or at the entrance of the cavity affect menthol activation. The observation that rapamycin activation is not noticeably affected in all these mutants confirms that the rapamycin and menthol binding sites are separate and also argues against a potential rapamycin binding site at the lower part of the voltage sensor-like domain.</p><p>Oppositely, we identified four mutants with a significantly lower rapamycin response ratio compared to wild type (response ratios &lt;0.3), indicating reduced rapamycin sensitivity. These include D796A (located in the S2-S3 linker), D802A and G805A (located in S3), and Q861A (located in the S5 pore helix; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The strongly reduced sensitivity of these mutants to rapamycin was confirmed in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, revealing robust current responses to menthol but very limited responses to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). These results further confirm that rapamycin binds directly to the TRPM8 channel and are in agreement with a model where rapamycin binds in the groove between the voltage sensor-like domain and the pore region. These results and the publication of the cryo-EM structure of the mouse TRPM8 during our experiments prompted the further refinement of dockings, resulting in the rapamycin binding site illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> (the pdb-file of the model is available via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17143202">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17143202</ext-link>).

Interestingly, structural studies indicated that these residues are not directly involved in binding icilin. Instead, D802 is involved in calcium binding, which strongly potentiates activation of TRPM8 by icilin, while the flexibility invoked by a glycine at position 805 allows enlargement of the VSLD cavity to accommodate the hydroxyphenyl moiety of icilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yin et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore tested whether rapamycin activation is also modulated by intracellular calcium, by using UV flash-induced release of caged Ca<sup>2+</sup> during whole-cell current recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahieu et al., 2010</xref>). In these experiments, a 1 ms UV flash was applied during a 800 ms voltage step to +80 mV, either in the absence of ligand or in the presence of rapamycin (10 µM) or icilin (10 µM). The UV flash caused a rapid increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as indicated by the change in Fura-FF fluorescence ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In line with our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahieu et al., 2010</xref>), at low cytosolic calcium, icilin evokes a sizable current response, which is robustly potentiated of inward and outward currents in the presence of icilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). In contrast, currents recorded in the absence of ligand or in the presence of rapamycin were not directly affected by flash-induced calcium uncaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).

To address this, we performed in silico dockings with everolimus, a close structural analog of rapamycin, in which the hydroxyl group on the cyclohexene ring is substituted by a 2-hydroxyethyl moiety. These revealed that everolimus can bind in the same region of TRPM8 as rapamycin, albeit with reduced binding energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In particular, the docking indicated that substituting the hydroxyl group for the 2-hydroxyethyl moiety prevented the formation of a hydrogen bond with the amide of Q861 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). If everolimus can indeed occupy the rapamycin binding site on TRPM8, without strongly activating the channel, the prediction would be that everolimus reduces the effect of rapamycin by competing for the same binding site. This was indeed confirmed in calcium imaging experiments showing that preincubation with 10 µM everolimus, a concentration which by itself does not evoke a substantial calcium signal, significantly inhibited the response to 10 µM rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and E</xref>). In contrast, 10 µM everolimus was without any effect on the response to 50 µM menthol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that macrolide analogs such as everolimus compete with rapamycin for the same binding site but with strongly reduced potency to activate the channel. The lack of effect on channel activation by menthol further confirms that the rapamycin and menthol binding sites are spatially separate and independent.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study demonstrates that, in addition to its well-established inhibitory effect on the mTOR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Wiederrecht, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lamming et al., 2013</xref>), rapamycin acts as an agonist of the ion channel TRPM8. Several lines of evidence indicate that the agonistic effect of rapamycin involves a direct interaction with the channel, rather than an indirect effect involving intracellular signaling pathways such as mTOR. First, we found that rapamycin rapidly and reversibly activates TRPM8 currents, not only in the whole-cell mode but also in inside-out patches, indicating a membrane-limited mode of action. Second, we developed STTD NMR methodology, which not only allowed us to demonstrate a direct molecular interaction between rapamycin and TRPM8, but also to identify moieties on rapamycin that interact with the channel. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis steered by molecular docking of rapamycin onto TRPM8 revealed residues that strongly reduce channel activation by rapamycin, while leaving responses to other stimuli intact. Although we cannot exclude that some of these mutations may have an allosteric effect on rapamycin-induced channel gating, the cumulative results are consistent with a model where rapamycin binds in the groove between the voltage sensor-like domain and the pore domain, at a site distinct from the interaction sites of well-studied TRPM8 agonists menthol and icilin.</p><p>The effect of rapamycin on TRPM8 occurs at low micromolar concentrations, which contrasts to the low nanomolar concentrations required to inhibit mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Wiederrecht, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Varnai et al., 2006</xref>). Plasma concentrations of rapamycin in patients on systemic drug regimens following organ transplantation or for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis or cancer rarely exceed 100 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jimeno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trepanier et al., 1998</xref>), rendering it unlikely that substantial rapamycin-induced TRPM8 activation would occur in these subjects. However, rapamycin is also used topically for the treatment of skin diseases, with the use of creams or ointments containing millimolar concentrations of rapamycin. For instance, a 0.2% rapamycin gel (corresponding to approximately 2 mM) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of facial angiofibromas in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, and formulations up to 1% have shown efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies for this and other skin disorders, including psoriasis and oral lichen planus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aitken et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ormerod et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soria et al., 2009</xref>). Following such treatments, local rapamycin concentrations are likely to rise to high-enough levels for activation of TRPM8 in sensory nerve endings of the skin, which could potentially contribute to beneficial effects of the drug in certain skin conditions. Indeed, it is well established that activation of TRPM8 in sensory neurons has anti-inflammatory effects and causes relief of pain and itch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palkar et al., 2018</xref>). Further research is required to elucidate the extent of this contribution and its clinical implications.</p><p>In addition to rapamycin, we also tested a comprehensive set of related macrolide immunosuppressants for their effect on TRPM8. In line with earlier work, FK506 also robustly activates TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arcas et al., 2019</xref>), albeit with lower potency than rapamycin, whereas the other tested macrolides had only very modest effects. Overall, these findings indicate that the <italic>trans</italic>-2-methoxycyclohexan-1-ol moiety is crucial for activity at TRPM8. Indeed, substitutions at this site (as for instance in everolimus) almost fully abolish TRPM8-mediated responses, whereas activity is at least partially maintained in compounds where this moiety is retained but with altered macrolactam ring (as in FK506 or ascomycin). These findings indicate that the structural determinants for macrolide activation of TRPM8 differ from the determinants for immunosuppressant activity, which are critically determined by the macrolactam ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Zhou, 2020</xref>). Notably, we found that everolimus can inhibit activation of TRPM8 by rapamycin but not by menthol, indicating that it likely competes with rapamycin for the same binding site.</p><p>Overall, our data are consistent with a macrolide binding site on TRPM8, in the groove between voltage sensor-like domain and the pore domain, distinct from the interaction sites of cooling agents and known TRPM8 agonists menthol and icilin, but partially overlapping with the binding site of AITC. The existence of this binding site is also coherent with the finding of Acras et al. showing that TRPM8 sensitivity to FK506/tacrolimus is not affected by Y745H and N799A mutations which eradicate TRPM8 sensitivity to menthol and icilin, respectively. Notably, this groove is also involved in the binding of the antagonist NDNA in the closely related TRPM5 channel. Alignment of TRPM8 with other TRPM channels indicates that some of the key residues for rapamycin activation (D796 and D802) are conserved amongst other TRPM channels, whereas residue Q861 is unique for TRPM8 and G805 is only found in TRPM8 and TRPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huffer et al., 2020</xref>). Further studies may elucidate whether the introduction of these residues may transfer rapamycin sensitivity to other TRPM channels. Moreover, structural alignment indicates that the rapamycin binding site in TRPM8 is in a similar location as the vanilloid binding site in TRPV1, although sequence alignment reveals that the key residues involved in binding are not conserved between these more distally related channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>) The rapamycin binding site may provide a potential clue for the development of drugs that can selectively target TRPM8 for therapeutic purposes, without the side effects associated with other TRPM8 agonists. We acknowledge the limitations of our docking approach, which did not include the lipid bilayer and its interactions with the channel and ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hughes et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the integration of docking with experimental validation, such as NMR and detailed calcium imaging and electrophysiology on selected mutants, strengthens the validity of our model. Interestingly, rapamycin also directly activates TRPML1, although information on a possible interaction site on that distally related channel is currently lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). We note that none of the key residues involved in activation of TRPM8 by rapamycin are conserved in TRPML1. Moreover, the order of potency of rapamycin analogs differs substantially between TRPML1 and TRPM8. For instance, TRPML1 is potently activated by temsirolimus, whereas this compound is without agonistic effect at TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results also serve as a cautionary note for the use of rapamycin in chemical dimerization studies, a common approach in the study of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Varnai et al., 2006</xref>). To exclude a contribution of TRPM8 in such experiments, the use of rapalogs such as everolimus represents a likely safer alternative.</p><p>In conclusion, our study reveals a hitherto undiscovered pharmacological property of rapamycin, identifying it as a direct agonist of the TRPM8 ion channel. These findings provide new insights into ligand activation of TRPM8 and may have potential therapeutic implications in the topical use of rapamycin for the treatment of skin diseases.</p></sec><sec

A train of 50 ms Eburp1 (with B<sub>1</sub> field strength of 75 Hz) was employed for selective irradiation of protein <sup>1</sup>H resonances in a total of 3 s. The saturation of aliphatic and aromatic proton regions of TRPM8 was carried out in separate experiments by setting the irradiation (on-resonance) frequencies of –1.8 ppm and 8.8 ppm, respectively, at least 2 ppm away from the resonances of rapamycin to avoid any partial saturation of rapamycin <sup>1</sup>H resonances. Reference spectra were recorded by setting the irradiation frequency off-resonance at –40 ppm. A spin-lock filter of 20ms was applied to reduce the broad signals of the receptor and cell components in the resulting STD spectra. For each STD spectrum (the two on-resonance and one off-resonance), 640 number of scans was acquired in an interleaved fashion to average out any sample and/or spectrometer instability during the measurement, resulting in a total experiment time of 3 hr. All spectra were processed with Topspin version 4.0.5.</p><p>NMR samples: 25x10<sup>6</sup> HEK293T or HEK-M8 cells/sample were used. Cells were counted by a NovoCyte flow cytometer (Agilent Technologies), and the number of the functional TRPM8 channels was estimated as ca. 5000 channels/cell based on average whole cell currents and single channels conductance available in the literature. 5 μl of rapamycin was added from a 22 mM stock solution resulting in a final concentration of 0.2 mM in D<sub>2</sub>O PBS solution, providing ca. 4.8x10<sup>7</sup> fold excess of ligand to TRPM8 ion-channels for the STD NMR measurements. The final volume of each sample was 550 μl. NMR data was recorded in three replicates, and a total of 12 individual samples were used to compute three independent STTD spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Synthesis of trans-2-Methoxycyclohexan-1-ol</title><fig id="S1" position="anchor"><label>Scheme 1.</label><caption><title>Synthesis of trans-2-Methoxycyclohexan-1-ol.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97341-scheme1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Trans-2-Methoxycyclohexan-1-ol was synthesized based on the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winstein and Henderson, 1943</xref>.

The spacing of grid points was set to 1.0 Å and the whole target protein structure and the macrocyclic backbone of the ligand were kept rigid during dockings. 5000 dockings were performed with the above settings and the resultant rapamycin-TRPM8 complexes were clustered and ranked according to the corresponding binding free energies.</p><p>Internal flexibility of the rapamycin molecule was assessed through performing simulated annealing using the Gromacs 5.1.4 software package, the CHARMM36 force field, and the GB/SA continuum solvent model. The simulated annealing protocol consisted of 2-ps gradual heating from 50 K to 1050 K, 5-ps equilibration at 1050 K and 5-ps exponential cooling back to 50 K. This protocol was repeated 1000 times for both crystallographic models of rapamycin. The coordinates of the system were stored after each simulated annealing cycle, resulting in a 1000-member ensemble of low-energy structures for both initial rapamycin models. Representative conformations of rapamycin were identified by clustering of the 1000-membered pools, having the macrocycle backbone atoms compared with 1.0 Å RMSD cut-off. Middle structures of the ten most populated clusters, accounting for more than 90% of the total conformational ensemble generated by simulated annealing, were used for further docking studies. To refine initial docking results and to identify plausible binding sites, the above selected rapamycin structures were docked again to the protein target, following the same protocol as above, except for the grid spacing which was set to 0.375 Å in the second pass. The resultant rapamycin-TRPM8 complexes were, again, clustered and ranked according to the corresponding binding free energies. Selected binding poses were subjected to further refinement.</p><p>The three most populated and plausible binding poses were further refined by a third pass of docking, where amino acid side chains of TRPM8, identified in the previous pass to be in close contact with rapamycin (&lt;4 Å), were kept flexible. Grid volumes were reduced to these putative binding sites including all flexible amino acid side chains (21.0–26.2 Å x 26.2–31.5 Å x 24.8–29.2 Å). The spacing of grid points was maintained at 0.375 Å. Putative binding modes of rapamycin and TRPM8 were selected from the resultant low energy complexes on the basis of adherence to STTD-NMR data and the number of direct intermolecular contacts.</p><p>The initial dockings were further refined upon the publication of Cryo-EM structures of the mouse TRPM8 variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). The hTRPM8 protein sequence Q7Z2W7 was downloaded from the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) and template Cryo-EM structures of mTRPM8 cold receptor in apo state C1 (PDB ID: 8E4N) and apo state C0 (PDB ID: 8E4P) were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. The homology modeling was performed with the standard homology modeling protocol implemented in Yasara (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yasara.org">https://www.yasara.org</ext-link>). Homology model based on these cryo-EM structures was performed using Swiss model as well with GMQE = 0.71 and sequence identity = 93.74%. All the structures were repaired using the FoldX plugin in YASARA, where RepairPDB identifies those residues which have bad torsion angles, or VanderWaals' clashes, or total energy, and repairs them. Visualization of the molecules was also done with Yasara. Figures were drawn with the open source Pymol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.5.2 Schrödinger, LLC; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pymol.org">https://www.pymol.org</ext-link>). The global docking procedure was accomplished with Autodock VINA algorithms, implemented in Yasara, in which a total of 900 docking runs were set and clustered around the putative binding sites. The grid volumes and parameters were similar to those used for the third pass of docking, described above. The Yasara pH command was set to 7.0, to ensure that molecules preserved their pH dependency of bond orders and protonation patterns. The best binding energy complex in each cluster was stored, analyzed, and used to select the best orientation of the interacting partners. Using a similar docking strategy, we reproduced binding of menthol into the reported menthol binding site based on the cryo-EM structure of TRPM8 in complex with the menthol-analog WS-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yin et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Generation of hTRPM8 mutants</title><p>Based on the results of the in silico studies, mutations were introduced at strategic sites within the putative ligand-binding domains.

With electrophysiology and STTD-NMR, they confirmed the activation is through direct interaction with TRPM8. Using mutants and computational modeling, the authored localized the binding site to the groove between S4 and S5, different than the binding pocket of cooling agents such as menthol. The hydroxyl group on carbon 40 within the cyclohexane ring in rapamycin is indispensable for activation, while other rapalogs with its replacement, such as everolimus, still bind but cannot activate TRPM8.

It is very impressive to see that &quot;within&quot; a rapamycin molecule, the portion shared with everolimus is for &quot;binding&quot;, while the hydroxyl group in the cyclohexane ring is for activation. Such detailed dissection represents a successful trial in computational biology-facilitated, functional experiment-validated study of TRP channel structural-activity relationship.

Additionally, while the finding on TRPM8 is novel, it is worthwhile to perform more comprehensive pharmacological characterization, including single-channel recording and a few more mutant studies to offer further insight into the mechanism of rapamycin binding to S4~S5 pocket driving channel opening.

We changed panel C of Figure 2 in the main text and provided all the STD and the computed STDD and STTD spectra recorded on one set of experiments. We carried out additional experimental replicas on new samples and addressed the variability of cell samples by rescaling the STD effects based on reference <sup>1</sup>H measurements. We provided supplementary spectra of the reference experiments without saturation (Figure S5) and the obtained STTD spectra from the three parallel NMR sessions (Figure S6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• I appreciate the labels for STDD-1, STDD-2, and STTD on the lower two spectra of Figure 2C. Is the top spectrum from STD-1 or is it prior to saturation? In Figure 2C, what do the x1 and x2 notations on the right-hand side of the spectra indicate?</p></disp-quote><p>We showed the top spectrum as an overview and a demonstration of the spectral complexity of the samples. <sup>1</sup>H experiments were run before the STD measurements to assess the sample quality and stability. The demonstrated spectrum on sample 1 (TRPM8 with rapamycin in HEK cells) was recorded with more transients than the corresponding STDs, thus it is only visually comparable with the difference spectra after scaling (2x). Figure 2 was changed and all the spectra were replaced as mentioned before. All the recorded <sup>1</sup>H-experiments without saturation including the one removed are now available in the supplementary information (Figure S5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The STTD NMR results with WT TRPM8 are consistent with rapamycin binding directly to the channel. Testing whether rapamycin binding observed with STTD NMR is disrupted by one of the most compelling mutations (D796A, D802A, G805A, or Q861A) would be a further test of this direct interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and agree that testing the most compelling mutants would be a promising next step.

How many were used? &quot;most populated&quot; is unspecific.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We have added the following highlighted information to the methods section to address your comment:</p><p>“Representative conformations of rapamycin were identified by clustering of the 1000-membered pools, having the macrocycle backbone atoms compared with 1.0 Å RMSD cut-off. Middle structures of the ten most populated clusters, accounting for more than 90% of the total conformational ensemble generated by simulated annealing, were used for further docking studies. To refine initial docking results and to identify plausible binding sites, the above selected rapamycin structures were docked again, following the same protocol as above, except for the grid spacing which was set to 0.375 Å in the second pass. The resultant rapamycin-TRPM8 complexes were, again, clustered and ranked according to the corresponding binding free energies. Selected binding poses were subjected to further refinement. The three most populated and plausible binding poses were further refined by a third pass of docking, where amino acid side chains of TRPM8, identified in the previous pass to be in close contact with rapamycin (&lt; 4 Å), were kept flexible. Grid volumes were reduced to these putative binding sites including all flexible amino acid side chains (21.0-26.2 Å x 26.2-31.5 Å x 24.8-29.2 Å).”</p><p>However, it is important to clarify that the clusters are not built and their number is not specified by the user. The number of clusters found depends on how similar the structures are in the structural ensemble analyzed by clustering. A high number of clusters indicates a diverse, whereas a low number suggests a uniform structural ensemble. Furthermore, it is arbitrarily controlled by the similarity cutoff specified by the user. If the cutoff is selected well, then the number of structures is different in each cluster. There are some highly populated clusters and a few which only have one structure. The selection of how many cluster representatives are used is usually based on the decision of whether or not the sum of the population of selected clusters sufficiently covers the mapped conformational space.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Additionally, the rapamycin poses were generated using a continuum solvent model that is unlikely to replicate the conditions existing in the lipid bilayer or in a lipid-exposed binding pocket as is predicted here. It is therefore possible that the rapamycin poses chosen for docking do not represent the physiological rapamycin binding pose, hampering the ability of the docking algorithm to find an appropriate docking pocket.</p><p>• Furthermore, accurately docking that may bind to membrane-exposed pockets is a challenging problem, particularly because many scoring algorithms, including those employed by Autodock, do not distinguish between solvent-exposed and membrane-exposed faces of the protein. This affects the predicted binding energies.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful comments. We add a note in discussion part, mentioning these important limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In Figure 4, it appears that the proposed rapamycin binding pocket is located at the interface between two subunits, but only one is shown. Is there any contact with residues in the neighboring subunit? Based on Figure S4, I assume not, but am unsure.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the estimated distances, we do not think that there are any relevant interactions with residues from neighboring subunits.

A link to the file on Zenodo is now included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Please discuss the spatial location of the proposed rapamycin binding pocket relative to the vanilloid binding pocket in TRPV1.</p><p>• The mutagenesis indicates that D745, D802, G805, and Q861 are most important for rapamycin sensitivity in TRPM8. Interestingly, the proposed rapamycin binding pocket appears to overlap spatially with the vanilloid binding pocket in TRPV1. Consistent with this, Q861 aligns with E570 in TRPV1, which is a critical residue for resiniferatoxin sensitivity. Indeed, similar to Q861's modeled proximity to the cyclohexyl ring, the hydroxyl group of the vanillyl moity of capsaicin (4DY in 7LR0, for example) is in proximity to E750 in TRPV1. Additionally, searching PubChem by structural similarity suggests that vanillyl head group of the TRP channel modulators capsaicin and eugenol are similar structurally to the trans-2Methoxycyclohexan-1-ol ring. Without overlaying the two structures myself, it is difficult to say more than that, but I encourage the authors to comment on any similarities and differences they observe.</p><p>• If the proposed rapamycin pocket is indeed similar to the location of the vanilloid binding site, the authors may wish to discuss other TRPM channel structures that show ligands and lipids bound to this pocket because this provides evidence that this pocket influences TRPM channel function. For example, how does the proposed rapamycin binding pocket compare to TRPM8 bound to agonist AITC (PDBID 8e4l), TRPM5 bound to inhibitor NDNA (7mbv), and TRPM2 bound to phosphatidylcholine (6co7)?</p><p>• Other TRP channel structures with ligands or lipids modeled in this region include TRPV1 bound to resiniferatoxin, capsaicin, or phosphatidylinositol (7l2j, 7l24, 7l2s, 7l2t, 7l2u, 7lp9, 7lpc, 7lqy, 7mz6, 7mz9, 7mza); TRPV3 bound to phosphatidylcholine (7mij, 7mik, 7mim, 7min, 7ugg); TRPV5 bound to econazole (6b5v) or ZINC9155 (6pbf); TRPV6 bound to piperazine (7d2k, 7k4b, 7k4c, 7k4d, 7k4e, 7k4f) or cholesterol hemisuccinate (7s8c); TRPC6 bound to BTDM (7dxf) or phosphatidylcholine (6uza); and TRP1 bound to PIP2 (6pw5).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these valuable insights. We have included some additional discussion highlighting the similarities between the proposed rapamycin binding site and some of the other ligandchannel interactions in the TRP superfamily, in particular the well-known vanilloid binding site in TRPV1. However, to keep the discussion focused, we have not fully discussed all the indicated interactions, to best serve the clarity and scope of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I would like to see negative control calcium imaging and electrophysiology data with untransfected HEK cells to confirm that the observed activation is mediated by TRPM8 to parallel the TRPM8 KO sensory neuron experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>This important information is now included in the revised manuscript (Figure S2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The DM-nitrophen Ca uncaging experiments are an interesting method to test Ca sensitivity of rapamycin, but the results make these experiments more complex to interpret. Ca has been shown to be an obligate cofactor for icilin sensitivity in TRPM8 under conditions where both the internal and external Ca concentrations are tightly controlled (Kuhn et al., 2009, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M806651200">https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M806651200</ext-link>), which is necessary because TRPM8 allows Ca permeation through the pore when open. The large icilin-evoked currents in Figure 5A and 5B indicate that the effective intracellular calcium concentration is not zero prior to calcium uncaging, which may be high enough to mask any Ca-dependence of rapamycin that occurs at low Ca concentrations. Given this ambiguity, the inside-out patch clamp configuration would provide more control over the internal and external Ca concentration than is achieved in the Ca uncaging experiments. Because the authors have already demonstrated their ability to perform such experiments (Figure 2 panel B), it would be nice to see tests of Ca dependence using inside-out patch clamp.</p></disp-quote><p>As was already shown in Figure 2, Rapamycin activates TRPM8 in inside-out patches, and these experiments were performed using calcium-free cytosolic and extracellular solutions. Note that earlier studies have already shown that icilin activates outward TRPM8 currents in the full absence of calcium: see e.g. Janssens et al. eLife, 2016. Chuang et al. 2004. In the case of Icilin, increased calcium further potentiates the current, which is more prominent for the inward current.</p><p>In the Ca uncaging experiments, considering the Kd of DM-nitrophen of 5 nM, we expect that the intracellular calcium concentration before the UV flash would be approximately 15 nM. Taken together, both the inside-out experiments and the flash uncaging experiments confirm that rapamycin responses are not directly regulated by intracellular calcium, contrary to icilin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Sequence conservation within TRPM channels could be used in combination with the binding pocket model and mutagenesis to predict rapamycin selectivity for TRPM8 over other TRPMs. For example, some important residues, specifically G805 and Q861, are not conserved in TRPM3, which agrees with the lack of rapamycin sensitivity observed in TRPM3 (Figure S1). Further sequence comparison would provide testable hypotheses for future exploration of rapamycin sensitivity in other TRPMs that could validate the proposed binding pocket.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We now indicate in the discussion that only some of the key residues are conserved and make suggestions for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Please unify the color scheme across the figures to improve clarity.</p><p>• The authors frequently use the colors blue, red, and green to represent menthol and rapamycin in the figures, but they are inconsistent in which one represents menthol and which represents rapamycin.

For example, only the transmembrane helices should be depicted embedded in the membrane, not the whole protein including the intracellular domain.

(2019) suggests that the G805A mutation impacts icilin sensitivity by influencing the flexibility of the binding site and possibly affecting calcium binding.

The widely used WaterLOGSY NMR experiment (doi: 10.1023/a:1013302231549) saturates water molecules then the magnetization is transferred to the ligand of interest. Characteristic changes in ligand resonances are observed in the case of a binding event with proteins. On the other hand, the selective saturation of lipids is -while theoretically possible –technically challenging mainly because of the inherent low signal-dispersion of lipids and peak overlapping with ligand resonances. Additionally, lipid systems are more dynamic compared to proteins and ligand-lipid interactions could be weaker and less specific, significantly affecting the sensitivity of STD experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major:</p><p>• Is it feasible to test rapamycin on TRPM8 with single-channel recording? This will allow us to better probe the mechanism of rapamycin activation and compare it with menthol, with parameters of singlechannel conductance and maximal open probability.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience, it is very difficult to obtain single-channel recordings from TRPM8. The channel expresses at high densities, typically leading to patches contain multiple channels, making a proper analysis of mean open and closed times very difficult. Therefore, we have decided not to include such measurements in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors classified rapamycin as a type I agonist, the type that stabilizes the open conformation, same as menthol but more prominent. Does that indicate that rapamycin work synergistically (rather than independently) with menthol, because co-application of them can allow them to add to each other in stabilizing the open conformation? I wonder if the authors agree that this could be tested with experiments as in Figure S3, by showing a much more prolonged deactivation with co-application of menthol and rapamycin than applying each alone.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the insightful suggestion. We conducted co-application experiments, and our results show that the deactivation time is indeed significantly prolonged when both compounds are applied together compared to each alone. In fact, very little deactivation is seen when both compounds are co-applied, which made it virtually impossible to perform reliable fits to the deactivation time course for the Menthol+Rapamycin condition. Instead, we have now included summary results showing the percentage of deactivation after 100 ms. We included these findings in FigureS8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• It could be tested whether rapamycin activation of TRPM8 requires or overrides the requirement of PIP2 with inside-out patch by briefly exposing the patch to poly-lysine to sequester PIP2.</p></disp-quote><p>This is certainly a good suggestion for further follow-up studies. However, we considered that examination of the (potential) interaction between ligands and PIP2 was outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 1C suggests that the authors test rapamycin when there is a relatively high baseline TRPM8 activation (prior to rapamycin) activation. This raises the possibility that rapamycin is more a potentiator than an activator. I wonder if the following two experiments could address it: (1) perfuse rapamycin while holding at different membrane potentials, wash-off rapamycin in the solution and quickly (in a few seconds) test the activated current magnitude (before rapamycin dissociation), to compare whether a more depolarized membrane potential (high baseline open probability) allows rapamycin to potentiate more. (2) Perform the experiment at a higher temperature (low baseline open probability) and test whether rapamycin EC50 shifts to the right.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the thoughtful suggestion. Overall, we are not really in favor of making a distinction between a potentiator and an activator since it is not really feasible to create a situation where TRPM8 activity is zero. As suggested, we performed the dose response experiment at a higher temperature (37 °C) and observed that rapamycin’s EC<sub>50</sub> shifts to the right FigureS2. This is similar to what has been observed for menthol on TRPM8 and for many other ligands on other temperature-sensitive TRP channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>(1) The author should report hill coefficient together with EC50 when showing dose-responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Hill coefficients for all the fits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 1 (E, F), it might be clearer to use Venn-diagram to show whether there is overlapping among rapamycin-, menthol-, and cinnamaldehyde-responsive neurons.

Since several spectra need to be subtracted, the authors should present the raw data and the results of the subtractions step by step. Also, it seems that the height of the peaks in each spectra will be highly variable and thus a reliable criterion employed to scale spectra before subtraction. None of these problems are discussed of described.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, that the data transparency should be improved and due to the high molecular complexity of the samples the size of the STD effects should be carefully scaled. We carried out additional experimental replicas on new samples and addressed the inherent sample/peak height variability by rescaling the STD effects based on reference <sup>1</sup>H measurements. We provided supplementary spectra of the reference experiments without saturation (Figure S5) and the computed STTD spectra from three parallel NMR sessions (Figure S6). We changed panel C of Figure 2 in the main text and provided all the STD and the computed STDD and STTD spectra recorded on one set of NMR experiments. We added the following paragraph to the main text: “To address the effect of the inherent variability of cellular samples on peak heights, STD effects were normalized based on the comparison of independent <sup>1</sup>H experiments (Figure S5). Three STTD replicates were computed, unambiguously confirming direct binding to TRPM8 in two datasets (Figure S6 A,B)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Importantly since this signal subtraction method is proposed as a new development, control experiments employing well-established pairs of ligand and membrane protein receptor should be performed to demonstrate the reliability of the method.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, that the STTD experiment as a new development needs further validation, however, this paper is a preliminary demonstration of a new strategy building on the well-established STD and STDD NMR methodologies. Our group is actively engaged in studying additional biological samples to enhance our understanding of the applicability of STTD NMR. These efforts also aim to address challenges such as sample and spectral complexity by refining and standardizing the proposed workflow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The tail currents shown in supplementary figure 3 are clearly not monoexponential. The fit to a single exponential can be seen to be inadequate and thus the comparison of kinetics of control, rapamycin and menthol is incorrect. At least two exponentials should be fitted and their values compared.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the decay in the (combined) presence of agonists deviates from a simple monoexponential behavior. While we agree that fitting with two (or more) exponentials would provide a better fit, this also comes with greater variations/uncertainties in the fit parameters. This is particularly the case when inactivation is very slow and incomplete, or when the difference between slow and fast exponential time constants is &lt;5, as seen with rapamycin and rapamycin +menthol. Therefore, we decided to provide monoexponential time constants as a proxy to describe the clear slowing down of activation and deactivation time courses in the presence of Type I agonists.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also related to this aspect, recordings of TRPM8 currents can not be leak subtracted with a p/n protocol, thus a large fraction of the initial tail current must be the capacitive transient. There is no indication in the methods of how was this dealt with for the fitting of tail currents.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in the methods, capacitive transients and series resistance were maximally compensated. Therefore, we do not agree that a large fraction of the initial tail current must be capacitive. This can also be clearly seen in experiment such as Figure 1C, where the inward tail current is fully abolished in the presence of a TRPM8 antagonist. Likewise, very small and rapidly inactivating tail currents can be seen during voltage steps under control conditions (e.g. Figure S7 and S8 in the revised version).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The docking procedure employed, as the authors show, is not appropriate for membrane proteins since it does not include a lipid membrane. It is not clear in the methods section if the MD minimization described applies only to the rapamycin molecule or to rapamycin bound to TRPM8.</p><p>It is also not clear if the important residue Q861 (and other residues that are identified as interacting with rapamycin) were identified from dockings or proposed based on other evidence.</p><p>(4) Identifying amino acid residues that diminish the response to a ligand, does not uniquely imply that they form a binding site or even interact with said ligand. It is entirely possible that they can be involved in the allosteric networks involved in the activating conformational change. This caveat should be clearly posited by the authors when discussing their results.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we identified several residues that significantly reduce the response to rapamycin when mutated, while retaining robust responses to menthol, which indicates that these mutations do not affect crucial conformational changes leading to channel gating. While our cumulative data suggest that these residues may be involved in direct interaction with rapamycin, we recognize the alternative possibility that they allosterically affect rapamycin-induced channel gating. This is now clearly stated in the first paragraph of the discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
