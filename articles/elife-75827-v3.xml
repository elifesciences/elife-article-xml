retina is an ideal model system to study neuronal development and neural circuit formation. The retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the final and only output neurons in the vertebrate retina and their dendrites collect the electrical information concerning the visual signal from all other cells preceding them. One of the major focuses of research in the retina is to understand how RGC dendrite arborization arises during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prigge and Kay, 2018</xref>). Existing evidences supported that homotypic repulsion controls retinal dendrite patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefebvre et al., 2015</xref>). However, in mice which had most RGCs genetically eliminated, the dendrite size and shape of remaining RGCs appeared relatively normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the fact that the dendrites of remaining RGCs did not expand to neighboring areas by the remaining RGCs supports the existence of the intrinsic limit for RGC dendrite patterning, which cooperates with the homotypic repulsion to determine the dendrite size of RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefebvre et al., 2015</xref>). However, such intrinsic limiting mechanisms remain elusive.</p><p>Glaucoma is one of the leading causes for blindness. The major risk factors for glaucoma include increased intraocular tension. Studies have shown that glaucoma causes pathological changes in RGC dendrites before axon degeneration and soma loss were detected in different model animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morgan et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, elucidation of mechanisms governing RGC dendrite arbor maintenance bears clinical significance.</p><p><italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most widely distributed and extensively studied internal modification in mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nachtergaele and He, 2018</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A modification has been shown to regulate brain development and functions in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Livneh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2021a</xref>). By effectors, most of these studies have focused on its demethylases (âm<sup>6</sup>A erasersâ) and methyltransferases (âm<sup>6</sup>A writersâ). Since the fate of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts is decoded by the m<sup>6</sup>A-binding proteins (âm<sup>6</sup>A readersâ), how the readers mediate these functions and what are their neural target mRNAs remain to be elucidated. In addition, more precisely controlled spatial-temporal ablation of the m<sup>6</sup>A readers instead of null knockout is required to elucidate their functions and mechanisms in nervous system.</p><p>In this study, we identified an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent intrinsic limiting mechanism for RGC dendrite arborization and maintenance. Conditional knockout (cKO) of the m<sup>6</sup>A reader YTHDF2 in the developing mouse retina increases RGC dendrite branching and improves visual acuity. YTHDF2 also mediates acute ocular hypertension (AOH)-induced RGC degeneration, the experiment model for glaucoma, and <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO in the retina alleviates AOH-induced RGC dendrite shrinking and neuronal loss. The regulation of RGC dendrite development and maintenance by YTHDF2 is mediated by two distinct groups of m<sup>6</sup>A-modified target mRNAs which encode proteins that promote dendrite arborization during development and maintain dendrite tree during injury, respectively. Therefore, our study reveals mechanisms by which YTHDF2 restricts RGC dendrite development and maintenance, which sheds light on developing new treatment approaches for glaucomatous eyes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Knockdown of YTHDF2 leads to a robust increase of RGC dendrite branching</title><p>To examine whether m<sup>6</sup>A modification and its reader proteins play a role in the dendrite development, we utilized the retina as the model system. We first checked their expression patterns in the developing mouse retina. Immunostaining with a widely used m<sup>6</sup>A antibody demonstrated that RGCs had high m<sup>6</sup>A modification levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with the m<sup>6</sup>A distribution, the m<sup>6</sup>A reader YTHDF2 is highly expressed in RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Conversely, the expression of YTHDF2 in other layers and cells of the retina is much lower or absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B-D</xref>). Another two m<sup>6</sup>A readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 show similar expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E, F</xref>). The strong expression of YTHDFs and high level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in RGCs suggest that the m<sup>6</sup>A reader YTHDFs might play roles in RGC development. We dissected and dissociated the retinal cells and cultured in vitro. We generated lentiviral shRNAs against YTHDFs, which showed similarly efficient knockdown (KD) of YTHDFs in RGC cultures in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G,H</xref>). In these YTHDF-deficient RGC cultures, the first and most obvious phenotype that we observed is the robust increase of dendrite branching of cultured RGCs treated by sh<italic>Ythdf2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1I,J</xref>). In contrast, the dendrite branching of RGCs with YTHDF1 KD using sh<italic>Ythdf1</italic> was not significantly different from control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1K</xref>), while YTHDF3 KD using sh<italic>Ythdf3</italic> caused a slight (statistically significant in several Sholl radii) decrease of RGC dendrite branching compared with control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1L</xref>). These results suggest that the m<sup>6</sup>A reader YTHDF2 might play an important role in controlling dendrite branching of RGCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Knockdown (KD) of YTHDF2 leads to a robust increase of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrite branching.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal images showing high expression of YTHDF2 in RGCs (marked by RBPMS) in P0 retina.

Numerous extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms have been found to regulate dendritic arbor patterning, which involves both positive and negative factors to achieve balanced control of dendritic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jan and Jan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ledda and Paratcha, 2017</xref>). For the secreted and diffusible cues, BDNF promotes dendrite branching and complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung et al., 2007</xref>); the non-canonical Wnt7b/PCP pathway is a positive regulator of dendrite growth and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosso et al., 2005</xref>); the non-canonical Wnt receptor Ryk works as a negative regulator by limiting the extent of dendritic branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lanoue et al., 2017</xref>).

For the transcription factors, studies have shown that manipulation of Cux1 and Cux2 levels has distinct effects on apical and basal arbors of cortical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cubelos et al., 2015</xref>); interestingly, the functions of Sp4 in dendrite development are dependent on the cellular context of its expression, for example, Sp4 promotes dendrite growth and branching in hippocampal dentate granule cells but limits dendrite branching in cerebellar granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ramos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we identified another negative regulator YTHDF2 which works posttranscriptionally, and loss-of-function of YTHDF2 increased dendrite complexity during development and protected RGC degeneration from AOH. We have validated this effect on several RGC subtypes. Since there are dozens of RGC subtypes, it is technically challenging but still interesting to test whether this effect is universal to all subtypes or there is specificity for RGC subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Posttranscriptional regulation of dendrite development</title><p>It is well established that mRNAs can be transported and targeted to specific neuronal compartments such as axons and dendrites.

Primary antibodies such as chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Abcam ab13970), mouse anti-Brn3a (1:300, Millipore MAB1585), mouse anti-SMI-32 (1:200, BioLegend 801701), or rabbit anti-Melanopsin (1:1000, Thermo PA1-780), rabbit anti-CART (1:2000, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals H-003â62) were diluted in 5% normal goat serum, 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated overnight at 4Â°C. Then retinas were incubated with Alexa 488 donkey anti-chicken (1:500, Jackson 703-545-155), Alexa 488 donkey anti-mouse (1:500, Thermo A21202), Alexa 555 donkey anti-mouse (1:1000, Thermo A-31570) and Alexa 555 donkey anti-rabbit (1:1000, Thermo A31572) secondary antibodies in 5% normal goat serum (Novus), 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS and finally mounted with the VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI.</p><p>All images were captured on Nikon A1R confocal microscope or Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope with identical settings for each group in the same experiment. A region of interest, length or thickness in immunofluorescence experiments were obtained with ImageJ. The number of neurons in specific area was counted blindly and manually. To quantify RGC dendrite lamination in IPL with Thy1-GFP, z-stack and maximum projection were performed during the analysis. GFP intensity values across IPL depth were measured by ImageJ/Analyze/Plot Profile function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). To quantify the numbers of Bassoon<sup>+</sup>/PSD-95<sup>+</sup> excitatory synapses in IPL, the colocalization puncta was measured by ImageJ/Analyze/Puncta Analyzer as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ippolito and Eroglu, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sholl analysis</title><p>For confocal images of cultured RGCs, MAP2 signals in original format were analyzed with simple neurite tracer and then quantified with Sholl analysis (5 Î¼m per distance from soma center) which was a widely used method in neurobiology to quantify the complexity of dendritic arbors using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binley et al., 2014</xref>). Retina wholemount data were captured in z-stack mode (0.5â1 Î¼m per slide) with confocal microscopes. ZsGreen, eGFP, and SMI-32 signals were directly analyzed with simple neurite tracer and then z projection of all tracers was quantified with Sholl analysis (10 Î¼m per distance from soma center), while melanopsin signals were maximum-projected before tracing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>OMR assay</title><p><italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO and control mice aged about 6 weeks were dark-adapted overnight before experiment and used in the OMR assay following the previously reported protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Douglas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sergeeva et al., 2018</xref>). Using the Matlab program, 0.2 c/deg (15 s per direction of rotation) was first used for mice to adapt this experiment, and 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47, 0.5 and 0.55 c/deg (30 s per direction of rotation) were used in the following recordings.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.

Unfortunately, as you can read in the reviews, the reviewers had a number of concerns that would each require additional work in a longer time frame required by <italic>eLife</italic> for revision (and recognizing the additional downtime due to the COVID crisis). The concerns include:</p><p>â Better phenotyping of the Ythdf2 cKO mouse model, including cross sections of retina in addition to horizontal views to more precisely measure layer dimensions, synapse number and dendritic extension; whether cells other than RGCs are affected; co-localization of YTHDF2 and RGC markers. Moreover, the connection between the dendrite development phenotype and the neuroprotective role of YTHDF2 is not clear from your analyses.</p><p>â in vivo evidence for the putative targets of YTHDF2, rather than simply in vitro, a better understanding of how the products produced by these mRNAs â kalirin, Strn and Ubr4 â contribute to the increase in dendrite branching in the Ythdf2 knockout; the mechanism of YTHDF2 upregulation induced by AOH and loss of Brn3a+ RGCs thereof.</p><p>â The use of the optomotor response is not an apt measure function, especially in the absence of connecting the response to the classes of direction-selective RGCs which one would expect might interface with OMR responses.</p><p>â Ythdf2 effects in the acute ocular hypertension (AOH) model: Is this related to the downstream mRNAs, or some other more general effect of loss of this m6 reader? And how is this related to RGC survival at a mechanistic level (and thus the relation to glaucoma)?</p><p>We hope that you can use the reviewer's comments to amend your manuscript for submission elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors report a functional-relevant role of YTHDF2 in mouse retina ganglion cells (RGCs) to negatively regulate dendrite development and maintenance of RGCs. Mechanistically, Kalrn, Strn, and Ubr4 mRNAs are selectively recognized and decay through the YTHDF2-mediated pathway, the subsequent downregulation of proteins encoded by those mRNAs negatively regulate dendrite development and maintenance of RGCs.</p><p>This work highlights regulatory roles of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and YTHDF2 protein in retina and suggested YTHDF2 as one possible target in AOH-induced RGC loss. A few concerns will need to be addressed.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1. The authors showed YTHDF2 mRNA is upregulated by AOH and argued a loss of YTHDF2 in retina results in less severe AOH-induced loss of Brn3a+ RGCs. The mechanism of YTHDF2 upregulation induced by AOH and loss of Brn3a+ RGCs mediated by YTHDF2 upregulation are unclear. The first question might be harder to address but the second one is within the scope of this work.</p><p>2. In figure 7B, YTHDF2 expression in Brn3a+ RGCs was quantified. The figure showed that Brn3a was not detected in some cells. In figure 7C, mRNA level was quantified with an extraction method that did not separate Brn3a+ and Brn3a- cells.</p><p>3. The authors showed AOH-induced loss of Brn3a+ RGCs in mouse models. Supportive evidence at the phenotype level such as less severe loss of visual acuity in YTHDF2 cKO mice are required.</p><p>4. The authors showed knockdown of Kalrn, Strn, and Ubr4 are sufficient to impair dendrite growth. Rescue experiments will further back up their claim.</p><p>5. The authors suggested that m6A-YTHDF2 axis regulates the stability of Kalrn, Strn, and Ubr4 mRNAs. The authors will need to show these RNAs contain m6A by m6A-IP-qPCR. The effect on Kalrn, Strn, and Ubr4 mRNAs upon m6A writer complex knockdown can also be shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript investigates the role of the m6A reader YTHDF2 during retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrite development and branching. The data presented in this study shows that deletion of YTHDF2 in the retina led to increased RGC dendrite branching and improved visual acuity. Based on high throughput analysis, YTHDF2 is suggested to regulate dendrite branching by reducing the stability of kalirin, Strn and Ubr4 mRNAs. Lastly, loss of YTHDF2 is shown to prevent RGC loss in a glaucoma model. The experimental designs were presented clearly, and the results were interpreted with the appropriate statistical tests. However, the phenotype of the Ythdf2 cKO mouse model is not well characterized and there lacks in vivo evidence for the putative targets of YTHDF2. It is also difficult to explain the connection, if any, between the dendritic role of YTHDF2 and its neuroprotective function.</p><p>1. The authors used RGC cultures to show that knockdown/knockout of YTHDF2 resulted in increased the dendrite branching based on the number of interactions in Sholl analysis. However, to determine the full extent of dendritic defect, it is important to perform detailed analysis of the dendrite structure, including the total dendritic length, number of total segments, maximum branch length, branch order and number of branches.</p><p>2. It is suggested in the manuscript that loss of YTHDF2 in the retina only affects dendrite development of RGCs, but not other cell types. This is based on the simple counting of the number of RPCs at E15 and bipolar and amacrine cells at P15, glossing over the vast complexity of the visual circuitry in the retina. At the very least, the authors should confirm that differentiation of all major retinal neurons and proper formation of the ribbon synapses were unaffected in the cKO mouse model of YTHDF2, which would other confound the interpretation of the RGC and visual acuity phenotype.</p><p>3. The in vivo characterisation of RGC dendrite morphology should be more thorough as previously mentioned, including the arbor shape, size and tiling pattern. The image quality of Melanopsin and SMI-32 staining is low. There are too many cells labelled, making it difficult to examine individual cells/dendrites. Higher resolution images from more sparsely labelled retina would be needed.</p><p>4. The authors provide evidence of increased synaptic density in the IPL using PSD-95 staining in the cKO mice compared to the control litter mates. It is important to investigate if there are any changes to the synaptic density in the OPL. In addition, it is also important to study the number of successful synapse formation by co-staining the tissues with presynaptic markers such as bassoon with PSD-95 and count for co-localisation.</p><p>5. The improved visual acuity in Six3Cre-mediated Ythdf2 cKO is solely attributed to the RGC dendrite defects. However, Six3Cre is widely expressed in the ventral telencephalon and ventral anterior hypothalamus, including the SCN and SPZ (PMID: 24767996). It is necessary to examine the retinocollicular projections of the RGC axons.</p><p>6. The Optomotor response (OMR)-based assay is not the most appropriate test to test the response of ganglion cells since the improved OMR could be attributed to other cell types as previously mentioned. A more targeted approach such as pattern ERG could provide more evidence to their claims.</p><p>7. The quality of the RIP-seq analysis is not clear. Is there an isotype antibody control? Are there biological replicates? What is the statistical significance of the top hits? There are similar concerns regarding the MS analysis and whether there is significant overlap between the target lists generated from RIP-Seq and MS studies.</p><p>8. The authors provide evidence in the RGC culture that stabilisation of kalirin, Strn and Ubr4 mRNAs could contribute to the increase in dendrite branching in Ythdf2 knockout. The regulation of these genes by Ythdf2 need to be validated in Ythdf2 cKO retina at the level of mRNA by qRT-PCR and at the level of protein by western blot. Functionally, the authors need to investigate if knockdown or knockout of these genes in retina indeed affect dendrite branching or even rescue Ythdf2 cKO phenotype.</p><p>9. Finally, there is not clear connection between the dendrite development phenotype and the neuroprotective role of YTHDF2. The authors need to clarify the rationale behind these experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors propose a role for the m6A reader YTHDF2 in regulating the dendritic arbor size of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and they extrapolate this to address issues in glaucoma and overall retina IPL morphology. They find that retina-specific loss of Ythdf2 leads to the expansion of RGC dendritic arbors in the horizontal plane and also a widening of the inner plexiform layer (IPL), with Ythdf2 cKOs showing a modest increase in visual acuity in an optomotor assay. They identify a number of factors downstream of YTHDF2 not previously known to be involved in retinal dendritic development, and they propose a role for Ythdf2 in a glaucoma model, providing a foundation for future studies into their functions in these contexts.</p><p>Although these data are sufficient to establish a role for Ythdf2 in RGC dendritic development and other more general aspects of retina morphology, many of the authors' specific claims are weakened by issues with the experiments, their analyses, and by weak effect sizes. Even if the points raised below were addressed, it remains unclear from this study how Ythdf2-mediated mechanisms are integrated into programs of dendritic development and RGC survival, diminishing the impact of this work. This study would be strengthened by, for example, identifying a developmental program that modifies the target mRNAs found in this study to promote recognition by YTHDF2, and also by providing better understanding of how the products produced by these mRNAs actually regulate dendrite morphology and synapse formation. Overall, while there are a number of promising findings in this study, the work required to address weaknesses falls well outside of the limits usually recommended by <italic>eLife</italic>, and it is suited for publication in a more specialized journal following attention to many of the points raised below.</p><p>1. The cell-type specific tracing in Figure 3 is difficult to assess due to the extremely high background in the melanopsin images and unclear signal in the SMI-32 images. This analysis would be improved by sparse viral labeling, with a fluorophore provided by the virus used for tracing and the melanopsin &amp; SMI-32 antibodies used solely for establishing RGC subtype identity. Further, the authors emphasize that the defects they observe here are in the plane of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendritic arbors, but this is an over-interpretation of these data. One wonders why the authors did not examine in cross section the lamination within the IPL of the melanopsin-positive ipRGCs, since this would provide, at least for this RGC subclass, a direct assessment of this issue. Finally, the Thy-1-O line GFP distribution is quite general, and it really is not the correct line to use if one wants to investigate defects in lamination.</p><p>2. The authors repeatedly describe increased dendritic and synaptic density within the IPL in Ythdf2 cKOs, yet they only present absolute signal intensities to support these claims; without normalizing signal intensity to IPL width, it is impossible to determine whether changes in intensity are indeed due to increased density or from the IPL becoming enlarged with a similar density of dendrites and synapses. Further, they claim in the text that VGlut2 puncta numbers are changed in these mutants, however the analysis presented is only for general signal intensity. If claims are to be made regarding changes in synaptic specializations, higher resolution assessments of individual puncta using pre- and postsynaptic markers is required.</p><p>3. While Ythdf2 cKOs do show a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity (although for these male data it is unclear whether the control data distribution is sufficiently normal to use a t-test), the effect size is small enough to call into question how meaningful the improvement is. Further, what is the actual relationship between this modest improvement in optomotor response (OMR) and the morphological phenotypes observed here, in particular since they are not connected here to the classes of direction-selective RGCs one would expect might affect OMR responses.</p><p>4. Much clearer co-localization between YTHDF2 and RGC markers is needed, both in vivo and in vitro, to clearly demonstrate association with RGCs and not displaced amacrine cells or other retinal cell types.</p><p>5. The several mRNAs and their produces shown to be under YTHDF2 control do appear to play some role in regulating general RGC dendritic morphology, though of course from these data we do not know whether or not there is any RGC-subtype specificity. However, as presented, we really do not learn much at all about their mechanisms of action. At the very least, do they act in the same, or different, pathwaysâ¦.i.e. have any attempts been made to knock down more than one at a time and ask about independent pathway affiliations?</p><p>6. It is not clear how to interpret the Ythdf2 effects in the acute ocular hypertension (AOH) model. Is this related to the downstream mRNAs, or some other more general effect of loss of this m6 reader? And how is this related to RGC survival at a mechanistic level?</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The m<sup>6</sup>A reader YTHDF2 is a negative regulator for dendrite development and maintenance of retinal ganglion cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, the phenotype of the Ythdf2 cKO mouse model is not well characterized and there lacks in vivo evidence for the putative targets of YTHDF2. It is also difficult to explain the connection, if any, between the dendritic role of YTHDF2 and its neuroprotective function. Most importantly, whether Ythdf2 acts cell autonomously in the RGCs remains to be resolved.</p><p>1. The premise of this study is that Ythdf2 is cell autonomously required in RGCs for dendritic development. In the rebuttal letter, the authors even went as far as claiming that &quot;all RGCs express YTHDF2 and all YTHDF2-expressing cells in retina are RGCs&quot;. However, this statement is belied by the strong YTHDF2 staining outside the RGC layers in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B. The YTHDF2 expression in non-RGC cells can also be seen in Figure 1A, although for unknown reason the staining intensity was weaker. In fact, numerous RNAseq studies have now thoroughly catalogued gene expression patterns in the retina throughout development and YTHDF2 expression can be found among all retinal cell types even from the earliest scRNAseq data (Macosko et al., 2015, Cell 161, 1202). The ubiquitous expression of YTHDF2 in the retina poses serious concerns regarding the usefulness of Six3-Cre mediated Ythdf2 cKO model and the validity of presumed Ythdf2 downstream targets in RGCs.</p><p>2. The revised manuscript presents data to show that retinal progenitors, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, photoreceptors, or horizontal cells were not affected in Ythdf2 cKO retina. It is also important for the authors to examine MÃ¼ller glia and astrocyte, especially the latter which is known to have a strong influence on RGC activity and health.</p><p>3. The potential targets of YTHDF2 were mostly characterized in the RGC culture, which is not a good model for studying dendritic development because RGCs will evitable die in vitro. As previously requested by this reviewer, the authors need to perform either qPCR or western blos of Ythdf2 cKO retina to confirm the regulation of Kalirin, Strn and Ubr4 by Ythdf2. They also need to show whether siRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout of these genes rescue the Ythdf2 cKO phenotype in vivo.</p><p>4. The authors propose that the better maintenance of RGC dendrite arborization in Ythdf2 cKO retina make it resistant to RGC death in AOH model and this is mediated by Hspa12a and Islr2 genes. To support this claim, the authors need to show that overexpression of Hspa12a and Islr2 alleviates loss of RGCs in the AOH model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have responded to my comments and suggestions with several new experiments and some additional explanations. Though the effects of YTHDF2 described here are pleiotropic across RGC cell types, these defects in dendritic arborization are better described in this revised manuscript. In addition, further attention to the mRNAs regulated by YTHDF2 is given, and though we still are far from a mechanistic understanding of how these gene products regulate RGC dendritic arborization, and whether or not there is any specificity of these effects with regard to RGC subtypes, I find this revision to be a substantial improvement over the initial submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed my comments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75827.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Mechanistically, Kalrn, Strn, and Ubr4 mRNAs are selectively recognized and decay through the YTHDF2-mediated pathway, the subsequent downregulation of proteins encoded by those mRNAs negatively regulate dendrite development and maintenance of RGCs.</p><p>This work highlights regulatory roles of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and YTHDF2 protein in retina and suggested YTHDF2 as one possible target in AOH-induced RGC loss. A few concerns will need to be addressed.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1. The authors showed YTHDF2 mRNA is upregulated by AOH and argued a loss of YTHDF2 in retina results in less severe AOH-induced loss of Brn3a+ RGCs. The mechanism of YTHDF2 upregulation induced by AOH and loss of Brn3a+ RGCs mediated by YTHDF2 upregulation are unclear. The first question might be harder to address but the second one is within the scope of this work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the mechanism of YTHDF2 upregulation induced by AOH is beyond the scope of this work, which may require further investigation as a future direction.</p><p>As for the mechanism of loss of Brn3a<sup>+</sup> RGCs mediated by YTHDF2 upregulation in AOH-treated retina, we tried to answer this question by expanding the scope of our study in the revised manuscript. We wanted to know whether YTHDF2 target mRNAs mediate these effects in the AOH models. AOH has been shown to cause pathological changes in RGC dendrites before axon degeneration or soma loss is detected in different model animals (Morgan et al., 2006; Shou et al., 2003; Weber et al., 1998), suggesting that RGC soma loss might be following dendrite degeneration. So we tested whether YTHDF2 upregulation mediates RGC dendrite degeneration in AOH-treated retina. We found that two target mRNAs <italic>Hspa12a</italic> and <italic>Islr2</italic> show upregulation in the adult <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina compared with control (<italic>Figure 8âfigure supplement 1C</italic>). We further found that <italic>Hspa12a</italic> and <italic>Islr2</italic> are downregulated in the retina after AOH operation (<italic>Figure 8âfigure supplement 1E</italic>), which is likely caused by upregulation of YTHDF2 in the AOH-treated retina (<italic>Figure 8âfigure supplement 1F-H</italic>). We therefore hypothesized that AOH upregulates YTHDF2 which in turn downregulates its targets <italic>Hspa12a</italic> and <italic>Islr2</italic>, thus causing RGC dendrite degeneration and soma loss.</p><p>If this is the case, overexpression of <italic>Hspa12a</italic> and <italic>Islr2</italic> might protect RGC dendrite from AOH triggered degeneration. We thus generated AAV harboring overexpression constructs of <italic>Hspa12a</italic> and <italic>Islr2</italic> which were intravitreally injected to wild type retinas. After the AOH induction, the retinas overexpressing <italic>Hspa12a</italic> and <italic>Islr2</italic> maintain significantly more complex RGC dendrite arbor compared with control AAV (<italic>Figure 8E,F</italic>).</p><p>These data support a model that AOH upregulates YTHDF2 which in turn downregulates its targets <italic>Hspa12a</italic> and <italic>Islr2</italic>, thus causing RGC dendrite degeneration and eventually resulting in soma loss</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In figure 7B, YTHDF2 expression in Brn3a+ RGCs was quantified. The figure showed that Brn3a was not detected in some cells. In figure 7C, mRNA level was quantified with an extraction method that did not separate Brn3a+ and Brn3a- cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this. Brn3a is a major RGC marker but does not stain all RGCs. We also used the pan-RGC marker RBPMS. As shown ion <italic>Figure 1A</italic>, all RGCS marked by the pan-RGC marker RBPMS express YTHDF2 while all YTHDF2-expressing cells are RBPMS<sup>+</sup> RGCs. These data suggest that all RGCs express YTHDF2 and all YTHDF2-expressing cells in retina are RGCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors showed AOH-induced loss of Brn3a+ RGCs in mouse models. Supportive evidence at the phenotype level such as less severe loss of visual acuity in YTHDF2 cKO mice are required.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have tried to do the OMR assay using the AOH model mice. Unfortunately, the AOH model mice are not eligible for the OMR assay to test their visual acuity. However, we did find that the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina with AOH operation maintains significantly higher dendrite complexity compared with the glaucomatous eyes of <italic>Ythdf2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> control mice (<italic>Figure 8A,B</italic>). In addition, the reduction of RGC number in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina with AOH operation is less than control retina with AOH operation (<italic>Figure 8C,D</italic>). These results support that <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO protects retina from RGC dendrite degeneration and soma loss caused by AOH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors showed knockdown of Kalrn, Strn, and Ubr4 are sufficient to impair dendrite growth. Rescue experiments will further back up their claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now further performed rescue experiments to examine whether these target mRNAs mediate YTHDF2-regulated RGC dendrite branching. As shown in <italic>Figure 2E-H</italic> and <italic>Figure 3</italic>, cKO of <italic>Ythdf2</italic> led to increased dendrite branching of RGCs both in vitro and in vivo. Transfection of siRNAs against these target mRNAs rescued dendrite branching increases in cultured <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO RGCs (<italic>Figure 7C</italic>). We continued to generate and performed intravitreal injection of AAV viral <italic>shKalrn12</italic> and <italic>shUbr4</italic>, which significantly rescued dendrite branching increases of CART<sup>+</sup> ooDSGCs and SMI-32<sup>+</sup> Î±RGCs in <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina in vivo (<italic>Figure 7D</italic>).

The authors suggested that m6A-YTHDF2 axis regulates the stability of Kalrn, Strn, and Ubr4 mRNAs. The authors will need to show these RNAs contain m6A by m6A-IP-qPCR.

We now verified the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of these mRNAs by m6A-IP-qPCR (<italic>Figure 6D</italic>).

The data presented in this study shows that deletion of YTHDF2 in the retina led to increased RGC dendrite branching and improved visual acuity. Based on high throughput analysis, YTHDF2 is suggested to regulate dendrite branching by reducing the stability of kalirin, Strn and Ubr4 mRNAs. Lastly, loss of YTHDF2 is shown to prevent RGC loss in a glaucoma model. The experimental designs were presented clearly, and the results were interpreted with the appropriate statistical tests. However, the phenotype of the Ythdf2 cKO mouse model is not well characterized and there lacks in vivo evidence for the putative targets of YTHDF2. It is also difficult to explain the connection, if any, between the dendritic role of YTHDF2 and its neuroprotective function.</p><p>1. The authors used RGC cultures to show that knockdown/knockout of YTHDF2 resulted in increased the dendrite branching based on the number of interactions in Sholl analysis. However, to determine the full extent of dendritic defect, it is important to perform detailed analysis of the dendrite structure, including the total dendritic length, number of total segments, maximum branch length, branch order and number of branches.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We have now performed more detailed analysis of the dendrite structure of cultured RGCs after KD of YTHDF2. As shown in <italic>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G,H</italic>, the total dendrite length showed significant increase after YTHDF2 while the length of maximum branch was not changed.</p><p>We further focused on the physiological dendrite structures by checking the RGC dendrites in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina in vivo. As shown in <italic>Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-E</italic>, the total dendrite length, number of branches, number of total segments, and number of segments in each branch order of melanopsin<sup>+</sup> RGCs in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina showed significant increases compared with control retina, while the length of maximum branch was not changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is suggested in the manuscript that loss of YTHDF2 in the retina only affects dendrite development of RGCs, but not other cell types. This is based on the simple counting of the number of RPCs at E15 and bipolar and amacrine cells at P15, glossing over the vast complexity of the visual circuitry in the retina. At the very least, the authors should confirm that differentiation of all major retinal neurons and proper formation of the ribbon synapses were unaffected in the cKO mouse model of YTHDF2, which would other confound the interpretation of the RGC and visual acuity phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Retinal progenitors, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, photoreceptors, or horizontal cells were not affected in <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina (<italic>Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B-L</italic>), suggesting that YTHDF2 is not involved in the generation or development of these cells. This is in line with the low YTHDF2 expression in these cells. The RGC number or density was not affected in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina (<italic>Figure 2C,D</italic>), indicating that <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO does not disturb RGC neurogenesis. These data suggest that differentiation of all major retinal neurons was unaffected in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO mouse model.</p><p>In addition, the numbers of the excitatory ribbon synapses marked by the colocalization of Bassoon<sup>+</sup>/PSD-95<sup>+</sup> in OPL show no difference between <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO and control retinas (<italic>Figure 4â figure supplement 1E,F</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The in vivo characterisation of RGC dendrite morphology should be more thorough as previously mentioned, including the arbor shape, size and tiling pattern. The image quality of Melanopsin and SMI-32 staining is low. There are too many cells labelled, making it difficult to examine individual cells/dendrites. Higher resolution images from more sparsely labelled retina would be needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We now have repeated and chosen better representative images for melanopsin and SMI-32 staining of RGC dendrites in vivo in the revised manuscript (<italic>Figure 3C,E</italic>). As mentioned earlier, we performed more detailed analysis of the RGC dendrite structures in vivo. As shown in <italic>Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-E</italic>, the total dendrite length, number of branches, number of total segments, and number of segments in each branch order of melanopsin<sup>+</sup> RGCs in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina showed significant increases compared with control retina, while the length of maximum branch was not changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors provide evidence of increased synaptic density in the IPL using PSD-95 staining in the cKO mice compared to the control litter mates. It is important to investigate if there are any changes to the synaptic density in the OPL. In addition, it is also important to study the number of successful synapse formation by co-staining the tissues with presynaptic markers such as bassoon with PSD-95 and count for co-localisation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We now used co-staining of the presynaptic marker Bassoon and the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 to count the colocalization puncta of Bassoon<sup>+</sup>/PSD95<sup>+</sup>. We found that the numbers of Bassoon<sup>+</sup>/PSD-95<sup>+</sup> excitatory synapses in IPL of <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina are significantly larger than that of control retina (<italic>Figure 4D,E</italic>). As a control, the numbers of the excitatory ribbon synapses marked by the colocalization of Bassoon<sup>+</sup>/PSD-95<sup>+</sup> in OPL show no difference between <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO and control retinas (<italic>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E,F</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The improved visual acuity in Six3Cre-mediated Ythdf2 cKO is solely attributed to the RGC dendrite defects. However, Six3Cre is widely expressed in the ventral telencephalon and ventral anterior hypothalamus, including the SCN and SPZ (PMID: 24767996). It is necessary to examine the retinocollicular projections of the RGC axons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We checked the targeting of optic nerves to the brain by anterograde labeling with cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) and found no difference of retinogeniculate or retinocollicular projections between <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO and control mice (<italic>Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F,G</italic>), suggesting the guidance and central targeting of RGC axons are not affected in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The Optomotor response (OMR)-based assay is not the most appropriate test to test the response of ganglion cells since the improved OMR could be attributed to other cell types as previously mentioned.

However, based on the analysis we have done so far, we believe that the improved OMR is most likely attributed to the increased RGC dendrite branching and thicker and denser IPL with more synapses because all other parts and processes of retina are not affected except RGC dendrite in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO mediated by <italic>Six3-cre:</italic></p><p>(1) As mentioned earlier, the neurogenesis of all major neuron types in retina is not affected by <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO in retina (<italic>Figure 2C,D</italic>; <italic>Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B-L</italic>).</p><p>(2) The increases of RGC dendrite branching in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina were validated both in vitro and in vivo (<italic>Figure 2E-H</italic>; <italic>Figure 3</italic>).</p><p>(3)IPL thickness significantly increased in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina (<italic>Figure 4A,B</italic>).

The quality of the RIP-seq analysis is not clear. Is there an isotype antibody control? Are there biological replicates? What is the statistical significance of the top hits?

For the RIP experiment: Yes, we used a control IgG and performed two biological replicates. To determine which gene is enriched, we computed the FPKM from RIP elute to input and any fold change greater than 2 (p value less than 0.05) was considered enriched. For MS analysis, we performed three biological replicates, and proteins with fold changes greater than 1.3 and p values less than 0.05 were considered to be regulated by YTHDF2 KD with statistical significance. By overlapping the two gene lists screened from anti-YTHDF2 RIP-Seq (<italic>Supplementary file 1</italic>) and YTHDF2 KD/MS_upregulation (<italic>Supplementary file 2</italic>), we identified a group of potential YTHDF2 target mRNAs in RGCs (<italic>Supplementary file 3</italic>).</p><p>As a summary, we now have added these information to the Materials and methods, and a new <italic>Supplementary file 3</italic> in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors provide evidence in the RGC culture that stabilisation of kalirin, Strn and Ubr4 mRNAs could contribute to the increase in dendrite branching in Ythdf2 knockout. The regulation of these genes by Ythdf2 need to be validated in Ythdf2 cKO retina at the level of mRNA by qRT-PCR and at the level of protein by western blot. Functionally, the authors need to investigate if knockdown or knockout of these genes in retina indeed affect dendrite branching or even rescue Ythdf2 cKO phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in <italic>Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</italic>, the mRNA levels of <italic>Kalrn7</italic>, <italic>Kalrn9</italic>, <italic>Kalrn12</italic>, <italic>Strn</italic> and <italic>Ubr4</italic> were dramatically increased after KD of YTHDF2 by qRT-PCR. We further verified this by directly measuring the stability of these target mRNAs. As shown in <italic>Figure 7A</italic>, all the target mRNAs showed significantly increased stability in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina compared with controls. These results suggest that YTHDF2 controls the levels of its m<sup>6</sup>A-modifed target mRNAs by decreasing their stability.</p><p>MS analysis after YTHDF2 KD has shown that the protein levels of these target mRNAs were upregulated (<italic>Supplementary file 2</italic>). For validation, we performed IF using antibodies against Strn and Ubr4 (unfortunately we could not find any convincing Abs against Kalrns after many attempts) and detected specific signals in the IPL which were increased in <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina compared with control retina (<italic>Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</italic>), suggesting that Strn and Ubr4 are upregulated in Ythdf2 cKO retina at the level of protein.</p><p>We continued to explore the functions of these YTHDF2 target mRNAs in RGC dendrite development. We first generated siRNAs against these transcripts (<italic>Figure 7âfigure supplement 1E</italic>).

As shown in <italic>Figure 7B</italic>, KD of <italic>Kalrn7</italic>, <italic>Kalrn9</italic>, <italic>Kalrn12</italic>, <italic>Strn</italic> or <italic>Ubr4</italic> led to significant decreases of RGC dendrite branching. We further examined whether these target mRNAs mediate YTHDF2regulated RGC dendrite branching. As shown in <italic>Figure 2E-H</italic>, and <italic>Figure 3</italic>, cKO of <italic>Ythdf2</italic> led to increased dendrite branching of RGCs both in vitro and in vivo.

Finally, there is not clear connection between the dendrite development phenotype and the neuroprotective role of YTHDF2. The authors need to clarify the rationale behind these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this. To answer this question, we now have expanded the scope of our study in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The pathological changes in RGC dendrites precede axon degeneration or soma loss in the glaucomatous eyes of different model animals (Morgan et al., 2006; Shou et al., 2003; Weber et al., 1998).

They find that retina-specific loss of Ythdf2 leads to the expansion of RGC dendritic arbors in the horizontal plane and also a widening of the inner plexiform layer (IPL), with Ythdf2 cKOs showing a modest increase in visual acuity in an optomotor assay. They identify a number of factors downstream of YTHDF2 not previously known to be involved in retinal dendritic development, and they propose a role for Ythdf2 in a glaucoma model, providing a foundation for future studies into their functions in these contexts.</p><p>Although these data are sufficient to establish a role for Ythdf2 in RGC dendritic development and other more general aspects of retina morphology, many of the authors' specific claims are weakened by issues with the experiments, their analyses, and by weak effect sizes. Even if the points raised below were addressed, it remains unclear from this study how Ythdf2-mediated mechanisms are integrated into programs of dendritic development and RGC survival, diminishing the impact of this work. This study would be strengthened by, for example, identifying a developmental program that modifies the target mRNAs found in this study to promote recognition by YTHDF2, and also by providing better understanding of how the products produced by these mRNAs actually regulate dendrite morphology and synapse formation. Overall, while there are a number of promising findings in this study, the work required to address weaknesses falls well outside of the limits usually recommended by eLife, and it is suited for publication in a more specialized journal following attention to many of the points raised below.</p><p>1. The cell-type specific tracing in Figure 3 is difficult to assess due to the extremely high background in the melanopsin images and unclear signal in the SMI-32 images. This analysis would be improved by sparse viral labeling, with a fluorophore provided by the virus used for tracing and the melanopsin &amp; SMI-32 antibodies used solely for establishing RGC subtype identity. Further, the authors emphasize that the defects they observe here are in the plane of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendritic arbors, but this is an over-interpretation of these data. One wonders why the authors did not examine in cross section the lamination within the IPL of the melanopsin-positive ipRGCs, since this would provide, at least for this RGC subclass, a direct assessment of this issue. Finally, the Thy-1-O line GFP distribution is quite general, and it really is not the correct line to use if one wants to investigate defects in lamination.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this.

The authors repeatedly describe increased dendritic and synaptic density within the IPL in Ythdf2 cKOs, yet they only present absolute signal intensities to support these claims; without normalizing signal intensity to IPL width, it is impossible to determine whether changes in intensity are indeed due to increased density or from the IPL becoming enlarged with a similar density of dendrites and synapses. Further, they claim in the text that VGlut2 puncta numbers are changed in these mutants, however the analysis presented is only for general signal intensity. If claims are to be made regarding changes in synaptic specializations, higher resolution assessments of individual puncta using pre- and postsynaptic markers is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry that the information about increased dendritic and synaptic density within the IPL in <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO was not clear. The MAP2 IF intensity shown in <italic>Figure 4C</italic> was already normalized to the IPL area.

The ON-OFF directionally selective RGCs (ooDSGCs) respond preferentially to movement in particular directions. Expression of CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript), a neuropeptide, distinguishes ooDSGCs from other RGCs (Kay et al., 2011). We now found that the dendrite branching of ooDSGCs marked by CART/Brn3a co-staining in <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retinal cultures increased compared with control in vitro (<italic>Figure 2G,H</italic>). Intravitreal injection of an AAV reporter expressing ZsGreen visualized the dendrite morphology of ooDSGCs marked by CART immunostaining in vivo (<italic>Figure 3A</italic>). We found that ooDSGCs showed dramatically increased dendrite branching in <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina compared with control retina (<italic>Figure 3A,B</italic>). Thus, <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO increased the dendrite branching of ooDSGCs both in vitro and in vivo, along with other data in this study supporting the improved optomotor response in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The several mRNAs and their produces shown to be under YTHDF2 control do appear to play some role in regulating general RGC dendritic morphology, though of course from these data we do not know whether or not there is any RGC-subtype specificity. However, as presented, we really do not learn much at all about their mechanisms of action. At the very least, do they act in the same, or different, pathwaysâ¦.i.e. have any attempts been made to knock down more than one at a time and ask about independent pathway affiliations?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.

These results suggest that these targets may work in different pathways to regulate the RGC dendrite morphology.

It is not clear how to interpret the Ythdf2 effects in the acute ocular hypertension (AOH) model. Is this related to the downstream mRNAs, or some other more general effect of loss of this m6 reader?

To answer this question, we now have expanded the scope of our study in the revised manuscript. We found that two YTHDF2 target mRNAs <italic>Hspa12a</italic> and <italic>Islr2</italic> show upregulation in the adult <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina compared with control (<italic>Figure 8âfigure supplement 1C</italic>).

We have now done a better phenotyping of the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO mouse model by more precisely measuring the layer dimensions (<italic>Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A-D</italic>), the synapse number (<italic>Figure 4D,E</italic>), the dendritic extension (<italic>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G,H</italic>; <italic>Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-E</italic>); checking cells other than RGCs in retina (<italic>Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B-L</italic>); confirming colocalization of YTHDF2 and RGC markers (<italic>Figure 1A</italic>). We also explained the connection between the dendrite development phenotype and the neuroprotective role of YTHDF2 (please see our response to Reviewer #2âs major comment 9 for details).</p><p>2. We have now provided in vivo evidence to show that the YTHDF2 target mRNAs <italic>Kalirin</italic>, <italic>Strn</italic> and <italic>Ubr4</italic> indeed contribute to the increase in dendrite branching in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> knockout. We generated and performed intravitreal injection of AAV viral <italic>shKalrn12</italic> and <italic>shUbr4</italic>, which significantly rescued dendrite branching increases of CART<sup>+</sup> ooDSGCs and SMI-32<sup>+</sup> Î±RGCs in <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina in vivo (<italic>Figure 7D</italic>). These data suggest that these target mRNAs mediate YTHDF2-controlled RGC dendrite branching.

Though the expression of YTHDF2 could be detected by scRNAseq in other retinal cell types in a previous report as the reviewer mentioned, their YTHDF2 expression levels are much lower than RGCs. More importantly, consistent with the minimal or no expression of YTHDF2 in other retinal layers/cells, all other retinal layers/cells except IPL are not affected in the <italic>Ythdf2</italic> cKO retina (<italic>Figure 2âfigure supplement 1; Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, the phenotype of the Ythdf2 cKO mouse model is not well characterized and there lacks in vivo evidence for the putative targets of YTHDF2. It is also difficult to explain the connection, if any, between the dendritic role of YTHDF2 and its neuroprotective function. Most importantly, whether Ythdf2 acts cell autonomously in the RGCs remains to be resolved.</p><p>1. The premise of this study is that Ythdf2 is cell autonomously required in RGCs for dendritic development. In the rebuttal letter, the authors even went as far as claiming that &quot;all RGCs express YTHDF2 and all YTHDF2-expressing cells in retina are RGCs&quot;. However, this statement is belied by the strong YTHDF2 staining outside the RGC layers in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B. The YTHDF2 expression in non-RGC cells can also be seen in Figure 1A, although for unknown reason the staining intensity was weaker. In fact, numerous RNAseq studies have now thoroughly catalogued gene expression patterns in the retina throughout development and YTHDF2 expression can be found among all retinal cell types even from the earliest scRNAseq data (Macosko et al., 2015, Cell 161, 1202). The ubiquitous expression of YTHDF2 in the retina poses serious concerns regarding the usefulness of Six3-Cre mediated Ythdf2 cKO model and the validity of presumed Ythdf2 downstream targets in RGCs.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed in the response to reviewer 1âs point 1 summarized by the editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The revised manuscript presents data to show that retinal progenitors, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, photoreceptors, or horizontal cells were not affected in Ythdf2 cKO retina.

The potential targets of YTHDF2 were mostly characterized in the RGC culture, which is not a good model for studying dendritic development because RGCs will evitable die in vitro. As previously requested by this reviewer, the authors need to perform either qPCR or western blos of Ythdf2 cKO retina to confirm the regulation of Kalirin, Strn and Ubr4 by Ythdf2. They also need to show whether siRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout of these genes rescue the Ythdf2 cKO phenotype in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed in the response to the editorâs emphasized item (1).

The authors propose that the better maintenance of RGC dendrite arborization in Ythdf2 cKO retina make it resistant to RGC death in AOH model and this is mediated by Hspa12a and Islr2 genes.

In addition, further attention to the mRNAs regulated by YTHDF2 is given, and though we still are far from a mechanistic understanding of how these gene products regulate RGC dendritic arborization, and whether or not there is any specificity of these effects with regard to RGC subtypes, I find this revision to be a substantial improvement over the initial submission.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these important future directions.
