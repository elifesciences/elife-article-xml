should express costly traits at a magnitude that optimizes the trait bearer’s cost-benefit difference. Trait expression varies across a species because costs and benefits vary among individuals. For example, if large individuals pay lower costs than small individuals, then larger individuals should reach optimal cost-benefit differences at greater trait magnitudes. Using the cavitation-shooting weapons found in the big claws of male and female snapping shrimp, we test whether size- and sex-dependent expenditures explain scaling and sex differences in weapon size. We found that males and females from three snapping shrimp species (Alpheus heterochaelis, Alpheus angulosus, and Alpheus estuariensis) show patterns consistent with tradeoffs between weapon and abdomen size. For male A. heterochaelis, the species for which we had the greatest statistical power, smaller individuals showed steeper tradeoffs. Our extensive dataset in A. heterochaelis also included data about pairing, breeding season, and egg clutch size. Therefore, we could test for reproductive tradeoffs and benefits in this species. Female A. heterochaelis exhibited tradeoffs between weapon size and egg count, average egg volume, and total egg mass volume. For average egg volume, smaller females exhibited steeper tradeoffs. Furthermore, in males but not females, large weapons were positively correlated with the probability of being paired and the relative size of their pair mates. In conclusion, we identified size-dependent tradeoffs that could underlie reliable scaling of costly traits. Furthermore, weapons are especially beneficial to males and burdensome to females, which could explain why males have larger weapons than females.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>From deer antlers to crab claws, weapons are some of the most elaborate and enormous structures in the animal kingdom.

The ‘handicap principle’ proposes that the cost of bearing a weapon dictates the variation in weapon size.

Larger weapons can better deter or damage competitors, and more intense ornaments can better attract mates. By first approximation, one might expect that all individuals should express these traits to arbitrarily high magnitudes because greater expression yields fitness benefits. However, fitness costs and physical limitations ensure that traits are expressed honestly instead of arbitrarily (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Searcy and Nowicki, 2005</xref>). Despite decades of research, the costs that maintain reliable scaling relationships remain hotly debated.</p><p>One hypothesis called the handicap principle suggests that sexual traits are costly, and these costs ensure that trait expression is not arbitrary. Costly traits lower fitness by reducing survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kotiaho et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moller and de Lope, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mappes et al., 1996</xref>) or reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cavender et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joseph et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moczek and Nijhout, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Somjee et al., 2018</xref>). Individuals should therefore express traits at a level that maximizes their benefits relative to their unit of cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grafen, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grafen, 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nur and Hasson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zahavi, 1977</xref>). For example, the handicap principle posits that sexually selected traits scale with quality because low-quality individuals pay more for, or benefit less from, costly traits compared to high-quality individuals. These differential costs set the optimal trait expression at a lower value for lower-quality individuals compared to higher-quality ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grafen, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grafen, 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nur and Hasson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zahavi, 1977</xref>). Even though this is a widely accepted explanation for the honest scaling of sexual traits, empirical evidence is scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kotiaho, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Penn and Számadó, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition to scaling relationships, costly traits can also differ depending on sex and season. For example, some secondary sexual traits are expressed in both sexes but at greater magnitudes in males than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heuring and Hughes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nolazco et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, costly traits might be expressed more intensely during the breeding season compared to the nonbreeding season, such as the annual shedding and regeneration of deer antlers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brockes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clements et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Price et al., 2005</xref>). Snapping shrimp offer a particularly tractable system with which to test these classic questions about scaling, sex, and seasonality in the expression of costly traits.</p><p>Snapping shrimp live in size-assortative male-female pairs. Both males and females in the pair defend territory, maintain shelter, and forage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mathews, 2002a</xref>). Size-matched pairs form via intraspecific contests and intersexual mate choice, but the exact dynamics of pair formation differ depending on the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heuring and Hughes, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rahman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rahman et al., 2004</xref>). The eggs in a female’s clutch are sired predominantly by the male in the size-matched pair; in other words, extra-pair paternity is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathews, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, egg clutch size is a function of female body length, while all reproductively active males can fertilize even the most bountiful of egg clutches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knowlton, 1980</xref>). Female snapping shrimp are only reproductively receptive for several hours after each molt, which occurs once every 16–20 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Govind et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knowlton, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathews, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rahman et al., 2003</xref>). Meanwhile, males are not limited to this molt-related breeding cycle. The estimated longevity for snapping shrimp ranges from 13 to 16 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa-Souza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mossolin et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Individuals of both sexes bear one enlarged claw that they use as weapon during fights with same-sex conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nolan and Salmon, 1970</xref>). They assess weapons as visual signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hughes, 1996</xref>) and use them as armament to injure or damage opponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dinh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinh and Patek, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kingston et al., 2022</xref>). Snapping shrimp use latch-mediated spring actuation to produce powerful strikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Longo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Longo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Patek and Longo, 2018</xref>). They cock their claws open and use muscles to load an elastic mechanism comprised of the flexing exoskeleton and stretching apodemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Longo et al., 2023</xref>). They unlatch the claw to quickly release elastic energy, driving the dactyl shut in as little time as 0.36 milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinh and Patek, 2023</xref>). Upon closure, a tooth-shaped protrusion in the dactyl inserts into a cavity in the propodus, which generates a high-velocity water jet that vaporizes the trailing region of water. This vapor bubble, known as a cavitation bubble, collapses and produces pressures that are audible to the human ear as a ‘snap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lohse et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Versluis et al., 2000</xref>). Snapping shrimp fire snaps at opponents during contests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dinh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinh and Patek, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nolan and Salmon, 1970</xref>). The pressure of the cavitation bubble collapse can cause neurotrauma to the opponent, so snapping shrimp have evolved shock-absorbing helmets called orbital hoods to dampen the blows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kingston et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Individuals with larger weapons produce longer-lasting cavitation bubbles, greater pressures, and have greater offensive capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinh and Patek, 2023</xref>). They also tend to win contests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dinh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinh and Patek, 2023</xref>). Yet, snapping shrimp do not grow weapons to arbitrary sizes. Instead, they vary along three axes: (1) larger individuals have larger weapons, (2) at any given body size, males have larger weapons than females, and (3) the sex difference amplifies during the summer breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heuring and Hughes, 2019</xref>). Therefore, the costs and benefits of weapon size can be examined across these three axes: body size, sex, and breeding season.</p><p>We test if snapping shrimp face tradeoffs that scale with the condition as predicted by the handicap principle. Then, we test the hypothesis that sex and seasonal differences in weaponry arise from sex-specific costs and benefits in alpheid snapping shrimp. We did not measure fitness and, therefore, refrain from using the term ‘costs’ when referring to our data. Instead, we use the term expenditure to represent tradeoffs that could cascade to fitness costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kotiaho, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Morphology</title><p>To identify weapon expenditures that vary with size as predicted by the handicap principle, we tested if snapping shrimp individuals bearing large weapons sacrificed resources from the abdomen (the muscular segmented region of the body used for swimming) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnott et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunyadi et al., 2020</xref>). Reduced abdomen size could lower fitness through reduced survival, given that abdomen length is positively correlated with predator escape velocity in other benthic decapod crustaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunyadi et al., 2020</xref>). Snapping shrimp with smaller abdomens could therefore be more vulnerable to predation. Furthermore, female snapping shrimp hold eggs underneath their abdomen, and reduced abdomen size could constrain maximum egg clutch volume. Thus, we tested whether snapping claws exhibit a morphological tradeoff with abdomen size, and whether this expenditure increases as body size decreases.</p><p>The allometric slope of snapping claw scaling differed significantly between sexes for <italic>Alpheus heterochaelis</italic> and <italic>Alpheus angulosus</italic> but not for <italic>Alpheus estuariensis</italic> (the species for which we had the smallest sample size) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Because individuals differ in the costs they pay and the benefits they reap, trait expression varies in systematic and predictable ways across the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grafen, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grafen, 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nur and Hasson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zahavi, 1977</xref>). We found empirical evidence for size-dependent expenditures that could explain reliable scaling of trait expression: The smallest snapping shrimp exhibited the steepest morphological and reproductive tradeoffs. Moreover, we applied the same logic — that costs and benefits differ between individuals and lead to different optimal trait expressions — to explain sex differences in weaponry. Large weaponry is especially burdensome to females which suffer reproductive tradeoffs. Meanwhile, large weaponry benefits males by increasing the probability of being paired and the relative rostrum-to-telson length of their pair mate. These sex-specific implications of weapon investment on reproduction and pairing are vital to fitness because female egg production is the primary determinant of fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knowlton, 1980</xref>). Males can boost fitness by pairing with larger females, and females sacrifice fitness by reducing investment into eggs. These sex-specific tradeoffs and benefits can therefore explain why females have smaller proportional weapon sizes compared to males, why this sex difference amplifies during the breeding season, and why female weapon scaling slopes become more shallow during the breeding season when egg production and pairing are at a premium.</p><p>For both males and females, individuals with larger weapons had smaller abdomens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This was true in all three species of snapping shrimp that we tested. Similar resource allocation tradeoffs between body parts have been shown in other species. For example, several species of dung beetles face tradeoffs between their horns and nearby morphologies such as their eyes, wings, and antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emlen, 2001</xref>), and reindeer face tradeoffs between antler length and body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Melnycky et al., 2013</xref>). Critically, in our study, we moved beyond simply identifying a tradeoff and demonstrated that different individuals experience tradeoffs to different extents. Specifically, in male <italic>Alpheus heterochaelis</italic>, smaller males exhibited a steeper tradeoff than larger males, indicating a size-dependent expenditure of weaponry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The proportion of the claw made of muscle decreases as the weapon residual increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinh, 2022</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether weapon residuals were negatively correlated with average angular velocity in the snapping claw, cavitation bubble duration, and snap pressure. We expected weapon residuals to affect these metrics because in other crustaceans, weapon residuals and muscle mass affect weapon function. For example, in some fiddler crabs, regenerated claws never fully recover the muscle mass of the original ones and have reduced pinching force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lailvaux et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, in the same species of fiddler crabs, as weapon residuals increase, pinching force does, too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lailvaux et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, in our analysis of snapping shrimp, weapon residuals were not correlated with any of the measured snap parameters.</p><p>The expenditures and benefits of growing a large weapon also differed by sex. For ovigerous <italic>A. heterochaelis</italic> females, greater weapon size led to lower egg counts, smaller average egg volume, and lower egg clutch volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In males, tradeoffs between primary reproductive traits and weapons are widespread. For example, male horned scarab beetles (<italic>Onthophagus spp</italic>.) experience tradeoffs between their horns and genitalia, and this tradeoff are most pronounced just as larvae are about to enter their prepupal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moczek and Nijhout, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simmons and Emlen, 2006</xref>). Similar tradeoffs arise in other insects like coreids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Somjee et al., 2018</xref>). These tradeoffs are evident in phylogenetic comparative analyses. Across horned scarab beetle species, for example, those with more positively allometric horn slopes have more negatively allometric testes slopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simmons and Emlen, 2006</xref>). Similarly, cetacean species that invest more in sexually dimorphic traits (e.g. narwhal tusks) invest less in testes mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dines et al., 2015</xref>), howler monkeys that have greater hyoid volume have smaller testes mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunn et al., 2015</xref>), and dobsonflies that have enlarged mandibular weapons invest less into nuptial gifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Although weapon-reproduction tradeoffs are commonly identified across taxa, the existing studies rarely identify analogous tradeoffs in females, and they rarely, if ever, test for size- or condition-dependence of tradeoffs. Our findings that female snapping shrimp face weapon-reproduction tradeoffs and those reproductive expenditures were size-dependent provide valuable nuances to the existing literature.</p><p>In addition, we showed that male <italic>A. heterochaelis</italic> benefited by investing in weaponry through pairing, whereas females did not. In males, weapon residuals were positively correlated with the probability of being paired and the relative body length of their pair mates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Females did not exhibit either of these benefits. Male-specific benefits could, therefore, contribute to sex differences in weapon investment.</p><p>Egg production is particularly salient to female snapping shrimp because they bear the entire energetic burden of egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knowlton, 1980</xref>). Likewise, there is an incentive for males to pair with large and fecund females. Therefore, growing a large weapon is particularly burdensome to females and particularly beneficial for males. These reproductive expenditures and benefits could therefore explain why males have larger proportional weapon sizes than females.</p><p>The sex-specific expenditures and benefits are also consistent with seasonal oscillations in weaponry. <italic>A. heterochaelis</italic> males had greater weapon residuals during the breeding season compared to the non-breeding season, whereas female weapon residuals remained consistent throughout the year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, the scaling slope of the snapping claw became more shallow during the breeding season for females. By contrast, males did not show a significant seasonal change in scaling slope, but across the range of body sizes, snapping claw lengths increased during the breeding season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Concurrently, males had significantly lower abdomen residuals during the breeding season, whereas females exhibited a parallel but marginally nonsignificant decrease in abdomen residuals. Similar trends have been reported in <italic>A. angulosus</italic>, although in that species, females significantly reduce proportional abdomen sizes during the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heuring and Hughes, 2019</xref>). We speculate that males shift investment from their abdomens into weapons during the breeding season because it increases their likelihood of being paired. Female snapping shrimp shift investment from abdomens to eggs, and they do not increase weapon size because they face tradeoffs between eggs and weapons.</p><p>Female weapon-egg tradeoffs are analogous to classic examples of male weapon-testes tradeoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simmons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simmons and Emlen, 2006</xref>). Still, female analogs of this phenomenon are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). Most likely, the dearth of findings is simply due to insufficient studies of female weaponry. Sex biases in research, such as the misconception that only males fight and only females choose, are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haines et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pollo and Kasumovic, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tang-Martínez, 2016</xref>). For example, it is now accepted that female birdsong is widespread, but for centuries, historical research focused almost entirely on males that were presumed to be the only sex to compete for mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Odom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Odom and Benedict, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Riebel et al., 2019</xref>). Like birdsong, female secondary sexual traits, weapons, and competition are not uncommon, and they often serve signaling functions just as they do in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amundsen and Forsgren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeBas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nolazco et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nordeide, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Watson and Simmons, 2010</xref>). Sex-inclusive research on the costs and benefits of these traits would not only redress long-standing omissions from the scientific literature, but comparisons between males and females would also provide empirical tools to understand how costs and benefits govern trait expression within a single species.</p><p>In snapping shrimp, large weaponry could have fitness benefits. For example, individuals of both sexes use weapons during contests over mates and territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dinh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinh and Patek, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nolan and Salmon, 1970</xref>). Larger weapons produce greater pressure and, therefore, increase offensive capacity during contests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinh and Patek, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, male snapping shrimp with large weapons independent of body size use elevated levels of visual weapon displays, and that seems to affect rival assessment during contests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes, 2000</xref>). It is also possible that large weaponry could be preferred in mate choice, although that has not been established firmly. In <italic>A. angulosus</italic>, females show a marginally non-significant preference for males with large claws independent of body size during the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heuring and Hughes, 2020</xref>). Meanwhile, females prefer larger males in <italic>A. heterochaelis</italic>, although experiments have not tested whether weapon size independent of body size affects mate choice in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rahman et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, large weaponry could also help snapping shrimp defend themselves against heterospecific intruders and predators. For example, the snapping shrimp <italic>Alpheus armatus</italic> defends its host anemone from fireworm predation using snaps, which can kill intruders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCammon and Brooks, 2014</xref>). Anecdotal evidence suggests a similar symbiotic relationship between nest-defending <italic>A. heterochaelis</italic> mud crabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Layman et al., 2003</xref>). If larger weapons are better equipped to fend off predators, then large weaponry could also boost fitness by preventing predation.</p><p>Ideally, we would be able to link each of the expenditures and benefits we identified here to a fitness cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kotiaho, 2001</xref>). There have been two systems where such a condition-dependent fitness cost has been demonstrated: in the substrate-borne signaling of wolf spiders (<italic>Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata</italic>) and in the ornamented tail feathers of barn swallows (<italic>Hirundo rustica</italic>). In wolf spiders, individuals that are fed high-quantity diets maintain steady body mass and drum at greater rates compared to those fed a low-rationed diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kotiaho, 2000</xref>). Females prefer to mate with males that drum at higher rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kotiaho et al., 1996</xref>). However, drumming is energetically demanding and, sometimes, lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kotiaho, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mappes et al., 1996</xref>). Males fed high-volume diets are better able to sustain and survive these costs compared to males on low-volume diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kotiaho, 2000</xref>).</p><p>In barn swallows, females prefer to mate with males that have long marginal tail feathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Møller, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Møller, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Møller, 1992</xref>). However, long tail feathers hinder the aerodynamics of flight: Individuals with experimentally lengthened tail feathers catch smaller, lower-quality dipteran prey and are more likely to die. Meanwhile, those with experimentally shortened tail feathers catch larger, higher quality dipteran prey and were more likely to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moller and de Lope, 1994</xref>). Individuals with naturally long tail feathers were best able to cope with experimental tail elongation, whereas those with naturally short tail feathers reaped the greatest survival boost from tail shortening, suggesting that the cost of ornamented tail feathers disproportionately burdens males with naturally short tail feathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moller and de Lope, 1994</xref>).</p><p>It is not feasible to quantify such fitness costs in natural observations of snapping shrimp. They are prolific breeders, cryptic, and difficult to mark and recapture because they molt each month. The egg production tradeoffs are as close to a direct fitness cost as we could identify. Morphological tradeoffs, on the other hand, are more distant from fitness costs. However, it is a reasonable possibility that abdomen tradeoffs impact survival. For example, the primary mode of predator escape in many decapod crustaceans is the tailflip, during which individuals contract their abdomen to propel themselves backward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wiersma, 1947</xref>). Tailflip velocity and acceleration in crayfish increase with abdomen length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunyadi et al., 2020</xref>). If the same holds in snapping shrimp, then the abdomen tradeoff that we found here could influence survival. However, future work is required to reach a definitive answer.</p><p>Some expenditures we documented did not differ with size; however, the overall fitness cost might still be size-dependent. For example, smaller females did not exhibit a weapon size tradeoff with the total number of eggs they produced. Even though the scaling slopes were invariant across the size range, small individuals might suffer a greater relative reduction in eggs and therefore a greater reduction in relative fitness. For example, reducing a 100-egg clutch by 10 would incur a 10% decrease, but reducing a 200-egg clutch by 10 would incur a 5%decrease. Compared to large and fecund individuals, then, smaller individuals might suffer a greater reduction in relative fitness than larger individuals despite a similar absolute tradeoff in egg production.</p><p>Critically, our findings rely entirely on observational data, and therefore, we cannot infer causation. In other taxa, it is possible to experimentally manipulate weapons to prevent them from developing. In beetles, for example, researchers can ablate imaginal disklike tissue in larvae before they form into horns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moczek and Nijhout, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simmons and Emlen, 2006</xref>), and in coreid insects, researchers can induce permanent autotomy of hind-leg weapons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joseph et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Somjee et al., 2018</xref>). However, permanent manipulation of weaponry is not as straightforward in snapping shrimp as it is in terminally molting insects. Snapping shrimp molt every 16–20 days, and after autotomy, they regenerate their weapons over a series of molts. Specifically, snapping shrimp regenerate a new non-snapping claw at the site of autotomy and transform the contralateral claw into a snapping claw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Govind et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pereira et al., 2014</xref>). It is not clear how weapon expenditures would change during regeneration; one might expect some expenditures, like maintenance, could decrease with a smaller, recovering claw, but other expenditures, like growth, could increase as the weapon grows and transforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bywater et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinh, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pereira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Read and Govind, 1991</xref>). Interestingly, in rare cases, wild-caught snapping shrimp can bear two snapping claws. This unusual arrangement can be permanently induced in the lab by removing the dactyl from a claw as it is transforming from a non-snapping claw to a snapping claw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Read and Govind, 1997</xref>). In future experiments, it would be interesting to test if this manipulation decreases investment into traits like abdomens and egg production.</p><p>Our methods also could not account for the genetic background of individuals, which could influence their weapon investment. Future experiments could use a siblings-based approach to control for these factors. Prior research has relied on breeding experiments, for example, to identify weapon-testes tradeoffs in horned scarab beetles (<italic>O. taurus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moczek and Nijhout, 2004</xref>) and to test the effects of diet on weapon development in the dung beetle <italic>Onthophagus acuminatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emlen, 1997</xref>). Indeed, it is possible to rear field-collected snapping shrimp eggs in captivity, though we have not been successful at inducing mating in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrison and Patek, 2023</xref>). In the future, it would be interesting to use a siblings-based design with the experimental manipulations described above to test experimentally for resource allocation tradeoffs.</p><p>Despite the challenges of observational inference, the statistical approach of testing for residual-based tradeoffs pinpoints patterns that are consistent with resource allocation tradeoffs. The morphologies implicated in these trends are valuable candidates for future experiments as described above. Furthermore, the robust datasets that we are able to collect from field observations allowed us to test for size-dependence of these tradeoffs — a critical assumption of the handicap principle that has largely been omitted from such experiments. Future research could apply the statistical framework we lay out here to test for size dependence in tradeoffs in lab-based experiments as well.</p><p>Empirical evidence of fitness costs is elusive because fitness manifests from a mosaic of subtle expenditures. Some of these expenditures, like reproduction, are obviously correlated to fitness, while others might have subtle yet meaningful effects. There is likely a smorgasbord of expenditures that we did not test for here, some of which are undetectable in purely observational work. For example, in other crustaceans, weapons hinder locomotion and reduce survival during predator escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunyadi et al., 2020</xref>). These expenditures need to be identified through future experiments. Other expenditures might not be tractable through morphology, but through social interactions. In the paper wasp <italic>Polistes dominulus</italic>, for example, body size is correlated with pigment deposition in facial masks. Poor-condition wasps with facemasks manipulated to appear formidable experienced social costs via conspecific aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tibbetts and Dale, 2004</xref>). The observational work we present here is a starting point to identify the fitness consequences of large weaponry. We encourage observations of behavior in naturalistic conditions and experiments that manipulate sexual traits to paint the entire mosaic of fitness-relevant expenditures of weaponry.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The handicap principle suggests that individuals are plastic in their ability to signal at different levels, and they signal at the level that optimizes their cost-benefit difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grafen, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grafen, 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nur and Hasson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zahavi, 1977</xref>).

We showed through field observations that size-dependent expenditures can ensure signal reliability through morphological and reproductive tradeoffs. Furthermore, we co-opted the same logic of differential costs and benefits to show that large weapons are particularly beneficial to males and particularly burdensome to females.

We collected <italic>A. angulosus</italic> during one trip in March 2019. We found snapping shrimp in oyster reefs at low tide by flipping oyster clusters and excavating several centimeters of mud. We located individuals through turbid waters by scanning for antennae sweeping the water surface. We designated two shrimp as a male-female pair if they occupied the same tidepool underneath an oyster clump, and we acquired pairing data for 486 <italic>Alpheus heterochaelis</italic> individuals. We also noted whether individuals were caught during the breeding season. We considered breeding season as a binary variable. If any female was found holding eggs, then the collection date was considered the breeding season. The breeding season occurred between April and October, and no eggs were found during February and March collections. The months of breeding resemble those seen in <italic>A. angulosus</italic> populations in Charleston, South Carolina, USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heuring and Hughes, 2019</xref>). Temperatures in nearby waters were colder during the non-breeding season, fluctuating between 8 and 14°C, whereas breeding season temperatures fluctuated between 18–30°C (NOAA Station 8656483, Beaufort, Duke Marine Lab, North Carolina, USA).</p><p>For all three species, we measured each individual’s carapace length, abdomen length, rostrum-to-telson length, and snapping claw length using digital calipers (resolution +/−0.02 mm, Husky Tools, Atlanta, Georgia, USA) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Figure 1, 2). We built log-log scaling relationships for snapping claws, and abdomen length as a function of rostrum-to-telson length, sex, and their interaction. Abdomen length and carapace length both contribute to rostrum-to-telson length, but we used each of the three metrics in separate analyses because the existing literature indicates that each metric predicts different biologically relevant functions. For example, carapace length is the best-known predictor of resource-holding potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dinh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinh and Patek, 2023</xref>), abdomen length in other benthic decapods predicts predator escape velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunyadi et al., 2020</xref>), and rostrum-to-telson length predicts egg production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knowlton, 1980</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using, R version 4.1.1, RStudio version 1.4.1717, and the tidyverse suite of R packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">RStudioTeam, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Morphological tradeoffs</title><p>For each species, we hypothesized that growing a larger snapping claw would coincide with reduced abdomen size. We tested this relationship by calculating the residuals from the log-log abdomen and snapping claw scaling relationships defined above, where positive residuals indicate a larger abdomen or snapping claw than predicted by the scaling relationship. To test for a morphological tradeoff, we built regressions using abdomen residuals as the response variable and snapping claw residuals, sex, and their interaction as the explanatory variables. We repeated this analysis for <italic>A. heterochaelis</italic>, <italic>A. angulosus</italic>, and <italic>A. estuariensis</italic>.</p><p>Then, we tested whether the slopes of the tradeoff depended on quality. Here and throughout the rest of the paper, we used carapace length as a measure of quality because it is the best-known proxy for resource-holding potential and a reliable predictor of dominance and subordinance in dyadic contests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dinh et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that the slope of the tradeoff would increase as carapace length decreased. To test this, we standardized carapace length so that the mean was zero and each increment of one represents an increase of one standard deviation. We built a regression with abdomen residual as the response variable and snapping claw residual, standardized carapace length, and their interaction as the explanatory variable. We performed this analysis only for <italic>A. heterochaelis</italic>, the species for which we had the greatest sample size and statistical power. We predicted a negative coefficient for the interaction, meaning that the tradeoff slope would approach zero as the carapace length increased.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Kinematics</title><p>We reanalyzed data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinh, 2022</xref> to test if exaggerated weapons reduced weapon performance in <italic>A. heterochaelis</italic>. We recorded high-speed videos with synchronous pressure measurements from 10 snaps each in 76 individuals. We measured the average angular velocity, cavitation bubble duration, and peak-to-peak sound pressure level of each snap. Details about recording setup, equipment, and performance metrics are provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinh, 2022</xref>. In brief, we calculated average angular velocity as the angle change between the dactyl and the propodus during closure divided by the duration of closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kagaya and Patek, 2016</xref>). Then, we calculated cavitation bubble duration as the duration between the initiation of cavitation to the onset of initial bubble implosion. Finally, we calculated the peak-to-peak sound pressure level coincident with the cavitation bubble collapse.</p><p>In previous research, we showed that average angular velocity decreased as claw mass increased, whereas cavitation bubble duration and sound pressure level increased as claw mass increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinh and Patek, 2023</xref>). Here, we tested if these relationships also depended on weapon residuals. We built three linear models that used either log<sub>10</sub>(average angular velocity), log<sub>10</sub>(bubble duration), or sound pressure level (a logarithmic measure of pressure) as the response variable. In each model, we used log<sub>10</sub>(claw mass) and weapon residual as explanatory variables. We built separate models for males and females. For each performance metric, we hypothesized that performance would decrease with high-residual snapping claws, and we, therefore, predicted a negative coefficient for snapping claw residuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Reproductive tradeoffs</title><p>We collected 37 ovigerous <italic>A. heterochaelis</italic> females. We removed each egg clutch and photographed them. We only included eggs in the early stage of development when the egg yolk was barely consumed and oblong deformation by the embryo was minimal. We counted the total number of eggs in each egg clutch and measured the estimated average egg volume using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ (version 2.0.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). For each egg clutch, we measured the egg volume for 20 randomly selected eggs as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> , where V<sub>egg</sub> represents egg volume, d<sub>min</sub> represents the minimum egg diameter, and d<sub>max</sub> represents the maximum egg diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuris, 1990</xref>). We then calculated the average egg volume as the mean volume of these 20 eggs. Finally, we calculated the total egg mass volume as the egg count multiplied by the average egg volume.</p><p>Egg count and egg mass volume increased as carapace length increased. Therefore, we regressed egg count and egg mass volume against carapace length and calculated egg count residuals and egg mass volume residuals from the scaling relationship. These residuals reflect investment into eggs, where more positive residuals indicate greater investment and more negative residuals indicate less investment. We did not use residual analysis for average egg volume because it did not scale with carapace length. To test for reproductive tradeoffs between eggs and weapons, we built three linear regressions that used either egg count residual, average egg volume, or egg mass volume residual as the response variable. All models included snapping claw residual as the sole explanatory variable. We predicted a negative relationship that reflected a reproductive tradeoff.</p><p>Then, to test if female snapping shrimp with smaller carapace lengths faced steeper tradeoffs, we added carapace length and its interaction with snapping claw residual to each of the models. If smaller individuals pay steeper expenditures, then the interaction should be positive: The negative relationship between egg properties and snapping claw residuals would taper to zero as carapace length increases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Pairing</title><p>We used <italic>t</italic>-tests to determine if paired individuals had greater weapon residuals than unpaired individuals. The response variable was weapon residual, and the explanatory variable was a binary variable of paired status, where one represents a paired individual and zero represents an unpaired individual. We performed separate tests for each sex.</p><p>Similarly, to test if greater snapping claw residuals increased the probability of pairing, we built a binomial generalized linear model with pairing status (1=paired, 0=unpaired) as the response variable. The explanatory variables were carapace length and snapping claw residual. We built models for each sex separately.</p><p>Then, we tested if individuals with greater weapon residuals paired with larger mates.

We used rostrum-to-telson length here because males and females form size-assortative pairs based on body length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathews, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nolan and Salmon, 1970</xref>). We built a linear model with the relative size of pair mates as the response variable and the snapping claw residual of the focal individual as the explanatory variable. We repeated this analysis using either males or females as the focal individuals and the opposite sex as the pair mate. We predicted a positive relationship if individuals with greater weapon residuals attracted or maintained relatively larger pair mates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Seasonal trends</title><p>We tested if reproductive tradeoffs manifested in seasonal fluctuations in morphology between breeding and non-breeding seasons in <italic>Alpheus heterochaelis</italic>. We performed <italic>t</italic>-tests to compare (1) abdomen residuals and (2) snapping claw residuals using the breeding season as the explanatory variable (1=breeding season, 0=non-breeding season). The breeding season lasted from April to October when we found ovigerous female snapping shrimp. February and March collections were considered the nonbreeding season because we collected no ovigerous females. We performed separate t-tests for each sex in <italic>Alpheus heterochaelis</italic>. We predicted that snapping claw residuals would be elevated during the breeding season for males but not females, and that shift would coincide with a reduction in abdomen residuals. Then, to test if the scaling slope of the snapping claw changed between seasons, we built a linear model for each sex with log<sub>10</sub>(snapping claw length) as the response variable and log<sub>10</sub>(rostrum-to-telson length), breeding season, and their interaction as the predictor variables. A significant interaction term would indicate a seasonal allometric shift. If the interaction term was nonsignificant, we removed it from the model to test if there was an overall shift in weapon investment without a change in slope across breeding and non-breeding seasons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84589-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Abdomen length and snapping claw length scaled positively with rostrum-to-telson length.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-84589-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data, metadata, and code are available on Dryad: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qz612jmkf">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qz612jmkf</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dinh</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Patek</surname><given-names>SN</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Tradeoffs and benefits explain scaling, sex differences, and seasonal oscillations in the remarkable weapons of snapping shrimp (Alpheus spp.)</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.qz612jmkf</pub-id></element-citation></p><p>The following previously published dataset was used:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dinh</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Patek</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Weapon performance and contest assessment strategies of the cavitating snaps in snapping shrimp</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.qz612jmjx</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to Ben Schelling and Jacob Harrison for assisting with field collection.

investment in costly weaponry traits as related to body size and reproduction. Convincing evidence is based on the collection of an exceptional number of fields samples, the inclusion of three shrimp species, and the measurement of numerous morphological and behavioral traits. The evidence shows that there are size-dependent trade-offs. Further, males and females differ in weapon investment, as weapons are especially beneficial to males but especially expensive for females. The findings will be of broad interest to evolutionary biologists and researchers working in the field of animal behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84589.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>O'Connell</surname><given-names>Lauren A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>O'Connell</surname><given-names>Lauren A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Christine Whitney</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02y3ad647</institution-id><institution>University of Florida</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.13.516325">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.13.516325v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Lauren A O'Connell as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by George Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christine Whitney Miller (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please consider a rewrite to tighten up the manuscript to make the paper clearer to the non specialist reader. The writing is meandering at times and the discussion could be restructured to link these findings to the broader literature.</p><p>2) In the discussion, please include more text about concrete costs and benefits as well as the pros and cons of the approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I commend the authors for all the natural observations done in these three shrimp species – this was a ton of work that allows for a robust testing of some evolutionary theory.</p><p>The introduction is a bit meandering. This is more a matter of style, but I would find it easier to read if the testing and predictions paragraphs in the intro were moved into the results to better set up the narrative and allow one to connect each result to a main idea. I get that this framework makes sense when a single idea or hypothesis is being tested, but there are many and by the time I got to the results, I had forgotten the main idea being tested. Sprinkling them throughout the results would prevent this from happening.</p><p>The discussion writing needs to be cleaned up a bit and is heavily focused on repeating the results and talking about shrimp. Starting in paragraph two of the discussion, there are 2-3 sentence mini-paragraphs that repeat the results. I don't think this are necessary. I would have liked to have seen interpretations in the light of other literature sooner rather than a repetition of what I had just read in the results. Consider filling these paragraphs out with comparisons to other studies or removing them/ incorporating them into the writing better. The first really great paragraph in the discussion that does this is on line 462 – 7 paragraphs in. There is very limited writing comparing these results to other taxa – doing this would improve the reach of your findings beyond something cool in snapping shrimp to a general principle of trait evolution that you suggest.</p><p>Species differences – The allometric slop of the snapping claw scaling differed between sexes in two of three species – why is that?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The current version of the manuscript would benefit from a discussion of the pros and cons of their approach of using residuals versus other approaches to measure resource allocation trade-offs. This version also needs more information on the life-history of these shrimp, including lifespan and information on molting. Further discussion is also needed on the incorporation of carapace length and rostrum-to-telson length and their relation to each other. Together, this information will help the general reader better interpret the results.</p><p>More details and other notes:</p><p>1. Title: Consider removing &quot;benefits&quot; from the title because it just makes the title more complex without providing much information.</p><p>2. Contractions are used throughout, which is not formal scientific writing (e.g., Lines 78 &amp; 460).</p><p>3. Line 16. To be a little more exacting, these species show patterns consistent with resource allocation trade-offs rather than just &quot;exhibit resource allocation trade-offs&quot;. See below -- more discussion on the inference provided by different methods to measure trade-offs will also be helpful.</p><p>4. Line 27. &quot;Especially burdensome to females&quot;, yet the authors have not tested for benefits to females of having weapons, which might be profound.</p><p>5. Lines 78-79. Other than the use of the contraction, this is an excellent way to set up the patterns – this manuscript has great writing throughout.</p><p>6. The paper in its current form is excellent, however there are some missing bits that are essential for the general reader to be able to interpret the quality of the paper and make sense of the patterns:</p><p>a. I find it essential that the authors address the pros and cons of their approach to measuring resource allocation trade-offs, and their approach is just one of many ways of looking at whether or not such trade-offs exist and the extent of the trade-offs. This is the #1 omission of the manuscript in its current form. What can the use of residuals say, what are the possible problems with this approach, and what are its strengths? Are results from this approach generally consistent with other approaches used? This approach does not account for genetics, nor is this an experimental method. Make sure to include citations throughout this discussion.</p><p>b. What is the lifespan of these invertebrates? The authors sampled two species monthly over a several month period in 2020 and 2021. How does this sampling overlap with their lifespan and molting cycles? When do they molt? How often do they molt? And, the authors mentioned that they change in their body dimensions during the reproductive season. Indeed, what is possible when they do molt – how much can they change? Most people reading this study will not have familiarity with marine invertebrates and especially these species.</p><p>c. Line 152. Both carapace length and rostrum-to-telson length are measured. The authors state that carapace length is a measure of quality. Though not explicitly stated here, it seems that rostrum-to-telson length is the measure they use of body size. This should be explicitly stated and why this metric is chosen. It would also be helpful to describe why carapace length should be the measure of quality, while the other is the size metric. How do they scale with each other?</p><p>7. Lines 86-88. This is a conservative and reasonable approach, and yet &quot;costs&quot; is used commonly throughout the manuscript (see Discussion section). It would be valuable to come back to this statement in the discussion and make sure that the terms used throughout are consistent.</p><p>8. Lines 427-430. How precise are the measurements? Could the difference be relatively small and hard to detect with your current methods?</p><p>9. Lines 477-487 More discussion of concrete costs and benefits would be helpful. In particular, there is mention in the introduction that females use their weapons for resource defense, but it is not discussed again.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84589.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please consider a rewrite to tighten up the manuscript to make the paper clearer to the non specialist reader.

Consider filling these paragraphs out with comparisons to other studies or removing them/ incorporating them into the writing better. The first really great paragraph in the discussion that does this is on line 462 – 7 paragraphs in. There is very limited writing comparing these results to other taxa – doing this would improve the reach of your findings beyond something cool in snapping shrimp to a general principle of trait evolution that you suggest.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now filled in these paragraphs with relevant findings from the existing literature and other taxa, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Species differences – The allometric slop of the snapping claw scaling differed between sexes in two of three species – why is that?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not entirely sure. It’s possible that this was just a sample size issue. The species where we did not detect a statistically significant difference in allometric slope also had the smallest sample size. We added this caveat in lines 125-126.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The current version of the manuscript would benefit from a discussion of the pros and cons of their approach of using residuals versus other approaches to measure resource allocation trade-offs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included an extensive discussion of the pros, cons, and future directions of our method in lines 637-676.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This version also needs more information on the life-history of these shrimp, including lifespan and information on molting.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included information on life history and molting in lines 62-74 and lines 642-655.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further discussion is also needed on the incorporation of carapace length and rostrum-to-telson length and their relation to each other. Together, this information will help the general reader better interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>The latest manuscript includes this discussion in lines 743-748.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More details and other notes:</p><p>1. Title: Consider removing &quot;benefits&quot; from the title because it just makes the title more complex without providing much information.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Contractions are used throughout, which is not formal scientific writing (e.g., Lines 78 &amp; 460).</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 16. To be a little more exacting, these species show patterns consistent with resource allocation trade-offs rather than just &quot;exhibit resource allocation trade-offs&quot;. See below -- more discussion on the inference provided by different methods to measure trade-offs will also be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 27. &quot;Especially burdensome to females&quot;, yet the authors have not tested for benefits to females of having weapons, which might be profound.</p></disp-quote><p>Females certainly benefit from bearing large weapons. Large weapons have greater offensive capacity and provide competitive advantage in intrasexual combat for both sexes, for example (Dinh et al., 2020; Dinh &amp; Patek, 2023).</p><p>The key sex difference we identify in this paper is in pairing benefits. We tested for this in both males and females, but only males exhibited this benefit. That’s why we conclude that weapons are especially beneficial to males—not exclusively beneficial to males.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Lines 78-79. Other than the use of the contraction, this is an excellent way to set up the patterns – this manuscript has great writing throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The paper in its current form is excellent, however there are some missing bits that are essential for the general reader to be able to interpret the quality of the paper and make sense of the patterns:</p><p>a. I find it essential that the authors address the pros and cons of their approach to measuring resource allocation trade-offs, and their approach is just one of many ways of looking at whether or not such trade-offs exist and the extent of the trade-offs. This is the #1 omission of the manuscript in its current form. What can the use of residuals say, what are the possible problems with this approach, and what are its strengths? Are results from this approach generally consistent with other approaches used? This approach does not account for genetics, nor is this an experimental method. Make sure to include citations throughout this discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve now included a discussion about the pros and cons of the observational residual approach. We’ve also discussed how the approach can be integrated with alternative experimental approaches in the future (lines 637-676).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. What is the lifespan of these invertebrates? The authors sampled two species monthly over a several month period in 2020 and 2021. How does this sampling overlap with their lifespan and molting cycles? When do they molt? How often do they molt? And, the authors mentioned that they change in their body dimensions during the reproductive season. Indeed, what is possible when they do molt – how much can they change? Most people reading this study will not have familiarity with marine invertebrates and especially these species.</p></disp-quote><p>They molt year round every 16 to 20 days, on average. Indeed, they can grow and alter their proportions — and even regenerate and transform claws — between molts.</p><p>We’ve now included these natural history details in lines 62-74 and lines 642-655.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Line 152. Both carapace length and rostrum-to-telson length are measured. The authors state that carapace length is a measure of quality. Though not explicitly stated here, it seems that rostrum-to-telson length is the measure they use of body size. This should be explicitly stated and why this metric is chosen. It would also be helpful to describe why carapace length should be the measure of quality, while the other is the size metric. How do they scale with each other?</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve now included a discussion of rostrum-to-telson length, carapace length, and abdomen length in lines 743-748. They are all correlated, but previous research has implicated each one in different important biological processes that we are interested in.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Lines 86-88. This is a conservative and reasonable approach, and yet &quot;costs&quot; is used commonly throughout the manuscript (see Discussion section). It would be valuable to come back to this statement in the discussion and make sure that the terms used throughout are consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>We use “costs” when speaking more broadly about the theory and the broader literature, but we used “expenditure” or “tradeoff” when talking specifically about our results. We double-checked our terminology throughout and made all necessary corrections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Lines 427-430. How precise are the measurements? Could the difference be relatively small and hard to detect with your current methods?</p></disp-quote><p>Our measurements were extremely precise. We describe our methods and equipment in Dinh &amp; Patek (2023), but in short, we used a high-speed camera that recorded at 100,000 frames per second and a calibrated hydrophone that recorded 1,000,000 samples per second. That provided 0.01 millisecond resolution in kinematic measurements and microsecond resolution in pressure measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Lines 477-487 More discussion of concrete costs and benefits would be helpful. In particular, there is mention in the introduction that females use their weapons for resource defense, but it is not discussed again.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a paragraph of concrete costs and benefits in lines 573-591.</p></body></sub-article></article>
