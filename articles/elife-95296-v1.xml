diseases constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health. Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting productivity and public health. Several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa surveillance data rarely include information from abortions, little is known about aetiology and impacts, and data are not available to inform interventions. This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform established in Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder systems to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers (LFO) and on to investigation teams. Events were included if the research team or LFO could attend within 72 hr. If so, samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate (a) determinants of attribution; (b) patterns of events, including species and breed, previous abortion history, and seasonality; (c) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; (d) cases involving zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017–2019, 215 events in cattle (n=71), sheep (n=44), and goats (n=100) were investigated. Attribution, achieved for 19.5% of cases, was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. Livestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale, can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. This study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system, achieved through engagement of community-based field officers, establishment of practical sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic platforms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Livestock reproductive losses are a major concern for farmers worldwide as they cause significant economic impacts, particularly for those that are heavily dependent on their livestock for food security. On top of this, such losses can also pose a threat to public health if they are caused by infections that can also be transmitted to humans.</p><p>Spontaneous abortion (when a pregnancy ends early and a foetus is expelled) can be caused by a number of factors, including infections, nutritional deficiencies and genetic issues. Identifying the cause is easier if high quality samples are collected from the aborting mother and the foetus. However, this can be difficult in some low-and middle-income countries, where such samples are rarely collected and analysed.</p><p>Lankester et al. wanted to investigate whether livestock abortion surveillance could be used to understand the causes and effects of livestock abortion in Tanzania. To do this, the researchers asked farmers to report abortion cases to livestock field officers. These officers alerted investigation teams to collect samples and conduct questionnaires which provided information on the livestock breeds, seasonal patterns and potential pathogens involved in 215 abortion cases in cattle, sheep and goats.</p><p>Analysis revealed that successfully identifying the cause of abortion depends heavily on the timing and quality of the samples. The chances of diagnosis decreased with each day that passed between the abortion and the samples being collected. Vaginal swabs, which are easier to collect than those from the placenta or aborted foetus, were the most effective at detecting abortion-causing infectious agents.</p><p>The analysis also revealed that many of the livestock which had an abortion in the previous 12 months had experienced one or more abortions before. This suggests that an infectious agent may be the cause and that, through surveillance and accurate diagnosis, managing these animals by removing them from the herd might improve productivity. Abortions were also more common in non-local breeds of cattle and goats, suggesting that local breeds may have a degree of resistance to abortion.</p><p>The findings of Lankester et al. reveal a method of livestock surveillance that is feasible in areas with limited resources and could be used to increase understanding of the causes of livestock abortion. Such information could help to direct interventions that prevent abortion and improve livestock health, ultimately helping to improve food security while reducing the risk of infection for livestock-owners in lower- and middle-income countries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>syndromic surveillance</kwd><kwd>livestock abortion</kwd><kwd>community-based</kwd><kwd>zoonoses</kwd><kwd>PCR</kwd><kwd>Tanzania</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000848</institution-id><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R83537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cleaveland</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L018926/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cleaveland</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Livestock abortion surveillance can capture valuable information on important livestock pathogens, including those that are zoonotic and with epidemic potential, revealing importance of timely collection of diagnostic samples for attribution.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Livestock reproductive losses, including spontaneous abortion, are a major concern for the livestock industry worldwide, resulting in significant economic loss and posing a threat to public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Food and Agriculture Organization, 2011</xref>). The impacts of livestock abortion on the world’s poorest livestock-keepers, who are heavily dependent on livestock for food security and livelihoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Food and Agriculture Organization, 2011</xref>), is likely to be substantial. For these families, the loss of a livestock foetus and a subsequent decline in milk production reduces the availability of a high-quality food source (milk) that can be essential for childhood growth and cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neumann et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, livestock reproductive losses reduce income (from sales of meat and milk), and cause a loss of livestock assets that are a critical source of wealth, collateral or a safety net in times of need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">The World Bank, 2021</xref>). Recent analyses have shown that because of the need for increased spending on animal management, livestock abortions mayalso have indirect negative impacts on household expenditure and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haseeb et al., 2019</xref>). Livestock abortion can also pose a direct threat to human health because many abortigenic agents are also zoonotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Givens and Marley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Surveillance is defined as the real-time (or near real-time) collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of health-related data to enable the early identification of the impact (or absence of impact) of potential health threats, which require effective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hulth, 2014</xref>). Effective livestock health surveillance provides critical data for evidence-based approaches to livestock disease control and management but this requires reliable, high-quality, and timely data that can be drawn from multiple sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George et al., 2021</xref>). Over the past decade, increasing attention has been given to animal health syndromic surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dórea and Vial, 2016</xref>), which relies on detection of health indicators, such as livestock abortion, that are discernible before a confirmed diagnosis is made. However, systematic reviews of the literature that collectively cover a period from 2000 to 2016 indicate that syndromic surveillance programmes have mostly been implemented in Europe, North America or Australasia with only a single pilot project identified in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dórea and Vial, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dórea et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In public health, event-based surveillance has also been gaining attention for the early detection of unusual events that might signal acute and emerging human health risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">World Health Organization, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018</xref>). This involves the collection, analysis and interpretation of information through both formal and informal channels to rapidly identify unusual or unexpected health events, such as disease outbreaks, emerging infectious diseases, or other public health threats. Although the WHO guidelines for event-based surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">World Health Organization, 2008</xref>) make explicit reference to the capture of information around unusual disease events in animals, the development of integrated early-warning systems involving animal disease events is still very limited. Livestock surveillance has a clear potential for identifying and preventing outbreaks of zoonotic and emerging diseases; a substantial proportion (39.4%) of livestock pathogens infect humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cleaveland et al., 2001</xref>), and ungulates harbour more zoonotic pathogens than any other taxonomic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005</xref>). With several abortigenic agents also causing emerging livestock diseases, for example those caused by Schmallenberg virus, bluetongue virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, livestock abortion may represent a particularly important syndromic target for zoonotic and emerging disease surveillance. However, there is limited information available on current practices, effectiveness, and challenges/opportunities of livestock abortion surveillance, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p><p>Livestock abortion has many causes, including infectious, nutritional, physical, and genetic factors. The diversity of causative agents and variation in the relative importance of agents across different livestock management systems and geographies makes abortion diagnosis complex and challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wolf-Jäckel et al., 2020</xref>). Challenges relate to timely collection of diagnostic samples, sample availability and deterioration, biases in detectability of agents, as well as complexities around establishment of a causal aetiology, particularly for pathogens such as <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which can often be present as incidental infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wolf-Jäckel et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, aetiological attribution of livestock abortion rarely exceeds 35%, even in well-resourced industrialised livestock systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wolf-Jäckel et al., 2020</xref>) and data are particularly sparse in African livestock systems.</p><p>A recent prospective study of the aetiologies of livestock abortion, carried out in northern Tanzania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>), investigated 215 cases of livestock abortion of which an attribution was made in 41 cases (19%). The infectious causes of abortion were identified as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in 14 cases (6.6%), followed by <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> in 10 (4.7%), pestiviruses in 9 (4.2%), <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> in 6 (2.8%), and <italic>Brucella</italic> sp., and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> in one case each (0.5%). Our study draws on the operational data generated from establishment of a livestock abortion study to examine characteristics of reporting and investigation of cases of livestock abortion. While this study was not designed as a systematic or comprehensive evaluation of a surveillance system, we present data on several key attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">ECDC, 2014</xref>) of the platform, including simplicity, data quality, representativeness, timeliness, and usefulness. We discuss our findings in relation to the feasibility, practicality, and value of establishing a livestock abortion surveillance framework to support evidence-based interventions to improve livestock development, livelihoods, and human health in Africa.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Descriptive statistics</title><p>Between October 2017 and September 2019, 215 abortion cases were reported from 150 households in 13 of the 15 target wards.

This included information that, to our knowledge, has not been captured or reported through existing surveillance systems.</p><p>Key findings were that: (i) livestock abortion can be a target for syndromic and/or event-based surveillance, with abortion incidents sufficiently distinctive and noteworthy to be reported by farmers to livestock field officers in a timely manner for investigation; (ii) pragmatic and robust protocols for sample collection and laboratory diagnosis can be established, even in resource-limited settings, to generate important etiological and epidemiological data; (iii) the likelihood of obtaining an etiological diagnosis depended on the timeliness of reporting and quality of sample collection; (iv) there was wide variation in reporting and investigation of cases by different LFOs and this did not appear to be associated with the distance between the ward and the investigation center; (v) in many herds prior livestock abortions were reported to have occurred in the 12 months preceding the investigated abortion event; (vi) abortions and repeat abortions reported disproportionately more frequently in non-indigenous breeds (cross-bred and exotic) than local breeds; and (vii) abortion cases wthere reported and investigated more frequently during drier periods, although there was no evidence of a relationship with monthly rainfall.</p><p>This study suggests that livestock abortion cases are sufficiently distinctive and observable to be reported by farmers to LFOs, would have widespread acceptability as a target for syndromic or event-based surveillance and would have considerable utility for farmers as well as for the livestock and public health sectors. The platform demonstrated the potential for generating high-quality aetiological data on previously relatively unrecognised livestock disease problems in Tanzania, such as <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> and novel pestiviruses, as well as data on endemic zoonoses, such as Q fever, brucellosis and toxoplasmosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>). Reports of unusual livestock abortion cases also provided an early warning of acute human health risks, as shown in this study area by the detection of an outbreak of RVF in livestock in peri-urban smallholder cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Glanville et al., 2022</xref>), which was the catalyst for subsequent public health investigations that identified several linked human RVF cases, including one fatality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Madut et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>An attempt was made to gauge the sensitivity of the surveillance platform by estimating the percentage of expected abortions that the investigated cases represented. This was carried out using data on ward-level livestock numbers drawn from Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries records. However, given the dynamic nature of livestock populations in the study area and shifts in ward configurations, these estimates should be considered approximate figures only. Overall the sensitivity of this platform was low, with the highest ward level sensitivity (12.4%) below a mean sensitivity of 34% reported for bovine abortion surveillance systems in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bronner et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, given that this was the first time that an abortion surveillance platform of this kind had been introduced, and the logistic and communication challenges inherent to this type of low-income setting, our study gives confidence of the feasibility and potential utility of this approach. Despite the limitations of the data, our conclusion that there is wide variation in the sensitivity of the surveillance platform across wards is likely to be robust. This finding, together with the ability of the platform to investigate only a very small proportion of expected abortion cases overall, has implications for the representativeness of data generated, which needs to be considered when interpreting the results reported here.</p><p>Contrary to expectations, the location and distance of the ward was not associated with the probability of cases being investigated. Association between cases investigated and farming system could not be determined as the number of wards was relatively small and the number representative of each system were not equal. However, relatively few cases were reported and investigated in the three agropastoral system wards, whilst both high and low rates of reporting occurred in individual wards within the smallholder (seven wards) and pastoral (five wards) systems. This suggests that LFOs and farmers in some wards were much more engaged and motivated than in others. To date, much investment in animal and human surveillance has been directed towards strengthening laboratory diagnostic capacity. While this is clearly essential, support also needs to be given to engaging, training, and motivating farmers and front-line animal health workers to effectively report both routine and unusual animal disease events. Understanding why and how animal keepers and LFOs are incentivised to report and investigate livestock health events will be essential for improving the reach and sensitivity of future surveillance platforms. The infrastructure for LFO engagement across Tanzania provides a valuable platform for timely and cost-effective reporting of abortions and other disease events but seems to be underutilised in existing surveillance systems.</p><p>The effectiveness of the platform in allowing an aetiological diagnosis to be reached was significantly impacted by the timeliness of investigation. The impact of delays may be explained by degradation of diagnostic samples, which also affected the utility of histopathological diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>). Delays were caused by several factors, including the time taken by the investigation team to reach households due to remoteness of some areas and multiple cases being reported in different areas on the same day. These findings underscore the importance of being able to respond rapidly to cases and, where access is difficult, of providing locally suitable means of transport.</p><p>A reactive surveillance platform that is managed locally, for example by ward-based LFOs, will require the establishment of effective and safe protocols for collection and transport of samples for laboratory diagnosis that can be carried out without the need for long-distance travel of more highly trained investigators. Protocols for collection of vaginal swabs from aborting dams, which proved effective for both pathogen detection and attribution, may be of value. In this study, the greater accessibility of vaginal swabs, as compared to placental samples and foetal samples, meant more attribution of abortigenic pathogens was attained through these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). They also require less handling of potentially infectious tissues and are more reliably accessible than placental and foetal tissues, which are often consumed by scavengers or disposed of by the farmer. Indeed, collection of vaginal swabs from the dam was possible in almost all cases investigated in this study. Thus, while logistic, financial, and capacity constraints for comprehensive sampling and investigation of livestock abortions are likely to exist across Africa, these need not preclude the establishment of simple and robust protocols that can yield valuable surveillance data.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Attribution</title><p>From this platform, an attribution was reached in 19.5% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>), which was not far below the typical range of 25–45% achieved in industrialized farming systems in high-income settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amouei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derdour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 1990</xref>). During this study, samples were tested for only 10 abortigenic pathogens and it is likely that rates of detection and attribution would be higher with inclusion of tests for other known abortigenic agents (such as <italic>Listeria</italic> spp., <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp., <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. and fungal pathogens), with more locally relevant aetiological data informing the suite of pathogens to be tested, and with metagenomic approaches.</p><p>As elsewhere in the world, non-infectious conditions, including nutritional, metabolic, and toxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alemayehu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Woodburn et al., 2021</xref>), are also likely to cause livestock abortions in Tanzania. Our study suggests a possible role for recent stressful events, including episodes of drought and attacks by wild predators, which were reported from approximately a third of unattributed abortion cases. However, these events are a common occurrence in our study population, so attribution is likely to be challenging.</p><p>We do not have an immediate explanation as to why the likelihood of attribution was lower for goats than for sheep or cattle. One possible explanation is that, in comparison to sheep and cattle, fewer data are available worldwide on causes of abortions in goats and very little is known about the aetiology of goat abortions in Africa, so the pathogens included in our diagnostic panel may not have been as relevant for goats as for sheep and cattle. This lack of knowledge is highlighted by the unusual finding of <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> as a cause of abortion in a goat detected through this platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The challenges of attribution, discussed also in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>, should not detract from the value of reporting and investigating livestock abortion cases. Recent studies have indicated that the economic costs of livestock abortion in Tanzania and impacts on food security are much more substantial than previously recognized; for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Semango et al., 2024</xref>) estimated the annual gross losses associated with abortion in Tanzania to be $262 million USD. Given these findings, data collected on the number of cases and species/breed affected will be of considerable value in highlighting the importance of this syndrome in the context of livestock productivity, household livelihoods and food security.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Patterns of livestock abortion in northern Tanzania</title><p>Data from the household questionnaire indicated that livestock abortion was a common occurrence across the study area with almost a third of cattle herds and two-thirds of small ruminant herds having experienced a previous case of abortion in the preceding 12 months.</p><p>This study indicated that investigated cases occurred more often than expected in non-indigenous breeds (cross-bred and exotic cattle and cross-bred goats) than in local breeds. This is consistent with studies reporting a four-times higher risk of abortion in cross-bred cattle in Ethiopia in comparison to local breeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deresa et al., 2020</xref>) and studies in Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yakubu et al., 2015</xref>) and India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khan et al., 2016</xref>) reporting breed effects in relation to cattle abortion. Our results may simply reflect a higher likelihood of reporting of abortion in animals that are of higher value and more likely to be zero-grazed or tethered while grazing (and hence abortions would be more apparent) and for which an existing relationship with animal health services is more likely.</p><p>More than a fifth of the dams that aborted were reported to have experienced a previous abortion, and several had experienced multiple abortion losses, with non-indigenous breeds more likely than indigenous breeds to have had a previous abortion. Chronic repeat abortions can arise from infection with pathogens such as <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> and pestiviruses which were detected as common causes of abortion in this study. Repeat aborting dams could be identified as candidates for slaughter with potential benefits for herd productivity, as well as reduced risks of potential zoonotic transmission. However, any advice around removal of these animals from a herd may result in sale rather than slaughter, with the risk of further spread of the pathogen.</p><p>The risk of exposure to zoonotic pathogens through abortion cases was underscored by two findings: first that, in nearly 80% of cases in which a pathogen was detected, the pathogen was zoonotic and second, that in nearly a quarter of all cases, someone had assisted with the aborted delivery, very likely without any form of personal protective equipment. Of those who assisted, 20% were female, of which most were of reproductive age and therefore at particular risk following infection with pathogens such as <italic>Toxoplasma gondii.</italic></p><p>In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that livestock abortion surveillance, even at a relatively small scale, can capture valuable aetiological and epidemiological information on important livestock pathogens, including those that are zoonotic and those with epidemic potential. The study demonstrated the utility, acceptability, and feasibility of livestock abortion as a target for both syndromic and event-based surveillance and showed that an effective reporting and investigation system could be operationalized across a range of settings in Tanzania, including remote rural areas. Key elements of effectiveness were high levels of engagement of community-based field officers, the establishment of practical and robust field sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic techniques, with prompt response to reporting of cases, and timely feedback of results. Future research might include abortion surveillance implemented at a larger scale to better understand the extent, and economic impact, of livestock abortion and associations with different livestock keeping systems. This work might include the investigation of rapid point-of-care testing and the use of mobile phone technology to speed up the detection and reporting back of results to LFOs and livestock keepers, with the potential to facilitate the capture of data for use in national disease surveillance databases. Such research might allow for refined assessment of the economic impact of abortion and, subsequently, of preventative interventions. Further, our results suggest a possible link between abortion and low rainfall, and further work is needed to examine this potentially important relationship in detail. Additionally, investigating the effectiveness of syndromic or event-based surveillance more broadly, targeting syndromes other than abortion, would provide further evidence demonstrating whether this type of surveillance can be implemented, in a cost-effective manner, at scale. Such research would provide much needed evidence to inform the design of effective livestock health interventions to improve livelihoods, food security, and public health.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Logic model</title><p>A logic model was created to provide a conceptual framework that described the logical links between the main activities, outputs, and outcomes that were expected from the programme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

The study was undertaken from October 2017 through September 2019 in 15 wards of five districts of Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Manyara Regions in northern Tanzania (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These study wards were selected from randomly selected wards included in earlier cross-sectional exposure studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodenham et al., 2021</xref>). Thirteen wards were selected at random and two additional wards were selected purposively because of strong existing relationships with the livestock-keeping community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>). These 15 wards comprised five wards that were expected to be predominantly pastoral, three were expected to be predominantly agropastoral and seven expected to predominantly smallholder, with categories assigned by the research team following discussion with local experts (typically the district level veterinary officer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodenham et al., 2021</xref>). Recruited livestock field officers (LFOs) responsible for each target ward received training on the causes and safe investigation of livestock abortion. These officers are government employees that are equivalent to para-veterinarians in other settings. They were requested to ask livestock owners to report any incidents of livestock abortion, stillbirths, and peri-natal death (hereafter referred to as abortion cases).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Map of the study area in northern Tanzania showing selected pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder wards in Kilimanjaro, Arusha, and Manyara Regions.</title><p>The number of investigated cases per ward and the study base (Moshi) are shown.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95296-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Investigation of cases</title><p>Cases were investigated if, following a report from the LFO, the event could be followed up within 72 hr of the abortion occurring.

Briefly, where available, blood, milk, and vaginal swabs were collected from the aborting dam and tissue and swab samples collected from the foetus and placental membranes. Information about the abortion event was collected and a household questionnaire (comprised of mixed open and closed questions) conducted to collect information on livestock demographics, livestock abortion history, the aborting dam (age, breed), household livestock parturition practices and household socio-economic data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Questionnaire data were only collected from abortion cases that were investigated by the research team and were used to investigate underlying patterns of abortion, risks associated with abortion cases, and operational aspects of the surveillance platform.</p><p>LFOs were instructed to provide farmers with advice as to locally appropriate preventive measures that could be taken to reduce transmission or contamination risks associated with abortion cases, which included safe removal of abortion tissues from livestock-occupied areas (e.g. burning, burying or covering the tissues in thorny branches; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Diagnostic results were reported back to LFOs and livestock owners within 10 days of the investigation and, where pathogens were detected, more specific advice provided as to appropriate management strategies that could minimise further transmission to livestock and people.</p><p>Event data were collected using a paper-based Cardiff Teleform system (Cardiff Inc, Vista, Ca., USA) into an Access database (Microsoft Corp, Va., USA).

In most of the paragraphs of the Discussion we discuss the implications of the findings with specific reference, where relevant, to disease control in Tanzania. For example, in the paragraph regarding human capacity building, we discuss how LFOs might be incentivised to report health events and how this could improve the reach and sensitivity of future surveillance platforms.

This paper fully describes the identified pathogens and the methods used for identification and attribution. Additionally, in the Sample Analysis section we describe the pathogens that were tested and the methods used. In the section Exposure to Zoonotic Pathogens we specifically list Brucella spp. C. burnetiid, <italic>T. gondii</italic> and RVFV and so we consider that we have sufficiently described the pathogens tested for, the methods and the zoonotic pathogens detected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The public health importance of any of the abortifacient agents was not highlighted.</p></disp-quote><p>The Introduction provides background information on the public health importance of abortifacient agents and we dedicate a whole section (Exposure to Zoonotic Pathogens) to the public health implications of the number of cases in which zoonotic pathogens were detected.

The study was supposed to be based on real time abortion events or at least abortion events within 72 hours</p></disp-quote><p>We were estimating the sensitivity of the platform by dividing the number of investigated abortion cases by the number of abortions for the livestock population in each of the study wards that would have been expected over the study period. Because the denominator in this calculation was an expected number, and not a measured count, we can only estimate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>236: In areas where there was no reported abortion event why will you estimate. This action will lead to false conclusion of abortion event in area that did have an event.</p></disp-quote><p>We think there has been some misunderstanding of what this section of text was describing. We were not attributing a case to an area where there was none. Rather, as mentioned above, the aim of this particular analysis was to estimate the sensitivity of the platform. To achieve this, we needed to estimate what the expected number of abortion cases in each ward would have been.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>279: Give a brief description of R</p></disp-quote><p>A citation and some explanatory text have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>348: Table 1: Your table did not show cases where estimate values were used</p></disp-quote><p>We think this comment has resulted from the confusion described above regarding estimated cases. Table 1 has summary data for the actual cases that were reported in the study and does not have the data for the estimated number of abortions that were expected to have occurred in each ward.

You have not told us about the previous abortion event in your study area prior to this study and why you embarked on this study in this regions.

As a result, thirteen of the fifteen wards targeted in the reported study were randomly selected. Two additional wards were selected purposively because of strong existing relationships with the livestock-keeping community. This was explained in the Methods in Lines 161 – 164.</p><p>Regarding livestock abortion in Tanzania, as explained in the Introduction (lines 112-114), there is little data on abortion in livestock in Tanzania and elsewhere. Nonetheless, in the Discussion, we do describe the results with respect to other abortion studies carried out in</p><p>Ethiopia, Nigeria and India (lines 592-598). Moreover, as described in the Introduction (line 90-94), the implementation of syndromic or event-based surveillance in livestock is rare and to the authors’ knowledge has mostly been implemented in Europe, North America or Australasia with only a single pilot project identified in Africa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>494: Why will you use an estimate for abortion event that were not reported</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, this comment reflects a misunderstanding of what was being described. As written in line 494, an attempt was made to gauge the sensitivity of the surveillance platform by estimating the percentage of expected abortions that the investigated cases represented. That is, to estimate the percentage of abortions that the surveillance platform managed to detect, we divided the number of investigated abortions by the expected number of abortions (in each ward). The method for this estimation was described in lines 228-238.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>511: Why was farming pattern excluded. Livestock rearing condition is equally critical for this type of investigation example an animal reared intensive system farming method will definitely experience different stress than livestock on nomadic free range system</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that livestock rearing system might be expected to impact both the aetiology and incidence of livestock abortion. However, because the number of wards was small and the distribution across system not equal, any association between investigated cases and livestock rearing system could not be assessed. We have made this clearer with additional text in the same paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>529: Nothing was mentioned about educating the farmers or livestock owners to assist in some instances on possible sample collection during this abortion events and</p></disp-quote><p>sending these samples as quickly as possible to the central laboratory in suitable condition for investigation and result of the finding communicated back to the farmers</p><p>Because abortions can be caused by zoonotic pathogens, we did not involve livestock keepers in the collection of samples. Rather, sample collection was carried out by the research team and livestock field officers who had received appropriate training. In addition, results were reported back to the livestock keepers within 10 days of the investigation and, where pathogens were detected, more specific advice provided as to management strategies that could minimise further transmission to livestock and people. This is all described in the Methods (lines 181-199).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>540: The livestock owner can be taught how to collect vaginal swab and send samples under suitable condition to the laboratory and the findings reported back to them.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>549: Please summerise.</p></disp-quote><p>Line 549-581 succinctly describes the attribution of cases to specific pathogens.
