pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25730.001</object-id><p>Sequencing studies have implicated haploinsufficiency of <italic>ARID1B</italic>, a SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling subunit, in short stature (Yu et al., 2015), autism spectrum disorder (O'Roak et al., 2012), intellectual disability (Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, 2015), and corpus callosum agenesis (Halgren et al., 2012). In addition, <italic>ARID1B</italic> is the most common cause of Coffin-Siris syndrome, a developmental delay syndrome characterized by some of the above abnormalities (Santen et al., 2012; Tsurusaki et al., 2012; Wieczorek et al., 2013). We generated <italic>Arid1b</italic> heterozygous mice, which showed social behavior impairment, altered vocalization, anxiety-like behavior, neuroanatomical abnormalities, and growth impairment. In the brain, <italic>Arid1b</italic> haploinsufficiency resulted in changes in the expression of SWI/SNF-regulated genes implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. A focus on reversible mechanisms identified Insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) deficiency with inadequate compensation by Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and Growth hormone (GH), underappreciated findings in <italic>ARID1B</italic> patients. Therapeutically, GH supplementation was able to correct growth retardation and muscle weakness. This model functionally validates the involvement of <italic>ARID1B</italic> in human disorders, and allows mechanistic dissection of neurodevelopmental diseases linked to chromatin-remodeling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25730.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25730.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25730.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA does not just float freely inside our cells. Instead, it is wound around proteins called histones and packaged tidily into a form called chromatin. This packaging allows genes to be switched on or off by making it easier or harder to access different stretches of the genetic code.</p><p>A group of proteins called the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex are responsible for the packing and unpacking of DNA during development, dictating the fate of thousands of genes. Mutations that affect one component of this complex, a protein known ARID1B, are associated with a rare genetic condition called Coffin-Siris syndrome, and may also have a role to play in autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability. However, there were previously no animal models that can be used to study this mutation in the laboratory.</p><p>Celen, Chuang et al. have now genetically modified mice to remove one of their two copies of the gene that encodes the mouse equivalent of ARID1B. This change replicates the mutation that is most commonly seen in people with Coffin-Siris syndrome. Celen, Chuang et al. report that the mutant mice with just one working copy of the gene showed many features also seen in Coffin-Siris syndrome, including a smaller size and weaker muscles. The mutant mice also repeated certain behaviors, like grooming themselves, and showed unusual interactions with other mice.</p><p>Further tests showed that the mutant mice had lower than expected levels of growth hormone in their blood. The mice were then treated with growth hormone supplements to find out if this could reverse any of their symptoms. Indeed, this treatment made the mice larger and stronger, but did not change their behavior.</p><p>Some doctors are already treating people with Coffin-Siris syndrome with growth hormone, and these new findings suggest that this treatment counteracts defects caused directly by the mutation affecting ARID1B. Moreover, this mouse model will allow the role of ARID1B to be investigated further in the laboratory, and could be used as a tool to discover, develop and test new treatments for Coffin-Siris syndrome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25730.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25730.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes use the energy of ATP to remodel nucleosome density and position to control epigenetic states, lineage differentiation, and cellular growth during development and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ho and Crabtree, 2010</xref>). ARID1B is a 236 kDa protein that contains an AT-rich DNA interactive domain (‘ARID’ domain) and facilitates proper genomic targeting of ARID1B containing SWI/SNF complexes. <italic>ARID1B</italic> is the most commonly mutated gene in Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), a monogenic syndrome characterized by growth retardation, facial dysmorphism, and intellectual disability (ID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Santen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsurusaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wieczorek et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, <italic>ARID1B</italic> is among the most frequently mutated genes in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and non-syndromic ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Roak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, 2015</xref>). In these diseases, <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations are scattered across the gene without clear accumulation in particular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ronan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Santen et al., 2013</xref>). Since these are often predicted to be nonsense or frameshift mutations, heterozygous <italic>ARID1B</italic> loss-of-function is hypothesized to be the causative genetic mechanism. Up to this point, if and how <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations translate into various human phenotypes is unknown, and animal models have not yet been used to model or devise novel treatments for these ‘<italic>ARID1B</italic>-opathies’.</p><p>Here, we employ genetically engineered mouse models to elucidate the phenotypic impact of <italic>Arid1b</italic> mutations. We developed an <italic>Arid1b</italic> haploinsufficient mouse that exhibits neuropsychiatric abnormalities reminiscent of ASD, as well as the developmental and growth retardation phenotypes seen in CSS. Although not previously considered a cardinal feature of this syndrome, a meta-analysis of 60 patients by Santen <italic>et al</italic>. shows that on average, stature is considerably shortened in CSS patients by about two standard deviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Santen et al., 2013</xref>). After showing the clinical relevance of our mouse model, we focused on potentially reversible etiologies of behavioral and growth phenotypes. We observed GHRH-GH-IGF1 axis deficiencies in <italic>Arid1b</italic> heterozygous mice and also found evidence for this in humans. GH supplementation in mice rescued growth retardation and muscle weakness, which are also salient features of human <italic>ARID1B</italic>-opathies. Though successful in <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutant mice that model Rett syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tropea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castro et al., 2014</xref>), intervening on the GH-IGF1 axis was not able to reverse neuropsychiatric defects associated with <italic>Arid1b</italic>. Our findings not only functionally validate <italic>ARID1B’s</italic> involvement in human disease, they suggest underappreciated clinical manifestations of human <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations that can be approached from a treatment-perspective.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of <italic>Arid1b<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Arid1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice</title><p>Using Cas9 germline gene-editing, we generated whole-body knockout and conditional floxed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Arid1b</italic> is prominently expressed in the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ka et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

A similar pattern of repetitive behaviors was seen with <italic>Synapsin</italic> knockout mice, another mouse model of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greco et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Another feature of ASD is abnormal communication and language.

To determine if some of these genes could be directly regulated by SWI/SNF, we analyzed the ChIP-Seq targets of Smarca4 (Brg1), a core SWI/SNF complex subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attanasio et al., 2014</xref>). 91 of 140 (65%) differentially regulated genes showed direct binding by Brg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), with positional enrichment at transcriptional start sites (TSSs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Arid1b-mediated SWI/SNF transcriptional activities appeared to directly regulate numerous neuropsychiatric related genes, including ones implicated in ASD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). Our data also show that haploinsufficiency is sufficient to cause broad gene expression disruption, but future studies will be required to determine the exact downstream genes that account for the neuropsychiatric phenotypes.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25730.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>Arid1b</italic> haploinsufficiency results in changes in the expression of SWI/SNF regulated genes implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) All significantly up- and downregulated genes in the <italic>Arid1b<sup>+/-</sup></italic> hippocampus are ranked according to p-value (least to most significant from left to right).

To discern if there was a hypothalamic, pituitary, peripheral, or combinatorial problem that led to IGF1 deficiency, we performed a series of endocrinologic tests. In the same cohorts of mice with IGF1 deficiency, fasting GH was not significantly different in <italic>Arid1b<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

After 40 days of treatment, <italic>Arid1b</italic> heterozygous mice gained significantly more body weight and nose-to-rump length than did WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>), demonstrating that exogenous GH supplementation was sufficient to rescue growth retardation in <italic>Arid1b<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. Given this selective efficacy for mutant mice, we asked if GH could potentially improve muscle weakness often associated with CSS.

Replacement with GH was able to selectively increase muscle strength in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Despite improvements in physical manifestations, GH replacement was not able to reverse behavioral phenotypes such as anxiety, as measured in the elevated plus maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

Several aspects of our model recapitulated the features of the overlapping disorders associated with <italic>ARID1B</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Our model is faithful to the heterozygosity seen in most <italic>ARID1B</italic>-opathies. It is interesting that another model of ASD involving a chromatin remodeling gene called <italic>CHD8</italic> also requires haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katayama et al., 2016</xref>) and suggests that dose could play a critical mechanistic role in phenotypes resulting from mutations in epigenetic regulators. Our study also raises interesting questions about how genotype relates to phenotype in diseases involving <italic>ARID1B</italic>. Some children with <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations have a subset but not all features of CSS, and others have different disorders such as ASD or isolated corpus callosum agenesis. For example, Yu <italic>et al.</italic> reported cases of idiopathic short stature without cognitive defects that were attributed to de novo <italic>ARID1B</italic> missense mutations, suggesting that there are either differences between mutations or important genetic interactions that play a key role in defining the phenotypic expression of these mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). It is also possible that differences between the function of <italic>Arid1b</italic> in mouse and human brain development account for intellectual and cognitive discrepancies.

Previously, height was shown to be reduced in <italic>ARID1B</italic> patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Santen et al., 2014</xref>), but there are only anecdotal findings of GH deficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). After the clinical identification of <italic>ARID1B</italic> or SWI/SNF mutations, interventions for short stature are usually not investigated. Thus, it is likely that GHRH-GH-IGF1 deficiency is under-diagnosed and rarely treated in this patient population. Conversely, <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations are not suspected in patients with non-syndromic short stature, and could represent a more common causative mechanism than previously suspected. The findings here should motivate deeper interrogation of the GHRH-GH-IGF1 axis and potentially GH supplementation in syndromic patients with CSS or non-syndromic patients with <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations and short stature.</p><p>Our study does not pinpoint the exact source of the peripheral IGF1 deficiency since liver-specific Cre lines did not recapitulate the IGF1 deficiency seen in the whole body <italic>Arid1b<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. Given the <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic> results, it is possible that reduced IGF1 production in the brain led to reduced plasma IGF1 and the inability to compensate with GHRH and GH exacerbated growth retardation. Another possibility that subtle peripheral defects in the liver and muscle will only manifest when combined with defects in other organs such as the brain. Future studies with tissue-specific conditional experiments could help to resolve these questions. Overall, our study provides a preclinical model for mechanistic and therapeutic dissection of <italic>ARID1B</italic> related diseases, and offers a translatable avenue to alleviate growth related aspects of developmental delay.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal procedures were based on animal care guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW).

Mice were held at the base of the tail and supported ventrally while being moved into position to grasp the wire grid. Once the rug was successfully grasped, mice were gently pulled in a horizontal plane until the animal’s grip was released from the grid. Peak force (in gram-force units, gf) was captured by the force meter and recorded for later analysis. Forelimb and hindlimb tests were conducted separately, with each being measured five times over a 2–3 min period.

After the habituation period, a small door was opened allowing them to access the light side of the apparatus (25 cm x 26 cm lit to approximately 1700 lux) for 10 min. The animals were monitored by 7 photobeams in the dark compartment and 8 photobeams on the light side connected to a computer which recorded the time spent in each compartment, latency to enter the light side and the number of entrances to each compartment (Med-PC IV, Med Associates, St. Albans, VT).

Experimenters were blinded to mouse genotypes. A circular pool was filled with room temperature water to a depth of approximately 12 inches. A platform (10 cm diameter) was placed in one quadrant of the pool with the top of the platform about 2 cm below the water level. White non-toxic paint was added to enhance the contrast with the animal and to hide the location of the platform. Each day the mice were placed in the pool and allowed to swim for 1 min to find the platform. The swim path and time until locating the platform wasrecorded via a videocamera and computer running videotracking software (Ethovision, Noldus). If the mouse does not find the platform within a minute, they were gently guided or placed on the platform for 10 s, then removed from the pool and return to their home cage. Each animal was placed in the pool for a total of four times each day for 13 days. Twenty-four hours after the last training day, a probe test was conducted in which the platform was removed from the pool and each mouse was allowed to swim for 1 min to determine whether the animal has learned the location of the platform. The time each animal spends in the quadrant which had contained the platform on training days and the number of times that the animal crosses the location which had contained the platform are indicators of how well the animal has learned the spatial location of the platform. To control for visual problems, the mice weregiven 4–6 trials after the probe test using the same pool and platform, however a large black block was placed on top of the platform to clearly mark the location. The location of the platform was moved on each trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Fear conditioning</title><p>Test was performed by UTSW Rodent Core Facilty.

For training, mice were individually placed in the chamber. After 2 min, the mice received three tone-shock pairings (30 s white noise, 80 dB tone co-terminated with a 2 s, 0.5 mA footshock, 1 min intertrial interval). The following day, memory of the context was measured by placing the mice into the same chambers and freezing was measured automatically by the Med Associates software. Forty-eight hours after training, memory for the white noise cue was measured by placing the mice in a box with altered floors and walls, different lighting, and a vanilla smell.

Recombinant mouse growth hormone was obtained from National Hormone and Peptide Program (NHPP). It was prepared according to the NHPP datasheet. Injection was performed subcutaneously. 30 ug GH/mouse/day was injected between P11 to P14, 50 ug GH/mouse/day was injected between P14 to P21, 70 ug GH/mouse/day was injected between P21 to P50. Grip strength test was performed at P60 after 10 days without treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Unless specified otherwise in the figure legends, statistical analyses were performed using unpaired, two-tailed, Student’s t-test or ANOVA.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The authors generate a null and conditional Arid1b heterozygous mouse model, and test it for features related to human ARID1B-haploinsufficiency disorders and Coffin-Siris syndrome. They note growth retardation, small corpus callosum, and altered behavior in models of anxiety. They did not note deficiencies in learning or memory that would be expected from the clinical finding in patients of intellectual disability. Finally, they observed rescue of growth and grip strength with administration of growth hormone.</p><p>This is a compelling manuscript, the first to demonstrate neurobehavioral deficits associated with Arid1b haploinsufficiency, the first to demonstrate a CNS-root of the growth retardation, and the first to and suggest GH replacement as a treatment. Strong points of this paper are the multiple behavioral testing paradigms presented by authors suggesting that Arid1b heterozygosity correlates with a neuropsychiatric phenotypes. There are a couple leaps in logic that make the correlation of this model with the human phenotypes feel at times forced, but overall the results are interesting. Despite these shortcomings, (i.e. IGF1 is low, but does not rescue phenotype. GH is not convincingly low, but does rescue the phenotype.) the findings are presented in a compelling way.</p><p>Concerns</p><p>Subsection “<italic>Arid1b<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice exhibit central GH-IGF1 axis deficiency”.

Strong points of this paper are the multiple behavioral testing paradigms presented by authors suggesting that Arid1b heterozygosity correlates with a neuropsychiatric phenotypes. There are a couple leaps in logic that make the correlation of this model with the human phenotypes feel at times forced, but overall the results are interesting. Despite these shortcomings, (i.e. IGF1 is low, but does not rescue phenotype. GH is not convincingly low, but does rescue the phenotype.) the findings are presented in a compelling way.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this feedback. Before we address specific questions, the following two paragraphs describe data that was not requested but which we think would help strengthen the conclusions of the paper. To enrich the connections between <italic>Arid1b</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice and ASD-like phenotypes, we performed grooming and marble burying tests that examine repetitive behaviors (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">1</xref></italic>). Consistent with other ASD mouse models, <italic>Arid1b</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice exhibited increased grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and potentially as a consequence, buried less marbles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similar repetitive behaviors were seen with <italic>Synapsin</italic> knockout mice, which exhibit features of ASD (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2</xref></italic>). It is unclear why <italic>Arid1b</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice bury marbles less, but one possibility is that grooming time is significantly increased, thus reducing time spent on burying. These data strengthen the functional connection between <italic>Arid1b</italic> mutations and ASD.</p><p>We also examined cellularity and cortical thickness of brains from WT, <italic>Arid1b<sup>+/-</sup>,</italic> and <italic>Arid1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> P1 pups. This analysis showed that cortical thickness and cellularity declined with loss of <italic>Arid1b</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> to D). TBR1, an early neuronal marker, showed that reduced cortical thickness was accompanied by reduced neuron numbers. These data are in line with the reduced hippocampal and dentate gyrus size, and suggest global changes in brain cellularity.</p><p> <italic>Concerns</italic></p><p> <italic>Subsection “Arid1b<sup>+/-</sup>mice exhibit central GH-IGF1 axis deficiency”.

Igfbp3 reduction may also be supportive of GH deficiency.</italic></p><p>We agree that the GH-IGF1 hormone measurements could be more robust and probed with greater numbers and depth. Thus, we performed a series of experiments with large N’s to try to identify where the GHRH-GH-IGF1 axis is defective in <italic>Arid1b</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. First, we confirmed the plasma IGF1 deficiency in additional cohorts. The original cohort is on the left (n = 7 WT and 6 HET; 45 day old female mice). The new cohorts are on the right (n = 16 WT and 19 HET, 21-33 day old male and female mice). This new data was added to the paper as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.</p><p>In more simplistic cases such as dwarfism from IGF1 mutations, Laron dwarfism (mutant GH receptor), or pituitary tumors causing GH deficiencies, the source of the IGF1 deficiency is usually clear. For example, children with Laron dwarfism do not respond to GH treatment due to a lack of GH receptors. In cases where there are whole-body syndromic defects that affect multiple organs, this source can often be more difficult to pinpoint. For example, it is not entirely clear what the source of IGF1 deficiency is in Rett Syndrome, despite the ability for IGF1 to rescue components of the disorder in mice (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">3</xref></italic>).</p><p>In an attempt to pinpoint the hypothalamic, pituitary, peripheral, or combinatorial problem that was leading to the IGF1 deficiency, we performed a series of endocrinological and genetic tests. In the same cohorts of mice with IGF1 deficiency mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), GH was not significantly different in the <italic>Arid1b</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice in fed or fasting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> in the paper revision). We also confirmed that GH was not altered in younger 2-week old <italic>Arid1b<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, an age where GH levels are more critical for growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This suggested a peripheral defect without appropriate compensation from either the pituitary or hypothalamus.</p><p>Examination of four additional cohorts shown below also showed no significant differences in plasma GH levels in either fed or fasting states. These data were not included in the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25730.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25730.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25730.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25730-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>To determine if the pituitary is capable of making and secreting sufficient amounts of GH, we performed GH stimulation testing with Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">4</xref></italic>). In two independent experiments with different cohorts of mice, we determined that in <italic>Arid1b</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, GH levels were never significantly different at baseline and also increased normally at multiple time points after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In addition, GH mRNA levels in the pituitary as measured by qPCR were not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In sum, this clearly indicated a normal ability for the pituitary to respond to exogenous GHRH.</p><p>Next, we attempted to determine if the hypothalamus is not producing enough GHRH. To examine the expression of endogenous GHRH, we dissected the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), which includes both the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the ventromedial (VMH) hypothalamus, two regions that normally produces GHRH. We found the expected reduction of <italic>Arid1b</italic> mRNA, but no significant increase in GHRH mRNA (n = 8 WT and 7 HET female mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). The lack of upregulation by GHRH in response to low IGF1 suggested a partial deficiency at the level of the hypothalamus. The fact that GHRH and GH were not significantly lower strongly supports the existence of a peripheral IGF1 production defect.</p><p>We also attempted to use genetic methods to pinpoint a tissue source for the IGF1 deficiency. As was shown in the original submission, we showed that there was growth impairment and IGF1 deficiency in <italic>Nestin-Cre; Arid1b<sup>Fl/+</sup></italic> mice. In contrast, there was no IGF1 or growth impairment in <italic>Alb-Cre; Arid1b<sup>Fl/+</sup></italic> mice, supporting a central deficiency. Because the liver is thought to be the primary source of serum IGF1 production, it was perplexing to us why liver specific HET mice did not replicate the whole body <italic>Arid1b<sup>-/+</sup></italic> mice. There are two main possibilities that we can speculate on. First, it is possible that a combination of central and peripheral defects in the GHRH-GH-IGF1 axis are required to fully recapitulate whole body <italic>Arid1b</italic> haploinsufficiency. Alternatively, the brain is the primary cause and source of the serum IGF1 deficiency. Future experiments will be required to precisely characterize the source of primary IGF1 deficiency in <italic>Arid1b</italic> HET mice. Nevertheless, these experiments provided some genetic evidence for a partial neural contribution to IGF1 deficiency, either in the form of reduced IGF1 production or in the form of inadequate GHRH-GH compensation for low IGF1 production.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, human patients can inform us about the biology of <italic>ARID1B</italic> haploinsufficiency. In a study with 60 <italic>ARID1B</italic> patients, height was shown to be significantly reduced (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">5</xref></italic>). In another study, patients with <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations demonstrated evidence for growth deficiency via partial GH deficiency (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">6</xref></italic>). For this revision, we also obtained detailed clinical information from additional CSS patients, two with <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations (from the www.arid1bgene.com database) and one with a mutation in <italic>SMARCA4</italic>, which encodes another SWI/SNF component. All three of these cases had deficiencies in the GH-IGF1 axis and clear beneficial responses to GH replacement therapy (Growth curves for the <italic>ARID1B</italic> patients are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). It is unknown if these patients also had IGF1 and/or GHRH deficiency. Short stature is usually not further investigated after a diagnosis of CSS, thus it is likely that deficiencies in the GHRH-GH-IGF1 axis are under-diagnosed and rarely treated in this patient population.</p><p>In summary, extensive murine testing demonstrated a peripheral IGF1 deficiency with inadequate GHRH and GH compensation, contributing to growth impairment. In humans with <italic>ARID1B</italic> mutations, there is anecdotal evidence of GH deficiency and in most of those cases IGF1 and GHRH had not been examined. These findings provided the rationale for GH supplementation trials in our mice, where we found that HET mice were more responsive to GH supplementation.</p><p> <italic>CSS is about 4x more common in females than males. Did the authors find any evidence to suggest the reason for this discrepancy that could relate to pituitary function, sex hormone alterations, or tolerance of mutation in males? Are there any difference in phenotypes between male and female Arid1b heterozygous and KO mice? Many tests were only done in male or female but not in both. In selection of genders for each test, are there any criteria that authors applied?</italic></p><p>Input from one of our clinical co-authors (Gijs Santen) makes us suspect that the historic reason that CSS was diagnosed more in females than in males rests partly upon the fact that some of the features (coarse face, hypertrichosis) are more likely to be considered abnormal in females. In the largest study to date about ARID1B patients there is no difference in the number of males/females: there are 30 males and 30 females in this study (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">5</xref></italic>).</p><p>In our mouse model, we did not identify phenotypic differences between females and males in terms of growth and hormone measurements. Given the sheer numbers of mice needed to complete the study, we did not apply specific criteria for selection of mouse sex, we merely used what we could generate to run tests with larger cohorts. For USV vocalization we used both sexes and did not discern a difference between sexes. For grooming and marble burying, we only used females. For anxiety (elevated plus maze, dark light, open field) and juvenile social interaction testing, we used only males. We have not done extensive anxiety testing in females. Since it will take another several months for enough females to be at the correct age for anxiety testing, we can state explicitly in the text that our neuropsychiatric phenotypes were so far only validated for male mice.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p> <italic>Zhu and colleagues modeled ARID1B-opathies in mouse.
