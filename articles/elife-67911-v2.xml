We further show that nuclear hormone receptor <italic>nhr-67</italic> is a negative regulator and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase <italic>hpk-1</italic> is a positive regulator of the NHR-49 pathway. Together, our experiments define a new, essential hypoxia response pathway that acts in parallel with the well-known HIF-mediated hypoxia response.</p></abstract><kwd-group

exogenous stresses, from suboptimal temperatures to foreign substances. Thus, an organism’s ability to mount specific stress responses, including protecting healthy cells from harm or inducing apoptosis when damage to a cell cannot be overcome, is critical for survival. Hypoxia is a stress that occurs when cellular oxygen levels are too low for normal physiological functions. It occurs naturally in cells and tissues during development, as well as in many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Powell-Coffman, 2010</xref>). For example, due to hyperproliferation, inadequate vascularization, and loss of matrix attachment, cancer cells grow in hostile microenvironments featuring hypoxia. Certain cancers thus hijack the hypoxia response to allow growth and metastasis in these harsh conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rankin and Giaccia, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schito and Semenza, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), and tumour hypoxia correlates with poor clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keith and Simon, 2007</xref>). Most prominently, mutations in the tumour suppressor von Hippel–Lindau (VHL), which inhibits the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), occur in kidney cancers, and the resulting accumulation of HIF drives tumour growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaelin Jr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Kim, 2011</xref>). In line with a pivotal role of HIF in these cancers are studies showing promising effects of HIF inhibitors in preclinical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albadari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cho et al., 2016</xref>) and clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fallah and Rini, 2019</xref>). However, a better understanding of the transcriptional hypoxia adaptation pathway is needed to pinpoint new drug targets and gain a deeper insight into how cells, tissues, and organisms cope with hypoxia.</p><p>The pathways that regulate the response to hypoxia are evolutionarily conserved from the nematode worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to humans. As in mammals, a key pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic> involves the transcription factor HIF-1, which is critical for the cellular responses to and the defence against hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choudhry and Harris, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2001</xref>). To survive hypoxia, animals activate the EGL-Nine homolog (EGLN)–VHL-HIF pathway (<italic>egl-9–vhl-1–hif-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic>). In normoxic conditions (21% O<sub>2</sub>), HIF-1 is degraded and thus inactive. This occurs when EGL-9 adds a hydroxyl group onto a proline residue within HIF-1. The hydroxylated proline promotes binding of the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL-1, leading to poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1. However, in hypoxic conditions, EGL-9 is rendered inactive; hence, HIF-1 is stabilized and activates a hypoxia adaptation gene expression program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Epstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Powell-Coffman, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although the responses controlled by the HIF-1 master regulator are most studied, evidence for parallel transcriptional programs in hypoxia exists, from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to mammalian organisms. For example, the transcription factor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLMP-1) has a <italic>hif-1</italic>-independent hypoxia regulatory role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Padmanabha et al., 2015</xref>), as does the conserved nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) oestrogen-related receptor (dERR) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2013</xref>), and the cargo receptor sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pursiheimo et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, despite the evolutionarily conserved and important role of the HIF family, robust and effective hypoxia adaptation requires an intricate network of transcription factors that act in concert. Compared to HIF, there is far less known about the mechanisms by which these pathways contribute to the hypoxia response.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> NHR-49 is a transcription factor orthologous to mammalian hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to these NHRs, it controls lipid metabolism by activating genes involved in fatty acid desaturation and mitochondrial β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pathare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Gilst et al., 2005a</xref>). By maintaining lipid homeostasis, NHR-49 is able to extend lifespan, a phenotype often associated with stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burkewitz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ratnappan et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to regulating lipid metabolism, NHR-49 also regulates putative xenobiotic detoxification genes in a dietary restriction-like state and during starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chamoli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goh et al., 2018</xref>), is required for resistance to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goh et al., 2018</xref>), and activates innate immune response programs upon infection of <italic>C. elegans</italic> with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wani et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naim et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dasgupta et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, a recent report showed that <italic>nhr-49</italic> is required to increase expression of the catechol-O-methyl-transferase <italic>comt-5</italic> in hypoxia, acting downstream of the hypoxia-inhibited receptor tyrosine kinase <italic>hir-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vozdek et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of <italic>nhr-49</italic> in hypoxia and how it intersects with <italic>hif-1</italic> have not been explored.</p><p>The detoxification gene flavin mono-oxygenase 2 (<italic>fmo-2</italic>) is induced in many of the aforementioned stresses in an <italic>nhr-49</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dasgupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wani et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>fmo-2</italic> is also a <italic>hif-1</italic>-dependent hypoxia response gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leiser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shen et al., 2005</xref>), but its dependence on <italic>nhr-49</italic> in hypoxia is not known. We hypothesized that <italic>nhr-49</italic> may play a role in the worm hypoxia response, in part by regulating <italic>fmo-2</italic> expression. Here, we show that <italic>nhr-49</italic> is not only required to induce <italic>fmo-2</italic>, but controls a broad transcriptional response to hypoxia, including the induction of autophagy, a process required within the <italic>nhr-49</italic> pathway for survival in hypoxia. Our epistasis experiments indicate that <italic>nhr-49</italic> is functionally required independently of <italic>hif-1</italic> in hypoxia. Finally, we identify the protein kinase homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (<italic>hpk-1</italic>) as an upstream activator and the transcription factor <italic>nhr-67</italic> as a repressor of the <italic>nhr-49</italic> hypoxia response pathway. Together, our data define NHR-49 as a core player in a novel hypoxia response pathway that acts in parallel with HIF-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NHR-49 is required to induce the expression of <italic>fmo-2</italic> in hypoxia</title><p><italic>C. elegans fmo-2</italic> is induced by oxidative stress, starvation, and pathogen infection in an <italic>nhr-49</italic>-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dasgupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wani et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>fmo-2</italic> expression is also induced in a <italic>hif-1</italic>-dependent manner during hypoxia (0.1% O<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leiser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shen et al., 2005</xref>). To test whether <italic>nhr-49</italic> regulates <italic>fmo-2</italic> expression in hypoxia, we quantified <italic>fmo-2</italic> mRNA levels in normoxia (21% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypoxia (0.5% O<sub>2</sub>) by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in wild-type and mutant animals. The <italic>nr2041</italic> allele deletes portions of both the DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain of <italic>nhr-49</italic> and is a predicted molecular null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Van Gilst et al., 2005b</xref>). The <italic>ia4</italic> allele deletes exons 2–4 of <italic>hif-1</italic> and is also a predicted null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2001</xref>). In wild-type animals, <italic>fmo-2</italic> transcript levels increased approximately 40-fold in hypoxia, but this induction was blocked in both <italic>nhr-49(nr2041</italic>) and <italic>hif-1(ia4</italic>) mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Experiments using a transgenic strain expressing a transcriptional <italic>fmo-2p::gfp</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goh et al., 2018</xref>) corroborated these observations in vivo. In normoxia, this reporter is weakly expressed in some neurons and in the intestine of transgenic animals, but expression was significantly elevated in the intestine of transgenic animals in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

To explore this interaction further, we used feeding RNAi to knock down <italic>nhr-67</italic> in normoxia and hypoxia, and observed how this affected the expression of the <italic>fmo-2p::gfp</italic> and <italic>acs-2p::gfp</italic> transcriptional reporters.

In hypoxia, <italic>nhr-67(RNAi</italic>) resulted in even higher expression of these reporters. In both normoxia and hypoxia, increased expression of the reporters was dependent on <italic>nhr-49</italic> as loss of <italic>nhr-49</italic> abrogated the GFP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref>).

Past studies have identified many stress response factors, often termed master regulators. However, recent studies indicate that stress response regulation requires the intricate interactions of multiple factors as part of networks that provide regulatory redundancy and flexibility. NHR-49 is a transcription factor that promotes longevity and development by regulating lipid metabolism and various stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chamoli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dasgupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wani et al., 2021</xref>). Our data show that NHR-49 coordinates a part of the transcriptional response to hypoxia. The NHR-49 pathway operates in parallel to the canonical HIF-1 hypoxia response pathway. Besides <italic>nhr-49</italic>, this pathway includes <italic>nhr-67</italic> and <italic>hpk-1</italic>. The former interacts with NHR-49 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reece-Hoyes et al., 2013</xref>), potentially forming a regulatory NHR-NHR heterodimer that modulates NHR-49 activity. During normoxia, <italic>nhr-67</italic> acts to repress NHR-49; however, during hypoxia, an increase in NHR-49 protein levels in turn represses <italic>nhr-67</italic> levels, forming a feedback loop that may serve to reinforce NHR-49 activity. In contrast to <italic>nhr-67</italic>, the upstream kinase HPK-1 positively regulates at least part of the NHR-49-dependent hypoxia response, either directly or indirectly, as it is required to survive hypoxia and to activate the NHR-49-regulated hypoxia response genes, including <italic>fmo-2, acs-2,</italic> and autophagy genes. Downstream, NHR-49 and HPK-1 induce autophagy, which is essential to promote hypoxia survival. Collectively, our experiments delineate a hypoxia response pathway that contains distinct upstream and downstream components and is just as essential for hypoxia survival as the parallel <italic>hif-1</italic> pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of the new NHR-49 hypoxia response pathway and its interaction with HIF-1 signalling.</title><p>The proposed model of how NHR-49 regulates a new hypoxia response parallel to HIF-1.

However, several lines of evidence support a model whereby HIF-1 and NHR-49 are core components of parallel signalling networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). First, <italic>hif-1</italic> and <italic>nhr-49</italic> interact genetically in hypoxia survival experiments, suggesting that they work in parallel genetic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and E</xref>). Second, our transcriptome analysis identified sets of genes that are regulated exclusively by HIF-1 or NHR-49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Third, the kinase <italic>hpk-1</italic> and the transcription factor <italic>nhr-67</italic> show synthetic genetic interaction with <italic>hif-1</italic>, but not with <italic>nhr-49</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In support of our study, a recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vozdek et al., 2018</xref>) showed that <italic>nhr-49</italic> is required to induce the <italic>hif-1</italic>-independent hypoxia response gene <italic>comt-5</italic> both in 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> and in a strain mutant for the kinase <italic>hir-1</italic>. In hypoxia, HIR-1 coordinates remodelling of the extracellular matrix independently of HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vozdek et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, although our RNA-seq results did not identify <italic>comt-5</italic> as a target of NHR-49 in hypoxia, this study supports the idea of a <italic>nhr-49</italic> hypoxia response pathway that acts in parallel with <italic>hif-1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Homeodomain-interacting protein kinases in hypoxia</title><p>Our efforts to map additional components of the NHR-49 hypoxia response pathway, especially factors acting in concert with NHR-49, revealed HPK-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

The worm’s only HIPK orthologue, <italic>hpk-1</italic>, regulates development and the response to DNA damage, heat shock, and dietary restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rinaldo et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, <italic>hpk-1</italic> regulates autophagy in response to dietary restriction as it is necessary to induce autophagosome formation and autophagy gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Das et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show that <italic>hpk-1</italic> is an upstream regulator of the <italic>nhr-49</italic>-dependent hypoxia response pathway. Our data suggest that HPK-1 promotes the accumulation of NHR-49 protein in hypoxia, leading to induction of NHR-49-dependent hypoxia response genes. This includes the induction of autophagy genes and autophagosome formation in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). In line with our model, mammalian HIPK2 is induced in and required to protect cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/reoxygenation induced injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dang et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, in breast cancer cells, HIPK2 is degraded during periods of low oxygen via association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calzado et al., 2009</xref>); this degradation of HIPK2 is necessary as the protein normally represses the expression of HIF-1α by binding at its promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nardinocchi et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, protecting cells from hypoxic injury may be a conserved, albeit cell-type-specific, role of HIPKs. Future experiments may reveal how HPK-1 regulates NHR-49, perhaps by examining direct phosphorylation and activation of the NHR-49 protein by HPK-1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Paradoxical regulation of the β-oxidation gene <italic>acs-2</italic> by hypoxia</title><p>Mitochondria consume cellular oxygen to produce energy and thus must adapt to limited oxygen availability. In particular, mitochondrial β-oxidation, the consumption of oxygen to catabolize fatty acids for energy production, is repressed in hypoxia in favour of anaerobic respiration. For example, the heart and skeletal muscle of mice and rats show decreased expression of key β-oxidation enzymes in acute hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morash et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the acyl-CoA synthetase <italic>acs-2</italic> is part of the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway, where it functions in the first step to activate fatty acids. NHR-49 activates <italic>acs-2</italic> expression during starvation, when β-oxidation is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Van Gilst et al., 2005b</xref>). Considering this, <italic>acs-2</italic> expression would be expected to be downregulated in hypoxia due to reduced β-oxidation. Paradoxically, however, we found that <italic>acs-2</italic> is strongly induced in hypoxia and that this regulation depends on <italic>nhr-49</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Examination of other fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes in our RNA-seq data showed that <italic>acs-2</italic> is the only enzyme induced. This suggests that, during hypoxia, ACS-2 is not feeding its product fatty acyl-CoA into the β-oxidation cycle, but perhaps produces fatty acyl-CoA for anabolic functions needed for survival in or recovery from low oxygen, such as phospholipid or triglyceride synthesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). Similar functions have been observed in human macrophages, which, during hypoxia, decrease β-oxidation but increase triglyceride synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boström et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In line with the repression of β-oxidation in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boström et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kennedy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morash et al., 2013</xref>), there is evidence supporting a HIF-dependent downregulation of the mammalian NHR-49 homolog PPARα, which promotes β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atherton et al., 2008</xref>). For example, in human hepatocytes and mouse liver sections, HIF-2α accumulation in hypoxia directly suppresses PPARα expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, HIF-1α suppresses PPARα protein and mRNA levels during hypoxia in intestinal epithelial cells, and the <italic>PPARA</italic> promoter contains a HIF-1α DNA-binding consensus motif, suggesting direct control of <italic>PPARA</italic> by HIF transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Narravula and Colgan, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Some evidence suggests alternative actions of PPARα.

Along these lines, PPARα protein levels increase in the muscle of Phd1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragonés et al., 2008</xref>) and following hypoxic exposure in mouse hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morash et al., 2013</xref>).

Autophagy is part of an adaptive response to hypoxia. During periods of low oxygen, cells switch from aerobic mitochondrial respiration to anaerobic glycolysis. To meet this increased glycolytic demand, the autophagy machinery promotes the activity and cell surface expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 to increase cellular glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roy et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, hypoxia causes improper protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is thought that autophagy and the UPR are activated simultaneously during stress to restore homeostasis, and that autophagy can assist in alleviating ER stress when the UPR is disrupted or overwhelmed (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, PPARα activates autophagy in response to various stresses, including in neurons to clear Aβ in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luo et al., 2020</xref>), and in the liver during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiao et al., 2014</xref>) and starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Proper regulation of autophagy is also a requirement in hypoxic conditions. Knockdown or genetic mutation of various <italic>C. elegans</italic> autophagy genes showed that they are required for worm survival when worms experience anoxia and elevated temperatures combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Samokhvalov et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, Zhang et al. found that mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) is induced by hypoxia in mouse embryo fibroblasts. This process requires the expression of BNIP3 (Bcl-2/E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein 3), an autophagy regulator, which is induced in a HIF-1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In agreement with this, our RNA-seq data showed a 3.8-fold induction of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> BNIP3 homolog <italic>dct-1</italic> in hypoxia; however, this induction was dependent on neither <italic>nhr-49</italic> nor <italic>hif-1</italic>. The above study also found that the autophagy genes Beclin-1 and Atg5 are induced and required for cell survival in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we show for the first time that autophagy is both induced and required for <italic>C. elegans</italic> adaptation and survival to 0.5% O<sub>2</sub>.

Possibly, a signalling molecule whose synthesis is promoted by NHR-49 activity in any tissue promotes organismal hypoxia adaptation. It is also possible that ectopic overexpression of NHR-49 shifts metabolism in the tissue wherein it is expressed, releasing metabolites that promote organismal hypoxia adaptation.</p><p>In sum, we show here that NHR-49 regulates a novel hypoxia response pathway parallel to HIF-1 and controls an important transcriptional response for worm survival in hypoxia.

cultured <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains using standard techniques on nematode growth media (NGM) plates. To avoid background effects, each mutant was crossed into our lab N2 strain; original mutants were backcrossed to N2 at least six times, except <italic>lgg-2</italic> and <italic>epg-6</italic> mutants, which were backcrossed four times. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50 was the food source in all experiments except for RNAi experiments, where we used <italic>E. coli</italic> HT115. All experiments were carried out at 20°C. Worm strains used in this study are listed in the Key resources table. For synchronized worm growths, we isolated embryos by standard sodium hypochlorite treatment. Isolated embryos were allowed to hatch overnight on unseeded NGM plates until the population reached a synchronized halted development at L1 stage via short-term fasting (12–24 hr). Synchronized L1 stage larvae were then transferred to OP50 seeded plates and grown to the desired stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Feeding RNAi</title><p>RNAi was performed on NGM plates supplemented with 25 μg/ml carbenicillin (BioBasic CDJ469), 1 mM IPTG (Santa Cruz CAS 367-93-1), and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline (BioBasic TB0504; NGM-RNAi plates), and seeded with appropriate HT115 RNAi bacteria. The RNAi clones were from the Ahringer library (Source BioScience) and were sequenced prior to use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA isolation and qRT-PCR analysis</title><p>Synchronized L1 worms were allowed to grow on OP50 plates for 48 hr to L4 stage, then either kept in 21% O<sub>2</sub> or transferred to 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> for 3 hr and rapidly harvested. RNA isolation was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goh et al., 2014</xref>). 2 μg total RNA was used to generate cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen 18064-014), random primers (Invitrogen 48190-011), dNTPs (Fermentas R0186), and RNAseOUT (Invitrogen 10777-019). Quantitative PCR was performed in 10 μl reactions using Fast SYBR Master Mix (Life Technologies 4385612), 1:10 diluted cDNA, and 5 μM primer, and analysed with an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus machine. We analysed the data with the ΔΔCt method. For each sample, we calculated normalization factors by averaging the (sample expression)/(average reference expression) ratios of three normalization genes, <italic>act-1</italic>, <italic>tba-1</italic>, and <italic>ubc-2</italic>. The reference sample was <italic>EV(RNAi</italic>), wild-type, or 21% O<sub>2</sub>, as appropriate. We used one-way or two-way ANOVA to calculate the statistical significance of gene expression changes and corrected for multiple comparisons using the Tukey method. Primers were tested on serial cDNA dilutions and analysed for PCR efficiency prior to use. All data originate from three or more independent biological repeats, and each PCR reaction was conducted in technical triplicate. Sequences of qRT-PCR primers are listed in the Key resources table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of fluorescent reporter lines via DIC and fluorescence microscopy</title><p>To analyse fluorescence in reporter lines, egg lays were performed on NGM plates seeded with OP50 or RNAi plates seeded with the appropriate HT115 RNAi culture. Worms were allowed to grow to adulthood. Plates were then kept in 21% O<sub>2</sub> or transferred to 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> for 4 hr and allowed to recover for 1 hr in normoxia before imaging to allow for GFP maturation; hence, these assays are technically post-hypoxia experiments. Worms were collected into M9 buffer containing 0.06% levamisole (Sigma L9756) for immobilization on 2% (w/v) agarose pads for microscopy. We captured images at ×10 magnification on a CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics) attached to a Zeiss Axioplan 2 compound microscope, followed by MetaMorph Imaging Software with Autoquant 3D digital deconvolution. For higher resolution images, we used the Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 LT+ Digital CMOS camera attached to a Leica SP8X confocal microscope at ×40 magnification. All images for the same experiment were captured at the same exposure time. Images were analysed using ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html</ext-link>), with fluorescence calculated by taking the difference of the background fluorescence from the mean intestinal or whole-worm fluorescence.

For the micrographs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, image brightness and contrast were adjusted in ImageJ to best visualize the number of foci present in each seam cell; importantly, the same adjustment was consistently applied throughout the whole image.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that your findings are interesting and have the potential to provide important new insight into hypoxia responses in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, there are a number of areas where the reviewers feel that the conclusions your paper draws are not fully supported by the data. Additionally, for the paper to provide the level of biological insight that would be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers feel some additional issues need to be addressed.</p><p>Based on the individual reviewer comments below, the following points must be addressed in a revised version.</p><p>(1) Autophagy. The reviewers feel that the link between hypoxia, nhr-49, and autophagy is one of the most important insights provided by your work. However, the role of autophagy in hypoxia, and its reliance on nhr-49, needs to be better substantiated.</p><p>a. As pointed out by Reviewers 2 and 3, the sample size for the experiments in Figure 3F and Supp Figure 4B are quite small. Together with the high variance in your measurements, it is unlikely that these experiments have the power to detect differences that could be present when comparing WT vs nhr-49 backgrounds. Please increase sample sizes here, ideally guided by power size calculations. As Reviewer 3 suggests, it may also be useful to consider altering the experimental conditions.</p><p>b. Please confirm the changes in expression of autophagy genes, and their dependence on nhr-49, by RT-PCR.</p><p>c. As suggested by reviewer 1, please examine autophagosome formation directly (e.g., with LGG-1::GFP) under hypoxic conditions, in WT, nhr-49, and hif-1 animals.</p><p>(2) Site of action of NHR-49. Reviewers 1 and 2 raise concerns about the interpretation and significance of these findings.</p><p>a. Please provide additional information on the site of NHR-49 induction by hypoxia, e.g., with high-magnification images.</p><p>b. Please confirm the specificity of the protective effects of NHR-49 overexpression by (i) examining body-wall-specific and pharyngeal-muscle-specific overexpression as suggested by Reviewer 2 OR (ii) using tissue-specific RNAi as suggested by Reviewer 1.</p><p>(3) RNAseq data. As suggested by Reviewer 1, please clarify the analysis presented in Figure 3A,B and, if possible, compare your results with other hypoxia transcriptome data that may have been previously reported.</p><p>(4) Interactions between NHR-67 and NHR-49.</p><p>a. As suggested by Reviewers 1 and 2, please examine transcriptional reporters for nhr-49 and nhr-67 in hypoxia and normoxia, in both wild-type and nhr-49/67 mutants.</p><p>b. Please investigate genetic interactions: is nhr-67 synthetic lethal with hif-1 and/or nhr-49 in the context of hypoxia survival?</p><p>c. As Reviewer 2 suggests, it would also be useful to determine whether specific subsets of hypoxia response genes are dependent on nhr-67, though this is not considered essential.</p><p>(5) Regulation of NHR-49 by HPK-1.</p><p>a. The reviewers consider the proposed mechanism to be quite speculative. If possible, it would be ideal for you to determine whether NHR-49 becomes phosphorylated under hypoxia, and whether this depends on hpk-1, as suggested by Reviewer 2, or whether the localization of NHR-49 changes under these conditions, as suggested by Reviewer 3. Alternatively, please modify the text and figures to make it clear that this part of your model has not been tested and that the regulation of nhr-49 by hpk-1 could be indirect.</p><p>b. To substantiate the connections between hpk-1, nhr-49, and autophagy, please determine whether the upregulation of autophagy genes requires hpk-1.</p><p>(6) In a number of places, the interpretation of your results should be softened. One example of this is lines 150-151 (Figure S1B). ~95% of WT animals are adults at 48 hr but 85% of nhr-49 mutants are still L3 and L4. However, you claim that &quot;mutants did not significantly develop slower than wildtype&quot;. If so, a different test needs to be carried out, or sample sizes need to be increased, because it seems clear that there is a difference in developmental rate between these groups. Other examples where conclusions need to be tempered are provided in the reviewer comments below.</p><p>In addition to these points, please also consider the other issues raised by the reviewers (see below) as you prepare your revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. To address Major Concern 2, the authors should confirm their RNA-seq results on new samples via qRT-PCR and also test whether autophagosomes are formed under hypoxic conditions (LGG-1::GFP), which should be dependent on nhr-49 but not hif-1 (if the authors model is true). The authors should expand their discussion to explain how increased autophagy would protect against hypoxia (metabolic shift for anaerobic respiration, decreased proteome reduces energetic demands, etc.).</p><p>2. To address Major Concerns 3 and 4, the authors should use tissue specific RNAi or hairpins to inactivate nhr-49 and assess whether loss in any one tissue compromises hypoxic response/survival. Additionally, if ectopic overexpression of NHR-49 within one tissue does indirectly protect other tissues through an adaptive response, one would predict that overexpressing NHR-49 in one tissue would mute the induction of NHR-49 a neighboring tissue after hypoxic treatment. This could be tested easily via combining their nhr-49p::NHR-49::GFP reporter and tissue specific overexpression of NHR-49. The authors should consider testing this possibility.</p><p>3. I strongly suggest avoiding the use of &quot;worms&quot; in formal manuscripts and use &quot;animals&quot; instead. It's jargon and diminishes the impact of <italic>C. elegans</italic> research when read by scientists using other systems.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Figure 3F – These results are very crucial for the main conclusion of this study. Since RNAi produces more variable results across biological replicates, this experiment should be repeated with some of the autophagy mutants such as unc-51 etc.</p><p>– The sample sizes for the RNAi experiments in Figure 3F do not seem to be enough to capture the differences in hypoxia survival between WT and nhr-49 mutant conditions: 41% vs 25% (atg-7), 27% vs 13% (bec-1) and 38% vs 13% (epg-3). None of these differences were detected as statistically significant. This is likely due to n = 4 for RNAi treatments of the nhr-49 mutant and very high variability across biological replicates. The authors should at least double their sample sizes for these conditions and test whether there are any significant differences in hypoxia survival between WT and nhr-49 mutant when autophagy is inhibited. Similarly, in Supplementary Figure 4B, some of the autophagy gene RNAi conditions seem to reduce survival by 25% (with some data points showing greater than 50% reduction) even in normoxia. None of these differences were detected as statistically significant, which again is likely due to low sample sizes and high variability across replicates. These experiments need to be carefully designed so that there is enough statistical power to discern whether nhr-49 and autophagy are regulating hypoxia survival via the same or independent pathways and whether autophagy inhibition reduces survival also in normoxia.</p><p>– For tissue-specific rescue of nhr-49 (data shown in Figure 4B), the authors should also perform a body wall muscle-specific rescue experiment. Since nhr-49 is expressed in the muscles, it will be informative to know whether body wall muscle-specific nhr-49 function is sufficient to improve hypoxia survival at the organism level. In addition, a pharyngeal muscle-specific nhr-49 rescue might serve as a good negative control, where tissue-specific rescue might not be able to affect whole organism hypoxia survival.</p><p>– To confirm the bidirectional regulation between nhr-49 and nhr-67, the authors should create a gfp transcriptional reporter for nhr-67 and test whether nhr-49 inhibition affects nhr-67 expression in hypoxia and normoxia. The RNA-seq data shown in Figure 5A suggests that NHR-49 possibly regulates nhr-67 expression only in hypoxic conditions, but it will be informative to know whether this regulation is restricted to specific tissues. In comparison, NHR-67 seems to be regulating nhr-49 expression predominantly in the intestine in both normoxia and hypoxia (line 309).</p><p>– The physiological relevance of the bidirectional negative regulation between nhr-49 and nhr-67 is not clear. Inhibition of both nhr genes reduces survival in hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Figure 5D). While this study has found downstream targets of nhr-49 that promote hypoxia survival, it is not clear how nhr-67 fits into this regulation. In this regard, the authors should investigate two directions: (1) does nhr-67 also show synthetic lethal interactions with hif-1 and nhr-49 in the context of hypoxia survival (similar to Figure 2A)?, and (2) does nhr-67 inhibition in hypoxic conditions prevent the activation of a specific subset of hypoxia response genes, such as genes involved in detoxification and autophagy?</p><p>– The authors propose that survival during hypoxia is predominantly due to the upregulation of autophagy genes, but not due to upregulation of fmo-2 and acs-2 (lines 222-224). However, they have only tested whether hpk-1 removal alters the expression of fmo-2 and acs-2 genes (Figures 6A-E). To mechanistically elucidate whether HPK-1 and NHR-49 are acting via the same pathway to promote hypoxia survival (as suggested in Figure 6F), it should be tested whether hpk-1 mutation impairs the upregulation of autophagy genes during hypoxia.</p><p>– The role of HPK-1 in stabilizing NHR-49 during hypoxia is a novel finding that is of broad interest. In its current form, the proposed mechanism is quite speculative. Since this regulation is central to the proposed HIF-1-independent hypoxia response pathway, the authors should investigate whether NHR-49 is phosphorylated in low oxygen conditions in an HPK-1-dependent manner. A simple way to test this would be to use the nhr-49::gfp translational reporter strain and prepare whole worm extracts in normoxia and hypoxia conditions. An immunoblot using GFP antibody would show whether there is an upward shift in the NHR-49::GFP band size in hypoxic conditions, which should be reversible after CIP treatment of the whole worm extracts. This experiment can also be performed in the hpk-1 mutant background to validate where the NHR-49 phosphorylation is dependent on HPK-1. An alternative way to test this would be immunoprecipitating NHR-49::GFP protein in normoxia and hypoxic conditions and immunoblotting with phospho-Ser and phospho-Thr antibodies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Question on results presented by author:</p><p>– Expression of fmo-2 increases in hypoxia (0.5%) in a nhr-49 and hif-1 dependent manner; approach was qRT-PCR and Pfmo-2::gfp reporter in wildtype and mutants.</p><p>– Figure 1A- large deviation in fmo-2 mRNA fold change in.5% hypoxia.

The reviewers feel that the link between hypoxia, nhr-49, and autophagy is one of the most important insights provided by your work. However, the role of autophagy in hypoxia, and its reliance on nhr-49, needs to be better substantiated.</p><p>a. As pointed out by Reviewers 2 and 3, the sample size for the experiments in Figure 3F and Supp Figure 4B are quite small. Together with the high variance in your measurements, it is unlikely that these experiments have the power to detect differences that could be present when comparing WT vs nhr-49 backgrounds. Please increase sample sizes here, ideally guided by power size calculations. As Reviewer 3 suggests, it may also be useful to consider altering the experimental conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the evidence in our initial manuscript did not convincingly link autophagy gene function to hypoxia survival and the <italic>nhr-49</italic> pathway. To overcome variability issues with RNAi, we instead studied functional requirements with mutants in two autophagy genes: <italic>lgg-2</italic> and <italic>epg-6</italic>. Analysis of <italic>lgg-2</italic> and <italic>epg-6</italic> single mutants and double mutants of these genes with the <italic>nhr-49</italic> mutant showed that mutation of each of these genes reduced hypoxia resistance, which was not exacerbated by concomitant <italic>nhr-49</italic> mutation. This provides strong support for our conclusion that autophagy contributes to hypoxia adaptation via the <italic>nhr-49</italic> pathway. These new results are presented in Figure 4E, F.

The only other paper that we found with hypoxia-normoxia transcriptome data is Shen et al., 2005. Comparing our gene list to the list from this paper, we found that 24 of 110 genes identified by Shen are also hypoxia-inducible in our study (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). This may appear low, but likely reflects the fact that Shen et al., studied different conditions and used different analysis and processing approaches (L3 larval stage by Shen, L4 by us; 0.1% O<sub>2</sub> by Shen, 0.5% O<sub>2</sub> by us; microarrays by Shen, RNA-seq by us).

The reviewers consider the proposed mechanism to be quite speculative. If possible, it would be ideal for you to determine whether NHR-49 becomes phosphorylated under hypoxia, and whether this depends on hpk-1, as suggested by Reviewer 2, or whether the localization of NHR-49 changes under these conditions, as suggested by Reviewer 3. Alternatively, please modify the text and figures to make it clear that this part of your model has not been tested and that the regulation of nhr-49 by hpk-1 could be indirect.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to investigate how HPK-1 may regulate NHR-49, but pilot experiments to study effects on NHR-49 did not reliably identify bands that might reflect phosphorylated NHR-49.

As noted in the response to comment 1b, hypoxia induction of autophagy gene expression (promoter-GFP reporters) and of autophagosome formation (LGG-1::GFP foci) showed strong reliance on <italic>hpk-1</italic>, supporting our core findings (Figure 4A, B, G, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In a number of places, the interpretation of your results should be softened.

However, you claim that &quot;mutants did not significantly develop slower than wildtype&quot;.

To address Major Concern 2, the authors should confirm their RNA-seq results on new samples via qRT-PCR and also test whether autophagosomes are formed under hypoxic conditions (LGG-1::GFP), which should be dependent on nhr-49 but not hif-1 (if the authors model is true). The authors should expand their discussion to explain how increased autophagy would protect against hypoxia (metabolic shift for anaerobic respiration, decreased proteome reduces energetic demands, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have performed validation experiments for our RNA-seq and studied autophagosomes, as detailed above (Editor Comment #1). To address putative protective effects of autophagy in hypoxia, we have edited the text in the discussion on lines 892-900.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To address Major Concerns 3 and 4, the authors should use tissue specific RNAi or hairpins to inactivate nhr-49 and assess whether loss in any one tissue compromises hypoxic response/survival. Additionally, if ectopic overexpression of NHR-49 within one tissue does indirectly protect other tissues through an adaptive response, one would predict that overexpressing NHR-49 in one tissue would mute the induction of NHR-49 a neighboring tissue after hypoxic treatment. This could be tested easily via combining their nhr-49p::NHR-49::GFP reporter and tissue specific overexpression of NHR-49. The authors should consider testing this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>With regards to the use of tissue specific RNAi, please see above (Editor Comment # 2b).</p><p>With regards to the second proposed experiment, this is not feasible because the tissue-specific NHR-49 overexpression strains also all bear the NHR-49 GFP fusion as well as the same transgenic marker; these existing strains can therefore not be used to generate the proposed double transgenic strains by crossing. In addition, the nhr-49p::NHR-49::GFP strain already substantially overexpresses NHR-49, and we hesitate introducing another gain-of-function transgene into this genetic context; interpretation of resulting data might be tricky, as pointed out by the reviewer themselves. We have therefore opted not to pursue this line of investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I strongly suggest avoiding the use of &quot;worms&quot; in formal manuscripts and use &quot;animals&quot; instead. It's jargon and diminishes the impact of <italic>C. elegans</italic> research when read by scientists using other systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and have corrected the terminology throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Figure 3F – These results are very crucial for the main conclusion of this study. Since RNAi produces more variable results across biological replicates, this experiment should be repeated with some of the autophagy mutants such as unc-51 etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for this suggestion. As requested, we have done these experiments using mutants in autophagy genes. Please see above (Editor Comment #1a) for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The sample sizes for the RNAi experiments in Figure 3F do not seem to be enough to capture the differences in hypoxia survival between WT and nhr-49 mutant conditions: 41% vs 25% (atg-7), 27% vs 13% (bec-1) and 38% vs 13% (epg-3). None of these differences were detected as statistically significant. This is likely due to n = 4 for RNAi treatments of the nhr-49 mutant and very high variability across biological replicates. The authors should at least double their sample sizes for these conditions and test whether there are any significant differences in hypoxia survival between WT and nhr-49 mutant when autophagy is inhibited. Similarly, in Supplementary Figure 4B, some of the autophagy gene RNAi conditions seem to reduce survival by 25% (with some data points showing greater than 50% reduction) even in normoxia. None of these differences were detected as statistically significant, which again is likely due to low sample sizes and high variability across replicates. These experiments need to be carefully designed so that there is enough statistical power to discern whether nhr-49 and autophagy are regulating hypoxia survival via the same or independent pathways and whether autophagy inhibition reduces survival also in normoxia.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and in our revised manuscript have redone this analysis with autophagy mutant strains, which strongly supports our conclusions. Please see above for details (Editor Comment #1a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For tissue-specific rescue of nhr-49 (data shown in Figure 4B), the authors should also perform a body wall muscle-specific rescue experiment. Since nhr-49 is expressed in the muscles, it will be informative to know whether body wall muscle-specific nhr-49 function is sufficient to improve hypoxia survival at the organism level. In addition, a pharyngeal muscle-specific nhr-49 rescue might serve as a good negative control, where tissue-specific rescue might not be able to affect whole organism hypoxia survival.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested we have added experiments with a body wall muscle-specific rescue strain, which also provides functional rescue. Please see above for details (Editor Comment # 2b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To confirm the bidirectional regulation between nhr-49 and nhr-67, the authors should create a gfp transcriptional reporter for nhr-67 and test whether nhr-49 inhibition affects nhr-67 expression in hypoxia and normoxia. The RNA-seq data shown in Figure 5A suggests that NHR-49 possibly regulates nhr-67 expression only in hypoxic conditions, but it will be informative to know whether this regulation is restricted to specific tissues. In comparison, NHR-67 seems to be regulating nhr-49 expression predominantly in the intestine in both normoxia and hypoxia (line 309).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested we have further investigated the relationship between NHR-49 and NHR-67. Please see above (Editor Comment #4a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The physiological relevance of the bidirectional negative regulation between nhr-49 and nhr-67 is not clear. Inhibition of both nhr genes reduces survival in hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Figure 5D). While this study has found downstream targets of nhr-49 that promote hypoxia survival, it is not clear how nhr-67 fits into this regulation. In this regard, the authors should investigate two directions: (1) does nhr-67 also show synthetic lethal interactions with hif-1 and nhr-49 in the context of hypoxia survival (similar to Figure 2A)?, and (2) does nhr-67 inhibition in hypoxic conditions prevent the activation of a specific subset of hypoxia response genes, such as genes involved in detoxification and autophagy?</p></disp-quote><p>We further examined crosstalk between <italic>nhr-67</italic> and the other two regulators; in response to (1), our data suggest that <italic>nhr-67</italic> loss interacts genetically with <italic>hif-1</italic> loss, showing that they act in separate pathways; in response to (2), we observed that depletion of <italic>nhr-67</italic> did not affect the induction of autophagy gene reporters or autophagosomes by hypoxia. For details, please see above (Editor Comment #4b, 4c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors propose that survival during hypoxia is predominantly due to the upregulation of autophagy genes, but not due to upregulation of fmo-2 and acs-2 (lines 222-224). However, they have only tested whether hpk-1 removal alters the expression of fmo-2 and acs-2 genes (Figures 6A-E). To mechanistically elucidate whether HPK-1 and NHR-49 are acting via the same pathway to promote hypoxia survival (as suggested in Figure 6F), it should be tested whether hpk-1 mutation impairs the upregulation of autophagy genes during hypoxia.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we not only tested whether <italic>hpk-1</italic> regulates the expression of autophagy related genes in hypoxia, but also assessed whether it is required for autophagosome formation, both of which excitingly is the case, in agreement with our model. For details, please see above (Editor Comment #1b, 3b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The role of HPK-1 in stabilizing NHR-49 during hypoxia is a novel finding that is of broad interest. In its current form, the proposed mechanism is quite speculative. Since this regulation is central to the proposed HIF-1-independent hypoxia response pathway, the authors should investigate whether NHR-49 is phosphorylated in low oxygen conditions in an HPK-1-dependent manner. A simple way to test this would be to use the nhr-49::gfp translational reporter strain and prepare whole worm extracts in normoxia and hypoxia conditions. An immunoblot using GFP antibody would show whether there is an upward shift in the NHR-49::GFP band size in hypoxic conditions, which should be reversible after CIP treatment of the whole worm extracts. This experiment can also be performed in the hpk-1 mutant background to validate where the NHR-49 phosphorylation is dependent on HPK-1. An alternative way to test this would be immunoprecipitating NHR-49::GFP protein in normoxia and hypoxic conditions and immunoblotting with phospho-Ser and phospho-Thr antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to investigate NHR-49 phosphorylation but were unable to conclusively identify phosphorylated NHR-49. In line with the suggestion of the editor, we have therefore tempered our interpretation of the role of HPK-1 in NHR-49 regulation.

Any experimental reasons why such is observed?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that these deviations are rather large; however, importantly, they are statistically significant. We do not have a clear explanation for the large variability – worms are all at the same stage, and are exposed for same time. Potentially, post-hypoxia harvesting procedures vary by minutes such that changes manifest due to normoxia exposure during the washing and harvesting procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The nhr-49 mutant does not survive 24 hrs 0.5% hypoxia (exposed as embryos) well or if exposed as L1 larvae, the post hypoxia larvae do not progress to L4 stage (24-hour exposure, allowed to develop to L4 stage). The nhr-1 mutant a similar survival rate as hif-1 mutants; whereas the double mutant was significantly lower. These data suggest separate pathways and that nhr-49 is required for adaptation to hypoxia.</p><p>– Were the nhr-49 L1 larvae exposed to hypoxia arrested or growing slow after hypoxia exposure (eventually reach L4/adult stage)?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not test whether arrested worms eventually reach adulthood. Anecdotally, we have observed that worms able reach the L3 or L4 stage eventually develop into adults, whereas animals arrested at the L1 or L2 stages remain permanently arrested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The hydrogen sulfide experiment separated out the role nhr-49 has in stress responses that hif-1 has.</p><p>– Authors took a transcriptomic approach (N2, nhr-49 and hif-1 mutants, normoxia/hypoxia). Results show 315 upregulated and 177 downregulated were dependent on nhr-49; 83 upregulated and 51 downregulated were hif-1 independent. Subset of gene expression responses to hypoxia are nhr-49 dependent. Based on transcriptomic data – of the 83 genes that require nhr-49 but not hif-1 for upregulation in hypoxia genes classified as autophagy and detoxification were enriched (Figure 3D).</p><p>– Supplementary files- present these as excel files or tables that communicate more data (wormbase ID, gene identification, gene name, gene description, classification based on GO terms or perhaps use wormCat and if category is significantly represented).

The fmo-2;acs-2 double mutant sensitive to hypoxia (embryo); individually hypoxia survival was overall not reduced. Reduction in autophagy genes via RNAi reduced hypoxia survival (atg-10, atg-7, atg-7, bec-1 and epg-3) in N2 and nhr-49 background.</p><p>– Line 235, line 238, Figure 3F- standard deviation not noted in text but the figure indicates it is large – authors have an indication as to why individual experiments vary, what is this due to? Have authors tried longer hypoxia exposures? This may intensify the hypoxia sensitivity and reduce variability in capacity to survive/develop after hypoxia exposure. I am not suggesting to redo all the hypoxia exposure experiments but something to keep in mind and consider to determine essential nature of the autophagy process in hypoxia.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it was important to provide further evidence showing that autophagy genes are important for hypoxia adaptation and have done as requested. For details, please see above (Editor Comment #1a).</p><p>We appreciate the idea to performing longer hypoxia survival assays to reduce variability, and we have done so in Figure 5A.

In pilot experiments, anecdotally, we observe slight upregulation directly after hypoxia; however, most of the GFP is made only once the worms return to normoxia because many of the translation steps involved in GFP production require oxygen.
