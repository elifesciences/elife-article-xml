In the retina, spontaneous activity comes in the form of retinal waves, comprised of three stages persisting from embryonic day 16 (E16) to eye opening at postnatal day 14 (P14). Though postnatal retinal waves have been well characterized, little is known about the spatiotemporal properties or the mechanisms mediating embryonic retinal waves, designated stage 1 waves. Using a custom-built macroscope to record spontaneous calcium transients from whole embryonic retinas, we show that stage 1 waves are initiated at several locations across the retina and propagate across a broad range of areas. Blocking gap junctions reduced the frequency and size of stage 1 waves, nearly abolishing them. Global blockade of nAChRs similarly nearly abolished stage 1 waves. Thus, stage 1 waves are mediated by a complex circuitry involving subtypes of nAChRs and gap junctions. Stage 1 waves in mice lacking the β2 subunit of the nAChRs (β2-nAChR-KO) persisted with altered propagation properties and were abolished by a gap junction blocker. To assay the impact of stage 1 waves on retinal development, we compared the spatial distribution of a subtype of retinal ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which undergo a significant amount of cell death, in WT and β2-nAChR-KO mice. We found that the developmental decrease in ipRGC density is preserved between WT and β2-nAChR-KO mice, indicating that processes regulating ipRGC numbers and distributions are not influenced by spontaneous activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spontaneous activity</kwd><kwd>embryonic</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1EY013528</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feller</surname><given-names>Marla B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1EY019498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feller</surname><given-names>Marla B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30EY003176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feller</surname><given-names>Marla B</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Benjamin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99EY030909</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tiriac</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Calcium imaging reveals spatiotemporal properties of correlated spontaneous activity in the embryonic retina and implicates a role for electrical and chemical synapses in generating the activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout the developing nervous system, spontaneous activity is observed before neural circuits are fully formed and sensory transduction begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akin and Zipursky, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luhmann and Khazipov, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martini et al., 2021</xref>). This activity is implicated in several development events, including cell death, maturation of functional circuits, and refinement of axonal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blanquie et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kirkby et al., 2013</xref>). This is well studied in the developing visual system, where prior to the maturation of vision, laterally propagating spontaneous depolarizations sweep across retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a pattern referred to as retinal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wong, 1999</xref>). Retinal waves drive eye-specific segregation and retinotopic refinement of retinal projections to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ackman and Crair, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arroyo and Feller, 2016</xref>). Retinal waves also play a role in the maturation of direction-selectivity within the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tiriac et al., 2022</xref>) and superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ge et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), as well as the development of retinal vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biswas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weiner et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Retinal waves are present throughout mouse retinal development, starting as early as embryonic day 16 and persisting until postnatal day 14, which is around the time of eye opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feller and Kerschensteiner, 2013</xref>). As the retina develops, the circuits that mediate waves change. Stage 2 retinal waves, observed between postnatal day 1 and 10 (P1–10), are mediated via activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) by acetylcholine (ACh) released from starburst amacrine cells (SACs). Stage 3 retinal waves, observed between P10 and 14, are mediated via activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors by glutamate released from bipolar cells.</p><p>Stage 1 waves are perhaps the least well understood, yet they are concurrent with many important events in retinal development as well as with retinal projections reaching their targets in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martini et al., 2021</xref>). Stage 1 waves are present in mice between embryonic day 16 and 18 (E16–18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bansal et al., 2000</xref>) and in rabbit starting at E22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Syed et al., 2004</xref>). In rabbit, stage 1 waves persist in the presence of pharmacological antagonists of fast neurotransmitters and are blocked by gap junction antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Syed et al., 2004</xref>). In mice, stage 1 waves consist of large propagating waves and small non-propagating events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bansal et al., 2000</xref>). The application of nAChR antagonist inhibits larger propagating waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bansal et al., 2000</xref>). Though there is no anatomical evidence of synapses as early as E16–18, recent work has shown that SACs are present embryonically, begin to migrate to the inner nuclear layer (INL), and send projections to the inner plexiform layer (IPL) guided by homotypic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ray et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, cholinergic signaling is likely occurring via the volumetric release of ACh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ford et al., 2012</xref>). The relative contribution of gap junction coupling and cholinergic signaling to the spatiotemporal properties of stage 1 waves remains to be understood.</p><p>Here we describe the spatiotemporal properties of stage 1 waves across the whole retina using a novel macroscope. We then identify the role of gap junction and cholinergic circuits on the generation and propagation of stage 1 waves. Next, we explore stage 1 waves in the β2-nAChR-KO mouse, which is the canonical mouse model for studying the role of stage 2 waves in developmental processes, and report that this mouse also exhibits altered stage 1 activity. Finally, we use β2-nAChR-KO mice to demonstrate that the regulation of ipRGC density is a wave-independent process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Macroscope imaging reveals the spatiotemporal properties of stage 1 retinal waves</title><p>The mouse retina at E16–18 exhibits spontaneous correlated transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bansal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Syed et al., 2004</xref>), termed stage 1 retinal waves, despite the immature state of retinal circuits. At E16–18, several postmitotic cell types are present in the retina, including broad classes of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and amacrine cells (ACs), as well as proliferating progenitors which will go on to produce cells such as rods, bipolar cells, and Muller glia postnatally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cepko, 2014</xref>).

The lines connect recordings that were paired – namely control and MFA application were conducted in the same cell. We observed a small increase in input resistance, consistent with a blockade of gap junctions. The variance in the voltage-gated sodium channel is consistent with the tremendous variability of ability of RGCs to fire action potentials at this young age, when different RGC types are maturing at different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rothe et al., 1999</xref>). Statistical significance was assessed based on unpaired t-test. Methods for voltage-clamp recordings: Whole-mount retinas were held in the recording chamber by a harp and visualized using a Kohler illumination system mounted below the objective of the microscope. Presumptive RGCs were identified by their location in the immature ganglion cell layer. A hole was pierced in the inner limiting membrane of the retina using a glass recording pipette to access the RGC layer. RGCs were targeted under control of a micromanipulator (MP-225, Sutter Instruments). Recording pipettes were fabricated using a vertical puller (Narishige PC-10) and had a tip resistance of 6–7 MU. Internal solution for voltage-clamp recordings was, in mM: 116 K+D-gluconate, 6 KCl, 2 NaCl, 20 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 4 ATP-Mg2+, 0.3 GTP-Na3, 10 phosphocreatine-Na2. Data were acquired using Clampex 10.2 recording software with a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices) and a Digidata 1322A digitizer (Axon Instruments). Voltage-clamp recordings were sampled at 10 kHz. Input resistance was computed by measuring the change in holding current in response to a –10 mV voltage change. Voltage-gated sodium currents were measured as the maximum inward current evoked by step depolarizations to between –30 or –20 mV.

Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we observed that MFA induced a significant decrease in voltage-activated potassium conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Note that a reduction in K+ conductance would increase excitability of cells and is therefore unlikely to be the reason for the observed decrease in wave activity in the presence of MFA. Hence, we conclude that MFA’s block on retinal waves is via their impact on gap junctions.</p><p>We next assayed the impact on nAChR-antagonists on stage 1 waves. For stage 2 waves, both spontaneous calcium transients and compound excitatory synaptic events are completely blocked by bath application of dihydro-ß-erythroidine hydrobromide (DHβE, 8 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ford et al., 2012</xref>), which preferentially targets nAChRs containing α4 and β2-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harvey and Luetje, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harvey et al., 1996</xref>). We found that DHβE also dramatically reduced activity associated with stage 1 retinal waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-H</xref>). However, in contrast to stage 2, some waves persisted in the presence of DHβE, but recruited fewer neurons and therefore had smaller areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Stage 1 waves were blocked by general nAChR antagonists: both hexamethonium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I-J</xref>; Hex, 100 μM), a non-selective nAChR antagonist, and epibatidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K-L</xref>; EPB, 10 nM), an nAChR agonist that potently desensitizes all nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Corrie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spang et al., 2000</xref>), blocked stage 1 wave events.

Hence, we conclude that light activation of ipRGCs does not significantly influence the spatiotemporal properties of stage 1 retinal waves in either WT or the β2 nAChR-KO retinas. These results are consistent with the fact that light stimulation of the retina does not modulate the frequency of stage 2 waves and only begins to do so when conventional photoreceptors come online during stage 3 waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tiriac et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Renna et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ipRGCs participate in stage 1 waves but their density and distribution are not altered in the β2-nAChRs-KO</title><p>RGCs undergo a period of dramatic cell death during the first two postnatal weeks of development, the majority occurring during the first postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abed et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Braunger et al., 2014</xref>).

We found that β2-nAChR-KO retinas exhibited the same density of ipRGCs at P1 as WT retinas, suggesting that the decrease in activity in stage 1 waves does not regulate ipRGC cell density. Like WTs, β2-nAChR-KO retinas also exhibited a decrease in the density of ipRGCs from P1 to P7 (p=4.99 × 10<sup>–11</sup>). At P7, we observed a small but significant increase in ipRGC densities at P7 in β2-nAChR-KO mice than in WT mice (568 ± 33 ipRGCs/µm<sup>2</sup> in WT vs. 654 ± 78 ipRGCs/µm<sup>2</sup> in β2-nAChR-KO, n = 8 retinas in each genotype). We cannot determine whether this small difference is due to the smaller size of retinas in β2-nAChR-KO retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 1999</xref>) or reflects a true increase in cell number. Overall, these data indicate that the cell death processes that regulate ipRGC density during the first postnatal week persist despite a significant reduction in wave activity.</p><p>To determine the impact of this developmental decrease in cell density on the mosaic organization of ipRGCs, we computed the regularity index, which is equal to the average nearest-neighbor distance divided by the standard deviation. A large regularity index is associated with a non-random distribution of somas. Despite the expected increase in nearest-neighbor distance in WT and β2-nAChR-KOs retina between P1 and P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), there was only a small decrease in the regularity index. Interestingly, the measured mean regularity indices of 2.8 ± 0.12 (WT P1), 2.9 ± 0.16 (β2-nAChR-KO P1), 2.3 ± 0.13 (WT P7) and 2.6 ± 0.2 (β2-nAChR-KO P1) fall within the range of what would be predicted by a random distribution of cells with soma diameters between 7–10 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keeley et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, the decrease in cell density does not appear make the soma organization more ordered. This might be expected since our analysis does not differentiate between ipRGC subtypes, each of which likely forms an independent retinal mosaic. Together these data indicate that although retinal waves provide a robust source of depolarization for embryonic and early postnatal ipRGCs, reducing wave activity does not significantly influence the processes that regulate their density or organization. Whether elimination of all spontaneous activity affects these processes remains to be determined.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Nearest-neighbor distances (NND) and regularity indices for intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells (ipRGCs) labeled in <italic>Opn4<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Ai9</italic> mice.</title><p>Data represented as averages ± SD.

Stage 1 waves initiate throughout the retina, propagate over finite regions of varying size, and drive periodic depolarizations of neurons in the immature retinal GCL. In WT embryonic mice, stage 1 waves are abolished in the presence of general nAChR antagonists but persist, albeit with greatly reduced cell participation, in an nAChR antagonist that targets α4β2 containing nAChRs. In the presence of gap junction antagonists, the frequency and participation of cells within waves is also greatly diminished, though some waves still occur. We found that in retinas isolated from embryonic β2-nAChR-KO mice, which exhibit strongly reduced stage 2 wave frequency, waves persisted both in control conditions and in the presence of a general nAChR antagonist, though the area of waves is greatly diminished compared to WT. However, similar to what we observed in WT mice, the frequency of stage 1 waves in β2-nAChR-KO mice was greatly reduced in the presence of a gap junction antagonist. This more striking effect of the gap junction antagonist compared to the general nAChR antagonist indicates that the electrical synapses are sufficient to generate waves in β2-nAChR-KO mice. Finally, we showed that ipRGCs are depolarized by stage 1 waves, but that the decrease in density of ipRGCs across early postnatal development was unaffected in the β2-nAChR-KO mouse, indicating that the proliferation and cell death processes that influence ipRGC density are not dependent on normal patterns of wave activity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Distinctions and similarities between stage 1 and stage 2 waves</title><p>Our findings support a model in which there are both key differences and some similarities between stage 1 and 2 waves. The distribution of ITI is peaked at roughly 80 s for stage 1 waves that is a slightly longer interval than the peak interval reported for stage 2 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> here to Figure 7D in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ford et al., 2012</xref>). Stage 1 and 2 waves also propagate at similar speeds. Key differences are that spontaneous activity between E16 and E18 included small non-propagating transients and propagating waves of a broad range of sizes. In contrast, after P1, there are no small non-propagating transients, and stage 2 waves mostly propagate over large areas of the retina, as observed both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hilgen et al., 2017</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>). Note the spatiotemporal properties of stage 2 waves also vary dramatically across the developmental period spanning P1–P10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ge et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hilgen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maccione et al., 2014</xref>) and therefore we are making these comparisons to the earlier stage 2 waves.</p><p>The similarity in frequency of waves and propagation speed indicates that the mechanisms responsible for initiating and propagating large waves are similar for stage 1 and 2 waves. Indeed, stage 1 and 2 waves share a dependence on nAChR signaling. Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) are the sole source of ACh in the retina. During the period of development concurrent with stage 1 waves, SACs begin to migrate toward the INL and send projections to the IPL via homotypic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ray et al., 2018</xref>). Also during this period, SACs start to express choline acetyltransferase at E17 in the rat retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2000</xref>), equivalent to E15.5 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneider and Norton, 1979</xref>), and show a response to nicotine in the fetal rabbit retina between E20 and 27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wong, 1995</xref>), corresponding to stage 1 and 2 waves in rabbit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Syed et al., 2004</xref>). Together these studies support the idea that during embryonic development, SACs are not only releasing ACh but also forming a cholinergic network, similar to that of stage 2 wave propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ford and Feller, 2012</xref>). Here, we have shown that stage 1 waves fail to initiate in the presence of the general nAChR antagonists, hexamethonium (Hex) and epibatidine (EPB). This suggests that spontaneous depolarization of SACs is important for wave initiation and that the cholinergic circuits that mediates waves start earlier than expected.</p><p>One key difference in ACh signaling between stage 1 and 2 waves is their sensitivity to the specific nAChR antagonist, DHβE. Though DHβE reduced the number of stage 1 waves, many smaller calcium transients persisted. In contrast, DHβE is a potent blocker of all activity during stage 2 waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ford et al., 2012</xref>). DHβE is an nAChR antagonist with a greater affinity for nAChRs containing α4 and β2 subunits in heterologous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Papke et al., 2010</xref>). The fact that all stage 1 wave activity is blocked by Hex and EPB suggests that different subunit combinations of nAChRs, on both SACs and RGCs, are independently contributing to either the initiation or propagation of stage 1 waves.</p><p>The different sensitivity to nAChR antagonists between stage 1 and 2 waves is highlighted in the patterns of retinal waves in β2-nAChR-KO mice. β2-nAChR-KO mice have significantly reduced stage 2 cholinergic waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bansal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burbridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2016</xref>) and as such have served as the canonical model for studying the role of stage 2 cholinergic waves in eye-specific segregation, retinotopic maps, retinal and collicular direction selectivity, and in the optokinetic reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arroyo and Feller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grubb et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thompson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tiriac et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, stage 1 waves in the β2-nAChR-KO mice persist, albeit they propagate with slower speed and cover smaller areas of the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Despite this difference in spatiotemporal properties, both stage 1 and 2 waves that persist in the β2-nAChR-KO mice are blocked by gap junction receptor antagonist rather than blockers of fast neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kirkby and Feller, 2013</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that embryonic activity throughout developing sensory system may influence many aspects of visual systems development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Juan et al., 2023</xref>). Whether the various visual system phenotypes observed in β2-nAChR-KO mice can be attributed in part to reduced stage 1 waves remains to be determined.</p><p>In our hands, global blockade or desensitization of nAChRs completely abolished stage 1 waves. This result appears to conflict with previous studies in mice showing that application of curare, a competitive antagonist for nAChRs, preserves small non-propagating transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bansal et al., 2000</xref>). One possibility is that in contrast to hexamethonium, curare has mixed affinity for neuronal nAChRs. A second is that curare was acting via other neurotransmitter receptors where it has some cross-reactivity not shared by the receptor antagonists that we used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spirova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wotring and Yoon, 1995</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the ACh signaling, gap junctions also play a role in mediating stage 1 retinal waves. Here, we use the gap junction antagonist meclofenamic acid (MFA), which was previously shown to reversibly block junctional conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Veruki and Hartveit, 2009</xref>), dye coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2007</xref>), and spikelets between developing RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caval-Holme et al., 2019</xref>). Application of MFA led to a significant reduction in both the frequency and size of stage 1 waves. The results we observed in MFA are consistent with the pharmacological studies of stage 1 waves in other species: stage 1 waves in rabbit are insensitive to nAChR antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Syed et al., 2004</xref>), as are early waves in developing chick retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Catsicas et al., 1998</xref>). Note that waves in these species were also sensitive to antagonists of various metabotropic receptors, indicating that neurotransmitters are still important for propagating waves in these systems. However, there is the important caveat that MFA can also have some off-target effects that might impact wave propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuo et al., 2016</xref>). Previously we showed that in P6-7 retina MFA did not alter depolarization-induced calcium transients and did not reduce the excitability of RGCs. Here, we show that short applications (10 min) of MFA increased input resistance of RGCs and did not appear to block compound EPSCs associated with waves or voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels. Future experiments with independent measures of gap junction coupling – such as tracer coupling and potentially knockout of connexin proteins – are necessary to have a more complete understanding of how electrical synapses contribute to wave propagation properties.</p><p>We also observed a difference between stage 1 and 2 waves in β2-nAChR-KO retinas. Embryonic β2-nAChR-KO retinas still exhibited stage 1 waves but at reduced frequency and size when compared to WT retinas. Though the spatiotemporal properties of stage 2 waves recorded in vitro for P1-P8 β2-nAChR-KO retinas are highly dependent on recording conditions with results ranging from sparse activity to high frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bansal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stafford et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2016</xref>), in vivo waves in β2-nAChR-KO are infrequent and weakly depolarizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burbridge et al., 2014</xref>). The activity that persists in β2-nAChR-KO retinas both embryonically and postnatally is resistant to nAChR antagonists, as was observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bansal et al., 2000</xref>). Rather the remaining activity in β2-nAChR-KO retinas is completely blocked by MFA, thereby suggesting that stage 1 and 2 waves in β2-nAChR-KO retinas rely solely on gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kirkby and Feller, 2013</xref>).</p><p>We propose a model for stage 1 waves consistent with these observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Stage 1 wave initiation is dependent on the spontaneous depolarization of SACs, but wave propagation is dependent on both gap junction coupling and nAChR activation. Hence, stage 1 wave initiation is similar to stage 2 waves where the spontaneous depolarization of a SAC activates neighboring SACs, leading to the volumetric release of ACh responsible for wave propagation both in the INL and GCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ford et al., 2012</xref>). The model for stage 1 wave propagation is also similar to stage 2 wave propagation, though a complete description of how gap junction coupling is mediating stage 2 wave propagation is needed. The pharmacological and genetic block/ablation of gap junctions have yet to reveal a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blankenship et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caval-Holme et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kirkby and Feller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Singer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Torborg et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, pure gap junction-mediated waves, such as those we observed in the β2-nAChR KO mouse, are considerably slower than waves in WT retina. A recent computational model of gap junction-mediated stage 1 waves, where waves are initiated by RGCs undergoing rare and random depolarizations that propagate entirely via electrical synapses, argues that the speed of propagation is limited by the slow rate at which the junctional currents charge up the membrane capacitance of neighboring RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kähne et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, the faster speed of waves mediated by a combination of nAChRs and gap junctions indicates that diffuse release of ACh leads to faster propagation than electrical synapses alone.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Working model of stage 1 wave initiation and propagation.</title><p>Wave initiation set by spontaneously depolarizing cholinergic amacrine cell/SAC, outlined in black, which release ACh and depolarizes neighboring cells, leading to the volumetric release of ACh.

Here, we report that ipRGCs are robustly activated by stage 1 waves, similar to our observations that ipRGCs participate in stage 2 waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arroyo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Caval-Holme et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kirkby and Feller, 2013</xref>). Thus, it is possible that depolarization via stage 1 waves may contribute to some of these ipRGC-dependent developmental processes.</p><p>To begin to explore to role of stage 1 and 2 waves in ipRGC development, we monitored the impact of chronically altered waves on the distribution and density of ipRGCs across the retina. Notably, ipRGCs undergo extensive apoptotic cell death, with the peak of apoptosis occurring between P2–P4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Prevention of apoptosis during this developmental period doubles the density of ipRGCs and dramatically increases the clumping of M1-ipRGC somas. In some systems, correlated network activity has been implicated in cell proliferation and cell death. For example, retinal wave activity promotes neurite outgrowth and potentially survival among RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goldberg et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, in the developing primary somatosensory and motor cortices, higher levels of spontaneous electrical activity were shown to have a neuroprotective effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blanquie et al., 2017b</xref>). However, here we show in the β2-nAChR-KO mouse, which has significantly diminished stage 1 and 2 retinal waves, the normal developmental loss of ipRGCs between P1 and P7 is maintained. Thus, stage 1 and 2 retinal waves are not required for ipRGC apoptosis; however, it is possible that the residual wave activity in β2-nAChR-KO is sufficient to activate pro-survival pathways. A deeper understanding of how spontaneous activity modulates RGC survival pathways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahmed et al., 2022</xref>) is warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the UC Berkeley Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (AUP-2015-10-8080-2), the Public Health Service Policy, and the SFN Policy on the Use of Animals in Neuroscience Research.

Large propagating waves were identified as regions of correlated calcium activity with no fixed areas and with wave fronts covering up to 90% of the retina.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>We blocked gap junctions via application of the gap junction blocker MFA (50 µM, Sigma-Aldrich). We blocked the nicotinic acetylcholine signaling pathway via application of the broad nicotinic receptor antagonists hexamethonium (Hex, 100 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) and epibatidine (EPB, 10 nM, Sigma-Aldrich) as well as the specific antagonist dihydro-ß-erythroidine hydrobromide (DHßE, 8 µM, Sigma-Aldrich).</p><p>The following procedure was used for all pharmacology experiments: We recorded baseline activity in ACSF for 8 min before pharmacological agents were applied to the perfusion system. We then waited 15–30 min for the agents to take effect before acquiring another 8 min recording session.</p><p>To attempt to assay off-target effects of MFA, we used whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to compare voltage-gated ion channels on RGCs in E16–18 retina but found inconsistent results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We associate this high variance with a rapid changing complement of ion channels during development and the quick washout of these conductances during whole-cell recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image analysis of population calcium imaging movies</title><p>Movies were preprocessed for motion correction using a MATLAB code from the Flat Iron Institute (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre">https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pnevmatikakis, 2019</xref>). The baseline movie frame (F0) was computed by taking the temporal median projection of all the movie frames. Each movie frame (F) was normalized by dividing its difference from the baseline frame (F-F0) by the baseline frame ((F-F0)/F0) to produce a ΔF/F0 movie. For movies taken on the two-photon microscope, circular ROIs were drawn on all cells within the FOV. Additional circular ROIs were drawn for tdTomato+ cells. For movies taken on the macroscope a grid of 10 µm × 10 µm squares, which were spaced 1.5 pixels apart, were drawn over the whole surface of the retina using a custom FIJI macro. The ROIs and the ΔF/F0 movie were then imported into MATLAB for further analysis using custom algorithms. Traces for each FOV and ROI were computed as the mean value of the pixels enclosed by the ROI in each frame of the ΔF/F0 movie.</p><p>For transient frequency analysis, event detection was done using the findpeaks function in MATLAB, with the minimum threshold set to greater than at least 10 times the standard deviation of the baseline fluorescence, which corresponds to at least 10% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>. The ITI for each ROI was calculated by finding the difference between the frame of each detected transient. This difference was then converted to seconds by multiplying it to the movie’s frame rate.</p><p>The area of waves was calculated for all movies taken on the macroscope. To do this, we first z-scored the percent active ROI traces and used the findpeaks function to detect individual waves, with the threshold set to a z-score of 1. After determining the time of waves, we removed any waves that occurred within the first and last 6 s of the movie due to them being edge cases. We then summed the number of active ROIs within 12 s around the wave times. This number was then divided by the total number of ROIs to get the percentage of active ROIs.</p><p>To determine whether neurons participate in waves in the two-photon calcium imaging data, we employed the following bootstrapping strategy: we randomly sampled the activity of individual neurons outside of wave times a thousand times to build a baseline of neural activity. We then set a threshold of 95th percentile to statistically determine whether neurons exhibited a greater calcium response during a wave than at rest. We then calculated the percentage of waves each cell participated in and averaged this value for every FOV. Similarly, mean response amplitudes were calculated for each cell and then averaged for each FOV.</p><p>For a description of statistics used, please refer to the figure captions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of ipRGC densities</title><p>To image the density of ipRGCs in fixed retinas, dissected retinas from P1 and P7 mice were fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min. The fixed retinas were subsequently mounted on a slide with vectashield and a cover slip, then imaged within an hour of mounting on the macroscope. For P1 retinas, Z-stacks were acquired by manually turning the focus knob.</p><p>We first identified the centroid of each ipRGC. For P7 retinas, where there is more space between cells, we employed the following automatic segmentation. Images were bandpass filtered and somata automatically segmented using the Morpholibj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Legland et al., 2016</xref>) classic watershed tool to obtain 8-bit binarized masks. The masks were then processed in MATLAB in order to obtain the centroid locations and nearest-neighbor distances for each soma. For P1 retinas, where there is less space between cells and in fact cells seem to form clusters, automatic segmentation was not possible. Therefore, cells were manually marked using the ImageJ multipoint tool and soma locations exported as a CSV file. For all ages, the centroid data was imported to MATLAB for further analyses.</p><p>Density was quantified by dividing the microscope field of view up into 200 ×200 μm squares, manually excluding ones that did not cover the retina or covered partial or damaged parts of the retinas. Out of the resulting squares (~150 per P7 retina, ~100 per P1 retinas), 75 squares (for P7 retinas) and 50 squares (for P1 retinas) were randomly selected and the average density of TdTom+ cells in those squares calculated.</p><p>To quantify the nearest-neighbor distances, we used a custom-written MATLAB code that, for each ipRGCs, identified the closest neighbor using the shortest Euclidean distance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>Details of statistical tests, number of replicates, and p values are indicated in the figures and figure captions. p values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were approved by the UC Berkeley Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Public Health Service Policy, and the SFN Policy on the Use of Animals in Neuroscience Research.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-81983-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>We have uploaded the raw data for Figure 5 on Dryad.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Fred Rieke as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Guillermina López-Bendito (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers agreed that the topic of the paper was important and appreciated the technical advances that made the work possible. Several important issues came up in review, however, that need to be strengthened before considering the paper further.</p><p>(1) Possible off-target effects of gap junction inhibitors should be discussed earlier and in more detail.</p><p>(2) The characterization of ipRGC development needs to be better motivated.</p><p>(3) Different subtypes of activity during the time period when stage 1 waves are observed need to be defined and distinguished more clearly.</p><p>(4) Several data analysis issues need attention.</p><p>These and a number of other issues are described in detail in the reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Page 7: The description of Stage 1 waves in rabbits talks about &quot;wave frequency&quot; being insensitive to block of fast synaptic transmission, and &quot;blocked&quot; by gap-junction antagonists. It is not clear whether this means all waves, or if &quot;frequency&quot; is included to indicate a subset of waves or properties. Please clarify!</p><p>Page 7, bottom: &quot;Waves that persisted … were smaller and had comparable amplitudes …&quot; – clarify that this means smaller in spatial extent.</p><p>Page 8, first sentence: revise – not clear how signaling is comprised of subunits.</p><p>Page 8, last full paragraph: this paragraph starts by saying that there is a light-dependent modulation of stage 1 wave frequency, but ends by saying that there is not. Is this a difference between WT and KO? If so that could be clarified.</p><p>Page 9, bottom, and page 10 top: Sentence starting &quot;Interestingly …&quot; is confusing. It seems to say that the regularity index is regular, but matches expectations if it was random. Please revise.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Introduction is too long and reads more like a review. I suggest limiting it to specific premise, tested hypothesis, and eliminating paragraphs 2 and 3.</p><p>Few technical notes:</p><p>In the final Results paragraph the cell body size of 7-10 μm is used to estimate ipRGC mosaics. This is too small. Please consider 20-30um.</p><p>Across the text, some statistical values are missing.</p><p>In Discussion, please note that while MFA does block GJs, it can also reduce spiking activity by a GJ-independent mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I provide here a long list of points that the authors should address. Despite the length of the list, the points I raised and requested do not involve any fundamental error or flaw in the manuscript but are aimed to improve the analysis, organization, and presentation of the dataset.</p><p>– It has been shown previously that stage 2 waves span from P1-P10. In this manuscript, the authors nicely set the focus on the embryonic phase of stage 1. The properties of both wave patterns are similar in many aspects (propagation speed, IEIs, and to some extent cholinergic). Thus, it is possible to think that the broad features extracted by the authors from stage 1 retinal waves represent the slow maturation of what we know as stage 2 waves rather than a preceding and complete separate class of retinal waves. Could this be the case? Could the authors speculate in the discussion on what happens in the transition between stages 1 and 2, at P0-P1?</p><p>– The authors pool together data from E16, E17, and E18 retinas. Are there any differences in the properties of the waves across time? The authors should at least show this data separately in the supplementary materials to justify pooling the data.</p><p>– It seems like the authors recognize the gap-junction component to a lesser extent and stress the cholinergic component. As one of the goals of the paper is to characterize the so-far-unknown stage 1 retinal waves, considered to be mainly gap-junction mediated in the literature, the reader expects to see a larger discussion on this issue and a comparison to the published literature.</p><p>– The first part of the Results could be better organized. It is not clear to me if the authors try to explain the relevant methods of analysis, illustrate the different types of activity they found (showing individual examples), or describe activity showing population data. In the second paragraph, the authors describe how they acquired the data, this is fine. In the third paragraph, the authors explain how they analyzed the movies and some properties of the transients detected per ROI and how ROIs participate in waves (although there is not, beforehand, a clear definition of what a wave is). Here, some clarity is needed when the authors use the terms &quot;transients&quot;, &quot;events&quot;, and &quot;waves&quot;. Up to this point, the authors refer to figure 1 where they show data from sample experiments. But, in the last paragraph of this section, they move to population data (and jump suddenly to panels of figure 3). Moreover, they focused on large propagating events, though it seems that sometimes they refer to all the propagating events, and present a summary in Table 1, where surprisingly small waves appeared for the first time without being mentioned in the text. In sum, it would be helpful for the reader if the authors reorganize the text of this section, try to set a clear scope for it, and present the data as smoothly and clearly as possible.</p><p>– Are waves detected by looking at the &quot;% Active&quot; plots, by visual inspection of the movies or by an algorithm? In the first case, what happens if there are two or more waves running simultaneously? It would help the reader if the authors explain how waves were detected. If wave detection is manual or visual, why the authors did not use automatic detection? In figure S2, it seems that there are a lot of waves per experiment, too many to be quantified manually or by eye.</p><p>– I suggest modifying the title to better fit the data. In the first half of the manuscript, the authors investigate the spatiotemporal properties and pharmacological profile of embryonic retinal waves. Using this information, the authors propose a model for the initiation and propagation of stage 1 waves (figure 6), but none of the cell types of the model were directly assessed in the manuscript. Regarding the ipRGCs, the authors nicely show that these cells participate in the network activity at early developmental stages; however, the data does not show the mechanism related to ipRGCs. Strictly, and in my opinion, the cellular mechanisms are not really established here.</p><p>– Why is the frequency of waves in the Hex control (Figure 2B) half the frequency of the other controls?</p><p>– The authors should include the mean duration of the waves/events in the description of the different types of activity.</p><p>– The authors claim that stage 1 retinal waves persist in WT retinas treated with DHβE. It is true that some activity remains upon DhβE, but, to me, the raster plot looks different than the WT (figure 2D). The statistical test yields no significant differences, but the p-value is amazingly borderline p = 0.05. This means that more experiments are needed to raise robust conclusions. Moreover, since DhβE (figure 2E) reduce the area of the events from 90% to 10% … is it still possible to call them stage 1 retinal waves? In sum, when the authors claim that waves persist, it suggests that normal stage 1 waves were observed in the DhβE-treated retinas; however, what remains looks like something different.</p><p>– As stage 1 waves are also affected in β2-nAChR KO mice, which is the &quot;standard&quot; model that has been widely used to assess the function of stage 2 waves, this is a good opportunity for the authors to discuss to what extent the conclusions raised using this mouse in the previous literature needs to be re-interpreted.</p><p>Additional comments (Introduction is page 1)</p><p>– The term &quot;events&quot; is used both to indicate the activation of an ROI and the correlated activation of multiple ROIs (as in waves). It would be easier for the reader if the authors differentiate them. Examples of the first case can be found in the third paragraph of the results: (i) &quot;… traces for each ROI were rasterized based on an event detection algorithm …&quot; or (ii) &quot;We first computed the time between spontaneous events by measuring the inter-event interval (IEI) for each ROI and …&quot;. Examples of the second case can be found in the fourth paragraph: (i) &quot;In addition to propagating events …&quot; or (ii) &quot;These events were like those described previously in (Bansal et al., 2000)&quot;. In addition, this disambiguation will clarify what they quantify in the &quot;Events/min&quot; plots. In sum, the authors should somehow clearly differentiate the activation of single ROIs from population activity. Perhaps, &quot;transients&quot; is a good option for the activation of single ROIs. It is not clear from the context which class of events is referred to by &quot;These&quot;.</p><p>– Why are waves divided into small and large events? This subdivision is not used in any of the quantifications that follow figure 1. In the same line, the authors adequately classified the events in propagating and non-propagating but we don`t know what happens with the latter in the different experimental conditions analyzed. It would be interesting to know whether the properties of non-propagating events are changed or remain the same upon pharmacological or genetic manipulations.</p><p>I think that the description of how to classify large waves is not accurate. In Methods: &quot;Large propagating waves were identified as regions of correlated calcium activity with no fixed areas and with wavefronts covering up to 90% of the retina&quot;. I guess that the authors meant wavefronts covering areas larger than 25% of the retina, which is the upper limit for small waves. In addition, the authors classify the events as fixed or non-fixed. However, it is not clear to the reader what &quot;fixed&quot; means.</p><p>– The number of asterisks used to indicate statistical significance is not consistent (see Figures 2 and 3, for example).</p><p>– The algorithm that detects calcium transients within ROIs should be described or referenced.</p><p>– Why does the threshold for detection vary from 15% to 50% depending on the experiment? In addition, these thresholds seem very high. Why not use n-times as the SD of the baseline? Is it related to the signal-to-noise ratio?</p><p>– I have some comments that may help to refine the Abstract. In lines 2-3, the authors should mention the species. In line 5, as far as I know, stage 1 waves are also observed at least at P0-P1, it is thus not completely correct to use &quot;embryonic retinal waves&quot; as a synonym for stage 1 waves. Perhaps &quot;the earliest pattern of retinal waves&quot; will do it. In line 7, it is not clear to me what the authors mean by &quot;finite&quot;. And finally, by reading only the Abstract, it is not evident which could be the relationship between stage 1 waves and the distribution of ipRGCs. Perhaps, the authors should briefly mention here what normally happens to this subpopulation during perinatal development.</p><p>– Page 1, line 7. Typo: vision instead of &quot;vison&quot;. Page 2, line 26. Typo: characterized instead of &quot;characterize&quot;.</p><p>– Page 2, lines 29-30. The details of FOV and resolution should go to Methods. The authors emphasize here that the field of view could cover the whole retina while preserving cellular (not subcellular) resolution, this is clear even without the details, increasing the readability of the paragraph. Please, check that &quot;FOV&quot; is spelled out before being abbreviated in the main text.</p><p>– Do the authors think that &quot;complex&quot; is a good descriptor for the spatiotemporal properties of stage 1 waves (as stated in the first subheading of Results)?</p><p>– I think that the initial paragraph of the first part of Results, about the cell types in the developing retina, does not have a clear link to the following paragraphs of the section. Perhaps, this information fits better in the Introduction. Further, I believe that Bansal and colleagues is not a convenient reference for the last sentence where gap junctions are proposed to be a primary substrate of stage 1 waves.

Also, when the second point is selected, it is not clear to me what &quot;parallel to the direction of the first point&quot; means.

Despite the length of the list, the points I raised and requested do not involve any fundamental error or flaw in the manuscript but are aimed to improve the analysis, organization, and presentation of the dataset.</p><p>– It has been shown previously that stage 2 waves span from P1-P10. In this manuscript, the authors nicely set the focus on the embryonic phase of stage 1. The properties of both wave patterns are similar in many aspects (propagation speed, IEIs, and to some extent cholinergic). Thus, it is possible to think that the broad features extracted by the authors from stage 1 retinal waves represent the slow maturation of what we know as stage 2 waves rather than a preceding and complete separate class of retinal waves. Could this be the case? Could the authors speculate in the discussion on what happens in the transition between stages 1 and 2, at P0-P1?</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the discussion significantly based on these comments. Please see pages 9 -11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors pool together data from E16, E17, and E18 retinas. Are there any differences in the properties of the waves across time? The authors should at least show this data separately in the supplementary materials to justify pooling the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not feel confident that we could rely on plug checks to estimate age of embryos better than +/- one day. Hence we have grouped across ages. We have assessed whether any variance could be attributed to mice that came from different litters (as a proxy for potential different ages). However we found more variance within litters than across litters and therefore we assume age does not explain the variance. We have added this to the Methods-Animals section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It seems like the authors recognize the gap-junction component to a lesser extent and stress the cholinergic component. As one of the goals of the paper is to characterize the so-far-unknown stage 1 retinal waves, considered to be mainly gap-junction mediated in the literature, the reader expects to see a larger discussion on this issue and a comparison to the published literature.</p></disp-quote><p>The dependence on nAChR signaling was more surprising to us given the lack of synaptic structures. In the revised manuscript, we think we have made clearer that both gap junction coupling and nAChR signaling are required for Stage 1 waves. Throughout the paper, we have added more discussion about the differential roles of gap junctions and nAChR on Stage 1 waves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The first part of the Results could be better organized. It is not clear to me if the authors try to explain the relevant methods of analysis, illustrate the different types of activity they found (showing individual examples), or describe activity showing population data. In the second paragraph, the authors describe how they acquired the data, this is fine. In the third paragraph, the authors explain how they analyzed the movies and some properties of the transients detected per ROI and how ROIs participate in waves (although there is not, beforehand, a clear definition of what a wave is). Here, some clarity is needed when the authors use the terms &quot;transients&quot;, &quot;events&quot;, and &quot;waves&quot;. Up to this point, the authors refer to figure 1 where they show data from sample experiments. But, in the last paragraph of this section, they move to population data (and jump suddenly to panels of figure 3). Moreover, they focused on large propagating events, though it seems that sometimes they refer to all the propagating events, and present a summary in Table 1, where surprisingly small waves appeared for the first time without being mentioned in the text. In sum, it would be helpful for the reader if the authors reorganize the text of this section, try to set a clear scope for it, and present the data as smoothly and clearly as possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified significantly the first part of the results to address these concerns. Specifically, we:</p><p>1) Rearranged the presentation of the results so that the flow is better. Figure 1 has been rearranged so that captions are called in order and there is no jump to Figure 3.</p><p>2) Increased clarity by using only the two terms “transients” and “waves”, and removing the word “event”. Transients and waves are both clearly defined in revised text page 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Are waves detected by looking at the &quot;% Active&quot; plots, by visual inspection of the movies or by an algorithm? In the first case, what happens if there are two or more waves running simultaneously? It would help the reader if the authors explain how waves were detected. If wave detection is manual or visual, why the authors did not use automatic detection? In figure S2, it seems that there are a lot of waves per experiment, too many to be quantified manually or by eye.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added information in the methods that describe how waves are detected. Specifically, the waves are automatically detected using a peakfind algorithm in MATLAB on the % Active traces.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I suggest modifying the title to better fit the data. In the first half of the manuscript, the authors investigate the spatiotemporal properties and pharmacological profile of embryonic retinal waves. Using this information, the authors propose a model for the initiation and propagation of stage 1 waves (figure 6), but none of the cell types of the model were directly assessed in the manuscript. Regarding the ipRGCs, the authors nicely show that these cells participate in the network activity at early developmental stages; however, the data does not show the mechanism related to ipRGCs. Strictly, and in my opinion, the cellular mechanisms are not really established here.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the title to: Circuit mechanisms underlying embryonic retinal waves</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why is the frequency of waves in the Hex control (Figure 2B) half the frequency of the other controls?</p></disp-quote><p>There was variance across preparations. However, we have conducted additional experiments and found that the frequency of waves within the same range as other experiments. The new data is incorporated into part of Revised Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should include the mean duration of the waves/events in the description of the different types of activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Duration is convolved with velocity, area and kinetics of the calcium dye. Therefore we restrict our description in the paper to area and velocity. It is unclear to us why this parameter is needed and so we have not added it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors claim that stage 1 retinal waves persist in WT retinas treated with DHβE. It is true that some activity remains upon DhβE, but, to me, the raster plot looks different than the WT (figure 2D). The statistical test yields no significant differences, but the p-value is amazingly borderline p = 0.05. This means that more experiments are needed to raise robust conclusions. Moreover, since DhβE (figure 2E) reduce the area of the events from 90% to 10% … is it still possible to call them stage 1 retinal waves? In sum, when the authors claim that waves persist, it suggests that normal stage 1 waves were observed in the DhβE-treated retinas; however, what remains looks like something different.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified how we describe this result (bottom of page 5).</p><p>“However, in contrast to Stage 2 wave, some waves persisted in the presence of DhβE, but they recruited fewer neurons and therefore had smaller areas (Figure 2B)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– As stage 1 waves are also affected in β2-nAChR KO mice, which is the &quot;standard&quot; model that has been widely used to assess the function of stage 2 waves, this is a good opportunity for the authors to discuss to what extent the conclusions raised using this mouse in the previous literature needs to be re-interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the discussion significantly. We highlight page 9 – the text is reproduced here for reviewers convenience:</p><p>“The different sensitivity to nAChR antagonists between Stage 1 and 2 waves is highlighted in the patterns of retinal waves in β2-nAChR-KO mice. β2-nAChR-KO mice have significantly reduced Stage 2 cholinergic waves (Bansal et al., 2000; Burbridge et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015, 2016) and as such have served as the canonical model for studying the role of Stage 2 cholinergic waves in eye-specific segregation, retinotopic maps, retinal and collicular direction selectivity, and in the optokinetic reflex (Arroyo and Feller, 2016; Grubb et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2017; Tiriac et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2009). In contrast, Stage 1 waves in the β2-nAChR-KO mice persist, albeit they propagate with slower speed and cover smaller areas of the retina (Figure 3). Despite this difference in spatiotemporal properties, both Stage 1 and Stage 2 waves that persist in the β2-nAChR-KO mice are blocked by gap junction receptor antagonist rather than blockers of fast neurotransmitter receptors (Kirkby and Feller, 2013). Recent evidence suggests that embryonic activity throughout the developing sensory system may influence many aspects of visual systems development (Martini et al., 2021; Moreno-Juan et al., 2022). Whether the various visual system phenotypes observed in β2-nAChR-KO mice can be attributed in part to reduced Stage 1 waves remains to be determined.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments (Introduction is page 1)</p><p>– The term &quot;events&quot; is used both to indicate the activation of an ROI and the correlated activation of multiple ROIs (as in waves). It would be easier for the reader if the authors differentiate them. Examples of the first case can be found in the third paragraph of the results: (i) &quot;… traces for each ROI were rasterized based on an event detection algorithm …&quot; or (ii) &quot;We first computed the time between spontaneous events by measuring the inter-event interval (IEI) for each ROI and …&quot;. Examples of the second case can be found in the fourth paragraph: (i) &quot;In addition to propagating events …&quot; or (ii) &quot;These events were like those described previously in (Bansal et al., 2000)&quot;. In addition, this disambiguation will clarify what they quantify in the &quot;Events/min&quot; plots. In sum, the authors should somehow clearly differentiate the activation of single ROIs from population activity. Perhaps, &quot;transients&quot; is a good option for the activation of single ROIs. It is not clear from the context which class of events is referred to by &quot;These&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the wording of transients, events, and waves and defined these terms on page 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why are waves divided into small and large events? This subdivision is not used in any of the quantifications that follow figure 1. In the same line, the authors adequately classified the events in propagating and non-propagating but we don`t know what happens with the latter in the different experimental conditions analyzed. It would be interesting to know whether the properties of non-propagating events are changed or remain the same upon pharmacological or genetic manipulations.</p><p>I think that the description of how to classify large waves is not accurate. In Methods: &quot;Large propagating waves were identified as regions of correlated calcium activity with no fixed areas and with wavefronts covering up to 90% of the retina&quot;. I guess that the authors meant wavefronts covering areas larger than 25% of the retina, which is the upper limit for small waves. In addition, the authors classify the events as fixed or non-fixed. However, it is not clear to the reader what &quot;fixed&quot; means.</p></disp-quote><p>We no longer make the distinction between small and large waves because there is a continuous distribution of wave areas.

In addition, these thresholds seem very high. Why not use n-times as the SD of the baseline? Is it related to the signal-to-noise ratio?</p></disp-quote><p>See new figure 1B. Our signal-to-noise is very good for these recordings, S Thresholds varied with dye that is used. In all cases, thresholds &gt; 10 SD were used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I have some comments that may help to refine the Abstract. In lines 2-3, the authors should mention the species. In line 5, as far as I know, stage 1 waves are also observed at least at P0-P1, it is thus not completely correct to use &quot;embryonic retinal waves&quot; as a synonym for stage 1 waves. Perhaps &quot;the earliest pattern of retinal waves&quot; will do it. In line 7, it is not clear to me what the authors mean by &quot;finite&quot;. And finally, by reading only the Abstract, it is not evident which could be the relationship between stage 1 waves and the distribution of ipRGCs. Perhaps, the authors should briefly mention here what normally happens to this subpopulation during perinatal development.</p></disp-quote><p>We have really avoided P0 recordings here and therefore cannot make much of a comment about the transition between Stage 1 and Stage.

I understand then that the speed value for a wave will change every time that the quantification is repeated (because wavefronts do not seem to propagate homogeneously). Is this correct? Or, are measurements repeated many times for every wave and a mean calculated? Also, when the second point is selected, it is not clear to me what &quot;parallel to the direction of the first point&quot; means. This section will benefit from a better explanation of the quantification method. Is this method standard or comparable to other methods that have been used in previous publications?</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the description of the wave speed measurements. This method was used to give an average measurement to wavefront propagation. We implemented several more complex algorithms based on location motion along all edges of wavefronts but given the complexity of Stage 1 waves, this was not productive. Rather we wanted to capture a more macroscopic assessment of wave propagation to compare between WT and β2-nAChR-KO. This approach led to similar Stage 2 velocities reported in previous publications. To describe the method we have added a new Figure 1 Supplemental Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Could the authors state in each figure the number of independent experimental units (N): how many retinas from how many mice (for example, information is incomplete in figure 3 and missing in figure 5)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added this to the Figure captions for Figures 3 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;Cook and Bekker, Physiology, 2009&quot; is not listed in the reference list. &quot;Emanuel and Do, 2015&quot; is not listed in the reference list.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added both of these references.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper has improved in revision, and most of the original issues have been nicely handled.

Did you try to wash out the effects of MFA in any of the experiments described here? Even a partial washout would be helpful. I would consider moving the whole cell recordings on lines 155-158 to the Methods since the variability limited the conclusions that can be drawn from them. It does look like K channel activity decreased systematically in MFA, which might be noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the changes you suggested – moving the results based on whole cell to the methods but leaving the summary in the main text.</p><p>For this study, we have not systemically checked for a washout of MFA. We do not see any signs of general health decline with the calcium imaging which manifests itself by a steady increase in baseline of the fluorescence (which in the past we have seen with higher concentrations of MFA). For whole cell recording, in two cells, we saw partial recovery of the voltage-gated potassium conductance after 15 minutes of rinse (after 45 minutes in 50 µM MFA) – given washout issues this seems not useful to add to paper. We also do not see big changes in resting potentials of cells or voltage-gated Na conductances. It is important to note that in the past we have found 50 µM MFA was sufficient to block gap junction coupling as assayed with spikelets (Arroyo et al., 2016, Figure 7; Caval-Holme et al. 2019; Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The motivation for the measurements in the knockout animals is clearer now.
