caused by mutations in the OPA1 mitochondrial dynamin <italic>like</italic> GTPase (<italic>OPA1</italic>) gene. <italic>OPA1</italic> encodes a dynamin-like GTPase present in the mitochondrial inner membrane. When associated with OPA1 mutations, DOA can present not only ocular symptoms but also multi-organ symptoms (DOA plus). DOA plus often results from point mutations in the GTPase domain, which are assumed to have dominant-negative effects. However, the presence of mutations in the GTPase domain does not always result in DOA plus. Therefore, an experimental system to distinguish between DOA and DOA plus is needed. In this study, we found that loss-of-function mutations of the <italic>dOPA1</italic> gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can imitate the pathology of optic nerve degeneration observed in DOA. We successfully rescued this degeneration by expressing the human <italic>OPA1</italic> (<italic>hOPA1</italic>) gene, indicating that <italic>hOPA1</italic> is functionally interchangeable with <italic>dOPA1</italic> in the fly system. However, mutations previously identified did not ameliorate the <italic>dOPA1</italic> deficiency phenotype. By expressing both WT and DOA plus mutant <italic>hOPA1</italic> forms in the optic nerve of <italic>dOPA1</italic> mutants, we observed that DOA plus mutations suppressed the rescue, facilitating the distinction between loss-of-function and dominant-negative mutations in <italic>hOPA1</italic>. This fly model aids in distinguishing DOA from DOA plus and guides initial <italic>hOPA1</italic> mutation treatment strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dominant

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is a progressive form of blindness characterized by selective degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the axons that form the optic nerve. Despite being a rare disease with a frequency of 1/12,000 to 1/50,000, DOA is the most commonly diagnosed form of hereditary optic neuropathy. In 2000, <italic>OPA1 mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase</italic> (<italic>OPA1</italic>) was identified as the causative gene for DOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delettre et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p><italic>OPA1</italic> encodes a dynamin-like GTPase located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Olichon et al., 2002</xref>). It has various functions, including mitochondrial fusion, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance, control of cell death, and resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lenaers et al., 2021</xref>). The most common pathogenic mutation in <italic>OPA1</italic> is the c.2708–2711 delTTAG deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Toomes et al., 2001</xref>). Five pathogenic mutations, including the one above, result in a substantial decrease in OPA1 protein in the fibroblasts from affected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zanna et al., 2008</xref>), supporting the theory that DOA is caused by haploinsufficiency.</p><p>Optic atrophy is a characteristic feature of <italic>OPA1</italic>-associated DOA; however, multisystem symptoms have been reported in up to 20% of <italic>OPA1</italic> mutation carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu-Wai-Man et al., 2010a</xref>). This is called DOA plus. DOA plus can include sensorineural deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amati-Bonneau et al., 2008</xref>), multiple sclerosis-like illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verny et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu-Wai-Man et al., 2016</xref>), parkinsonism and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lynch et al., 2017</xref>), and cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spiegel et al., 2016</xref>). The R445H mutation is a well-known mutation associated with DOA plus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amati-Bonneau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amati-Bonneau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shimizu et al., 2003</xref>). The proportion of mutated OPA1 locations differs between patients with DOA and DOA plus. Missense mutations in the dynamin-featured structure, especially the GTPase domain of <italic>OPA1</italic>, are more likely to cause severe symptoms compared with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations such as deletions or splice site mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu-Wai-Man et al., 2010a</xref>). This is probably due to the dominant-negative (DN) effect of a DOA plus mutation on the normal <italic>OPA1</italic> allele, since OPA1 functions as a homo-oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olichon et al., 2006</xref>); in fact, its yeast ortholog, Mgm1, forms oligomers, increasing the GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meglei and McQuibban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rujiviphat et al., 2009</xref>). Particularly, the dynamin-featured structure accounts for 70% of the 233 pathogenic variants of DOA and DOA plus described in the locus-specific database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferré et al., 2015</xref>). However, mutations in these domains do not determine DOA plus, as it affects only 20% of all <italic>OPA1</italic> mutation carriers. Thus, experimental models to determine whether a gene mutation is LOF or DN are required to distinguish between DOA and DOA plus. Although currently there is no effective treatment for DOA or DOA plus, distinguishing between them allows earlier planning of interventions such as hearing aids, rather than relying solely on visual aids, necessary only for those with DOA plus. In the quest to differentiate between LOF and DN effects within the context of genetic mutations, precedents exist in simpler systems such as yeast and human fibroblasts. These models have provided valuable insights into the conserved functions of OPA1 across species, as evidenced by studies in yeast models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Dotto et al., 2017</xref>) and fibroblasts derived from patients harboring <italic>OPA1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kane et al., 2017</xref>). However, the ability to distinguish between LOF and DN effects in an in vivo model organism, particularly at the structural level of retinal axon degeneration, has remained elusive.

We obtained similar results with an independent alternative RNAi line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine whether the degeneration was limited to the axons, we counted the number of rhabdomeres in the cell bodies. Each compound eye comprises 700–800 ommatidia, with each ommatidium containing eight types of photoreceptors, designated as R1–R8. The distal region of an ommatidium reveals the R1–R7 photoreceptors with a stereotypical arrangement of rhabdomeres (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–J</xref>). Since it is easy to evaluate retinal degeneration by counting the number of rhabdomeres, a decrease in their number indicates degeneration of the photoreceptor cell body. The <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown caused a significant decrease in the number of rhabdomeres per ommatidium in 1-week-old adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–J</xref>, quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Interestingly, although the retinal axons had already decreased on the day of eclosion, the ommatidia remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and K</xref>). Note that the ommatidia in R7 remained intact after 1 week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Our results indicate that the <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown causes degeneration in both axonal terminals and cell bodies, with the neuronal degeneration starting from the axons and continuing in the cell bodies. A previous report indicated that the compound eyes of homozygous mutations of <italic>dOPA1</italic> displayed a glossy eye phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yarosh et al., 2008</xref>).

These results suggest that <italic>hOPA1</italic> and <italic>dOPA1</italic> are interchangeable. We also generated and expressed the <italic>hOPA1</italic> mutation 2708-2711del, which is known to cause DOA, the I382M mutation, located in the GTPase domain and associated with DOA, as well as the D438V and R445H mutations, also located in the GTPase domain and associated with DOA plus. The expression of these mutations in retinal axons failed to rescue the <italic>dOPA1</italic> deficiency to the same extent as the WT <italic>hOPA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Importantly, unlike the D438V and R445H mutations, the 2708-2711del and I382M mutations could be weakly rescued. This suggests that these mutations result in LOF, but may retain some residual activity. These findings are also in line with the observed severity of the associated diseases, DOA and DOA plus. The D438V and R445H mutations were not significantly rescued, unlike the 2708-2711del and I382M mutations. Our methodology distinctively facilitates the quantitative evaluation of LOF severity by comparing the rescue capabilities of various mutations. Notably, the 2708-2711del and I382M mutations demonstrated only partial rescue, indicative of a hypomorphic effect with residual activity. In contrast, the D438V and R445H mutations failed to show significant rescue, suggesting a more profound LOF. The correlation between the partial rescue by the 2708-2711del and I382M mutations and their classification as hypomorphic is significant. Moreover, the observed differences in rescue efficacy correspond to the clinical severities associated with these mutations, namely in DOA and DOA plus disorders. Thus, our results substantiate the model’s ability to quantitatively discriminate among mutations based on their impact on protein functionality, providing an insightful measure of LOF magnitude.</p><p>Furthermore, we assessed the potential for rescuing ROS signals. Similar to its effect on axonal degeneration, WT hOPA1 effectively mitigated the phenotype, whereas the 2708-2711del, D438V, and R445H mutants did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Importantly, the I382M variant also reduced ROS levels comparably to the WT. These findings demonstrate that both axonal degeneration and the increase in ROS caused by dOPA1 downregulation can be effectively counteracted by hOPA1. Although I382M retains partial functionality, it acts as a relatively weak hypomorph in this experimental setup.</p><p>We also conducted western blot analyses using anti-COXII and anti-Atg8a antibodies to assess changes in mitochondrial quantity and autophagy activity following the knockdown of <italic>dOPA1</italic>.

The results revealed no significant differences across the genotypes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Distinction between LOF and DN mutations in <italic>hOPA1</italic> linked to DOA or DOA plus</title><p>Currently, the <italic>hOPA1</italic> mutations that contribute to DOA plus have been primarily located in the GTPase domain of <italic>hOPA1</italic>. The role of <italic>hOPA1</italic> as a GTPase is facilitated by its ability to form a polymer via the GED domain and Middle domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2019</xref>). This led to the hypothesis that mutations in the GTPase domain can interact with WT hOPA1 but cannot activate the GTPase activity to show a DN effect. However, it has been challenging to clarify whether these mutations are DN or LOF, as there is a significant number of LOF mutations in the GTPase domain. Given that <italic>dOPA1</italic> can be substituted with <italic>hOPA1</italic>, we suspected that a DN effect could also be achieved by expressing the D438V or R445H mutations in the WT background. However, the axons did not degenerate despite expression and monitoring for 2 weeks in adult flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> indicate that there are no significant differences in the expression levels among the variants, suggesting that variations in expression levels do not influence the outcomes. The amino acid sequences of hOPA1 and dOPA1 are highly conserved (72% identity), particularly in the GTPase domain. The Middle and GED domains are also relatively well preserved, with 54% and 64% agreement, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results imply that, although <italic>dOPA1</italic> and <italic>hOPA1</italic> are functionally interchangeable, they may not interact with each other. Consequently, we expressed <italic>hOPA1</italic> in the photoreceptor depleted of <italic>dOPA1</italic> by somatic clone; under these conditions, we further expressed <italic>hOPA1</italic> WT, 2708-2711del, and mutations in the GTPase domains, including R445H, I382M, and D438V. This allowed <italic>hOPA1</italic> to interact with itself and to verify the DN effect. As a result, the expression of the WT, 2708del, and I382M did not result in any changes when rescued by <italic>hOPA1</italic> substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, the rescue was significantly suppressed for D438V and R445H, which are known to cause DN; thus, the DN effect could be replicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In conclusion, we established an experimental model that can separate LOF and DN, the pathological significance of <italic>hOPA1</italic> mutations.

We were successful in reversing this degeneration by expressing <italic>hOPA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, we could not rescue any previously reported mutations known to cause either DOA or DOA plus except for I382M. In the context of rescuing the retinal axons of the <italic>dOPA1</italic> mutant by expressing the WT of <italic>hOPA1</italic>, it was observed that only the DOA plus mutations suppressed the rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This allowed us to distinguish between LOF and DN mutations in <italic>hOPA1</italic>. The fly model developed in this study will allow investigating new <italic>hOPA1</italic> mutations for DOA or DOA plus. We have previously utilized MeDUsA to quantify axonal degeneration, applying this methodology extensively to various neurological disorders. The robust adaptability of this experimental system is demonstrated by its application in exploring a wide spectrum of genetic mutations associated with neurological conditions, highlighting its broad utility in neurogenetic research. We identified a novel de novo variant in Spliceosome Associated Factor 1, Recruiter of U4/U6.U5 Tri-SnRNP (<italic>SART1</italic>). The patient, born at 37 weeks with a birth weight of 2934 g, exhibited significant developmental delays, including an inability to support head movement at 7 months, reliance on tube feeding, unresponsiveness to visual stimuli, and development of infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia, as evidenced by EEG findings. Profound hearing loss and brain atrophy were confirmed through MRI imaging. To assess the functional impact of this novel human gene variant, we engineered transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines expressing both WT and mutant <italic>SART1</italic> under the control of a UAS promoter. Our MeDUsA analysis suggested that the variant may confer a gain-of-toxic-function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nitta et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, we identified heterozygous LOF mutations in <italic>DHX9</italic> as potentially causative for a newly characterized neurodevelopmental disorder. We further investigated the pathogenic potential of a novel heterozygous de novo missense mutation in <italic>DHX9</italic> in a patient presenting with short stature, intellectual disability, and myocardial compaction. Our findings indicated a LOF in the G414R and R1052Q variants of <italic>DHX9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamada et al., 2023</xref>). This experimental framework has been instrumental in elucidating the impact of gene mutations, enhancing our ability to diagnose how novel variants influence gene function. Our research established that <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown precipitates axonal degeneration and elevates ROS signals in retinal axons. Expression of human <italic>OPA1</italic> within this context effectively mitigated both phenomena; it partially reversed axonal degeneration and nearly completely normalized ROS levels. These results imply that factors other than increased ROS may drive the axonal degeneration observed post knockdown. Furthermore, while differences between the impacts of DN mutations and LOF mutations were evident in axonal degeneration, they were less apparent when using ROS as a biomarker. The extensive use of transgenes in our experiments might have mitigated the knockdown effects. In a systemic <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown, assessments of mitochondrial quantity and autophagy activity revealed no significant changes, suggesting that the cellular consequences of reduced <italic>OPA1</italic> expression might vary across different cell types.</p><p>In our study, expressing <italic>dOPA1</italic> in the retinal axons of <italic>dOPA1</italic> mutants resulted in significant rescue, but it did not return to control levels. There are three possible explanations for this result. The first concerns gene expression levels. The Gal4-line used for the rescue experiments may not replicate the expression levels or timing of endogenous <italic>dOPA1</italic>. Considering that the optimal functionality of <italic>dOPA1</italic> may be contingent upon specific gene expression levels, attaining a WT-like state necessitates the precise regulation of these expression levels. The second is a non-autonomous issue. Although <italic>dOPA1</italic> gene expression was induced in the retinal axons for the rescue experiments, many retinal axons were homozygous mutants, while other cell types were heterozygous for the <italic>dOPA1</italic> mutation. If there is a non-autonomous effect of <italic>dOPA1</italic> in cells other than retinal axons, it might not be possible to restore the WT-like state fully. The third potential issue is that only one isoform of <italic>dOPA1</italic> was expressed. In mouse OPA1, to completely restore mitochondrial network shape, an appropriate balance of at least two different isoforms, long-form OPA1 (L-OPA1) and short-form OPA1 (s-OPA1), is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Dotto et al., 2017</xref>). This requirement implies that multiple isoforms of <italic>dOPA1</italic> are essential for the dynamic activities of mitochondria.</p><p>Our established fly model is the first simple organism to allow observation of degeneration of the retinal axons. The mitochondria in the axons showed fragmentation of mitochondria. Former studies have observed mitochondrial fragmentation in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McQuibban et al., 2006</xref>), muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2008</xref>), segmental nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trevisan et al., 2018</xref>), and ommatidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yarosh et al., 2008</xref>) due to the LOF of <italic>dOPA1</italic>. Our study presents compelling evidence that <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown instigates neuronal degeneration, characterized by a sequential deterioration at the axonal terminals and extending to the cell bodies. This degenerative pattern, commencing from the distal axons and progressing proximally toward the cell soma, aligns with the paradigm of ‘dying-back’ neuropathy, a phenomenon extensively documented in various neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Previously, the function of <italic>OPA1</italic> in mice (<italic>mOPA1</italic>) was substituted by <italic>hOPA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Dotto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sarzi et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that the function of <italic>dOPA1</italic> can also be substituted by <italic>hOPA1</italic>. Thus, the function of <italic>OPA1</italic> is conserved across a wide range of species but our fly model has the advantage of allowing rapid observation of phenotypes. In the mouse model of DOA with the heterozygous deletion of the <italic>mOPA1</italic> gene at positions 329–355 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alavi et al., 2007</xref>) or delTTAG mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sarzi et al., 2012</xref>), a decrease in the number of RGC was observed after 17 months or 16 months of age, respectively. To save time, using a fly model for quick analysis and direct observation of retinal axons would be useful. Previous models using nematodes, flies, and zebrafish did not observe axonal degeneration directly, but our new model has made this possible. As a result, our model has the potential to be used for screening for modifiers of unclear molecular pathologies and drug screening.</p><p>Our model could also demonstrate the pathological significance of <italic>hOPA1</italic> mutations and be used for genetic diagnosis to differentiate between LOF and DN mutations. To elucidate the pathophysiological implications of mutations in the <italic>OPA1</italic> gene, we engineered and expressed several human <italic>OPA1</italic> variants, including the 2708-2711del mutation, associated with DOA, and the I382M mutation, located in the GTPase domain and linked to DOA. We also investigated the D438V and R445H mutations in the GTPase domain and correlated with the more severe DOA plus phenotype. The 2708-2711del mutation exhibited limited detectability via HA-tag probing. Still, it was undetectable with a myc tag, likely due to a frameshift event leading to the mutation’s characteristic truncated protein product, as delineated in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zanna et al., 2008</xref>). Contrastingly, the I382M, D438V, and R445H mutations demonstrated expression levels comparable to the WT <italic>hOPA1</italic>.</p><p>However, the expression of these mutants in retinal axons did not restore the <italic>dOPA1</italic> deficiency to the same extent as the WT hOPA1, as evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. This finding indicates a functional impairment imparted by these mutations, aligning with established understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zanna et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, while the 2708-2711del and I382M mutations exhibited limited functional rescue, the D438V and R445H mutations did not show significant rescue activity. This differential rescue efficiency suggests that the former mutations, particularly the I382M, categorized as a hypomorph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Del Dotto et al., 2018</xref>), may retain partial functional capacity, indicative of a LOF effect but with residual activity. The I382M missense mutation within the GTPase domain of OPA1 has been described as a mild hypomorph or a disease modifier. Intriguingly, this mutation alone does not induce significant clinical outcomes, as evidenced by multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonifert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonneau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schaaf et al., 2011</xref>). A significant reduction in protein levels has been observed in fibroblasts originating from patients harboring the I382M mutation. However, mitochondrial volume remains unaffected, and the fusion activity of mitochondria is only minimally influenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Del Dotto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kane et al., 2017</xref>). This observation is consistent with findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chao de la Barca et al., 2020</xref>, where a targeted metabolomics approach classified I382M as a mild hypomorph. In our current study, the I382M mutation preserves more OPA1 function compared to DN mutations, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>. Considering the results from our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model and previous research, we hypothesize that the I382M mutation may constitute a mild hypomorphic variant. This might explain its failure to manifest a phenotype on its own, yet its contribution to increased severity when it occurs in compound heterozygosity.</p><p>Our results for LOF or DN segmentation were consistent with previously reported yeast models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Del Dotto et al., 2018</xref>) and fibroblasts obtained from patients with OPA1 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kane et al., 2017</xref>), and confirmed the conserved function of <italic>OPA1</italic> across species. A major advantage of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model over yeast or fibroblasts is that we can observe a phenotype that mimics the actual disease state of axonal degeneration in retinal axons and analyze it not only at the molecular level, but also the structural level of axons and mitochondria. The transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> of disease-associated <italic>hOpa1</italic> mutations created in this study can also serve to understand the pathophysiology of these mutations.</p><p>Advances in genome analysis allowed the identification of many variants and genetic mutations associated with DOA using next-generation sequencing. This could confirm diagnoses and identify new forms of DOA. The widespread use of these sequencers has also created new challenges, such as the growing number of variants of unknown significance (VUS) in publicly available databases such as CliniVar for DOA. These variants are categorized as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS, likely benign, or benign, and the number of VUS is increasing as more variants are registered. The ClinVar database had classified 110 out of 319 <italic>Opa1</italic> variants as VUS at the end of 2019. By the end of 2022, this number had increased to 357 out of 840, indicating an increase from 34% to 42% over the last 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henrie et al., 2018</xref>). This trend suggests that the number of VUS in <italic>Opa1</italic> may continue to increase in the future. Analyzing VUS requires testing the effects of a mutation in vitro or in vivo; this can be expensive and time-consuming without prior confirmation or high probability of pathological significance. However, our fly model can be used to easily and inexpensively determine the pathological effects of disease-causing gene mutations among the growing number of rare mutations identified in DOA.</p><p>In this study, we tested the effect of expressing the D438V and R445H mutations in the <italic>dOPA1</italic> background and found that retinal axons did not degenerate. Regarding the interactions among OPA1 proteins, in yeast Mgm1, K854 in the region near the C-terminus is important for aggregation, and it becomes an oligomer to increase the activity of GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rujiviphat et al., 2009</xref>). Although hOPA1 normally has low GTPase activity, its interaction with negatively charged phospholipids such as cardiolipin causes hOPA1 to aggregate, increasing GTP hydrolysis activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ban et al., 2010</xref>). In the thermophilic fungus <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic>, Mgm1 forms a dimer and then a tetramer at the C-terminal Stalk domain of Mgm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Faelber et al., 2019</xref>). Structural analysis also predicted that the Middle and GED domains are necessary for dimer and oligomer formation in hOPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, peptide-binding assays have revealed that the coiled-coil domain, which is part of the GED domain, is required for hOPA1 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akepati et al., 2008</xref>). Comparing the amino acid sequences of hOPA1 and dOPA1, the Middle and GED domains, which are necessary for interactions between OPA1 molecules, exhibit concordance rates of 54.3% and 63.6%, respectively. These percentages are low compared to the 71.8% identity observed in the GTPase domains. These suggest that the OPA1 homologs of each species form oligomers with their unique OPA1. Note that the expression of <italic>dOPA1<sup>K273A</sup></italic>, a presumably GTPase-negative form of <italic>dOPA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsuyama et al., 2017</xref>), degenerated retinal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results imply that, while dOPA1 and hOPA1 are interchangeable, they may not interact with each other. This could pave the way for the development of a chimeric hOPA1, which would retain its functional properties while avoiding the interaction with endogenous hOPA1. Such chimeric hOPA1 could potentially be used as gene therapy since induced pluripotent stem cells have been generated from a patient with R445H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sladen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>OPA1 has been implicated in various other diseases as well, including normal tension glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Powell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yu-Wai-Man et al., 2010b</xref>), multiple sclerosis-like illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verny et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu-Wai-Man et al., 2016</xref>), Parkinson’s disease and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lynch et al., 2017</xref>), and cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spiegel et al., 2016</xref>). Although the connection between these diseases and OPA1 is not fully understood, further research on DOA may provide a deeper insight into this relationship. In the future, pathological analysis using the present model could have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying these diseases.</p><p>DOA has also been reported to involve mtDNA depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amati-Bonneau et al., 2008</xref>), but our model, while useful for nuclear gene analysis, is limited for mtDNA analysis. The gene content in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mtDNA genome is similar as that in vertebrates, but the gene order and distribution on both DNA strands differ. mOPA1 interacts with mtDNA nucleoids through exon 4b binding to mtDNA D-loops, independent of mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). However, the homologous region of mOPA1 or hOPA1 to exon 4b is not found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and the D-loop of mtDNA has not been found in cultured cells of flies or in mtDNA of embryos using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rubenstein et al., 1977</xref>). In addition, while the D-loop is involved in mtDNA replication in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fish et al., 2004</xref>), the A+T region is the origin of replication in mtDNA replication in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goddard and Wolstenholme, 1978</xref>). Thus, there may be differences in the mechanism of mtDNA replication between humans and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garesse and Kaguni, 2005</xref>). Therefore, the association of dOPA1 with mtDNA may differ from that in mammals and the regulatory mechanism of mtDNA homeostasis in which dOPA1 is involved requires further investigation.</p><p>Another limitation of our model is that the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of L-OPA1 and S-OPA1, which are well analyzed in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacVicar and Langer, 2016</xref>), have not been elucidated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In hOPA1, S1 or S2 sites are processed by the i-AAA protease OMA1 and Yme1L respectively to produce short form of hOPA1 (S-hOPA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anand et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the fact that Yme1L is conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it has been involved in the degradation of the dOPA1 protein rather than its cleavage by dYme1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the cleavage site for i-AAA does not exist in dOPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olichon et al., 2007</xref>). Regarding other proteases, yeast Mgm1 is processed by the rhomboid protease Pcp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Esser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herlan et al., 2003</xref>). However, the Rhomboid-7, a Pcp1 ortholog of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, was not required for dOPA1 processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Whitworth et al., 2008</xref>). Although hOPA1 expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has identified three different sizes of hOPA1 in our western blotting result, it is unclear how they are cleaved. From a size perspective, the upper band was inferred to represent the full-length hOPA1 including the mitochondrial import sequence (MIS). Since the Middle and the lowest bands were not present in HA-tagged samples, it is possible that the bands at the Middle size represent the long-form hOPA1 in which probably MIS was processed. The band detected at the lowest position may represent an S-hOPA1. However, <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not have OMA1, an i-AAA protease that cleaves the S1 site. Although another i-AAA protease that cleaves the S2 site, YME1L, is conserved, our expressed hOPA1 is isoform 1 and lacks the S2 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, it is not clear how S-hOPA1 is processed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The anti-dOPA1 antiserum detects three bands in the overexpression of a FLAG-tagged dOPA1 construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Poole et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting a molecular mechanism by which dOPA1, like yeast and mammals, is cleaved after translation. However, the proteases involved in the mechanism are not yet clarified. Whether <italic>Drosophila’s</italic> endogenous mechanisms can be used to study how L-OPA1 and S-OPA1 are involved in DOA remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we established a new model of DOA in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in which we discovered the following: (1) We could replicate the human disease of optic nerve degeneration, allowing rapid genetic disease analysis. (2) We could distinguish the LOF and DN effects of <italic>hOPA1</italic> by observation of axonal degeneration phenotype but not with ROS signal, autophagy activity, and amount of the mitochondria in this model. These findings can reveal the pathological significance of de novo mutations and are useful in diagnosing DOA or DOA plus. Additionally, while <italic>hOPA1</italic> is the major gene involved in DOA, other genes involved in DOA and interacting proteins have not been investigated yet. Our model can be used for pathological modifier screening, exploring modifiers, and contributing to drug development. In the future, we hope to provide insights that can be applied to the fundamental treatment of DOA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Flies were maintained at 25°C on standard fly food.

Using forceps, the proboscis was secured, and the right and left eyes were dissected out with another set of forceps. The proboscis and attached trachea were also removed from the brain. The brains were then carefully transferred with forceps into a 1.5 mL tube containing 150 μL of 0.3% PBT (PBS with Triton X-100) at room temperature.</p><p>To fix the tissues, 50 μL of 16% formaldehyde was added to each tube, followed by gentle mixing.

It has long been hypothesized that missense OPA1 mutations affecting the GTPase domain, which are associated with more severe optic atrophy and extra-ophthalmic neurologic conditions such as sensorineural hearing loss (DOA plus), impart their effects through a dominant negative mechanism, but no clear direct evidence for this exists particularly in an animal model. The authors execute a well-designed study to establish their model, demonstrating a mitochondrial phenotype and optic atrophy measured as axonal degeneration. They leverage this model to provide the first direct evidence for a dominant negative mechanism for 2 mutations causing DOA plus by expressing these variants in the background of a full hOPA1 complement.</p><p>Strengths of the paper include well-motivated objectives and hypotheses, and overall solid design and execution. There is a thorough discussion of the interpretation and context of the findings. The results technically support their primary conclusions with minor limitations. First, while only partial rescue of the most clinically relevant metric for optic atrophy in this model is now acknowledged, the result nevertheless hamstrings the mechanistic experiments that follow. Second, the results statistically support a dominant negative effect of DOA plus-associated variants, yet the data show a marginal impact on axonal degeneration for these variants. In added experiments, the ability of WT hOPA1 and I382M but not 2708del, D438V or R445H to rescue ROS levels or mitophagy in the context of dOPA1 knockdown serves to support axonal number as a valid measure of mitochondrial function in this context. However, the critical experiment demonstrating a dominant negative effect was performed in the context of expressing WT hOPA1 along with a pathogenic variant, in which no differences in ROS, COXII expression or mitophagy were seen. This makes it difficult to conclude that the dominant negative effect of D438V and R445H on axon number is related to mitochondrial function.</p><p>As an animal model of DOA that may serve for rapid assessment of suspected OPA1 variants, the results overall support utility of this model in identifying pathogenic variants but not in distinguishing haploinsufficiency from dominant negative mechanisms among those variants. The impact of this work in providing the first direct evidence of a dominant negative mechanism is under-stated considering how important this question is in development of genetic treatments for dominant optic atrophy.</p><p><bold>Comments on revised version:</bold></p><p>The authors have addressed the comments in my initial review.

Detailing possible explanations for this has been addressed in the discussion. However, only partial rescue of the most clinically relevant metric for optic atrophy in this model hamstrings subsequent mechanistic experiments that follow.</p><p>Discussion regarding variant I382M has been improved.</p><p>While reviewer 1's concerns about axonal number as a biomarker for OPA1 function are valid, it is worth noting that this is the most clinically relevant marker in the context of DOA. That said, I agree that the mechanistic DN/HI studies needed support using other measures of mitochondrial function, and the authors have done this. The ability of WT hOPA1 and I382M but not 2708del, D438V or R445H to rescue ROS levels or mitophagy in the context of dOPA1 knockdown serves to support axonal number as a valid measure of mitochondrial function in this context. However, the critical experiment demonstrating a dominant negative effect was performed in the context of expressing WT hOPA1 along with a pathogenic variant, in which no differences in ROS, COXII expression or mitophagy were seen. This makes it difficult to conclude that the (marginal) DN effect of D438V and R445H on axon number is related to mitochondrial function, and serves as a minor weakness of the paper.</p><p>Which exons are included in the transcript, and therefore, which isoforms are expressed in the model, has been addressed.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>The authors have addressed the need to include greater methodological details.</p><p>Language concerning the clinical utility of the model in informing treatment decisions has been appropriately modified.

The authors then use this model to investigate the differences between dominant-negative and haploinsufficient OPA1 variants. The value of this paper lies in the study of DN/HI variants rather than the establishment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model per se as this has existed for some time and does have some significant disadvantages compared to existing models, particularly in the extra-ocular phenotype which is common with some OPA1 variants but not in humans. I judge the findings of this paper to be valuable with regards to significance and solid with regards to the strength of the evidence.</p><p>Suggestions for improvements:</p><p>(1) Stylistically the results section appears to have significant discussion/conclusion/inferences in section with reference to existing literature. I feel that this information would be better placed in the separate discussion section. E.g. lines 149-154.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to relocate the discussion, conclusions, and inferences, particularly those that reference existing literature, to a separate discussion section. For lines 149–154, we placed them in the discussion section (lines 343–347) as follows. “Our established fly model is the first simple organism to allow observation of degeneration of the retinal axons. The mitochondria in the axons showed fragmentation of mitochondria. Former studies have observed mitochondrial fragmentation in S2 cells (McQuibban et al., 2006), muscle tissue (Deng et al., 2008), segmental nerves (Trevisan et al., 2018), and ommatidia (Yarosh et al., 2008) due to the LOF of <italic>dOPA1</italic>.”</p><p>For lines 178–181, we also placed them in the discussion section (lines 347–351) as follows. “Our study presents compelling evidence that <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown instigates neuronal degeneration, characterized by a sequential deterioration at the axonal terminals and extending to the cell bodies. This degenerative pattern, commencing from the distal axons and progressing proximally towards the cell soma, aligns with the paradigm of 'dying-back' neuropathy, a phenomenon extensively documented in various neurodegenerative disorders (Wang et al., 2012). ”</p><p>For lines 213–217, 218–220, and 222–223, we also placed them in the discussion section (lines 363– 391) as follows. “To elucidate the pathophysiological implications of mutations in the <italic>OPA1</italic> gene, we engineered and expressed several human <italic>OPA1</italic> variants, including the 2708-2711del mutation, associated with DOA, and the I382M mutation, located in the GTPase domain and linked to DOA. We also investigated the D438V and R445H mutations in the GTPase domain and correlated with the more severe DOA plus phenotype. The 2708-2711del mutation exhibited limited detectability via HA-tag probing. Still, it was undetectable with a myc tag, likely due to a frameshift event leading to the mutation's characteristic truncated protein product, as delineated in prior studies (Zanna et al., 2008). Contrastingly, the I382M, D438V, and R445H mutations demonstrated expression levels comparable to the WT <italic>hOPA1</italic>. However, the expression of these mutants in retinal axons did not restore the dOPA1 deficiency to the same extent as the WT hOPA1, as evidenced in Figure 5E. This finding indicates a functional impairment imparted by these mutations, aligning with established understanding (Zanna et al., 2008). Notably, while the 2708-2711del and I382M mutations exhibited limited functional rescue, the D438V and R445H mutations did not show significant rescue activity. This differential rescue efficiency suggests that the former mutations, particularly the I382M, categorized as a hypomorph (Del Dotto et al., 2018), may retain partial functional capacity, indicative of a LOF effect but with residual activity. The I382M missense mutation within the GTPase domain of OPA1 has been described as a mild hypomorph or a disease modifier. Intriguingly, this mutation alone does not induce significant clinical outcomes, as evidenced by multiple studies (Schaaf et al., 2011; Bonneau et al., 2014; Bonifert et al., 2014; Carelli et al., 2015). A significant reduction in protein levels has been observed in fibroblasts originating from patients harboring the I382M mutation. However, mitochondrial volume remains unaffected, and the fusion activity of mitochondria is only minimally influenced (Kane et al., 2017; Del Dotto et al., 2018). This observation is consistent with findings reported by de la Barca et al. in Human Molecular Genetics 2020, where a targeted metabolomics approach classified I382M as a mild hypomorph. In our current study, the I382M mutation preserves more OPA1 function compared to DN mutations, as depicted in Figures 5E and F. Considering the results from our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model and previous research, we hypothesize that the I382M mutation may constitute a mild hypomorphic variant. This might explain its failure to manifest a phenotype on its own, yet its contribution to increased severity when it occurs in compound heterozygosity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I do think further investigation as to why a reduction of mitochondria was noticed in the knockdown. There are conflicting reports on this in the literature. My own experience of this is fairly uniform mitochondrial number in WT vs OPA1 variant lines but with an increased level of mitophagy presumably reflecting a greater turnover. There are a number of ways to quantify mitochondrial load e.g. mtDNA quantification, protein quantification for tom20/hsp60 or equivalent. I feel the reliance on ICC here is not enough to draw conclusions. Furthermore, mitophagy markers could be checked at the same time either at the transcript or protein level. I feel this is important as it helps validate the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model as we already have a lot of experimental data about the number and function of mitochondria in OPA+/- human/mammalian cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments and suggestions regarding our study on the impact of mitochondrial reduction in a knockdown model. We concur with the reviewer’s observation that our initial results did not definitively demonstrate a decrease in the number of mitochondria in retinal axons. Furthermore, we measured mitochondrial quantity by conducting western blotting using antiCOXII and found no reduction in mitochondrial content with the knockdown of <italic>dOPA1</italic> (Figure S4A and B). Consequently, we have revised our manuscript to remove the statement “suggesting a decreased number of mitochondria in retinal axons. However, whether this decrease is due to degradation resulting from a decline in mitochondrial quality or axonal transport failure remains unclear.” Instead, we have refocused our conclusion to reflect our electron microscopy findings, which indicate reduced mitochondrial size and structural abnormalities. The reviewer’s observation of consistent mitochondrial numbers in WT versus mutant variant lines and elevated mitophagy levels prompted us to evaluate mitochondrial turnover as a significant factor in our study. Regarding verifying mitophagy markers, we incorporated the mito-QC marker in our experimental design. In our experiments, mito-QC was expressed in the retinal axons of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to assess mitophagy activity upon <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown. We observed a notable increase in mCherry positive but GFP negative puncta signals one week after eclosion, indicating the activation of mitophagy (Figure 2D–H). This outcome strongly suggests that <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown enhances mitophagy in our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model. The application of mito-QC as a quantitative marker for mitophagy, validated in previous studies, offers a robust approach to analyzing this process. Our findings elucidate the role of <italic>dOPA1</italic> in mitochondrial dynamics and its implications for neuronal health. These results have been incorporated into Figure 2, with the corresponding text updated as follows (lines 159–167): “Given that an increase in mitophagy activity has been reported in mouse RGCs and nematode ADOA models (Zaninello et al., 2022; Zaninello et al., 2020), the mitoQC marker, an established indicator of mitophagy activity, was expressed in the photoreceptors of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The mito-QC reporter consists of a tandem mCherry-GFP tag that localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria (Lee et al., 2018). This construct allows the measurement of mitophagy by detecting an increase in the red-only mCherry signal when the GFP is degraded after mitochondria are transported to lysosomes. Post <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown, we observed a significant elevation in mCherry positive and GFP negative puncta signals at one week, demonstrating an activation of mitophagy as a consequence of <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown (Figure 2D–H).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Could the authors comment on the failure of the dOPA1 rescue to return their biomarker, axonal number to control levels. In Figure 4D is there significance between the control and rescue. Presumably so as there is between the mutant and rescue and the difference looks less.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer correctly pointed out, there is a significant difference between the control and rescue groups, which we have now included in the figure. Additionally, we have incorporated the following comments in the discussion section (lines 329–342) regarding this significant difference: “In our study, expressing <italic>dOPA1</italic> in the retinal axons of <italic>dOPA1</italic> mutants resulted in significant rescue, but it did not return to control levels. There are three possible explanations for this result. The first concerns gene expression levels. The Gal4-line used for the rescue experiments may not replicate the expression levels or timing of endogenous <italic>dOPA1</italic>. Considering that the optimal functionality of <italic>dOPA1</italic> may be contingent upon specific gene expression levels, attaining a wild-type-like state necessitates the precise regulation of these expression levels. The second is a nonautonomous issue. Although <italic>dOPA1</italic> gene expression was induced in the retinal axons for the rescue experiments, many retinal axons were homozygous mutants, while other cell types were heterozygous for the <italic>dOPA1</italic> mutation. If there is a non-autonomous effect of dOPA1 in cells other than retinal axons, it might not be possible to restore the wild-type-like state fully. The third potential issue is that only one isoform of <italic>dOPA1</italic> was expressed. In mouse OPA1, to completely restore mitochondrial network shape, an appropriate balance of at least two different isoforms, lOPA1 and s-OPA1, is required (Del Dotto et al., 2017). This requirement implies that multiple isoforms of <italic>dOPA1</italic> are essential for the dynamic activities of mitochondria.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors have chosen an interesting if complicated missense variant to study, namely the I382M with several studies showing this is insufficient to cause disease in isolation and appears in high frequency on gnomAD but appears to worsen the phenotype when it appears as a compound het. I think this is worth discussing in the context of the results, particularly with regard to the ability for this variant to partially rescue the dOPA1 model as shown in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, the I382M mutation is known to act as a disease modifier. However, in our system, as suggested by Figure 5, I382M appears to retain more activity than DN mutations. Considering previous studies, we propose that I382M represents a mild hypomorph. Consequently, while I382M alone may not exhibit a phenotype, it could exacerbate severity in a compound heterozygous state. We have incorporated this perspective in our revised discussion (lines 375-391).</p><p>“Notably, while the 2708-2711del and I382M mutations exhibited limited functional rescue, the D438V and R445H mutations did not show significant rescue activity. This differential rescue efficiency suggests that the former mutations, particularly the I382M, categorized as a hypomorph (Del Dotto et al., 2018), may retain partial functional capacity, indicative of a LOF effect but with residual activity. The I382M missense mutation within the GTPase domain of OPA1 has been described as a mild hypomorph or a disease modifier. Intriguingly, this mutation alone does no induce significant clinical outcomes, as evidenced by multiple studies (Schaaf et al., 2011; Bonneau et al., 2014; Bonifert et al., 2014; Carelli et al., 2015). A significant reduction in protein levels has been observed in fibroblasts originating from patients harboring the I382M mutation. However, mitochondrial volume remains unaffected, and the fusion activity of mitochondria is only minimally influenced (Kane et al., 2017; Del Dotto et al., 2018). This observation is consistent with findings reported by de la Barca et al. in Human Molecular Genetics 2020, where a targeted metabolomics approach classified I382M as a mild hypomorph. In our current study, the I382M mutation preserves more OPA1 function compared to DN mutations, as depicted in Figures 5E and F. Considering the results from our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model and previous research, we hypothesize that the I382M mutation may constitute a mild hypomorphic variant. This might explain its failure to manifest a phenotype on its own, yet its contribution to increased severity when it occurs in compound heterozygosity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I feel the main limitation of this paper is the reliance on axonal number as a biomarker for OPA1 function and ultimately rescue. I have concerns because (a) this is not a well validated biomarker within the context of OPA1 variants (b) we have little understanding of how this is affected by over/under expression and (c) if it is a threshold effect e.g. once OPA1 levels reach &lt;x% pathology develops but develops normally when opa1 expression is &gt;x%. I think this is particularly relevant when the authors are using this model to make conclusions on dominant negativity/HI with the authors proposing that if expression of a hOPA1 transcript does not increase opa1 expression in a dOPA1 KO then this means that the variant is DN. The authors have used other biomarkers in parts of this manuscript e.g. ROS measurement and mito trafficking but I feel this would benefit from something else particularly in the latter experiments demonstrated in figure 5 and 6.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised concerns regarding the adequacy of axonal count as a validated biomarker in the context of <italic>OPA1</italic> mutants. In response, we corroborated its validity using markers such as MitoSOX, Atg8, and COXII. Experiments employing MitoSOX revealed that the augmented ROS signals resulting from <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown were mitigated by expressing human <italic>OPA1</italic>. Conversely, the mutant variants 2708-2711del, D438V, and R445H did not ameliorate these effects, paralleling the phenotype of axonal degeneration observed. These findings are documented in Figure 5F, and we have incorporated the following text into section lines 248–254 of the results:</p><p>“Furthermore, we assessed the potential for rescuing ROS signals. Similar to its effect on axonal degeneration, wild-type hOPA1 effectively mitigated the phenotype, whereas the 2708-2711del, D438V, and R445H mutants did not (Figure 5F). Importantly, the I382M variant also reduced ROS levels comparably to the wild type. These findings demonstrate that both axonal degeneration and the increase in ROS caused by dOPA1 downregulation can be effectively counteracted by hOPA1. Although I382M retains partial functionality, it acts as a relatively weak hypomorph in this experimental setup.”</p><p>Moreover, utilizing mito-QC, we observed elevated mitophagy in our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, with these results now included in Figure 2D–H. Given the complexity of the genetics involved and the challenges in establishing lines, autophagy activity was quantified by comparing the ratio of Atg8-1 to Atg8-2 via Western blot analysis. However, no significant alterations were detected across any of the genotypes. Additionally, mitochondrial protein levels derived from COXII confirmed consistent mitochondrial quantities, showing no considerable variance following knockdown. These insights affirm that retinal axon degeneration and mitophagy activation are present in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> DOA model, although the Western blot analysis revealed no significant changes in autophagy activation. Such findings necessitate caution as this model may not fully replicate the molecular pathology of the corresponding human disease. These Western blot findings are presented in Figure S4, with the following addition made to section lines 255–263 of the results:</p><p>“We also conducted Western blot analyses using anti-COXII and anti-Atg8a antibodies to assess changes in mitochondrial quantity and autophagy activity following the knockdown of <italic>dOPA1</italic>.

This limitation of the fly model is mentioned in the results, noting the observation of the axonal degeneration phenotype but not alterations in ROS signaling, autophagy activity, or mitochondrial quantity as follows (line 287–290):</p><p>“We investigated the impacts of dominant negative mutations on mitochondrial oxidation levels, mitochondrial quantity, and autophagy activation levels; however, none of these parameters showed statistical significance (Figure S6).”</p><p>The reviewer also inquired about the effects of overexpressing and underexpressing <italic>OPA1</italic> on axonal count and whether these effects are subject to a threshold.

The results showed no significant differences in expression levels between the wild-type and variant forms in the <italic>OPA1</italic> overexpression experiments, suggesting the absence of a variation threshold effect. These findings have been newly documented as quantitative data in Figure 5C. Furthermore, we have included a statement in the results section for Figure 6A, clarifying that overexpression of hOPA1 exhibited no discernible impact, as detailed on lines 274–276.</p><p>“The results presented in Figure 5C indicate that there are no significant differences in the expression levels among the variants, suggesting that variations in expression levels do not influence the outcomes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Could the authors clarify what exons in Figure 5 are included in their transcript. My understanding is transcript NM_015560.3 contains exon 4,4b but not 5b. According to Song 2007 this transcript produces invariably s-OPA1 as it contains the exon 4b cleavage site. If this is true, this is a critical limitation in this study and in my opinion significantly undermines the likelihood of the proposed explanation of the findings presented in Figure 6. The primarily functional location of OPA1 is at the IMM and l-OPA1 is the primary opa1 isoform probably only that localizes here as the additional AA act as a IMM anchor. Given this is where GTPase likely oligomerizes the expression of s-OPA1 only is unlikely to interact anyway with native protein. I am not aware of any evidence s-OPA1 is involved in oligomerization. Therefore I don't think this method and specifically expression of a hOPA1 transcript which only makes s-OPA1 to be a reliable indicator of dominant negativity/interference with WT protein function. This could be checked by blotting UAS-hOPA1 protein with a OPA1 antibody specific to human OPA1 only and not to dOPA1. There are several available on the market and if the authors see only s-OPA1 then it confirms they are not expressing l-OPA1 with their hOPA1 construct.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed a Western blot using a human OPA1 antibody to determine if the expressed hOPA1 was producing the l-OPA1 isoform, as shown in band 2 of Figure 5D. The results confirmed the presence of both l-OPA1 and what appears to be s-OPA1 in bands 2 and 4, respectively. These findings are documented in the updated Figure 5D, with a detailed description provided in the manuscript at lines 224-226. Additionally, the NM_015560.3 refers to isoform 1, which includes only exons 4 and 5, excluding exons 4b and 5b. This isoform can express both l-OPA1 and s-OPA1 (refer to Figure 1 in Song et al., J Cell Biol. 2007). We have updated the schematic diagram in the figure to include these exons. The formation of s-OPA1 through cleavage occurs at the OMA1 target site located in exon 5 and the Yme1L target site in exon 5b of <italic>OPA1</italic>. Isoform 1 of <italic>OPA1</italic> is prone to cleavage by OMA1, but a homologous gene for OMA1 does not exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Although a homologous gene for Yme1L is present in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, exon 5b is missing in isoform 1 of <italic>OPA1</italic>, leaving the origin of the smaller band resembling s-OPA1 unclear at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The data presented support and extend some previously published data using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model to unravel the cellular and genetic basis of human Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA).

By using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> loss-of-function mutations, RNAi- mediated knockdown and overexpression, the authors could recapitulate some aspects of the disease phenotype, which could be rescued by the wild-type version of the human gene. Their assays allowed them to distinguish between mutations causing human DOA, affecting the optic system and supposed to be loss-of-function mutations, and those mutations supposed to act as dominant negative, resulting in DOA plus, in which other tissues/organs are affected as well. Based on the lack of information in the Materials and Methods section and in several figure legends, it was not in all cases possible to follow the conclusions of the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's constructive feedback and the emphasis on enhancing clarity in our manuscript.

By underscoring the model’s value in differential diagnosis and its influence on initiating treatment strategies, we have clarified this connection explicitly, within the constraints of the abstract’s word limit.

It has long been hypothesized that missense OPA1 mutations affecting the GTPase domain, which are associated with more severe optic atrophy and extra-ophthalmic neurologic conditions such as sensorineural hearing loss (DOA plus), impart their effects through a dominant negative mechanism, but no clear direct evidence for this exists particularly in an animal model. The authors execute a well-designed study to establish their model, demonstrating a clear mitochondrial phenotype with multiple clinical analogs including optic atrophy measured as axonal degeneration. They then show that hOPA1 mitigates optic atrophy with the same efficacy as dOPA1, setting up the utility of their model to test disease-causing hOPA1 variants. Finally, they leverage this model to provide the first direct evidence for a dominant negative mechanism for 2 mutations causing DOA plus by expressing these variants in the background of a full hOPA1 complement.</p><p>Strengths of the paper include well-motivated objectives and hypotheses, overall solid design and execution, and a generally clear and thorough interpretation of their results. The results technically support their primary conclusions with caveats. The first is that both dOPA1 and hOPA1 fail to fully restore optic axonal integrity, yet the authors fail to acknowledge that this only constitutes a partial rescue, nor do they discuss how this fact might influence our interpretation of their subsequent results.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer rightly points out, neither <italic>dOPA1</italic> nor <italic>hOPA1</italic> achieve a complete recovery. Therefore, we acknowledge that this represents only a partial rescue and have added the following explanations regarding this partial rescue in the results and discussion sections.</p><p>Result:</p><p>Significantly —&gt; partially (lines 207 and 228) Discussion (lines 329–342):</p><p>In our study, expressing <italic>dOPA1</italic> in the retinal axons of <italic>dOPA1</italic> mutants resulted in significant rescue, but it did not return to control levels. There are three possible explanations for this result. The first concerns gene expression levels. The Gal4-line used for the rescue experiments may not replicate the expression levels or timing of endogenous <italic>dOPA1</italic>. Considering that the optimal functionality of <italic>dOPA1</italic> may be contingent upon specific gene expression levels, attaining a wild-type-like state necessitates the precise regulation of these expression levels. The second is a non-autonomous issue. Although <italic>dOPA1</italic> gene expression was induced in the retinal axons for the rescue experiments, many retinal axons were homozygous mutants, while other cell types were heterozygous for the <italic>dOPA1</italic> mutation. If there is a non-autonomous effect of dOPA1 in cells other than retinal axons, it might not be possible to restore the wild-type-like state fully. The third potential issue is that only one isoform of <italic>dOPA1</italic> was expressed. In mouse OPA1, to completely restore mitochondrial network shape, an appropriate balance of at least two different isoforms, l-OPA1 and s-OPA1, is required (Del Dotto et al., 2017). This requirement implies that multiple isoforms of <italic>dOPA1</italic> are essential for the dynamic activities of mitochondria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second caveat is that their effect sizes are small. Statistically, the results indeed support a dominant negative effect of DOA plus-associated variants, yet the data show a marginal impact on axonal degeneration for these variants. The authors might have considered exploring the impact of these variants on other mitochondrial outcome measures they established earlier on. They might also consider providing some functional context for this marginal difference in axonal optic nerve degeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment regarding the modest effect sizes observed, we acknowledge that the magnitude of the reported changes is indeed small. To explore the impact of these variants on additional mitochondrial outcomes as suggested, we employed markers such as MitoSOX, Atg8, and COXII for validation. However, we could not detect any significant effects of the DOA plus-associated variants using these methods. We apologize for the redundancy, but to address Reviewer #1's fifth question, we present experimental results showing that while the increased ROS signals observed upon <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown were rescued by expressing human <italic>OPA1</italic>, the mutant variants 2708-2711del, D438V, and R445H did not ameliorate this effect. This outcome mirrors the axonal degeneration phenotype and is documented in Figure 5F. The following text has been added to the results section lines 248–254:</p><p>“Furthermore, we assessed the potential for rescuing ROS signals. Similar to its effect on axonal degeneration, wild-type hOPA1 effectively mitigated the phenotype, whereas the 2708-2711del, D438V, and R445H mutants did not (Figure 5F). Importantly, the I382M variant also reduced ROS levels comparably to the wild type. These findings demonstrate that both axonal degeneration and the increase in ROS caused by dOPA1 downregulation can be effectively counteracted by hOPA1. Although I382M retains partial functionality, it acts as a relatively weak hypomorph in this experimental setup.”</p><p>Moreover, utilizing mito-QC, we observed elevated mitophagy in our <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, with these results now included in Figure 2D–H.

The authors discuss important points regarding the potential utility of this model in clinical science.

Notably, the 2708-2711del and I382M mutations demonstrated only partial rescue, indicative of a hypomorphic effect with residual activity. In contrast, the D438V and R445H mutations failed to show significant rescue, suggesting a more profound LOF. The correlation between the partial rescue by the 2708-2711del and I382M mutations and their classification as hypomorphic is significant. Moreover, the observed differences in rescue efficacy correspond to the clinical severities associated with these mutations, namely in DOA and DOA plus disorders. Thus, our results substantiate the model’s ability to quantitatively discriminate among mutations based on their impact on protein functionality, providing an insightful measure of LOF magnitude.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>Line 251, 252 and line 358: What is &quot;the optic nerve&quot; in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>In humans, the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are referred to as the optic nerve, and we posit that the retinal axons in flies are similar to this structure. In the introduction section, where it is described that the visual systems of flies and humans bear resemblance, we have appended the following definition (lines 107–108): “In this study, we defined the retinal axons of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as analogous to the human optic nerve.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 344: These bands appear only upon overexpression of the hOPA1 constructs, so this part of the is very speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>Confirmation was achieved using anti-hOPA1, demonstrating that myc is not nonspecific.

Additionally, rescue was not possible with any variants except for I382M. Furthermore, we assessed whether there were changes in ROS in the evaluation of dominant negatives, but no significant differences were observed in this experimental system. These findings have been added to the discussion section as follows (lines 318–328). “Our research established that <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown precipitates axonal degeneration and elevates ROS signals in retinal axons. Expression of human <italic>OPA1</italic> within this context effectively mitigated both phenomena; it partially reversed axonal degeneration and nearly completely normalized ROS levels. These results imply that factors other than increased ROS may drive the axonal degeneration observed post-knockdown. Furthermore, while differences between the impacts of DN mutations and loss-of- function mutations were evident in axonal degeneration, they were less apparent when using ROS as a biomarker. The extensive use of transgenes in our experiments might have mitigated the knockdown effects. In a systemic <italic>dOPA1</italic> knockdown, assessments of mitochondrial quantity and autophagy activity revealed no significant changes, suggesting that the cellular consequences of reduced <italic>OPA1</italic> expression might vary across different cell types.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Consider being more explicit regarding literature that has or has failed to test a direct dominant negative effect by expressing a variant in question in the background of a full OPA1 complement. My understanding is that this is the first direct evidence of this widely held hypothesis. This lends to the main claim promoting the utility of fly as a model in general. The authors might also outline this in the introduction as a knowledge gap they fill through this study.</p></disp-quote><p>In the introduction, we have incorporated a passage that highlights precedents capable of distinguishing between LOF and DN effects, and we note the absence of models capable of dissecting these distinctions within an in vivo organism. This study aims to address this gap, proposing a model that elucidates the differential impacts of LOF and DN within the context of a living model organism, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of their roles in disease pathology. We added the following sentences in the introduction (lines 71–80).</p><p>“In the quest to differentiate between LOF and DN effects within the context of genetic mutations, precedents exist in simpler systems such as yeast and human fibroblasts. These models have provided valuable insights into the conserved functions of OPA1 across species, as evidenced by studies in yeast models (Del Dotto et al., 2018) and fibroblasts derived from patients harboring <italic>OPA1</italic> mutations (Kane et al., 2017). However, the ability to distinguish between LOF and DN effects in an in vivo model organism, particularly at the structural level of retinal axon degeneration, has remained elusive. This gap underscores the necessity for a more complex model that not only facilitates molecular analysis but also enables the examination of structural changes in axons and mitochondria, akin to those observed in the actual disease state.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should clarify the language used in the abstract and introduction on the effect of hOPA1 DOA and DOA plus on the dOPA1- phenotype.
