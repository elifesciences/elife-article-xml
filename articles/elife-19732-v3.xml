in vitro, and become more adult-like in their structure, cellular diversity and function following transplantation into immunocompromised mice. Previously we have demonstrated that hPSC-derived human lung organoids (HLOs) resembled human fetal lung tissue in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dye et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show that HLOs required a bioartificial microporous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffold niche for successful engraftment, long-term survival, and maturation of lung epithelium in vivo. Analysis of scaffold-grown transplanted tissue showed airway-like tissue with enhanced epithelial structure and organization compared to HLOs grown in vitro. By further comparing in vitro and in vivo grown HLOs with fetal and adult human lung tissue, we found that in vivo transplanted HLOs had improved cellular differentiation of secretory lineages that is reflective of differences between fetal and adult tissue, resulting in airway-like structures that were remarkably similar to the native adult human lung.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19732.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19732.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>organoids</kwd><kwd>lung airway</kwd><kwd>human pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>transplantation</kwd><kwd>scaffolds</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rackham Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dye</surname><given-names>Briana R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cellular and Molecular Biology Training Grant - T32 GM007315</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Alyssa J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tissue Engineering and Regeneration Training Grant - DE00007057-40</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Alyssa J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 HL119215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Jason R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Dye et al., 2015) showing that pluripotent stem cell derived lung organoids were immature/fetal, the current study shows that in vivo transplantation leads to mature tissue, reminiscent of adult airways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The past decade has seen an exciting emergence of new models of human development and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">St Johnston, 2015</xref>). These advances stem from our ability to culture primary human tissues and derive complex three-dimensional organ-like tissues, called organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dedhia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fatehullah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Hockemeyer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huch and Koo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rookmaaker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dye et al., 2016</xref>). Both tissue-derived and hPSC-derived human lung models have been developed and recapitulate some structural and cellular features of the human lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barkauskas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rock et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gotoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Konishi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vaughan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pageau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fessart et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franzdóttir et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaisani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mou et al., 2016</xref>). For example, we recently described methods to direct differentiation of hPSCs in a stepwise process, which mimicked aspects of in vivo lung development, into three-dimensional human lung organoids (HLOs). HLOs possessed closed epithelial cysts resembling airway-like structures, which consisted of epithelial cells primarily expressing ciliated and basal cell markers. The airway-like structures were surrounded by mesenchyme, including cells expressing smooth muscle and myofibroblast markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dye et al., 2015</xref>). Despite having airway-like organization around a lumen, the HLO epithelium was disorganized and did not possess some cell types found in the mature airway, including club and goblet secretory cell lineages. Consistent with in vitro differentiated HLOs being immature, transcriptome-wide comparisons showed that HLOs were similar to the human fetal lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dye et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to HLOs, intestinal, kidney and cerebral organoids are similar to the analogous human fetal organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finkbeiner et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Camp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takasato et al., 2015</xref>). Human intestinal organoids (HIOs), for example, are an in vitro three-dimensional model of the human intestine derived from hPSCs that closely resemble the fetal intestine. When transplanted under the mouse kidney capsule, HIOs mature and gain relevant adult structures including villi and crypts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finkbeiner et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finkbeiner et al., 2015a</xref>). In the current work, our goal was to transplant HLOs to determine if an in vivo environment would enhance the structural organization and cellular differentiation of the airway-like tissue.</p><p>Our results show that, unlike intestinal organoids, HLOs placed under the mouse kidney capsule, in the omentum, or the epididymal fat pad did not generate lung epithelial structures or cell types. Thus, while all of these highly vascular sites have been utilized for engraftment in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finkbeiner et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pepper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartholomeus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smink et al., 2013</xref>), HLOs did not thrive in these environments. We turned to microporous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffolds in order to create an alternative niche for the HLOs during transplantation since PLG scaffolds have led to improved survival and function of pancreatic beta cells following transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blomeier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hlavaty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kheradmand et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that microporous PLG scaffolds provided a niche for HLOs that enhance survival and engraftment upon transplantation into the epididymal fat pad of NOD-<italic>scid</italic> IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice. After 8–15 weeks, the retrieved transplanted HLOs (tHLOs) possessed airway-like structures with improved epithelial organization resembling the human adult lung and demonstrated enhanced cellular differentiation into basal, ciliated, club, and goblet cells. The tHLO airway structures were vascularized, and surrounded by mesenchymal cells that expressed both smooth muscle and myofibroblast markers, in addition to areas of organized cartilage. This work demonstrates that hPSC-derived lung tissue can give rise to complex multicellular airway-like structures in vivo, similar to those found in the adult human lung.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lung epithelium does not persist when HLOs are transplanted into mice</title><p>It has been shown that hPSC derived intestinal organoids acquire crypt and villus structures resembling the adult intestine along with mature cell types by transplantation into a highly vascular in vivo environment such as the kidney capsule or the abdominal omentum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finkbeiner et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). A similar strategy was employed in an attempt to engraft and mature HLOs, in which several different experimental conditions and engraftment sites were attempted utilizing NSG mice. Experiments were initially conducted using the hESC line UM63-1, and all major findings were reproduced in two additional hESC lines; H1 and H9 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Data presented throughout the manuscript are from the hESC line UM63-1, unless otherwise stated. In our first attempt, 35d (35 day old) HLOs were placed under the kidney capsule and were harvested after 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). The retrieved organoids expressed the human-specific mitochondria marker (huMITO), but lacked NKX2.1+ lung epithelium (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). We hypothesized that an earlier stage of HLO cultures may be more proliferative and therefore have better survival upon engraftment. 1d HLOs were injected under the kidney capsule (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). After 6 weeks, the tissue had expanded, surpassing the size of the kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Further analysis demonstrated that the tissue was of human origin (huMITO+), but no NKX2.1+ epithelium was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, the age of transplanted HLOs did not seem to affect the survival of the HLO lung epithelium.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19732.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Overview of Organoid transplants.

In both conditions, 100% of the recovered constructs possessed NKX2.1+ airway-like structures (n = 12 total) (Characterized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the addition of Matrigel/FGF10 prior to transplant was not necessary, but that the scaffold provided critical support for engraftment and survival of the lung epithelium. The epididymal fat pad was chosen as the site for transplantation because it was the only site able to accommodate the large size of the scaffold-HLO construct while still providing a highly vascular environment. As a control, 1d HLOs in a Matrigel plug (without being placed on a scaffold) were transplanted into the epididymal fat pad but no tissue was recovered at 8 weeks post-transplant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We also demonstrated that HLOs generated from three independent hESC lines (H1, H9, UM63-1) developed similarly following transplantation on scaffolds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrated that PLG scaffolds provide a robust niche, enabling HLOs to engraft and survive in the epididymal fat pad.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19732.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transplanted HLO-scaffold constructs engrafted, grew and possessed airway-like structures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PLG scaffold are 5 mm in diameter with honeycomb-patterned architecture.

After 4 weeks of transplantation, constructs had airway-like structures that resembled in vitro grown HLOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dye et al., 2015</xref>). 4 week HLO constructs had NKX2.1 +/huMITO+ airway-like structures that consisted of cells expressing the basal cell marker P63 and ciliated markers FOXJ1 and Acetylated Tubulin (ACTTUB), but the secretory club cell marker CC10 (also known as SCGB1A1) was not detected, suggesting that 4 weeks of transplantation did not lead to enhanced structure within HLOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The scaffold-HLO constructs harvested after 8 weeks ranged in size from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We observed that each transplanted HLO had multiple epithelial structures per cross section. To further characterize the in vivo grown HLOs, we quantified the total number of epithelial structures (ECAD+) per cross-section and found that 86.19% of all ECAD structures were also NKX2.1+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The histology of the transplanted tissue revealed airway-like structures tightly surrounded by mesenchymal cells. In addition, there were pockets of organized cartilage throughout the transplants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Epithelial structures were verified to be of human origin using huMITO and the human-specific nuclear marker HUNU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–K</xref>). As a control, 1d HLOs were seeded on the scaffold and grown in vitro for 4 to 8 weeks. These in vitro grown HLO-scaffolds had significantly less growth, and although some cells expressed the lung marker NKX2.1, no airway structures were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). This is possibly due to the fact that HLOs grown in vitro are normally embedded in Matrigel and passaged every two weeks whereas tissue grown on the scaffolds could not be passaged, and were not embedded in Matrigel. Thus, results from in vitro grown scaffold-HLO constructs suggest that the scaffold alone does not support long term HLO growth or induce the enhanced epithelial organization or maturation, but the combination of the scaffold and the in vivo environment allows for growth and maturation of the HLO epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>In vivo grown HLO-scaffold constructs have enhanced epithelial structure and cellular differentiation</title><p>The native lung is organized into airway structures and alveoli. Interestingly, even though in vitro grown HLOs possessed alveolar cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dye et al., 2015</xref>), we could not find evidence for the ATI marker HOPX or the ATII marker SFTPC in tHLOs at 4 or 8 weeks indicating that these cell types do not persist in vivo (data not shown). Native lung airways are organized into a SOX2+ pseudostratified epithelium with basal and multiciliated cells being the most prevalent cell types in the airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</xref>). Both non-transplanted HLOs and transplanted HLOs expressed the airway marker SOX2; however, tHLOs on scaffolds formed a highly organized pseudostratified epithelium, including taller ECAD+ cells that had a clearly visible apical and basal surface similar to the adult human airway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; Note that adult human airways examined are consider lower bronchi as detailed in the Materials and methods). The average cell height – from the apical to basal surface – of cells lining the tHLO airway-like lumen was similar to adult lungs while the non-transplanted HLOs grown in Matrigel had significantly shorter cells than the tHLOs and adult lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In both fetal upper airways and adult airways, basal cells line the basal side of the airway epithelium and express markers including P63, cytokeratin 5 (CK5), and NGFR (2C-E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>; Note that fetal human airways examined are considered upper bronchi, as detailed in the Materials and methods). Both non-transplanted and transplanted HLOs possessed cells lining the basal side of the airway-like structures that expressed the basal cell markers P63, CK5, and NGFR, however; basal cells in tHLOs had cellular organization and shape more reminiscent of the native human lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>).</p><p>Upon dissection of tHLOs, we observed tube-like structures within the 8 week constructs. Micro-dissected tube-like structures were stained for FOXJ1 and P63 using whole-mount immunostaining, followed by confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Whole-mount imaging revealed tube-like structures with abundant FOXJ1 and P63 expressing cells. P63+ cells appeared to line the basal surface of the tube, while FOXJ1 appeared to be located closer to the lumen. A cross section through a three-dimensional rendered airway revealed that the structure had a lumen lined by FOXJ1+ cells, while P63+ cells lined the outside of the tube along the basal side of the airway-like tissue. This organization was similar to the upper airways in the adult and fetal human lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Although several tube-like structures were observed, micro-dissection was very disruptive, and did not allow accurate quantitation of the number of these structures. Thus, it is likely that not all airway-like structures were shaped as a tube, and cyst-shaped airway structures are also present within the transplants. In the adult airway and fetal upper airway sections, the majority of the cells facing toward the lumen express the ciliated cell marker FOXJ1 and are multiciliated, demonstrated by ACTTUB staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>. In vitro grown HLOs have scattered cells that express FOXJ1 and few disorganized cells that are multiciliated as shown by ACTTUB immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>).

We had previously reported that HLOs grown in vitro possessed rare cells expressing low levels of the club cell marker CC10 and we did not detect cells expressing MUC5AC protein, which is found in goblet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dye et al., 2015</xref>). We asked if the lack of differentiated secretory cell types reflected an immature stage of development by comparing cellular differentiation in human adult and fetal airways. In adult airways, cells expressing the club cell markers CC10 and PLUNC and cells expressing the goblet cell marker MUC5AC were scattered throughout the airway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, we could not find evidence for robust expression of any of these markers in the human fetal lung at 14 weeks of gestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to the adult airway, we observed that the tHLO epithelium had distinct CC10+, PLUNC+, and MUC5AC+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Further quantification of secretory cells in multiple tHLOs (n = 9 independent transplants) revealed biological heterogeneity across samples. On average 45.55% of all NKX2.1+ airways contained CC10+ secretory cells and 70.43% contained MUC5AC+ secreting cells, however; variability ranged from some individual tHLOs possessing no secretory cells (n = 2/9 possessed no CC10+; n = 1/9 possessed no MUC5AC+) to 100% of all airway structures within an individual tHLO possessing secretory cell types (n = 1/9 CC10+; n = 3/9 MUC5AC+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Highly organized airway-like structures with multiple cell types (P63+ basal, ACTTUB+ multiciliated, CC10+ club and MUC5AC+ goblet cells) were also observed in tHLOs derived from the H9 and H1 cell lines, indicating that maturation of airway-like structures upon transplantation is reproducible across multiple cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, airway-like structures transplanted for different lengths of times (8 weeks, 15 weeks) appeared similar in epithelial organization and in expression of mature airway markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that in vivo grown tHLOs possess airway-like epithelium with basal, ciliated, goblet, and club cells in a highly organized pseudostratified epithelium that resembled both the structure and cellular diversity of adult human airways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Transplanted HLOs possess diverse mesenchymal cell types and vasculature</title><p>Along with the epithelium, native adult airways are surrounded by smooth muscle, myofibroblasts, and cartilage.

Tissue grown on an air-liquid interface generated an organized pseudostratified epithelium that reflects most of the cellular diversity of the human airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wong et al., 2012</xref>), while other models possess an airway epithelium with a supporting mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Firth et al., 2014</xref>). Previous work has also shown that lung epithelial cells derived from hPSC monolayers transplanted underneath a mouse kidney capsule can further differentiate into cells expressing airway and alveolar markers over a period of six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). However, it was unclear how robust this approach was, and whether this yielded tissue with any degree of organization. To our knowledge, the work presented here is the first to show that hPSC-derived HLOs are able to engraft in vivo and differentiate into an organized pseudostratified airway-like epithelium with a complete repertoire of airway cell types and supporting mesenchyme, along with a vascular supply and the ability to survive for long periods of time. Interestingly, our findings demonstrated that despite the fact that in vitro grown HLOs possessed alveolar cell types, we found no evidence of alveolar cells or alveolar structure in tHLOs. Given that the alveolar cell types present in HLOs were few in number, it is possible that these cells were not abundant enough to persist in vitro, or alternatively, that PLG scaffolds did not promote their survival. Ongoing studies are aimed at better understanding how to generate these distal airway structures.</p><p>Here, we used microporous PLG scaffolds to provide a physical environment for HLO engraftment in vivo however; alternative engineering approaches have also been developed as a platform to grow organized lung-like structures. For example, decelluarized lung scaffolds have been employed to seed primary and derived lung tissue in order to provide an appropriate physical and structural environment and in attempts to generate lung-like tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilpin et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghaedi et al., 2014</xref>). Many efforts have focused on seeding alveolar tissue including alveolar type I and II cells onto acellular matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilpin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghaedi et al., 2014</xref>), and lung tissue derived from mouse embryonic stem cells seeded on decellularized rat lung matrix enhanced maturation of airway cell types and epithelial organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shojaie et al., 2015</xref>). Our data previously demonstrated that in vitro grown HLOs seeded onto an adult human decelluarized lung matrix allowed adherence of the HLO epithelium to the airway matrix and resulted in the differentiation of a small number of multiciliated cells, but did not enhance club or goblet cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dye et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, our data along with the data from decelluarized lung scaffolds suggest that providing an ideal physical environment may be an important factor for promoting tissue organization and differentiation, but that additional cues will also be required for full tissue maturation.</p><p>Recent breakthroughs in biomimetic microfluidic cell-culture devices called 'organs on a chip' have also generated airway epithelium from human adult airway cells grown on an air-liquid interface platform. The microfluidic devices allow are designed to mimic the microenvironment of the airway, and can include controlled media flow and multiple cell layers including human primary epithelium, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sellgren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benam et al., 2016</xref>). These in vitro systems successfully mimic the microenvironment of an airway, but are designed for small scale and high throughput applications. In contrast tHLOs are an in vivo system that may be more appropriate for low-throughput disease modeling or for pre-clinical drug testing, which has a great unmet need for better models that more accurately mimic human tissue in both healthy and diseased states in order to improve prediction of drug efficacy. This is particularly true for diseases that affect the lung, in part because commonly used animal models do not faithfully recapitulate several key aspects of the human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moore and Hogaboam, 2008</xref>). Moreover, there is generally a poor track record of accurately predicting which drugs will work in humans based on pre-clinical animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruggeri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mak et al., 2014</xref>), as up to 80% of drugs that pass pre-clinical tests fail in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perrin, 2014</xref>). A prime example of this is in lung disease where many therapies have shown benefit in mouse models, but only 2 of these have shown benefit in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Myllärniemi and Kaarteenaho, 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to speculate that tHLOs will have utility as a novel model to study complex tissue-tissue interactions in airway homeostasis or disease. For example, since tHLOs have the potential to interact with the host immune system, and since the epithelium possesses diverse cell types including club and goblet cells, it may be possible to model inflammatory insults resulting in goblet cell hyperplasia. Future directions will be aimed at exploiting this new in vivo model of the human airway to better understand disease and to improve human health.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, human tissue and animals</title><p>Human ES line UM63-1 (NIH registry #0277) was obtained from the University of Michigan and human ES line H9 (NIH registry #0062) and H1 (NIH registry #0043) was obtained from the WiCell Research Institute.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, NKX2.1+ airway-like tissue within individual tHLOs were quantitated to determine if they possessed ciliated cells, club cells or goblet cells by co-immunostaining with NKX2.1, ACTTUB, CC10 and MUC5AC antibodies, respectively. Cell height was measured of the cells facing in toward a lumen of an airway stained with ECAD by using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Experimental replicates and statistics</title><p>All immunofluorescence (IF) were done on at least three (n = 3) independent biological samples per experiment except for foregut spheroids injected into the kidney capsule. Only 1 out 3 transplanted foregut spheroids under the kidney capsule yielded retrievable tissue; therefore only 1 sample was used for the IF analysis. For the airway quantification and cell height quantification the error bars represented SEM while the long bar represented the average. Statistical differences were assessed with Prism software using multiple t tests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>JRS is supported by the NIH-NHLBI (R01 HL119215).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this research advance, building on their previous generation of lung organoids from human pluripotent cells, the authors have described a bioengineering approach to derive airway epithelial cell structures in vivo using scaffolds and iPS derived cells. Using a combination of organoid culture with matrigel and scaffold, the layered epithelium they achieve in vivo closely parallels human airway. The imaging and especially the polarity and organization of the cell types they have achieved is quite remarkable. This technique, if as reproducible and efficient as reported, could advance the field for the study of lung disease.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main concern raised by the reviewers was around the reproducibility of the process and the quantitation of the extent of the differentiated structures produced. There is still wide variability in success for each transplant. What parameters are critical in determining efficiency? If this approach is to become a major tool for studying lung function and lung disease, the robustness with which the complex structures can be produced in different assays and using different starting cell lines is key.</p><p>The authors are requested to consider these issues and address them as outlined in the reviewers' comments below:</p><p>A major concern is that the overall reproducibility of the PLG technique is not clear. For example, it is not clear if every region of NKX2.1+,ECAD+ epithelium stained at 8 weeks post-transplant was differentiated as airway, or if differentiation was more patchy. Please quantify appropriately to clarify this point. In addition, 3x 15 week transplants are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> as showing NKX2.1+ regions with airway-like differentiation. Were these identical to the 8 week transplants? Two different cell lines are listed as being used in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, were the results identical between them?</p><p>Similarly, was the airway epithelium obtained at 8-15 weeks post-transplant always arranged in tubes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>?</p><p>In general quantitation is appropriate and well described (although as noted above the origin of the samples scored is not shown e.g. all H9, or all UM63-1, or a mixture? 8 weeks or 15 weeks?) e.g. cell height of airway epithelium <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>However, the quantitation of the secretory cell phenotype is missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Such a concern is very valid in a field where variability is often not addressed adequately (or at all in some cases), and we appreciate the opportunity to improve our manuscript with additional data to help paint a transparent picture of the transplanted lung organoid system that we are describing. We will note that for the revision, we have added transplant from another cell, bringing the number of different cell lines used to three (H1, H9, UM63-1), (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). While the absolute number of airway-like epithelium structures varied widely amongst individual transplants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), we will note that 100% of transplants examined from all three cell lines possessed at least some airway-like epithelium. Thus, we feel that using three different cell lines, and a total of n=19 individual constructs transplanted into different mice for at least 8 weeks, with 100% of these possessing some airway-like epithelium, that we have rigorously tested the robustness of this system.</p><p><italic>The authors are requested to consider these issues and address them as outlined in the reviewers' comments below:</italic> </p><p><italic>A major concern is that the overall reproducibility of the PLG technique is not clear. For example, it is not clear if every region of NKX2.1+,ECAD+ epithelium stained at 8 weeks post-transplant was differentiated as airway, or if differentiation was more patchy. Please quantify appropriately to clarify this point.</italic> </p><p>We have now quantified n=9 individual transplants derived from the UM63-1 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Note that at the time of generating data for revisions, we had tissue sections left from only 9 transplanted HIOs (out of 12 total). To conduct the quantitation, we did co-staining for NKX2.1/ACTTUB, NKX2.1/CC10 and NKX2.1/MUC5AC. We then calculated percent of NKX2.1+ epithelial structures that were also positive for the co- stained markers. In the plotted data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), each individual transplanted construct is presented as a different color, so that the reader can get an idea of the percent of co-staining that was present in each transplant. Since multiciliated cells are abundant in human airways, we only considered an NKX2.1+ structure to be an airway-like structure when most/all of NKX2.1+ region contained multiciliated cells indicated by ACTTUB staining (appearing similar to staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Co-staining with ACTTUB and NKX2.1 revealed that 61 of 63 airways counted in 9 constructs had 100% of airway-like structures with co-staining of NKX2.1/ACTTUB similar to that shown in confocal images throughout the manuscript. As the reviewers suggested (see below), secretory cells were more rare, and were observed in a more variable fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Nonetheless, this analysis supports that individual NKX2.1+ epithelial structures within tissue sections are not “patchy” – that they largely resemble mature airways and are populated with abundant multiciliated cells, and to a lesser extent, also possess secretory cells.</p><p><italic>In addition, 3x 15 week transplants are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> as showing NKX2.1+ regions with airway-like differentiation. Were these identical to the 8 week transplants? Two different cell lines are listed as being used in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, were the results identical between them?</italic> </p><p>We have also now added a cohort of transplanted HLOs derived from the H1 cell line, which were harvested after 8 weeks. Examining the airway-like structures from three different lines, and from different times transplanted in vivo(summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) we find that airway-like structures are similar, regardless of transplant time or cell line. To support this claim, we now include representative images from H9-derived tHLOs transplanted for 15 weeks, and from H1-derived tHLOs transplanted for 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Similarly, was the airway epithelium obtained at 8-15 weeks post-transplant always arranged in tubes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>?</italic> </p><p>When micro-dissecting tHLOs, we routinely find tube-like structures present, however; we have not rigorously evaluated the extent that ‘tube-like’ structures are present across different transplant times. Moreover, we have not quantified ‘tube-like’ structures relative to ‘cyst-like’ structures. Thus, while we have chosen to keep the ‘tube-like’ data in the manuscript, we have now softened our claims, and have added the above caveats to this observation in the text.</p><p><italic>In general quantitation is appropriate and well described (although as noted above the origin of the samples scored is not shown e.g. all H9, or all UM63-1, or a mixture? 8 weeks or 15 weeks?) e.g. cell height of airway epithelium <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing out this detail. We have now explicitly clarified which transplants were used for all analyses. In general, all analyses are carried out with UM63-1 at 8 weeks, unless otherwise noted. We chose to use this data because we had the largest transplant cohort from this cell line and felt that the increased sample size would yield more powerful quantitative data.</p><p><italic>However, the quantitation of the secretory cell phenotype is missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Following discussions with Dr. White, our clinical collaborator, for purposes of this manuscript, we are defining upper airways as anything above the terminal bronchioles in the lungs. Given that smaller bronchioles have fewer secretory cells, and given that we did not see evidence for secretory cells in the fetal lung tissue we examined, we confirmed that the fetal lung images we used were from upper airways in which cartilage condensations are present. We feel that this landmark (cartilage) ensures that we are in an area within the upper airway that will eventually give rise to secretory cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
