strategic value. Determining how neurons along a sensorimotor circuit contribute to this transformation is central to understanding behavior. To do this, a quantitative framework to describe behavioral dynamics is needed. In this study, we built a high-throughput optogenetic system for <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva to quantify the sensorimotor transformations underlying navigational behavior. We express CsChrimson, a red-shifted variant of channelrhodopsin, in specific chemosensory neurons and expose large numbers of freely moving animals to random optogenetic activation patterns. We quantify their behavioral responses and use reverse-correlation analysis to uncover the linear and static nonlinear components of navigation dynamics as functions of optogenetic activation patterns of specific sensory neurons. We find that linear–nonlinear models accurately predict navigational decision-making for different optogenetic activation waveforms. We use our method to establish the valence and dynamics of navigation driven by optogenetic activation of different combinations of bitter-sensing gustatory neurons. Our method captures the dynamics of optogenetically induced behavior in compact, quantitative transformations that can be used to characterize circuits for sensorimotor processing and their contribution to navigational decision making.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06225.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06225.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06225.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living organisms can sense their surroundings and respond in appropriate ways.

Here, Hernandez-Nunez et al. have used optogenetics in fruit fly larvae to activate nerve cells that normally respond to smells and tastes, while the larvae's movements were tracked. Fruit fly larvae were chosen because they have a simple, but well-studied, nervous system. These larvae also move in two distinct ways: ‘runs’, in which a larva moves forward; and ‘turns’, during which a larva sweeps its head back and forth until it selects the direction of a new run.</p><p>The data from these experiments were quantified using a specific type of statistical analysis called ‘reverse correlation’ and used to build mathematical models that predict navigational behavior.

The navigational strategies of insect larvae represent a long-standing paradigm for studying the mechanisms of animal orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loeb, 1918</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mast, 1938</xref>). The small size and simple nervous system of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, combined with its powerful genetic toolbox and recent advances in optical neurophysiology and anatomical reconstruction of circuit structure and connectivity, opens the possibility of understanding the neural encoding of animal navigation from sensory inputs to motor outputs without gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saalfeld et al., 2012</xref>). To accomplish this, a quantitative framework to describe navigation decision-making is needed. Such a framework can then be used to dissect the function of the neurons and circuits in charge of processing sensory information.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larva navigation involves the regulation of transitions between two basic motor states, runs during which the animal moves forward using rhythmic peristaltic waves and turns during which the larva sweeps its head back and forth until it selects the direction of a new run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez-Marin and Louis, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Attractive and repulsive responses can be estimated by the tendency of the larva to aggregate near or avoid an environmental stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>). Attractive and repulsive responses can also be observed in the movement patterns of individual larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Louis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gershow et al., 2012</xref>). When the larva encounters improving conditions over time, it lowers the likelihood of ending each run with a turn, thereby lengthening runs in favorable directions. When the larva encounters improving conditions during each head sweep of a turn, it increases the likelihood of starting a new run, thereby starting more runs in favorable directions. Thus, subjecting the larva to an attractant tends to suppress transitions from runs to turns and stimulate transitions from turns to runs; subjecting the larva to a repellant has the opposite effects.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06225.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental method for reverse-correlation analysis using optogenetics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Larvae navigate by alternating between two basic motor states: runs and turns.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kreher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>). One challenge of studying chemotaxis is that it is difficult to provide sensory input to behaving animals with the flexibility, receptor specificity, and precision needed to build computational models of chemosensory-guided navigation. The recent development of a red-shifted version of channelrhodopsin, CsChrimson, which is activated at wavelengths that are invisible to the larva's phototaxis system, now allows us to specifically manipulate the activity of neurons in behaving animals with reliability and reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we sought a mathematical characterization of the navigation dynamics evoked by optogenetic activation of different sets of neurons. We focus on the navigation driven by chemosensory inputs. Although the organization of the chemosensory periphery is well-defined, the quantitative mapping from sensory activity to behavioral dynamics has not yet been determined. To do this, we engineered a high-throughput experimental setup capable of recording the run and turn movements of freely moving larvae subjected to defined optogenetic activation of selected chemosensory neurons. By measuring large numbers of animals responding to defined random patterns of optogenetic stimulation, we were able to collect enough data to use reverse-correlation analysis to connect optogenetic activation patterns of sensory neurons with motor patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ringach and Shapley, 2004</xref>). We used this information to build linear–nonlinear (LN) models that accurately predict behavioral dynamics in response to diverse patterns of optogenetic activation of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geffen et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We used our method to study how the optogenetic activation of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and different sets of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) map to navigational movements. Analysis of gustatory neurons allowed us to investigate the navigational responses evoked by individual GRNs and their combinations. We find that compact LN models that connect optogenetic activation to behavioral responses are nonetheless sufficient to describe or predict navigational behavior and should facilitate future studies to elucidate the circuit mechanisms that shape sensorimotor transformations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reverse-correlation analysis of navigation dynamics</title><p>We can characterize the navigation strategy of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva by identifying the mathematical functions that describe transitions between two basic motor states: running and turning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We sought these functions (<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>r → t</italic></sub>, <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>t → r</italic></sub>) for defined patterns of chemosensory stimulation delivered via optogenetics. We used transgenic animals that express the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson in selected olfactory and gustatory neurons using the UAS-Gal4 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>). In our setup, we followed the movements of large numbers of late second-instar larvae navigating the surface of a 22 cm × 22 cm agar plate under dark-field illumination provided by infrared LEDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The entire plate was subjected to spatially uniform optogenetic illumination from above using a matrix of 625 nm red LEDs, a wavelength chosen to activate CsChrimson while invisible to the larva's photosensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keene and Sprecher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). We tuned our light intensity (1.9 W/m<sup>2</sup>) to a level where negligible behavioral response is detected in wild-type animals crossed with <italic>UAS-CsChrimson</italic> fed with 0.5 mM all-trans-retinal. We made sure that this light intensity is strong enough to activate CsChrimson by testing it with a well-studied motor neuron line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To obtain direct evidence that optogenetic illumination in our behavioral setup activates sensory neurons, we used electrophysiology. We made extracellular recordings of the dorsal organ (DO) of individual larvae expressing CsChrimson in specific ORNs and recorded the responses to red light activation pulses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 s of the same intensity used in the behavioral experiments. We found that optogenetic activation of the ORN-expressing Or45a reliably and reproducibly induced spike trains during exposure to red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar results were obtained using larvae expressing CsChrimson in the ORN-expressing Or42a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results confirm direct correspondence between ON/OFF pulses of CsChrimson activation and induced spiking in single sensory neurons.</p><p>To map the input–output relationships with optogenetic interrogation of chemosensory neurons, we used reverse-correlation methods viewing the whole animal as a transducer. We subjected larvae to random patterns of optogenetic stimulation and collected the statistics of all behavioral responses exhibited by the freely moving larvae. We used the simplest white process for reverse-correlation, a Bernoulli process where we assigned −1 for lights OFF and +1 for lights ON, and calculated the mean stimulus history that preceded each run-to-turn or turn-to-run transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). These event-triggered stimulus histories represent how the animal uses optogenetic activation patterns of specific neurons to regulate each motor state transition and are proportional to the linear filter components of <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>r → t</italic></sub> and <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>t → r</italic></sub> (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Linear filters of repellant and attractive responses</title><p>When freely crawling larvae encounter increasing chemoattractant concentrations during runs, they decrease the likelihood of initiating a turn. When they encounter increasing chemoattractant concentrations during the head sweep of a turn, they increase the likelihood of starting a new run. The Or42a receptor is activated by a number of volatile chemoattractants including ethyl butyrate and ethyl acetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Louis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kreher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asahina et al., 2009</xref>). Genetically modified animals in which the <italic>Or42a</italic>-expressing ORN is the only functional ORN are capable of climbing olfactory gradients towards these attractants. These observations strongly suggest that the <italic>Or42a</italic>-expressing ORN mediates attractant responses. To test our system, we subjected <italic>Or42a&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae to random optogenetic stimulation. We found that run-to-turn transitions coincided with a decrease in the probability of optogenetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left), whereas turn-to-run transitions coincided with an increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right). These patterns are consistent with an attractive response to Or42a activation. Importantly, the full shape of the event-triggered stimulus histories informs us about how the temporal optogenetic activation patterns of Or42a regulate each type of navigational movement. Methods that measure the tendency of larvae to aggregate near chemoattractants or net movement up chemoattractant gradients provide information about the overall tendency to navigate but not about the discrete decision-making processes that drive navigation.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06225.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ORNs evoked navigation strategy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Event-triggered stimulus histories for run-to-turn (left panel) and turn-to-run (right panel) transitions exhibited by <italic>Or42a&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae subjected to random optogenetic stimulation as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Their motor state transitions were random and spontaneous.</p><p>In our setup, we flag turn-to-run transitions by the resumption of peristaltic forward movement and run-to-turn transitions as the onset of head-sweeping behavior. However, the decision to finish a run may begin at an earlier point, when the animal first begins to slow down. We measured the crawling speeds of larvae before flagged run-to-turn transitions and found that runs decelerate ∼1 s before the onset of head-sweeping behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). For both repellant and attractants, an increase and decrease in the probability of optogenetic illumination, respectively, coincides with the beginning of run deceleration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The average deceleration time was 1 s for all experiments conducted in this study (Student's t-test, p &lt; 0.01).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>LN models of behavior</title><p>A satisfactory model of navigation should be able to predict behavioral responses to various stimulus waveforms. We asked whether we could use our measurements of event-triggered stimulus histories to build such a model. A simple and widely used formalism is the LN model. In LN models, the linear filter component is proportional to our measurement of the event-triggered stimulus history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geffen et al., 2009</xref>). First, the stimulus waveform is passed through this linear filter to make an initial prediction of the behavioral response. Linear estimates have common problems, such as taking negative values and failing to account for saturation. To correct these problems, the linear prediction is then scaled with a static nonlinear function. This static nonlinearity can be calculated by comparing a linear prediction with experimental measurements.</p><p>We used larvae with CsChrimson in <italic>Or45a</italic>-expressing neurons to test an LN model in predicting behavior. We calculated the static nonlinearity for both run-to-turn and turn-to-run transitions by comparing linear predictions obtained with the event-triggered stimulus histories shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> with experimental measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we implemented the linear filter and static nonlinearity in an LN model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) to predict the behavioral response of these larvae to different inputs, using step increases in optogenetic illumination as well as defined trains of pulses of different widths. We found remarkably good agreement in these predictions to both stimulus types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We note that the LN prediction begins to fail to account for the turn-to-run transitions at long times following a step increase in optogenetic illumination. Turns typically last &lt;4 s, which limits the length of stimulus history that can be used in a linear filter, which thus puts a ∼4-s upper bound on the length of stimulus response that can be predicted. Taken together, our results show that LN models governing stimulus-evoked transitions between motor states can be used to predict larval chemotaxis behavior with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The LN model was also successful in predicting the behavior of <italic>Or42a-</italic>expressing neurons and other chemosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; the procedure for detailed calculations are described in ‘Materials and methods’).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06225.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Linear-nonlinear (LN) models of behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Estimating the static nonlinear function for run-to-turn and turn-to-run transitions exhibited by <italic>Or45a&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae.

Since we have sufficient data such that np &gt;= 5 and n(1 − p) &gt;= 5 in all cases (n is the number of samples, and p is the probability of undergoing a transition), we conducted a z-test to compare the distribution at each time point after opotgenetic stimulation with the baseline distribution.

To explore this question, we compared the prediction and experimental measurement of stepwise activation of <italic>Or45a</italic>- and <italic>Gr21a</italic>-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Biphasic linear filters—such as that associated with Gr21a and also seen in other sensory systems like the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> chemotactic response—contribute to adaptation following transient stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Block et al., 1982</xref>). A step increase in stimulation with repellants will cause a transient increase in the probability of run-to-turn transition. We predicted and confirmed differences in the adaptive return to baseline behavior for Gr21a and Or45a. The probability of run-to-turn transition returns to baseline faster in the case of Gr21a. Since each point represents a distribution of binary values (larvae transitioning from running to turning and larvae not transitioning), we used a z-test to identify regions where <italic>P(r → t)</italic> is significantly higher than baseline with p &lt; 0.05. We found that <italic>P(r → t)</italic> of Gr21a larvae reach values significantly higher than baseline at least 0.5 s earlier than Or45a larvae. In addition, Or45a larvae stay at elevated values of <italic>P(r → t)</italic> for at least 0.75 s longer than Gr21a larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We also asked whether differences in behavioral dynamics caused by different linear filters might be found in attractant responses. Gr2a is expressed in the A1 and A2 GRNs of the DO as well as in two unidentified neurons in the terminal organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>). The role of the Gr2a receptor is not known, but it is part of the subfamily of Gr68a, which has been identified as a pheromone receptor in the adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray and Amrein, 2003</xref>). We calculated the event-triggered stimulus histories of <italic>Gr2a&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae and found that run-to-turn transitions coincided with a decrease in optogenetic activation, consistent with an attractant response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the linear filter associated with Gr2a was distinct from that of Or42a. In <italic>Or42a&gt;CsChrimson</italic>, the run-to-turn transition was preceded by a single negative lobe lasting ∼2 s. In <italic>Gr2a&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae, the negative lobe was itself preceded by a positive lobe. As we did for repellants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we asked whether the response dynamics to step decrease in optogenetic stimulation were distinct. We predicted and confirmed differences in behavioral dynamics. The most noticeable feature is that Or42a larvae reach different steady states of <italic>P(r → t)</italic> for lights ON or OFF; this creates differences in step-response dynamics. We conducted a z-test to identify regions where <italic>P(r → t)</italic> is significantly higher than baseline with p &lt; 0.05. Since the steady-state <italic>P(r → t)</italic> for Or42a larvae is different for lights ON and lights OFF, we conducted the z-test with both values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Thus, using larvae expressing CsChrimson under the control of different <italic>Grx-</italic>Gal4 drivers enabled us to assess the contribution of selected GRNs to behavior.</p><p>The C1 neuron expresses 17 receptors, some of which are found in other neurons (e.g., Gr32a, which is also found in B2) and some of which are specific to C1 (e.g., Gr9a). Most Grs are thought to respond to repulsive bitter compounds because they express the bitter markers Gr33a and Gr66a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that C1 is a broadly tuned mediator of repellant responses. Consistent with this hypothesis, optogenetic activation of C1 with random stimuli using <italic>Gr9a&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae evoked a weak repellant response where the run-to-turn transition coincided with a slight increase in the probability of optogenetic illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (this response was significantly different than the control with p &lt; 0.05, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The crawling speeds of larvae before flagged run-to-turn transitions triggered by optogenetic activation of GRNs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. Optogenetic activation of C1 together with B2 using <italic>Gr32a&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae evoked a much stronger repellant response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Optogenetic activation of specifically the B2 neuron using <italic>Gr10&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae evoked a repellant response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Optogenetic activation of C1 together with C4 using <italic>Gr39a.b&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae generated a strong repellant response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). One possibility is that co-activation of narrowly tuned GRNs that express fewer Grs potentiates the repellant response of the broadly tuned C1 GRN; however, this interpretation should be taken with caution since different Gal4 drivers may induce different spiking rates upon optogenetic activation with CsChrimson.</p><p>We found that optogenetic activation of the C2 neuron alone using <italic>Gr94a&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae evoked a weak attractive response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) (this response was significantly different than the control with p &lt; 0.05, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is surprising because the C2 neuron also expresses the bitter receptors Gr33a and Gr66a, which should drive repellant responses, although these receptors are also found in other neurons. One possibility is that the attractant response driven by C2 is inverted when additional gustatory neurons are recruited. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that co-activation of C1 and C2 using <italic>Gr39a.a&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae exhibited a much stronger repellant response than activation of C1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Co-activation of C1, C2, and C4 using <italic>Gr59d&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae also exhibited a strong repellant response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The strongest repellant response was observed by co-activating C1-C4, B1, and B2 using <italic>Gr66a&gt;CsChrimson</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A fundamental step towards understanding how animal navigation is encoded in neural circuits is the development of a quantitative framework that accurately describes behavioral dynamics. To take this step with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva, we combined optogenetics with high-resolution behavioral analysis and reverse-correlation techniques to build LN models that provide an accurate estimate of the decision-making processes that guide navigation during optogenetically induced chemotaxis.</p><p>LN models separate time dependencies and instantaneous scaling into two modules, the linear filter and static nonlinearity, respectively. We find that the LN model is capable of accounting for diverse dynamics across attractant and repellant responses in both the gustatory and olfactory systems. For example, LN models accurately predicted the differences in response speed and adaptation when different GRNs and ORNs were activated. One reason for the diversity of dynamics is that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva chemosensory system, in addition to encoding attractant and repellant responses, is also capable of shaping the dynamics of behavioral responses in ecologically important ways. For example, the priorities given to specific chemicals encountered in the environment might not only be measured in terms of their relative degrees of attraction or repulsion but also in the speed of the behavioral response that they trigger or the speed of adaptation. We note that some of the observed differences in behavioral dynamics might be caused by using different transgenic lines and different Gal4 drivers with different potencies. It would thus be useful to confirm the differences in behavioral dynamics that are suggested by our optogenetic manipulations with direct stimulation of each GRN and ORN and quantitative behavioral analysis in defined environments using cell-specific odorants and tastants.</p><p>Navigational dynamics evoked by specific sets of gustatory neurons have remained elusive because of the lack of chemicals that are specific to individual GRNs. Our reverse-correlation analysis using optogenetic activation with CsChrimson allowed us to determine not only the valence (attraction or repulsion) of navigation mediated by different combinations of GRNs but also the dynamics of the evoked behavior. Although little is known about the circuits downstream of the GRNs, our analysis of sensorimotor transformations serves as a reference to determine how these circuits organize navigational decision-making.</p><p>Although chemotactic navigation behavior involves just two motor states (running and turning), it is possible, in principle, to extend reverse-correlation analysis to a larger number of possible behavioral states. Vogelstein et al presented recently a study where they used optogenetic pulses to trigger different subsets of neurons throughout the larval brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vogelstein et al., 2014</xref>). They identified 29 statistically different behavioral states, likely because they were able to interrogate circuits for a much wider variety of larval behaviors than navigation. It would be useful to apply reverse-correlation methods such as ours to examine transitions between this rich set of behavioral states to identify how specific neurons mediate a broader range of behavioral decisions than navigation up or down stimulus gradients.</p><p>The wiring diagram of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva nervous system is likely to be the next whole animal connectome that will be reconstructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardona et al., 2010</xref>). Powerful genetic tools are making it possible to target specific neurons throughout the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system with cellular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>). The new availability of powerful optogenetic tools for activating and inactivating neurons, particularly red-shifted molecules that are outside the spectrum of <italic>Drosophila</italic> vision, is making it possible to pinpoint the role of specific neurons in overall behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). An essential step in building whole nervous system models of behavior that incorporate wiring and dynamics is computational modeling. Bringing together computational modeling of behavior with new tools for behavioral and physiological analysis, such as those described here, should open the door to a thorough understanding of behavioral circuits from sensory input to motor output in the small but surprisingly sophisticated nervous system of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p>All larvae were raised in the dark at 22°C and fed yeast with 0.5 mM all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal.

Using Gaussian white noise, for example, would require intensity modulation of the optogenetic stimulus. While it is possible that induced spiking scales linearly with light intensity for some Gal4 drivers, a nonlinear relationship might also occur. By using a Bernoulli process, we can use a uniform light intensity for optogenetic stimulation and need only assume a consistent level of spiking with optogenetic stimulation. This assumption was validated by direct electrophysiological measurement in two ORNs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For a Bernoulli process, the random stimulation is confined to the timing of the ON or OFF state of the LEDs. Nonlinearities might still be introduced, for example, in delays in the onset or cessation of spiking with respect to the start or end of each illumination pulse. These effects pose an upper limit on the frequencies that can be used for random activation. To reduce the effect of these latencies while retaining the ability to characterize larval decision-making that occurs on the 1-s time scale, we used a stimulus frequency of 4 Hz.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present a very intriguing behavioral analysis of the navigation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae using optogenetically induced fictive olfactory and gustatory stimuli for specific receptor neurons and for receptor neurons in combination. These stimuli are random on-off (Bernoulli process that is wide-sense stationary and produces independent binary values). In an automated system, they monitor large numbers of larvae to a variety of receptor neuron activations and combinations thereof and apply Linear-Nonlinear (LN) models. Their results predict navigational responses for different optogenetic activation waveforms with reasonable accuracy. They also study the sensorimotor transformations underlying navigation driven by bitter sensing gustatory neurons. They find a diversity in the behavioral dynamics evoked by different subsets of gustatory neurons expressing different taste receptors, suggesting that larvae can discriminate between tastes of the same quality because these evoke kinetically different behavioral responses. These results have important implications for behavioral analysis of navigation in animals and serve as an entry point for further mechanistic studies in the important model system. Moreover, the application of the techniques here can be a model for applications in other systems.</p><p>There are concerns about the manuscript as presented that the authors must address, by re-writing and if feasible some additional experiments or more explicit recognition of the limitations of the analysis.</p><p>1) The chief concern is with the optogenetic stimuli and their interpretation. The authors say in the Introduction that they are able to “connect sensory activity patterns with motor patterns” via their study. Without recording from the larval chemosensory neurons expressing CsChrimson and determining what patterns of neural activity are evoked by the different optical stimulation protocols, they cannot make this claim. Rather, even though the red light stimulus is a random pattern, the sensory neurons that express CsChrimson may respond in non-linear ways to the red light activation. The patterns of sensory neuron activity therefore may not nicely (linearly) reflect the red light stimulation they provide. It should be feasible to record from the sensory neurons during the optogenetic stimuli and determine how they fire in response. For example using the GR94a (C2) line one could record extracellularly from the dorsal organ and determine how the neuron responds to optical stimuli and in particular to their random flicker pattern of optical stimulation. However, unless a comprehensive e-phys study is performed, the caveats would remain for the untested lines. There must therefore be a section in the Discussion where the authors address the caveats that arise because the extent and quality of the sensory neurons firing to the optogenetic stimulus is unknown. The authors should tone down the claims that turning on the lights is the same thing as turning on the neurons.</p><p>Moreover, it is not known how the optogenetic activation equates with neuronal activity in the different genetic backgrounds. A variety of GAL4 drivers are used and the strength of CsChrimson expression among these drivers could be quite different. Thus, one cannot distinguish a weak behavioral response from potentially weak expression of the CsChrimson or to a less important role of the neuron. Thus “the different linear filters” discovered in the study might be simply differences among CsChrimson potency in the cells and this caveat should be stated in the text.</p><p>This concern about the relationship between the light stimulus and neuronal activation carries over especially into the interpretation of the 'attractive' response evoked by optogenetic stimulation of the C2 receptor alone. It is quite possible that CsChrimson activation of C2 is very weak and that greater activation would change the valence of the response to aversion. Unless we know the quality of the C2 response to the optogenetic stimuli, it is necessary to be circumspect in the interpretation of C2 mediating an attractive response, and the authors' claim that the hypothesis that “gustatory preferences are… encoded in “valence labeled lines” is weakened by the C2 result is subject to real caveats.</p><p>2) One of the authors’ claims is that, essentially, not all attraction or avoidance responses are created equal. That is, different ORNs and GRNs are known to drive “avoidance” or “attraction” but they see that the dynamics of the behavior is different for different neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Are there statistical methods that would substantiate these claims of different kinetics?</p><p>3) The Materials and methods section is inadequate. It should be substantively amplified to explain more carefully what was done especially with the modeling and the statistical analyses. The reader must assume as the legends of the figures are not explicit (except an off handed mention in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that the gray shading around the event triggered average lines in the figure are SEM, but even this is missing or not visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. How do we know for each of these cases, particularly for the case of C2, alone in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, if these events triggered averages are significant compared to background? What statistical criteria were applied? How were these noisy averages incorporated into the LN model? Please adequately explain what was done. In addition, a more intuitive explanation of the linear-non-linear transformation is needed for readers that are not familiar with this type of modeling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06225.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The chief concern is with the optogenetic stimuli and their interpretation.

To demonstrate that CsChrimson activates sensory neurons with pulse widths and light intensities comparable to our behavioral measurements, we have now made direct recordings in the dorsal organ as suggested. To do this, we obtained help from Jonas Belina and John Carlson at Yale (who are now coauthors). We found consistent spiking patterns in both Or45a and Or42a over a range of pulse widths comparable to our experiments, confirming the correspondence between optogenetic illumination and sensory neuron activity.</p><p>We also agree that spiking triggered by CsChrimson activation, however, might not necessarily mirror optogenetic activation across all tested lines. Thus, we have added discussion of these caveats as recommended.</p><p>We note that we were cognizant of the potentially nonlinear relationship between the intensity of optogenetic illumination and spiking. This was why we used a Bernoulli process—i.e., random ON/OFF flicker—as our stimulus. Gaussian white noise is often used in reverse-correlation studies, but would have involved intensity modulation over time, which would have added another nonlinearity in the transformation between optogenetic illumination and behavioral response. By using a Bernoulli process where we fix light intensity, we avoid this problem. The randomness is in the onset or offset of the light, not in various intensity values.</p><p>Another consideration we made when selecting the random process is the possibility that there could be delays in onset of offset of spiking with respect to CsChrimson activation. This constrains the frequencies that can be used for optogenetic stimulation; since the timescale for behavior is ∼1 second, we used a frequency of 4Hz. Furthermore, if significant time delays in the onset or offset of spiking occur with respect to CsChrimson activation, then the triggered average of optogenetic activation would likely fail to predict the behavioral responses to trains of pulses of different widths as the one used in the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the top right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>, the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>, or the top right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2A</xref>.</p><p><italic>Moreover, it is not known how the optogenetic activation equates with neuronal activity in the different genetic backgrounds.

Confirmation of the role of these neurons might be possible by identifying a chemical stimulus specific to Gr94a, and then analyzing chemotaxis in response to that stimulus.
