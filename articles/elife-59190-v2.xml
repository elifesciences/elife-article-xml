are mechanisms conserved in self-organizing systems leading to biological patterns. A number of them involve the production by the developing cell of an inhibitory morphogen, but how this cell becomes immune to self-inhibition is rather unknown. Under combined nitrogen starvation, the multicellular cyanobacterium <italic>Nostoc</italic> PCC 7120 develops nitrogen-fixing heterocysts with a pattern of one heterocyst every 10–12 vegetative cells. Cell differentiation is regulated by HetR which activates the synthesis of its own inhibitory morphogens, diffusion of which establishes the differentiation pattern. Here, we show that HetR interacts with HetL at the same interface as PatS, and that this interaction is necessary to suppress inhibition and to differentiate heterocysts. <italic>hetL</italic> expression is induced under nitrogen-starvation and is activated by HetR, suggesting that HetL provides immunity to the heterocyst. This protective mechanism might be conserved in other differentiating cyanobacteria as HetL homologues are spread across the phylum.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cyanobacteria are the only bacteria on Earth able to draw their energy directly from the sun in the same way that plants do. In addition, some strains are able to ‘fix’ the nitrogen present in the atmosphere: they can extract this gas and transform it into nitrogen-based compounds necessary for life. However, both processes cannot happen in a given cell at the same time.</p><p>A strain of cyanobacteria called Nostoc PCC 7120 can organise itself into long filaments of interconnected cells. Under certain conditions, one in every ten cells stops drawing its energy from the sun, and starts fixing atmospheric nitrogen instead.

For instance, a protein called HetR turns on the genetic program that allows cyanobacteria to fix nitrogen; on the other hand, a signal known as PatS binds to HetR and turns it off. Cells starting to specialise in fixing nitrogen produce both HetR and PatS, with the latter diffusing in surrounding cells and preventing them from extracting nitrogen.</p><p>However, it remained unclear how the nitrogen-fixing cell could ignore its own PatS signal and keep its HetR signal active. HetL – another protein produced by the future nitrogen-fixing cell – could potentially play this role, but how it acts was unknown.</p><p>Here, Xu et al. show that HetL cannot diffuse from one cell to the other, and that it binds to HetR at the same place than PatS does. When both PatS and HetL are present, they compete to attach to HetR, which stops PatS from turning off HetR and deactivating the nitrogen-fixing program.</p><p>Understanding how cyanobacteria fix nitrogen could help to develop new types of natural fertiliser.

Unraveling the rules governing pattern formation helps to elucidate the genetic basis of cell differentiation. A key contribution in theoretical biology was made by Alan Turing in 1952 who demonstrated that the reaction of two molecules with different diffusion rates generates regular patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Turing, 1952</xref>). Later on, Turing equations were adapted in a new mathematical model that emphasized conspicuous features of biological development, in particular local activation linked to autocatalysis and long range inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meinhardt and Gierer, 1974</xref>). Valuable experimental approaches showed the recurrence of this mechanism in various developmental behaviors, such as: spacing of leaves, tissue regeneration in Hydra, epidermis of insects, pigmentation in Zebra fish, embryogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and also differentiation in some prokaryotes (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schweisguth and Corson, 2019</xref>). In all these developmental situations several aspects of the molecular interactions involved to generate patterning remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Among prokaryotes, several members of the Cyanobacteria phylum are capable of cell differentiation. The molecular basis of differentiation has been well documented for the cyanobacterium <italic>Anabaena/Nostoc</italic> PCC 7120 (referred herein as <italic>Nostoc</italic>). <italic>Nostoc</italic> is a diazotrophic strain which can differentiate into specific type of cells responsible for fixing atmospheric nitrogen. When combined nitrogen is abundant <italic>Nostoc</italic> forms long filaments consisting of a single cell type. When the filaments of <italic>Nostoc</italic> are deprived of combined nitrogen, around 10% of the vegetative cells differentiate into heterocysts. These micro-oxic cells, which provide a suitable environment for N<sub>2</sub>-fixation, are non-dividing and are distributed semi-regularly along the filaments. <italic>Nostoc</italic> differentiation follows therefore a one-dimensional pattern of heterocysts separated by 10 vegetative cells. Heterocysts are unable to undergo cell division, but as vegetative cells continue dividing, the filaments grow and new heterocysts form in the middle of the intervals between pre-existing heterocysts. Consequently, the pattern is dynamic and persists throughout the growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flores and Herrero, 2010</xref>). The molecular signal inducing heterocyst differentiation is 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), which accumulates in response to combined nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laurent et al., 2005</xref>). Among the various genes involved in the regulation of heterocyst formation and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herrero et al., 2016</xref>), the global regulator NtcA and the specific master regulator HetR are key transcriptional factors in the cascade resulting in heterocyst development. Upon combined nitrogen starvation, NtcA interacts with 2-OG and induces heterocyst differentiation by controlling, directly or indirectly, the expression of several genes, including <italic>hetR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herrero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valladares et al., 2008</xref>). HetR is essential for cell differentiation: its deletion abolishes differentiation, and its overexpression induces differentiation of multiple contiguous heterocysts under combined nitrogen-starvation and allows differentiation even under non-permissive conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buikema and Haselkorn, 1991</xref>). It exists in different oligomeric states among which dimer and tetramer have been proposed to interact with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Valladares et al., 2016</xref>). The HetR regulon includes hundreds of genes, which are either activated in response to nitrogen starvation or repressed in nitrogen-replete conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flaherty et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitschke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Videau et al., 2014</xref>). The structure of HetR shows a unique fold comprising three domains: helix-turn-helix, flap and hood; with the latter encompassing the binding site of PatS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). A key event in pattern formation in <italic>Nostoc</italic> is the positive autoregulation of <italic>hetR</italic> occurring specifically in the differentiating cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Black et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rajagopalan and Callahan, 2010</xref>) and the inhibition of HetR in neighboring cells by the product of <italic>patS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Golden and Yoon, 2003</xref>). The deletion of the <italic>patS</italic> gene leads to the formation of multiple contiguous heterocysts, and its overexpression inhibits the differentiation process and hence induces a lethal phenotype under combined nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoon and Golden, 1998</xref>). <italic>patS</italic> encodes a 13–17 amino acid peptide containing at its carboxy-terminal end a <bold>RGSGR</bold> pentapeptide (PatS-5) that interacts with HetR, which inhibits its DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feldmann et al., 2011</xref>) and blocks cell differentiation when added to culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoon and Golden, 1998</xref>). The hexapeptide <bold>ERGSGR</bold> (PatS-6) derived from PatS is also able to interact with HetR and to inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). A mutant strain producing a variant of HetR, R223W, that is no longer able to interact with PatS, forms multiple contiguous heterocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khudyakov and Golden, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). PatS-dependent signals are considered to diffuse along the filament; inhibiting HetR in the cells adjacent to the heterocyst, so preventing them from differentiating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Risser and Callahan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corrales-Guerrero et al., 2013</xref>). The <bold>RGSGR</bold> pentapeptide is also present in HetN; a protein required for the maintenance of the pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Black and Wolk, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Higa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corrales-Guerrero et al., 2014</xref>), and recently a third protein (PatX) containing a <bold>RGTGR</bold> motif, has been reported to inhibit heterocyst differentiation when overproduced in <italic>Nostoc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elhai and Khudyakov, 2018</xref>). The transcription of <italic>patX</italic> is induced in the heterocyst and is under the control of NtcA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elhai and Khudyakov, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The HetR/PatS regulatory loop fits the local activation/long range inhibition scheme that has been adapted from the Turing model explaining pattern formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Rutenberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Turing, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Turing, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the action of HetN and PatX as inhibitory factors, the stochastically noisy expression of regulatory proteins (HetR and NtcA) among other features specific to cell differentiation of <italic>Nostoc</italic>, allow the emergence of more elaborated mathematical models that outline the principles governing pattern formation in cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Patti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muñoz-García and Ares, 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Patterning model and HetL/HetR interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Self-organized patterning in <italic>Nostoc</italic> Heterocysts are presented in green.

Nevertheless, several questions are still unanswered and deserve investigation. In particular, how the differentiating cell, where <italic>patS</italic> is expressed at its highest level, becomes immune to self-inhibition is not fully understood yet. A genetic analysis of <italic>patS</italic> suggested that the seven amino acids at the N-terminus of PatS protect the producing cell from inhibition likely concomitantly with the export of the active form of PatS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corrales-Guerrero et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, if <italic>patS</italic> or <italic>patS-5</italic> are expressed specifically in the vegetative cells, or when PatS-5 is added to the culture medium, cell differentiation is abolished. However when produced in cells that have already initiated development (proheterocysts), PatS-5 is not able to inhibit differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoon and Golden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). These observations suggest that proheterocysts must acquire additional protection post-PatS export/processing.</p><p>The <italic>hetL</italic> gene (all3740) was unearthed in a genetic screen aiming to identify factors involved in PatS signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Golden, 2002</xref>). HetL is a single domain protein composed of 40 pentapeptides (A(D/N)LXX), adopting a right-handed quadrilateral beta helix typical of an Rfr-fold common to all pentapeptide repeats containing proteins (PRPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ni et al., 2009</xref>). The ectopic expression of <italic>hetL</italic> in a background of <italic>patS</italic> overexpression restores the ability of the strain to differentiate heterocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Golden, 2002</xref>). <italic>hetL</italic> overexpression stimulates differentiation also when PatS-5 is added to the culture medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Golden, 2002</xref>). Henceforth, HetL interferes with PatS inhibition but the molecular mechanism involved is unknown.</p><p>This study aims to further explore the function of HetL in PatS signaling. We show that HetL interacts with HetR at the same interface as PatS. This interaction is needed for HetR to escape PatS inhibition, and does not inhibit its DNA-binding activity. Analyzing <italic>hetL</italic> transcription, we found that this gene is induced shortly after initiation of cell differentiation and that HetR is required for its expression. Finally, we show that the expression of <italic>hetL</italic> in heterocysts, but not in vegetative cells, is necessary to counteract PatS inhibitory effect. We conclude that, by interacting with HetR, HetL interferes with PatS fixation and therefore provides immunity to the developing cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HetL interacts with HetR without inhibiting its DNA-binding activity</title><p>To get further insights into HetL function, we wondered whether its activity would be mediated by its direct interaction with HetR. To test this, we used the bacterial two hybrid assay (BACTH), which is based on the reconstitution of adenylate cyclase (CyA) activity by two interacting proteins that bring the T18 and T25 domains of CyA into close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karimova et al., 1998</xref>). T18 and T25 domains were fused to HetR and HetL proteins at their N-terminal extremities, and the dimerization ability of HetR was used as an internal control for this assay. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> show that HetL displays a strong interaction with HetR. Interestingly, it seems that the HetR-hood domain is sufficient to mediate the interaction of HetR to HetL. Furthermore, this experiment indicated that HetL is able to form dimers (or oligomers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To confirm this interaction, we developed a BioLayer interferometry (BLi) assay. For this purpose, HetR and HetL proteins were produced and purified using affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). HetR was biotinylated and immobilized on streptavidin biosensors as the ligand, while HetL was used as the analyte. Upon addition of HetL, a concentration-dependent association was recorded and decreased during the dissociation step corresponding to the washing of the sensor, indicating a direct interaction between HetL and HetR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The estimated dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of the HetR-HetL interaction was 6 µM. The interaction between HetR and HetL observed in the BACTH assay was thus confirmed by BLi.</p><p>As HetR acts by directly binding to promoters of a subset of its target genes, we tested if the interaction with HetL would impact its DNA binding activity. To this end, we conducted an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using the <italic>hetP</italic> promoter as a target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). The previously reported ability of PatS-5 to inhibit HetR DNA-binding activity was used as a control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). In the presence of HetL, HetR was still able to interact with the <italic>hetP</italic> promoter and the complex formed was higher than the one formed by HetR alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This result indicates that, contrary to PatS-5 binding, the interaction between the two proteins does not inhibit the DNA-binding activity of HetR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HetL and PatS interact with HetR at the same interface</title><p>Since HetL has been identified on the basis of counteracting PatS inhibition and as both PatS and HetL interact with HetR at its hood domain, we hypothesized that HetL could interact with HetR at the same interface as PatS, which would therefore interfere with its inhibiting action. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the fact that HetR-PatS interaction involves the Hood domain of HetR and that the residue R223 of HetR is required for this interaction. Interestingly, a variant of HetR bearing a R223W substitution lost the ability to interact with HetL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). HetR (R223W) was still able to form dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which indicates that this variant is correctly folded. We conclude that the absence of interaction between HetR (R223W) and HetL indicates that this residue, in addition to being involved in the interaction with PatS-5/PatS-6, is also required for the interaction with HetL. For a deeper investigation of HetR-HetL interaction, we exploited the available structures of HetL and of the Hood domain of HetR to build interaction models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ni et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, a group of four models among the top 10 clusters share similar orientations of HetR on HetL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, these models present interesting properties regarding the binding interface of HetR-Hood to HetL: (i) the residue R223 of HetR was involved in the binding interface with HetL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), (ii) the HetR interaction interface with HetL matches the one involved in PatS-5 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the retained models, the HetR-Hood:HetL interaction is maintained by a large network of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. For HetR, the binding interface is composed of the surface exposed residues from strand β3 and α-helix α12’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In HetL, the large proportion of the binding interface includes the pentapeptides repeat localized in face three encompassed E<sup>84</sup>ADLT, K<sup>104</sup>ASLC, <sup>124</sup>QADLR, <sup>149</sup>YADLR, <sup>169</sup>RANFG and <sup>197</sup>YANLE. A small second binding interface is localized within face 2 and includes <sup>40</sup>ADLRQ and <sup>145</sup>ADLSY pentapeptide repeats. To gain further insight about the HetR:HetL interaction, we performed a site-directed mutagenesis to substitute the residue D151 from HetL to Alanine. Interestingly, this substitution impaired the binding of HetL to HetR as revealed by BACTH assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, HetL D151A variant was still able to form dimers which is an important indication to rule out the possibility that the mutation impacted the fold of this variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that HetL and PatS-5 interact with HetR at the same interface, which implies that HetL and PatS must compete for the interaction with HetR. To check this assumption, the interaction between HetR and HetL was analyzed by BLi in the presence of increasing amounts of PatS-5. The data obtained clearly indicated that the association between HetR and HetL is impaired with the addition of PatS-5 in a dose-response manner, with a total inhibition effect obtained at a concentration of 5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

While adenylate cyclase activity was restored in bacteria producing T25-HetR and T18-HetL fusions, the interaction between HetR and HetL was abolished when PatS-6 was produced along with HetL from the synthetic operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), which is a further demonstration that PatS and HetL share the same interaction site within HetR. The interference of PatS with the HetR-HetL complex was also observed in EMSA experiments where the addition of increasing amounts of PatS-5 abolished the binding of HetR-HetL to the <italic>hetP</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Altogether, these data support the hypothesis of a competition between PatS and HetL for the interaction with HetR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>HetL does not interact with PatS</title><p>Based on the data presented above, HetR acquired immunity against PatS inhibition can be explained by an exclusion of the inhibitor as a consequence of HetR-HetL interaction. However, an additional titration-based mechanism through a direct interaction between HetL and PatS cannot be ruled out. To test this possibility, Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to analyze the possible interaction between HetL and PatS-5. This technique has been used previously to uncover the binding of PatS-5 to HetR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feldmann et al., 2011</xref>). We have confirmed that HetR does indeed interact with PatS-5 with a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 600 nM similar to that of 227 nM described in the literature with a stoichiomerty of 1:1. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> show that HetR (left panel) displays a reducing heat exchange when titrated with increasing amounts of Pats-5, indicating a saturation of the HetR sites with PatS-5. This reaction is an exothermic favorable reaction with an enthalpy of −7.43 ± 0.67 ΔH kcal/mol. On the contrary, HetL (right panel) does not show a relative heat exchange upon binding to PatS-5.

The wild-type version of <italic>hetL</italic> or the mutated gene encoding HetL (D151A) were expressed in <italic>Nostoc</italic> cells under the control of the <italic>petE</italic> promoter, and quantitative RT-PCR analyses were carried out to check the accurate overexpression of these genes upon induction. Results revealed a 30-fold higher expression of the <italic>hetL</italic> and the <italic>hetL (D151A)</italic> genes in the recombinant strains compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that the two versions of <italic>hetL</italic> are actually overexpressed. PatS effect was analyzed either by the overexpression of <italic>patS</italic> gene from the <italic>petE</italic> promoter or by the addition in the medium of PatS-5 (or PatS-6). The cultures were transferred into a nitrate-depleted medium during 48 hr to assess heterocyst development. In agreement with published data, the overproduction of PatS or the addition of PatS-5 inhibited the differentiation process, while the overexpression of <italic>hetL</italic> restored the ability of the PatS overproducing strain to form heterocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). HetL overproduction also allowed the ability of the strain to form heterocysts when PatS-5 was added to the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The percentage of the heterocysts formed in the <italic>hetL</italic> overexpressing strain was equal to that of the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the recombinant strain overproducing HetL (D151A) was not able to form heterocysts when PatS was overproduced or upon addition of PatS-5 in the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The interaction of HetL with HetR is therefore needed to counteract PatS inhibition. <italic>hetL</italic> expression in the heterocyst is required for providing HetR immunity against PatS inhibition <italic>hetL</italic> expression level was too low to be detected by Northern blot or fluorescent gene fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Golden, 2002</xref>). We therefore chose quantitative RT-PCR approach to analyze <italic>hetL</italic> transcription during the differentiation process. The <italic>hetP</italic> gene whose transcription is activated by HetR 8 hr after nitrogen step-down was used as an internal control for this experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitschke et al., 2011</xref>). RNAs were collected from the wild-type strain and the <italic>ΔhetR</italic> mutant at different times after nitrogen starvation and the transcript levels of the two genes were expressed relative to their amount at time zero. Results reveal that <italic>hetP</italic> expression was, as expected, strongly induced from 8 hr after nitrate depletion. Contrary to the 10-fold induction in the wild-type strain, the expression of <italic>hetP</italic> did not significantly increase in the <italic>ΔhetR</italic> strain which is consistent with the activation of this gene by HetR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The <italic>hetL</italic> gene showed a similar transcription profile to that of <italic>hetP</italic>, yet its expression level was much lower. In the wild-type strain, a 3.5-fold increase of <italic>hetL</italic> transcripts was observed 8 hr after nitrogen step-down and was maintained up to 24 hr. In the <italic>ΔhetR</italic> mutant, no induction of <italic>hetL</italic> transcription was observed. The region including 500 nucleotides upstream of the start codon of <italic>hetL</italic>, which must include the promoter of this gene, was analyzed to probe for the two binding site consensus reported for HetR: the high-affinity consensus (<named-content content-type="sequence">GTAGGCGA<bold>GGG</bold>GTCTAAC<bold>CCC</bold>TCATTACC</named-content>), and the low-affinity one (<named-content content-type="sequence">GCTTAT<bold>GGTGGGCAATGCCCACC</bold>ATAATA</named-content>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Videau et al., 2014</xref>).

Because <italic>hetL</italic> mutant does not show any specific differentiation phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Golden, 2002</xref>), we wondered if this could be due to a cross-complementation with another PRP. In this regard, we analyzed the capacity of HetR to interact with some HetL homologs. For this, we chose All3256 and All4303 because they share the closest features with HetL. They have a similar size (237, 268, 213 amino acids, respectively), a similar organization of the PRs domains, and the three are predicted to be cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows the results of a BACTH assay questioning the putative interaction of these proteins with HetR. Only All4303 displayed interaction with HetR, and even if this interaction is two-fold weaker than that of HetR-HetL it is significant compared to the negative control. This experiment indicates that at least one among the 31 PRPs is able to interact with HetR, which makes a cross-complementation of the <italic>hetL</italic> mutation with all4303, or another PRP coding gene a possible scenario. An important perspective of this work is to study the impact of the <italic>hetL-</italic>all4303 double mutation on the differentiation process.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>HetR interacts with a HetL homolog and patterning model including HetL.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HetL, All3256 or All4303 PR domains organization.

In their conclusion, the authors of this study speculated that PatS and HetL might act by modulating HetR activity. This speculation reveals to be an accurate prediction as demonstrated by the results of the experiments presented in this manuscript, added to all the knowledge accumulated on HetR and PatS functions from previous valuable studies that are fundamental to our investigation. In particular, as the unique structural fold of HetR with its two exposed domains (flap and hood) was proposed to favor protein-protein interactions, we questioned the possible interaction of HetR with proteins involved in patterning. In this context, HetL was found to interact strongly with HetR without abolishing its DNA-binding activity, which suggests that HetR-HetL complex may be active regarding gene regulation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A possible mechanism to explain the role of HetL in PatS signaling is the titration by HetL of the inhibiting peptide. This hypothesis was ruled out since ITC assay did not show any interaction between HetL and PatS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Alternatively, a site-exclusion mechanism can be proposed for HetL. The observation that HetL and PatS-5 (or PatS-6) interact with HetR at the same interface is in agreement with this suggestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In Bli assays, increasing concentrations of PatS-5 interfered with HetR-HetL interaction, and in EMSA experiments addition of PatS-5 abolished the formation of HetR-HetL complex in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). In addition to confirming the in silico docking model predicting a same HetR-interaction interface for PatS and HetL, these data imply that the concentration of HetL in the (pro)heterocyst must be higher than the PatS peptide, which is plausible because (i) PatS peptide is diffusible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoon and Golden, 2001</xref>), (ii) HetL features do not include any motif or domain that predicts a putative translocation/secretion or association with membranes that could decrease its amount in the producing cell. Moreover, as <italic>hetL</italic> transcription is activated by HetR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), HetL protein is likely to accumulate in the cytoplasm of differentiating cells. The diffusion of the inhibiting peptides (derived from PatS and HetN) along the filament has been shown to occur through septal junctions (SJ) connecting adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mariscal et al., 2016</xref>). Electron cryotomography analysis showed that these SJ consist of tubes traversing the septal peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weiss et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the lumen of the tubes measures around 7 nm which is compatible with the diffusion of the inhibiting peptides but probably not with the transfer of HetL between cells. HetL protein is 3.5 nm wide and 6.5 nm length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ni et al., 2009</xref>), which might suggest that a monomer could be transferred via the SJ. However, it is important to note that that HetL is capable of forming dimers (or multimers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the size of which is not consistent with transfer via the SJ. In addition, it is also possible that HetL surface charge might not be compatible with its transfer across the SJ tubes.</p><p>Alternatively, it can be assumed that in the (pro)heterocyst the affinity of HetR for HetL must be higher than that for PatS. Bli and ITC experiments showed that in vitro, the affinity of HetR for PatS is 10-fold higher than for HetL (compare data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). One might speculate that in vivo, and especially in the (pro)heterocyst, the affinity of HetR for HetL increases either due to a modification of HetR or to its interaction with another factor. HetR has been shown to be regulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Valladares et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roumezi et al., 2019</xref>), if this posttranslational modification occurs only in the developing cell it could explain a high affinity of HetR for HetL specifically in the heterocyst. In addition, the observation that the overexpression of <italic>hetL</italic> in vegetative cells, from <italic>petE</italic> or <italic>rbcL</italic> promoters, did not lead to their differentiation into heterocsyts is rather in favor of a mechanism promoting the association between HetR and HetL specifically in the heterocyst. Resolving the structure of HetR-HetL complex and following the behavior of HetL protein and PatS in vivo will provide more information about the dynamics and the nature of HetR complexes in the two cell types through the differentiation process.</p><p>A deletion mutant of <italic>hetL</italic> differentiates heterocysts as well as the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Golden, 2002</xref>). The possibility that <italic>hetL</italic> is not essential for heterocyst differentiation and that only its overexpression affects the differentiation process was one of the hypotheses proposed to explain the phenotype of the <italic>hetL</italic> mutant. The second hypothesis was functional redundancy based on a crosstalk between HetL and another PRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Golden, 2002</xref>). The observation that at least one homolog of HetL (All4303) interacted with HetR, is rather in favor of functional redundancy. A global transcription study using RNA sequencing has shown that all4303 transcription is induced in response to nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flaherty et al., 2011</xref>). The <italic>hetL</italic> gene has also been reported in this study to be induced after nitrogen starvation, which is consistent with our data. The other PRPs coding genes whose transcription has also been reported to be regulated in this condition are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. At this stage of our investigation, we cannot rule out that homologs of HetL may also be part of the PatS signaling, but the fact that the genetic suppressor screen for suppression of PatS inhibition selected only <italic>hetL</italic> would rather point to it as the principal factor involved in the differentiation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Golden, 2002</xref>). Because of the presence of multiple homologs, cross-complementation might occur when <italic>hetL</italic> happens to be mutated.</p><p>Genes encoding proteins containing tandem pentapeptide repeats are abundant in all cyanobacterial genomes, which render the study of their function by gene-deletion approaches unjustified. Interestingly, despite their high amino acid homology, their structures possess distinctive features that can help to investigate their function. Exploring these structural features and searching for potential binding-partners can be a successful strategy in their study. The gyrase-binding PRP is the first protein of this family whose partner was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tran et al., 2005</xref>). PRPs from this family are largely conserved among bacteria, where number of them have been, based on their ability, proposed to provide resistance to quinolone-type antibiotics. Structural studies revealed the distribution of large contiguous patches of negative electrostatic potential resembling DNA which gave insights into their function as mimicking DNA structure for binding to gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>). The structure of HetL does not show such a large distribution of negative charges, but instead contiguous patches of positively and negatively charged surfaces are distributed at the surface of the structure. These patches have been suggested to mediate the binding to unknown potential partners, other than DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ni et al., 2009</xref>). In docking simulation analyses reported in this study, these charged surfaces especially those localized in face 2 and face 3 mediate the interaction with the HetR-Hood domain. To the best of our knowledge, the interaction of HetL with HetR constitutes the second case of protein-protein complex identified for a PRP member. In <italic>Nostoc</italic> two other integral PRPs (PatL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu and Wolk, 2011</xref>] and FraF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merino-Puerto et al., 2013</xref>]) and a pentapeptide repeat domain-containing protein (HglK, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Black et al., 1995</xref>) are involved in cell differentiation, but their mechanism of action is not fully uncovered. Analyzing their interaction with their physiological partners will provide a better understanding of the role played by PRPs in the developmental program of <italic>Nostoc</italic>.</p><p>Genetic experiments showed that HetL interaction with HetR allows the differentiating cell to escape from PatS overproduction and from the addition to the culture medium of the (E)<bold>RGSGR,</bold> (H)<bold>RGTGR</bold> inhibiting peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These data suggest that HetL provides immunity for the developing cells all along the differentiation process. HetL might therefore be important for pattern initiation and establishment, exerted by PatX and PatS, and also for pattern maintenance mediated by HetN and PatS. Therefore, we propose that HetR can be engaged in two different networks depending on cell types: a HetR-HetL-positive network in the (pro)heterocyt as a consequence of <italic>hetL</italic> expression, and a negative HetR-inhibiting peptide complex taking place in the HetL-free vegetative cells. The HetR/HetL complex therefore enriches the ‘local-activation and long-range inhibition model’ with a third module that we propose to call ‘local protection’ since this complex allows the differentiating cell to become immune to self-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). An interesting particularity of patterning in <italic>Nostoc</italic> is that future heterocysts do not emerge as isolated cells. Rather, strings of 3–4 developing cells appear before resolving into a single proheterocyst. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilcox et al., 1973</xref>). These clusters of cells ‘competent’ for differentiation were suggested to be correlated to the stochastic fluctuation in <italic>hetR</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corrales-Guerrero et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, we propose that a stochastic variation of <italic>hetL</italic> expression among the string of competent cells might also be part of the resolving mechanism fixing the decision to differentiate in the cell that inherits enough HetL to be protected from self-inhibition. Microfluidic approaches probing multiple and integrated aspects of heterocyst formation along with mathematical models should shed light on how patterning emerges, resolves and persists in <italic>Nostoc</italic>. An interesting evolutionary aspect resulting from the conservation of PRPs coding-genes in cyanobacterial genomes is that the function of HetL described here might be accurate for other heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria. It is also likely that understanding all the parameters and factors governing heterocyst-pattern formation will be useful in uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying patterning in more complex biological systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Nostoc</italic> PCC 7120)</td><td><italic>hetR</italic></td><td>GenBank</td><td>Genomic sequence:NC_003272.1;

An extra TURBO DNase (Invitrogen) digestion step was performed to eliminate the contaminating DNA. The RNA quality was assessed by tape station system (Agilent). RNAs were quantified spectrophotometrically at 260 nm (NanoDrop 1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For cDNA synthesis, 1 µg total RNA and 0.5 μg random primers (Promega) were used with the GoScript Reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the manufacturer instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses were performed on a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). The reaction volume was 15 μL and the final concentration of each primer was 0.5 μM. The qPCR cycling parameters were 95°C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 55°C for 60 s. A final melting curve from 65°C to 95°C was added to determine the specificity of the amplification. To determine the amplification kinetics of each product, the fluorescence derived from the incorporation of BRYT Green Dye into the double-stranded PCR products was measured at the end of each cycle using the GoTaq qPCR Master Mix 2X Kit (Promega). The results were analysed using Bio-Rad CFX Maestro software, version 1.1 (Bio-Rad, France). The RNA 16S gene was used as a reference for normalization. All measurements were carried out in triplicate and a biological duplicate was performed for each point. The amplification efficiencies of each primer pairs were 80% to 100%.

The experiments were performed at 25°C using the MicroCal PEAQ-ITC (Malvern UK) with 19 injections, first with an initial injection of 0.4 µL followed by 18 injections of 2 µL. The protein ligands were in the cell and the peptide analytes were in the syringe. The reaction was performed with a constant stirring speed of 750 rpm, each injection lasted for 4 s with a 150 s space between each injection. A constant heat control (offset) was removed from the raw data to account for heat dilution before integration.

For both structures, the surface exposed residues were selected manually using PyMol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Two independent docking simulations were performed. For each run, 10 clusters were generated, and classified based on their HADDOCK score.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper reveals a key aspect of cellular differentiation in the one-dimensional patterning of cyanobacterial heterocysts. The differentiating heterocyst produces a morphogen, PatS, whose gradient emanating from the source suppresses the differentiation of its neighbors and establishes spacing of heterocysts every 10-12 cells. Here Xu et al. describe how the PatS-producing cell escapes suppression of differentiation: another protein, HetL, also expressed in the nascent heterocyst, directly competes with PatS for binding to the transcription factor HetR, blocking the developmental suppression activity of PatS.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;HetL provides immunity to HetR against PatS inhibition, and promotes patterning in the cyanobacterium <italic>Nostoc</italic> PCC 7120&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Susan Golden as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Conrad W Mullineaux (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a compelling study that goes a long way towards explaining how PatS/HetR/HetL can serve as a Turing-type reaction-diffusion system to control pattern formation in differentiating filaments of the cyanobacterium <italic>Nostoc</italic> (<italic>Anabaena</italic>). Heterocyst formation in <italic>Nostoc</italic> produces a one-dimensional pattern; this minimal system has always looked like a good model for a rigorous understanding of biological pattern formation and should have broad appeal for the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. Although the study doesn't provide rigorous quantitative understanding of the model, it defines the key players in the system and explains qualitatively how they act. The work shows that a pentapeptide repeat protein called HetL interacts with the transcriptional regulator HetR in competition with the PatS peptide. PatS inhibits HetR interaction with promoter targets, and HetL engagement with HetR blocks PatS-mediated inhibition. In this way, the differentiated cells that produce PatS are immune to inhibition, whereas surrounding vegetative cells are inhibited by a gradient of PatS (as previously demonstrated). The authors provide data in the form of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, structural modelling, gene expression, and genetic approaches that support a mechanistic model in which HetL and PatS interact with the same surface of HetR. Additionally, the authors identify a second protein, All4303, that is homologous to, and may serve a redundant function as that of HetL.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>One substantive scientific point: the schematic model in Figure 7C doesn't make sense, because it shows diffusion of the inhibiting morphogen away from the heterocyst in one direction only (towards the right, as shown in the scheme). All available evidence indicates that <italic>Nostoc</italic> cells are equally open for molecular exchange at both poles. A much more likely scenario would show the morphogen concentration declining symmetrically either side of each heterocyst. Indeed that was what was shown experimentally by Corrales-Guerrero et al., 2013, who found the highest concentrations of PatS in the vegetative cells either side of each heterocyst.</p><p>Authors don't address the question of how the PatS peptide diffuses from cell to cell, and something on that point in the Discussion section would help to give readers a more complete picture of the system. Circumstantial evidence suggests that PatS diffuses via the &quot;septal junctions&quot; (Mariscal et al., 2016). The septal junction structures have recently been very nicely characterised by cryo-electron tomography (Weiss et al., 2019). The observed dimensions of the intercellular channels may explain why the PatS peptide can diffuse from cell to cell, but HetL can't (which is a key requirement for the authors' model to work).</p><p>It would be good to have a title that captures the broader significance of the work. Maybe something like: &quot;HetL, HetR and PatS form a reaction-diffusion system for pattern formation in the filamentous cyanobacterium <italic>Nostoc</italic>&quot;</p><p>The impact statement doesn't do the work justice, as it emphasizes details. The work describes elements of a Turing-type reaction-diffusion system to control pattern formation in differentiating cyanobacterial filaments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59190.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>One substantive scientific point: the schematic model in Figure 7C doesn't make sense, because it shows diffusion of the inhibiting morphogen away from the heterocyst in one direction only (towards the right, as shown in the scheme).
