parasites and is required for prenylation-dependent vesicular trafficking and other cellular processes. We have elucidated a critical and previously uncharacterized role for IPP in apicoplast biogenesis. Inhibiting IPP synthesis blocks apicoplast elongation and inheritance by daughter merozoites, and apicoplast biogenesis is rescued by exogenous IPP and polyprenols. Knockout of the only known isoprenoid-dependent apicoplast pathway, tRNA prenylation by MiaA, has no effect on blood-stage parasites and thus cannot explain apicoplast reliance on IPP. However, we have localized an annotated polyprenyl synthase (PPS) to the apicoplast. PPS knockdown is lethal to parasites, rescued by IPP and long- (C<sub>50</sub>) but not short-chain (≤C<sub>20</sub>) prenyl alcohols, and blocks apicoplast biogenesis, thus explaining apicoplast dependence on isoprenoid synthesis. We hypothesize that PPS synthesizes long-chain polyprenols critical for apicoplast membrane fluidity and biogenesis. This work critically expands the paradigm for isoprenoid utilization in malaria parasites and identifies a novel essential branch of apicoplast metabolism suitable for therapeutic targeting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>isoprenoids</kwd><kwd>apicoplast</kwd><kwd>organelle biogenesis</kwd><kwd>polyprenol

parasites are single-celled eukaryotes that harbor a non-photosynthetic plastid organelle called the apicoplast which houses core metabolic pathways and is essential for parasite viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>). Because human cells lack this organelle and many of its constituent enzymes, the apicoplast has been viewed as a potentially rich source of new parasite-specific drug targets. However, cashing in on this potential has proved challenging since many apicoplast pathways, including heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldberg and Sigala, 2017</xref>) and fatty acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shears et al., 2015</xref>), are dispensable during parasite infection of erythrocytes when all malaria symptoms arise. Multiple antibiotics, including doxycycline and clindamycin, block apicoplast biogenesis and inheritance and kill parasites, but their slow activity over several lifecycles has been a fundamental limitation to broad clinical application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dahl and Rosenthal, 2007</xref>).</p><p>A key, essential function of the apicoplast is biosynthesis and export of the isomeric isoprenoid precursors, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), via the non-mevalonate/methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. IPP and DMAPP, which can be interconverted by an IPP isomerase, are critical for diverse cellular processes that include prenylation of proteins involved in vesicular trafficking, dolichol-mediated protein glycosylation, and biosynthesis of mitochondrial ubiquinone and heme A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guggisberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jomaa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Dooren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simão-Gurge et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, exogenous IPP is able to rescue parasites from lethal apicoplast dysfunction or disruption, highlighting the essential requirement for this isoprenoid precursor outside the apicoplast in blood-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>). Consistent with these critical cellular roles for IPP, the MEP pathway inhibitor fosmidomycin (FOS) kills parasites in the first lifecycle of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jomaa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uddin et al., 2018</xref>). This first-cycle FOS activity contrasts with the delayed, second-cycle death observed for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites treated with antibiotics such as doxycycline and clindamycin that are thought to block translation of the 35 kb apicoplast genome and the predominantly organelle maintenance pathways it encodes. These contrasting kinetics have led to a prevailing view in the literature that essential apicoplast functions can be segregated into two general categories: (1) anabolic pathways that produce metabolites required outside the apicoplast and whose inhibition causes first-cycle parasite death and (2) housekeeping pathways that are only required for organelle maintenance and whose inhibition causes delayed, second-cycle defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ramya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kennedy et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kennedy et al., 2019a</xref>). Although this simple paradigm has been useful for conceptualizing general apicoplast functions, exceptions to this model have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uddin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boucher and Yeh, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada et al., 2020</xref>) and thus its general validity remains uncertain.</p><p>Since exogenous IPP rescues parasites from lethal apicoplast disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>), isoprenoid biosynthesis has been thought to only serve essential roles outside this organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guggisberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uddin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kennedy et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gisselberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Imlay and Odom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gisselberg et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> expresses an essential polyprenyl synthase (PPS, PF3D7_1128400) that appears to localize to the cytoplasm and other cellular foci outside the apicoplast and mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gabriel et al., 2015a</xref>). The dual farnesyl/geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS/GGPPS) activity of this protein is critical for condensing isoprenoid precursors into longer polyprenyl-PP groups required for diverse cellular processes such as protein prenylation and dolichol synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gisselberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gabriel et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">No et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, known prenyltransferases, which attach prenyl groups such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to client proteins, are also cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Imlay and Odom, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to this prevailing paradigm, we have unraveled a novel essential arm of isoprenoid metabolism and utilization within the apicoplast and provide direct evidence that IPP and its condensation into downstream linear isoprenoids are required for apicoplast branching and inheritance by daughter merozoites. Genetic knockout of MiaA-dependent tRNA prenylation, the only previously predicted isoprenoid-dependent pathway in the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>), had no effect on blood-stage parasites, and thus MiaA cannot account for apicoplast dependence on IPP. However, we have localized a previously annotated PPS (PF3D7_0202700) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tonhosolo et al., 2005</xref>) to the apicoplast and show that its conditional knockdown (KD) is lethal to parasites, can be rescued by IPP and long- but not short-chain polyprenols, and blocks apicoplast inheritance. We posit that this apicoplast PPS functions downstream of IPP synthesis to produce longer-chain isoprenoids essential for apicoplast membrane fluidity during organelle biogenesis. This discovery critically expands the paradigm for isoprenoid utilization in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, identifies a potential new apicoplast drug target, and uncovers an organelle maintenance pathway whose inhibition causes first-cycle defects in apicoplast inheritance in contrast to delayed death-inducing antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Apicoplast elongation and branching require isoprenoid precursor synthesis</title><p>The <italic>P. falciparum</italic> literature has focused almost exclusively on the essential roles of isoprenoid metabolism outside the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guggisberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kennedy et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kennedy et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gisselberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Imlay and Odom, 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, several prior studies reported that MEP pathway inhibitors such as FOS and MMV008138 blocked apicoplast elongation in lethally treated parasites, suggesting a possible role for IPP in apicoplast biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nair et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goodman and McFadden, 2014</xref>). These prior studies, however, could not rule out that defects in apicoplast development caused by MEP pathway inhibitors were due to non-specific effects from the pleiotropic cellular dysfunctions inherent to parasite death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gisselberg et al., 2018</xref>). We revisited FOS inhibition of apicoplast biogenesis to further test and distinguish specific versus non-specific effects on organelle development.</p><p>We first tested the effect of 10 µM FOS (10× EC<sub>50</sub>) on apicoplast elongation in synchronized cultures of two different parasite strains: D10 parasites expressing the apicoplast-targeted acyl carrier protein (ACP) leader sequence fused to GFP (ACP<sub>L</sub>-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Waller et al., 2000</xref>) and a recently published NF54 parasite line (PfMev) that expresses ACP<sub>L</sub>-GFP as well as heterologous enzymes that enable cytoplasmic synthesis of IPP from exogenous mevalonate precursor, independent of the apicoplast MEP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swift et al., 2020b</xref>).

This family of enzymes uses a conserved dyad of DDXXD residues positioned near the protein surface of the active site binding pocket to coordinate Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions that bind the pyrophosphate headgroup of DMAPP, GPP, or FPP and position its allylic head relative to the vinyl tail of the IPP subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kellogg and Poulter, 1997</xref>). Condensation of the two substrates via electrophilic alkylation elongates the nascent isoprenoid chain into the protein interior. Two amino acids just upstream of the first DDXXD motif determine the length of the resulting prenyl chain by forming a hydrophobic ‘floor’ that gates the depth of the protein interior. Indeed, dedicated FPPS enzymes feature an amino acid floor comprised of sequential Phe-Phe residues just upstream of the first DDXXD motif that sterically block synthesis of products longer than FPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poulter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thulasiram and Poulter, 2006</xref>).

We independently confirmed that lethal treatment with MMV019313 did not affect apicoplast branching in the PfMev line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that the cytosolic FPPS/GGPPS is not the origin of the PPS activity required for apicoplast biogenesis. Therefore, we turned our attention to the second isoprenoid synthase homolog in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, PF3D7_0202700, which shares 23% sequence identity with avian FPPS.</p><p>Like the FPP/GGPP synthase, PF3D7_0202700 retains the DDXXD sequence dyad expected for a polyprenyl pyrophosphate synthase.

Based on the authors’ description, this truncated recombinant protein appears to have lacked one of the DDXXD motifs. Because of this difference from the native protein and the impurity of the parasite-derived protein, it remains possible that the native, pure protein has a distinct product spectrum than previously reported. Nevertheless, this in vitro activity and the general sequence features of PF3D7_0202700 support its function as a long-chain PPS.</p><p>Prior immunofluorescence studies of this PPS, using a polyclonal antibody raised against the truncated recombinant protein, were unable to localize PF3D7_0202700 to a specific sub-cellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tonhosolo et al., 2009</xref>). Analysis of the protein sequence with MitoProt II or PlasmoAP suggested the presence of a subcellular-targeting leader sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claros and Vincens, 1996</xref>), but ambiguous sequence features prevented a high-confidence targeting prediction to the mitochondrion or apicoplast. MitoProt II predicted a 55% probability of mitochondrial targeting. PlasmoAP strongly predicted an apicoplast-targeting transit peptide, but SignalP did not recognize the N-terminal sequence as a canonical signal peptide. To localize PPS within parasites, we engineered Dd2 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lines to episomally express full-length PPS fused to either C-terminal GFP or RFP. In live parasites, focal PPS-GFP fluorescence was detected in a tubular compartment proximal to but distinct from the mitochondrion, as expected for apicoplast localization. Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) of the PPS-RFP line revealed strong co-localization between PPS-RFP and the apicoplast ACP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm apicoplast targeting of PPS, we stably disrupted the apicoplast in the PPS-GFP Dd2 line by culturing these parasites in 2 µM doxycycline and 200 µM IPP for 1 week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sigala et al., 2015</xref>). As expected for an apicoplast-targeted protein, the PPS-GFP signal in these parasites displayed a constellation of dispersed fluorescent foci, rather than the concentrated signal observed in untreated parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Western blot analysis of the PPS-RFP parasites revealed two bands at the expected sizes for precursor protein and a smaller, N-terminally processed mature form, as expected for import into the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Waller et al., 2000</xref>). In the apicoplast-disrupted parasites, however, only a single PPS-RFP band for the precursor protein was detected, consistent with loss of apicoplast import and lack of transit peptide removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dahl et al., 2006</xref>). On the basis of these observations, we conclude that PF3D7_0202700 is an apicoplast-targeted PPS that is imported into the organelle and N-terminally processed to a mature form. This localization, the predicted ability of this enzyme to synthesize polyprenyl-PPs longer than four isoprene units, and our observation that decaprenol rescued FOS-induced defects in apicoplast biogenesis all suggested a critical role for this protein in apicoplast maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PPS is essential for parasite viability and apicoplast biogenesis</title><p>The genomic locus for PF3D7_0202700 was reported to be refractory to disruption in recent genome-wide KO studies in <italic>P. berghei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bushell et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) suggesting an essential function.

Our detection of only the mature form of endogenous PPS contrasts with our detection of both the precursor and mature forms of episomally expressed PPS-RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that the precursor form may preferentially accumulate when PPS is over-expressed. We also quantified PPS transcript levels by RT-qPCR and observed robust KD of PPS mRNA levels by the second intraerythrocytic cycle of parasite growth in -aTc conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

These observations strongly suggest that PPS has an essential function downstream of IPP synthesis in converting isoprenoid precursors into longer-chain linear polyprenyl-PPs containing at least 5–10 isoprene units.</p><p>To test if PPS function is required for apicoplast biogenesis, we cultured PPS KD parasites in +aTc or -aTc/ + IPP conditions for 12 days and then assessed apicoplast morphology in fixed parasites by αACP immunofluorescence. We reasoned that IPP would rescue parasite viability upon PPS KD but not interfere with assessing any defect in apicoplast biogenesis if IPP synthesis were upstream of PPS function. IFA revealed that ~30% of parasites cultured in -aTc conditions had a dispersed ACP signal indicative of apicoplast disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although this observation supports a critical role for PPS in apicoplast biogenesis, we wondered why PPS KD did not result in a higher fraction of parasites with disrupted apicoplast. We hypothesized that residual PPS expression resulting from incomplete KD combined with high IPP levels due to culture supplementation and endogenous MEP pathway activity might enable sufficient synthesis of polyprenols to attenuate the impact of PPS KD on apicoplast biogenesis.</p><p>To test this hypothesis and the contribution of MEP pathway activity to the observed phenotype, we synchronized parasites to the ring stage and cultured them in ±aTc conditions for 96 hr (two 48 hr growth cycles) to knock down PPS expression before adding FOS and IPP at the start of the third growth cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In this experiment, FOS was expected to inhibit endogenous MEP pathway activity without impacting apicoplast biogenesis since it was added concurrently with IPP, which fully rescues parasites from growth and apicoplast defects induced by FOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yeh and DeRisi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gisselberg et al., 2013</xref>).

Using our PPS KD line, we tested whether translational repression of PF3D7_0202700 impacted detectable levels of β-carotene in parasites, as predicted to occur if PPS also functioned as a PSY. After synchronization, PPS KD parasites were grown ±aTc for 120 hr and harvested at the end of the third intraerythrocytic growth cycle, which immediately precedes the growth defect observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>.

This reciprocal dependence between organelle maintenance and metabolic outputs may extend to other apicoplast pathways in mosquito- and liver-stage <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as well as <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, where additional apicoplast outputs, such as fatty acids, contribute to parasite fitness and may support apicoplast maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shears et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Schaijk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Krishnan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mazumdar et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our results also support the emerging paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uddin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boucher and Yeh, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada et al., 2020</xref>) that inhibition of apicoplast maintenance pathways can kill parasites with first-cycle kinetics that defy the delayed-death phenotype commonly observed for translation-blocking antibiotics such as doxycycline that target organelle housekeeping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dahl and Rosenthal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uddin et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, blocking IPP synthesis causes same-cycle defects in apicoplast biogenesis, which are expected to produce non-viable parasite progeny independent of lethal dysfunctions in isoprenoid-dependent metabolism outside the organelle. Analysis of the timing of FOS-induced defects in apicoplast branching also provides an unexpected and incisive window into the differential compartmentalization of IPP essentiality in parasites. We observed that FOS-treated parasites display apicoplast-elongation defects in early schizogony but continue to divide nuclear DNA and transition into mature schizonts before stalling prior to segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the critical role of IPP for apicoplast biogenesis precedes the broader cellular need for IPP outside the organelle in mature schizonts, suggested by recent works to predominantly reflect essential roles for IPP-dependent protein prenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kennedy et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howe et al., 2013</xref>). Although MEP pathway activity begins in ring-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cassera et al., 2004</xref>), we observed identical inhibition of apicoplast elongation in schizonts independent of whether FOS was added to rings concomitant with synchronization or to trophozoites 12 hr after synchronization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This observation suggests that IPP utilization in the apicoplast depends on de novo synthesis rather than a pre-existing metabolite pool, possibly because IPP does not accumulate in the apicoplast and/or that IPP synthesis within the organelle is differentially partitioned for export and internal utilization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Localization of PPS to the apicoplast</title><p>Our studies identified PF3D7_0202700 as an apicoplast-targeted PPS based on its co-localization with apicoplast ACP, dispersed localization upon apicoplast disruption, and N-terminal processing in an apicoplast-dependent manner. Nevertheless, the sequence features that target PPS to the apicoplast are somewhat obscure. Imported apicoplast proteins canonically contain N-terminal signal and transit peptides that are proteolytically removed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and apicoplast, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Waller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Dooren et al., 2002</xref>). The N-terminus of PPS contains a transit peptide recognized by PlasmoAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foth et al., 2003</xref>) but is not recognized by SignalP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019</xref>) to contain a canonical signal peptide. This targeting ambiguity is not unique to PPS. We are aware of multiple apicoplast-targeted and imported proteins, including several identified in the prior proximity-biotinylation study of the apicoplast proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>), that contain a recognizable transit peptide but lack an identifiable signal peptide by SignalP. These proteins include the key MEP pathway enzymes DXR (PF3D7_1467300) and IspD (PF3D7_0106900), holo ACP synthase (PF3D7_0420200), FabB/F (PF3D7_0626300), and the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PF3D7_1446400). These observations suggest that protein N-termini in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> can have sequence properties compatible with apicoplast targeting that are broader and more heterogenous than ER-targeting sequences from other eukaryotes that comprise the training sets upon which SignalP is currently based. It remains a future challenge to understand these N-terminal properties and their relation to apicoplast targeting and import in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.</p><p>N-terminal processing of apicoplast-targeted proteins is an exclusive property of known proteins imported into the organelle. Although multiple proteins have been shown or suggested to associate with the apicoplast exterior or target the outer apicoplast membrane, none of these proteins is N-terminally processed (e.g., ATG8, oTPT, and FTSH1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mullin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tomlins et al., 2013</xref>). N-terminal processing of PPS is therefore strongly suggestive of import into the apicoplast. Such processing, however, does not specify the sub-compartment within the apicoplast to which PPS is localized, which could include the matrix and/or multiple membranes or intermembrane spaces. Indeed, N-terminal processing has been reported for both matrix and membrane-targeted proteins imported into the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mullin et al., 2006</xref>). The central conclusions of our study are not affected by this ambiguity. For simplicity, we have depicted PPS localization within the apicoplast matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), but more studies and higher resolution (e.g., electron microscopy with immunogold labeling) will be required to specify sub-compartmental targeting of PPS within the apicoplast. PPS lacks obvious membrane-targeting features but required overnight extraction in 2% SDS or LDS for detection by western blot. These features, together with low expression, may explain why PPS has not been detected in prior studies of the apicoplast proteome that used milder extraction conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for other apicomplexan parasites</title><p>PPSs are diverse enzymes that perform a variety of cellular functions, whose specific roles can differ between organisms.

Although the dominant polyprenyl-PP product of apicoplast PPS in parasites remains uncertain, sequence features, prior in vitro enzymology, and the ability of exogenous decaprenol but not GGOH or FOH to rescue PPS KD indicate that linear polyprenyl-PP products longer than 4 and as long as 10 isoprene units are critical for apicoplast maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tonhosolo et al., 2005</xref>). Prior work suggested a dual function for PF3D7_0202700 as a PSY that also condenses isoprenoid precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tonhosolo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gabriel et al., 2015b</xref>), but we found no evidence to support this proposed PSY function or carotenoid biosynthesis more broadly. Synthesis of octaprenyl-PP by PF3D7_0202700 was previously proposed to be critical for ubiquinone biosynthesis in the parasite mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tonhosolo et al., 2005</xref>). Localization of this protein to the apicoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and observation that exogenous IPP rescues the growth defects of its KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) strongly suggest that its activity is not required for mitochondrial ubiquinone biosynthesis and that its essential function is specific to the apicoplast.</p><p>Plant chloroplasts synthesize linear polyprenyl isoprenoids to serve a wide variety of functions that are only partially understood but include key roles in light harvesting and photosynthesis, oxidative stress protection, and as precursors of signaling and defense molecules that function outside the chloroplast (e.g., abscisic acid, gibberellins, and terpenes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joyard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Gelder et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> apicoplast has lost photosynthesis capabilities and has uncertain carotenoid and terpene synthesis capacity. Volatile terpenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kelly et al., 2015</xref>) and carotenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tonhosolo et al., 2009</xref>) have been detected in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes, but the parasite genome lacks enzyme homologs of the relevant synthases required for terpene and carotenoid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ralph et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guggisberg et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we found no evidence of de novo β-carotene synthesis by parasites, and results herein as well as recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miller and Odom John, 2020</xref>) indicate that these metabolites can derive from erythrocyte and/or culture medium sources rather than parasite-specific synthesis. Thus, these known functions in chloroplasts seem uncertain or unlikely to explain apicoplast reliance on longer-chain PPS activity in malaria parasites. Longer-chain polyprenyl-PPs and related dolichols serve as membrane-bound glycan carriers for protein glycosylation, but these activities in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> appear to occur in the ER as they do in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Imlay and Odom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zimbres et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Linear polyprenyl alcohols have been found to be important components of plant membranes, especially chloroplast membranes, where they are proposed to modulate membrane structure, fluidity, and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Gelder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hartley and Imperiali, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Swiezewska and Danikiewicz, 2005</xref>). In the absence of other known roles for longer-chain polyprenyl-PPs in the apicoplast, we hypothesize that linear polyprenols or polyprenyl phosphates may serve as critical components of the apicoplast membranes and be required for maintaining membrane fluidity during organelle biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). A prior MS-based lipidomics study of isolated apicoplasts focused primarily on the fatty acid and phospholipid composition of this organelle and did not characterize isoprenoid components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Botté et al., 2013</xref>). Selective isotopic labeling of parasite-synthesized isoprenoids by 2-<sup>13</sup>C-mevalonate in the PfMev line, combined with apicoplast isolation and our PPS KD line, can potentially identify specific apicoplast isoprenoids whose synthesis depends on PPS activity and thus clarify why apicoplast biogenesis requires longer-chain PPS activity.</p><p>Independent of its specific role in apicoplast biogenesis, PPS function is critical for parasite survival and thus constitutes a new essential arm of isoprenoid metabolism in the apicoplast suitable for development as a therapeutic target. BLAST analysis of the human genome using the PPS protein sequence as query reveals a variety of PPS homologs with modest 20–30% sequence identity to 25–50% of the PPS sequence. The substantial sequence differences with human orthologs will facilitate selective targeting of PPS by chemical inhibitors. Identification of PPS as an apicoplast-targeted enzyme indicates that new metabolic pathways and functions remain to be discovered and/or localized to the apicoplast. These novel functions, which are predicted to be required for organelle maintenance, will enhance our understanding of fundamental apicoplast biology and provide new candidate drug targets for antimalarial therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">D10ACPL-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10775264/">10775264</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NF54-PfMevACP<sub>L</sub>-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32059044/">32059044</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NF54-PfMev∆DXS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32815516/">32815516</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dd2PPS-RFP (pTyEOE)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Described in Materials and methods.

A shield mutation was introduced to the 3’ end of the coding-sequence homology flank corresponding to the gRNA sequence <named-content content-type="sequence">TGATATAAAACAAAGTAGCG</named-content>. This mutation (introduced using primer 18) ablated the CRISPR PAM sequence AGG that immediately following the gRNA sequence above by mutating it to AAG, resulting in a silent mutation of the Glu523 codon from GAG to GAA. Sanger sequencing confirmed the correct sequence of the homology flanks inserted into the pMG75 vector. PCR analysis of the final pMG75 vector using primers 39–40 revealed that only nine copies of the aptamer sequence were retained. Before transfection, the pMG74 vector was linearized by AflII digestion performed overnight at 37°C, followed by deactivation with Antarctic Phosphatase (NEB M0289S).</p><p>Dd2 parasites were transfected with 50 µg of pAIO Cas9/gRNA vector and 50 µg of the linearized pMG75 donor plasmid, as described above. Parasites were selected on the basis of the BSD resistance cassette encoded by the pMG75 plasmid and returned from transfection after 4–6 weeks. Gene-edited Dd2 parasites resulting from transfection with pAIO Cas9/gRNA-4 (produced with primers 10/11) contained PPS (PF3D7_0202700) tagged with the aptamer/TetR-DOZI cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ganesan et al., 2016</xref>) and were maintained in 0.5–1 µM aTc (Cayman Chemicals 10009542). Genetically modified parasites were genotyped by Southern blot, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klemba et al., 2004</xref>). Briefly, genomic DNA from the polyclonal parasites that returned from transfection was digested with BamHI and SpeI (New England Biolabs) and transferred to membrane (Nytran SuPerCharge) using the TurboBlotter system (VWR 89026–838). A DNA probe consisting of the 5 750 bp of the PPS gene was produced by PCR (primers 16/17). Probe labeling, hybridization, and visualization were performed using the AlkPhos Direct Labeling and Detection System (VWR 95038-288) and CDP-Star reagent (VWR 95038-292). The Southern blot confirmed complete integration into the PPS locus without evidence for unmodified parasites, and the polyclonal parasites were used for all subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of PPS transcript levels</title><p>Biological replicate cultures of PPS aptamer/TetR-DOZI parasites were synchronized in 5% D-sorbitol and grown for 72 hr in +aTc (four biological replicates), -aTc (four biological replicates), or -aTc/ + IPP (200 µM) (two biological replicates) conditions prior to harvest. Four mL cultures at ~10% were harvested by centrifugation (2000 rpm for 3 min) and stored at –20°C until use. Total RNA was isolated from frozen parasite-infected blood pellets using a modified Trizol (Invitrogen) extraction protocol. Five mL Trizol (Invitrogen) was added to thawed pellets on ice, pipetted 20–30 times to resuspend, and pulse-vortexed 20 times for 15 s. Two mL chloroform was added to each sample and vortexed, incubated on ice for 5 min, then spun for 10 min at 4°C at 5000 rpm without brake. The top, aqueous layer (~3 mL) was transferred to a new tube. Five mL of isopropanol was added to each sample, gently mixed, and incubated at –80°C for 20 min or –20°C overnight. Samples were spun at 5000 rpm for 30 min, washed with freshly made solution of 70% ethanol, then spun again for 10 min. Ethanol was removed and pellets were dried 30 min on ice. RNA pellets were resuspended in RNAse-free water, quantitated, and used immediately or stored at –80°C. One µg of RNA was DNAse-treated and reverse-transcribed using Superscript IV kit (Invitrogen) with the addition of gene-specific reverse primers 31–38. Subsequent cDNA was analyzed in technical duplicate through qPCRs with SYBR Green fluorescent probe (Invitrogen) in a Roche Lightcycler. Cp values for PPS (primers 35–36) were normalized to the average of two nuclear-encoded control genes (I5P, PF3D7_0802500; ADSL, PF3D7_0206700; primers 31–34), then used to calculate relative RNA abundance values for each culture condition, with the +aTc sample normalized to a value of 1. Data is reported as average ± SD of replicates for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Synchronous growth assays of PPS KD parasites</title><p>Dd2 parasites tagged at the genomic PPS locus with the aptamer/TetR-DOZI system were synchronized by 5% D-sorbitol to ring-stage parasites and allowed to expand ±aTc in two or three biological replicate samples. Parasitemia values were measured daily by flow cytometry and plotted as the average ± SD of replicate samples. For growth-rescue experiments, synchronous parasites were allowed to expand ±aTc, and -aTc plus 200 µM IPP, 5 µM FOH, 5 µM GGOH, or 5 µM decaprenol (C<sub>50</sub>-OH). For growth-rescue experiments involving FOS, PPS KD parasites were synchronized to rings with 5% D-sorbitol and grown for 4 days (96 hr) ± aTc. After 96 hr, all culture wells were synchronized again with 5% D-sorbitol and supplemented with 10 µM FOS and 200 µM IPP, 5 µM FOH, 5 µM GGOH, or 5 µM decaprenol. Parasites were cultured for another 38 hr before harvest at 134 total hours post-initial synchronization for IFA analysis of apicoplast morphology. Parasites grown ±aTc with 10 µM FOS and 200 µM IPP were allowed to expand for an additional 48 hr and harvested at 182 hr post-initial synchronization for analysis by IFA and qPCR for apicoplast morphology and apicoplast:nuclear genome levels, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>qPCR analysis of apicoplast:nuclear genomic DNA levels</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from triplicate parasite samples grown ±aTc with 10 µM FOS and 200 µM IPP and harvested at 182 hr post-initial synchronization. DNA extraction was performed using the QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen 51104). Primers for qPCR were designed to amplify a 120–140 bp region of an apicoplast gene (TufA, PF3D7_API02900, primers 35–36) and each of two nuclear genes (I5P, PF3D7_0802500; ADSL, PF3D7_0206700; primers 31–34). Approximately 100 ng of DNA was amplified in each of three biological replicates with PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher A25741) in a 96-well plate with 20 µL reaction volume on a Quantstudio3 Real Time PCR system. Specificity of primer amplification was confirmed for every sample by identifying only one melting temperature for the product of each qPCR reaction. Abundance of apicoplast relative to nuclear DNA was determined by comparative Ct analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schmittgen and Livak, 2008</xref>), with amplification of TufA (apicoplast) and I5P (nuclear) and calculation of 2<sup>∆Ct</sup>, where ∆Ct = Ct<sub>TufA</sub> – Ct<sub>I5P</sub>. As a positive control, abundance of a second nuclear gene (ADSL) relative to I5P was calculated similarly. The 2<sup>∆Ct</sup> value for TufA or ADSL was normalized to +aTc for each gene to determine a normalized target gene:control gene DNA abundance. Error bars represent the standard deviation between replicates, and p values were determined by two-tailed unpaired t-test in GraphPad Prism 9.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>MiaA gene disruption</title><p>The gene encoding MiaA (PF3D7_1207600) was disrupted in the NF54 PfMev line using CRISPR/Cas9 and gene deletion by double-crossover homologous recombination, similar to the recently described disruption of the DXPR gene (PF3D7_1467300) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swift et al., 2020b</xref>). Homology arm regions (411 bp for the 5’ arm and 540 bp for the 3’ arm) were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with primers 19–22 and cloned into the vector pRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swift et al., 2020b</xref>) using ligation-independent cloning (In-Fusion, Clontech, Mountain View, CA). A guide RNA with sequence <named-content content-type="sequence">AATAACGATATTAAATGTAA </named-content>was cloned into a modified pAIO vector called pCasG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rajaram et al., 2020</xref>) using primers 23 and 24; 75 µg of pRS-miaA-KO plasmid was combined with 75 µg of the pCasG guide RNA plasmid and transfected into NF54 PfMev parasites. Transfected parasites were allowed to expand for 48 hr in 50 µM mevalonate before selection with 5 nM WR99210 and 50 µM mevalonate. Parasites returning from positive selection were genotyped by PCR using primers 25–30. Asynchronous growth of ∆MiaA PfMev parasites ± Mev compared to parental PfMev parasites was performed on biological duplicate samples. Average parasitemia values ± SD were plotted versus time and fit to an exponential growth equation in GraphPad Prism 9.0. Apicoplast (SufB: Pf3D7_API04700) and nuclear (LDH: PF3D7_1324900) genome PCR was performed to confirm apicoplast status in parental PfMev and ∆MiaA parasites, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swift et al., 2020b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Western blots</title><p>Samples of episomal PPS-GFP Dd2 or endogenously HA-FLAG-tagged PPS Dd2 parasites were harvested by centrifugation and treated with 0.05% saponin (Sigma 84510) in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and spun down by centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C; 2% SDS or LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies NP0007) was added to saponin pellets, resuspended by sonication, and incubated overnight at 4°C. 5× Sample buffer containing beta-mercaptoethanol was added to parasite samples before heating at 95°C for 5 min and centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% acrylamide gels run at 120 V in the BIO-RAD mini-PROTEAN electrophoresis system. Fractionated proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gel to a nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 1 hr using the BIO-RAD wet transfer system. Membranes were blocked in 1% casein/PBS for 1 hr at room temperature and then probed with primary antibody overnight at 4°C and secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hr. Episomal PPS-RFP parasite samples were probed with 1:1000 mouse anti-RFP (Invitrogen Life Technologies MA5-15257) and 1:10,000 donkey anti-mouse DyLight800 (Invitrogen Life Technologies SA5-10172). Endogenous HA-FLAG-tagged PPS parasite samples were probed with Roche rat anti-HA monoclonal 3F10 (Sigma 11867423001) and mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma F1804) primary antibodies and goat anti-rat IRDye800CW (Licor 926–32219) and goat anti-mouse IRDye800CW (Licor 925–32210) secondary antibodies.

Uninfected erythrocyte samples were prepared by collecting 20 mL of 4% hematocrit uninfected culture incubated for 6 days in RPMI media that lacked or contained 2.5 g/L AlbuMAX. Samples of infected or uninfected erythrocytes were harvested by centrifugation, lysed by 0.05% saponin, and pelleted by centrifugation. Saponin pellets were washed in PBS and then extracted three times in 1 mL of chilled acetone (pellet was briefly sonicated after addition of the first acetone volume). The supernatant of each extraction was pooled and dried down by vacuum concentration (Speed Vac). Three biological replicates of each sample were prepared. For analysis of AlbuMAX, 85 mg of dry AlbuMAX (equivalent to the AlbuMAX content in 35 mL of complete culture media) was extracted in 3 volumes of cold acetone, and supernatants were combined and dried as above.</p><p>For analysis of β-carotene synthesis, NF54 PfMev parasites were cultured and expanded over three intraerythrocytic cycles in media containing 50 µM 2-<sup>13</sup>C-mevalonate and 10 µM FOS. This strategy was chosen to inhibit MEP pathway activity, ensure full <sup>13</sup>C-labeling of the endogenous IPP and DMAPP precursor pool within parasites produced by the cytoplasmic bypass enzymes, and result in a distinguishable 8 Da mass increase for any β-carotene derived from de novo synthesis. Final parasite samples contained 70 mL of culture at 15% parasitemia and were collected by centrifugation prior to 0.05% saponin lysis, centrifugation, and washing the pellet in PBS. The final pellet was extracted in acetone and dried, as described above.</p><p>As a positive control for detecting isotopic incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled precursors into biosynthesized β-carotene, we turned to studies of <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria engineered to biosynthesize β-carotene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunningham and Gantt, 2005</xref>) and grown in minimal M9 medium with uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C-glucose as the sole carbon source.

The mobile solvent phase A was H<sub>2</sub>O with 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B was MeOH:ACN:IPA (2:2:1 v/v) with 0.1% formic acid. The chromatography gradient started at 80% mobile phase B then increased to 100% B over 6 min where it was held until 9.9 min and then returned to the initial conditions and equilibrated for 5 min.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stuart A Ralph (Reviewer #1); Taco W.A. Kooij (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall the reviewers are aligned in considering the work suitable for publication at <italic>eLife</italic> however there are some issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Perform an IPP rescue on knockdown of the PPS</p><p>2. Provide experimental evidence that PPS is inside the apicoplast and not associated outside of the organelle. As it stands the model presented in figure 9 is not supported by the data.The reviewers are asking for more data (bioinformatics or wet lab) to explain this unusual phenomenon and to adjust the figure 9 and conclusion accordingly.</p><p>3.

Perform an IPP rescue on knockdown of the PPS</p></disp-quote><p>We currently show in Figure 6E that culture supplementation with 200 µM IPP rescues parasite growth from downregulation of PPS expression in -aTc conditions. To address R1’s concern that the PPS transcript reduction in -aTc conditions in Figure 6D could be due to non-specific defects in parasite fitness from loss of PPS function, we have repeated the RT-qPCR experiment in the presence of 200 µM IPP to rescue parasites and decouple their viability from PPS knockdown. We observe identical reduction of PPS transcript levels in -aTc conditions (relative to control gene) in the presence or absence of exogenous IPP, supporting our conclusion that PPS transcripts are selectively degraded in -aTc conditions. We also performed western blot experiments of PPS knockdown in -aTc +IPP conditions to avoid non-specific effects from impaired parasite fitness in -aTc conditions alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Provide experimental evidence that PPS is inside the apicoplast and not associated outside of the organelle. As it stands the model presented in figure 9 is not supported by the data.The reviewers are asking for more data (bioinformatics or wet lab) to explain this unusual phenomenon and to adjust the figure 9 and conclusion accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that apicoplast targeting by PPS has somewhat unusual features in that the N-terminus is not recognized as a signal peptide by SignalP (versions 3-5), despite clear recognition by PlasmoAP of a transit peptide sequence. Nevertheless, multiple experimental observations strongly support our conclusion that PPS is targeted to and imported into the apicoplast. These observations include co-localization of PPS with apicoplast-targeted ACP, dispersal of PPS signal after apicoplast disruption upon culture in IPP/doxycycline, and most importantly western blot detection of both a precursor and N-terminally processed mature form of PPS in untreated parasites but exclusive detection of the precursor protein upon apicoplast disruption. We have also added new localization data to Figure 6 for the endogenous HA-tagged PPS, showing co-localization with apicoplast ACP (including detailed signal overlap analysis via 2-dimensional intensity versus distance plot).</p><p>Because our detection of PPS expression relies on a C-terminal epitope, detection of a truncated mature form implies processing at the N-terminus. To our knowledge, N-terminal processing of an apicoplast-targeted protein is an exclusive property of proteins imported into the organelle. Although multiple proteins have been shown or suggested to associate with the apicoplast exterior or target the outer apicoplast membrane (e.g., ATG8, oTPT, and FTSH1), none of these proteins is N-terminally processed (see Pubmed IDs: 22900071, 24025672, 28826494, and 16760253). In all cases, these proteins are either unprocessed (ATG8 and oTPT) or subject to C-terminal processing (FTSH1). N-terminal processing of PPS is therefore strongly suggestive of import into the apicoplast. Loss of such N-terminal processing in apicoplast-disrupted parasites is consistent with a model that such processing requires apicoplast import.</p><p>We agree that N-terminal processing does not specify the sub-compartment inside the apicoplast to which PPS is localized, which could include the matrix and/or multiple membranes or inter-membrane spaces. Indeed, N-terminal processing has been reported for both matrix and membrane-targeted proteins imported into the apicoplast (e.g., Pubmed 16760253). The central conclusions of our manuscript are not affected by this ambiguity. For simplicity, we have depicted PPS localization in Figure 9 as within the apicoplast matrix but agree that more work is required to specify sub-compartmental targeting within the apicoplast. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion to explore PPS localization and to explicitly state that further experiments will be needed to specify targeting of PPS within the apicoplast. We have also modified the legend for Figure 9 to explicitly state that depiction of PPS localization in the matrix is a model and that additional experiments are required to test and refine this localization.</p><p>As a point of perspective, we note that multiple proteins detected in the Boucher et al. apicoplast proteome (Pubmed 30212465) lack an identifiable signal peptide by SignalP yet are clearly imported into the apicoplast. These proteins include the key MEP pathway enzymes DXR (PF3D7_1467300) and IspD (PF3D7_0106900), holo ACP synthase (PF3D7_0420200), FabB/F (PF3D7_0626300), and the E1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PF3D7_1446400). Thus, apicoplast import despite lack of identifiable signal peptide by SignalP is not unique to PPS but general to multiple (if not many) apicoplast-targeted proteins. These observations suggest to us that protein N-termini in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> can have sequence properties compatible with apicoplast targeting that are broader and more heterogenous than ER-targeting sequences from other eukaryotic organisms that comprise the training sets upon which SignalP is currently based. It remains a future challenge to fully understand these N-terminal properties and their relation to apicoplast targeting and import in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. We have added a section to the Discussion to explore these considerations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
