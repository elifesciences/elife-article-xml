many of these channels remains elusive. In particular, no ion channel has been characterized in melanosomes, organelles that produce and store the major mammalian pigment melanin. Defects in melanosome function cause albinism, characterized by vision and pigmentation deficits, impaired retinal development, and increased susceptibility to skin and eye cancers. The most common form of albinism is caused by mutations in oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2), a melanosome-specific transmembrane protein with unknown function. Here we used direct patch-clamp of skin and eye melanosomes to identify a novel chloride-selective anion conductance mediated by OCA2 and required for melanin production. Expression of OCA2 increases organelle pH, suggesting that the chloride channel might regulate melanin synthesis by modulating melanosome pH. Thus, a melanosomal anion channel that requires OCA2 is essential for skin and eye pigmentation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04543.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04543.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04543.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Melanin is a pigment found in our skin, eyes and hair. Individuals who are unable to make or store melanin, a condition known as albinism, have unusually pale features and problems with vision. The pigment helps to protect us from harmful UV radiation, and so individuals with albinism also have an increased risk of developing skin and eye cancers.</p><p>In cells, melanin is made and stored in compartments called melanosomes. The most common type of albinism is caused by defects in a protein called OCA2, which is found in the membrane that surrounds melanosomes. However the role of OCA2 in melanin production is unclear.</p><p>It has been proposed that OCA2 may allow charged particles (or ions) to enter or leave melanosomes. Here, Bellono et al. used a technique called patch-clamp to study the movement of ions across the membrane of melanosomes from skin and eye cells. The experiments show that a flow of chloride ions out of the melanosome is required for melanin to be produced. OCA2 is involved in the ion movement, and it might alter the acidity of the melanosome when present.</p><p>Bellono et al. propose that OCA2 is part of an ion channel that allows chloride ions to pass through the membrane, to make the melanosome less acidic and enable melanin to be produced. The next challenge will be to identify other ion channels in the melanosome and understand their roles in producing melanin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04543.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04543.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>melanosome</kwd><kwd>albinism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellono</surname><given-names>Nicholas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lefkovith</surname><given-names>Ariel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bellono</surname><given-names>Nicholas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006418</institution-id><institution>Brown University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oancea</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2) contributes to a melanosome-specific anion channel that modulates organellar pH and is critical for melanin synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ion channels are membrane proteins that regulate the concentration of key signaling ions to control a wide range of cellular functions. While plasma membrane ion channels have been extensively studied, much less is known about the identity and physiology of intracellular channels because they are less accessible to direct electrophysiological characterization.</p><p>Melanosomes are lysosome-related organelles that produce and store melanin, a natural pigment present in most organisms. Impaired melanin synthesis and storage affects visual system development and pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and hair, leading to reduced protection against ultraviolet radiation and predisposition for skin and eye cancers. A number of genes encoding putative melanosomal ion transport proteins are critical for melanosomal function, as mutations in these genes result in oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Montoliu et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that ionic homeostasis plays an important role in melanin synthesis and storage, yet how ion channels might contribute to melanosome function and pigmentation remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellono and Oancea, 2014</xref>).</p><p>One of the most common forms of albinism is caused by mutations in a highly conserved protein encoded by the oculocutaneous albinism II gene (OCA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gardner et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rinchik et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosemblat et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sitaram et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

OCA2 has twelve predicted transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gardner et al., 1992</xref>), is localized to melanosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosemblat et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sitaram et al., 2009</xref>), and has been implicated in pH regulation of melanosomes and trafficking of the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Puri et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manga and Orlow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni-Komatsu and Orlow, 2006</xref>). Despite its importance, the function of OCA2 and the molecular mechanism by which it regulates melanin are not known.</p><p>Here we identify and characterize a new intracellular ion channel that resides in the melanosomal membrane and requires OCA2 expression. Using whole-organelle and single-channel patch-clamp recordings we found that OCA2 contributes to an anion channel required for pigmentation. The OCA2-mediated Cl<sup>−</sup> current was nearly abolished by a mutation identified in patients with oculocutaneous albinism type II. Interestingly, expression of OCA2 in endolysosomes increased organelle pH, providing a potential mechanism for how OCA2 regulates melanogenesis. Thus, a previously uncharacterized OCA2-dependent anion channel is critical for melanosomal function and pigmentation, revealing a novel function for intracellular ion channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>Because intracellular ion channels are important regulators of organellar and cellular function and defects in melanosomes, lysosomal-related organelles present in melanocytes and retina, often result in severe pigmentation phenotypes, we wondered how ion channels contribute to melanosome function.

We thus calculated the OCA2-mediated transport rate at 80 mV, where we measured the largest single-channel amplitude, and found a transport rate of ∼5.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> ions/s. The large conductance recorded in isolated patches from OCA2-expressing endolysosomes indicates that OCA2 functions as a critical component of an electrodiffusive anion channel. Similar properties were measured for single-channel currents in excised cytoplasmic-side-out patches of dermal melanosomes from <italic>Oa1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> melanocytes (i<sub>melano</sub>) (E<sub>rev</sub> = −67 mV and unitary slope conductance = 60 ± 1 pS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Thus, the single-channel properties of this endogenous melanosomal current are nearly identical to those recorded from OCA2-expressing endolysosomes.</p><p>To determine the anion selectivity of the recorded currents, we estimated the permeability to different anions by determining E<sub>rev</sub> under symmetrical concentrations (48 mM) of luminal Cl<sup>−</sup> and cytoplasmic Cl<sup>−</sup>, Br<sup>−</sup>, I<sup>−</sup>, F<sup>−</sup> or Gluc<sup>−</sup>. E<sub>rev</sub> for I<sub>OCA2</sub> was close to zero for cytoplasmic Cl<sup>−</sup> and Br<sup>−</sup> and shifted to negative voltages for I<sup>−</sup>, F<sup>−</sup>, and Gluc<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting that in endolysosomes OCA2 mediates a current selective for Cl<sup>−</sup> and Br<sup>−</sup>, but poorly permeable to I<sup>−</sup>, F<sup>−</sup>, and Gluc<sup>−</sup>. A similar shift in E<sub>rev</sub> was measured for I<sub>melano</sub> in dermal or RPE melanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), indicating that the endogenous currents have the same selectivity profile. Moreover, the calculated permeability ratios (P<sub>x</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub>) for the heterologously expressed currents were nearly the same as the endogenous ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that I<sub>OCA2</sub> and I<sub>melano</sub> are mediated by the same anion channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusions and implications</title><p>Our results suggest that OCA2 is an essential component of a melanosome-specific anion channel. Heterologous endolysosomal expression of OCA2 contributes to a chloride channel with biophysical properties similar to an endogenous melanosomal OCA2-mediated channel. Importantly, OCA2 activity controls the melanin content of melanosomes, most likely by regulating organellar pH. We propose that OCA2 contributes to a novel melanosome-specific anion current that modulates melanosomal pH for optimal tyrosinase activity required for melanogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cells and tissue</title><p>All cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and reagents were from Invitrogen/Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY) unless stated otherwise.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and Chris Miller, who is serving as a guest editor, as well as two other reviewers, one of whom, David Clapham, has agreed to reveal his identity. Chris Miller has been in touch with you about the steps required for submission of a revised manuscript. This is a more formal letter that summarizes the decision.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a satisfying study that identifies a novel ion channel involved in regulation of acidification of melanosomes, which are lysosome-like intracellular organelles specialized for melanin pigment-producing cells. The authors start with a guess – that OCA2, an unknown-function membrane protein whose genetic disruption leads to albinism – might contribute to melanosome physiology. Accordingly, they heterologously express OCA2 in mammalian cells, showing that the protein is directed to the endolysosomes, and in exceedingly challenging patch-recording experiments document a new current appearing in dissected lysosomes. They carry out a thorough characterization of this voltage-dependent, Cl- selective current, showing that it is reduced by certain mutations associated with albinism. Moreover, they detect a similar current endogenous to melanosomes from a melanocyte cell line. The biological function of this current is addressed by experiments showing that heterologous expression of OCA2 leads to pH regulation in lysosomes similar to that known for melanosomes in melanocytes, and effect that albinism mutants fail to produce. Moreover, they show that proper pH regulation in the melanocyte line is suppressed by OCA2 siRNA.</p><p>These difficult experiments are carefully done, the analysis is rigorous, and the conclusions compelling (but see below). Moreover, the system offers novel insight into an unusual cellular physiology: pH regulation of melanin-producing organelles in melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelial cells.</p><p>The reviewers had several criticisms that will need to be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) The conclusion that the OCA2 currents observed are mediated by an electrodiffusive ion channel mechanism is not well enough supported by the single-channel recordings of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. It is clear that these recordings are unusually difficult to make, but the absence of a statistically serious argument that these appear only upon OCA2 expression is lacking here. Since OCA2 is a member of the SLC13 family, for which only transporters are known, makes it all the more important to establish the identity of the single channels observed.</p><p>2) The use of Lysotracker to put a precise value on the lumenal pH of these lysosome-like compartments is questioned. Lysosensors are weak bases that accumulate in acidic organelles, but since this accumulation is pH dependent, as is the molecules' fluorescence it is very difficult to be confident of assessments of pH change. The calibrations are questionable because monensin alone is unlikely to allow full pH equilibration with the bathing medium.</p><p>3) The authors have given no plausible picture of why expression of a Cl- conductance should lead to alkalinization of the melanosomal lumen via the V-ATPAse, rather than acidification, and so the physiological rationale of the study needs sharpening in the Discussion (or Introduction).</p><p>4) The family of voltage-pulse-evoked currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) are far noisier than the ramp-evoked IV curves of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, and this discrepancy raises concerns. In addition, the currents of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> are rather redundant to those of 4E, and could be removed, but the large difference on primary data quality should be explained in the authors' response.</p><p>5) Albinism mutations. All three reported mutations presumably cause albinism, but the K614E mutation seems to generate completely normal currents. The authors never address this discrepancy, which is difficult to reconcile with the claimed function of the protein.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04543.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The conclusion that the OCA2 currents observed are mediated by an electrodiffusive ion channel mechanism is not well enough supported by the single-channel recordings of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>.

Since OCA2 is a member of the SLC13 family, for which only transporters are known, makes it all the more important to establish the identity of the single channels observed</italic>.</p><p>Our argument that single channels are only present in cells transfected with OCA2 is based on a negative control (endolysosomes dissected from mock-transfected cells) of only two patches. As the reviewer indicates, this is because of the extreme difficulty of the experiments. We agree that increasing the n for the negative control would make our claim statistically stronger. In response to this, we added more recordings from cytoplasmic-side-out patches from dissected mock-transfected endolysosomes, included in a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). In this figure we show all six negative control recordings, none of which has currents similar to those measured in all eight of the OCA2-expressing cells and dermal melanosomes. We also plotted all-points amplitude histograms for each recording and graphed the average maximal amplitudes obtained from Gaussian fits of each amplitude histogram for each recording. These data are very consistent and, we believe, convincing that the single channels recorded require OCA2 expression.</p><p><italic>2) The use of Lysotracker to put a precise value on the lumenal pH of these lysosome-like compartments is questioned.

The calibrations are questionable because monensin alone is unlikely to allow full pH equilibration with the bathing medium</italic>.</p><p>We agree that LysoSensor quantification is not flawless and we altered the text and figures to reflect that. However, because the LysoSensor measurements complement the pHluorin experiments, we feel that it would be useful to keep them in supplemental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>) and adjusting the wording for the quantification of luminal pH accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) The authors have given no plausible picture of why expression of a Cl- conductance should lead to alkalinization of the melanosomal lumen via the V-ATPAse, rather than acidification, and so the physiological rationale of the study needs sharpening in the Discussion (or Introduction)</italic>.</p><p>We don’t understand the mechanism by which OCA2 expression makes the endolysosomal lumen more alkaline, but can offer some of our hypotheses or speculations.</p><p>There are two determinant factors for our hypothesis/model: the organelle membrane potential (Vm) and the Nernst potential for endolysosomal/melanosomal Cl<sup>−</sup> (E<sub>Cl</sub>).</p><p>If Vm is more positive than E<sub>Cl</sub>, then Cl<sup>−</sup> will flow from the lumen into the cytosol. Negative charges leaving the lumen will make the inside more positive and decrease the electrogenic pumping of V-ATPase. In addition, OCA2-mediated Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux will also decrease the luminal Cl<sup>−</sup> concentration, decreasing the driving force for CLC antiporters, which will bring less H<sup>+</sup> into the lumen. A decrease in H<sup>+</sup> pumped by V-ATPases and transported by CLC would result in a more basic luminal pH.</p><p>Vm &gt; E<sub>Cl</sub> → <bold>↑</bold> pH lumen</p><p>If Vm is more negative than E<sub>Cl</sub>, then Cl<sup>−</sup> will flow from the cytosol into the lumen. The Cl<sup>−</sup> influx would shunt the positive-inside membrane potential, which in turn would increase the electrogenic pumping of V-ATPase, leading to H<sup>+</sup> accumulation in the lumen. In this case OCA2-mediated Cl<sup>−</sup> transport would acidify the lumen of the endolysosome or melanosome.</p><p>Vm &lt; ECl → <bold>↓</bold> pH lumen</p><p>Our experimental evidence suggests that the first possibility applies to our data. But neither of the two values, Vm nor E<sub>Cl</sub>, has been unequivocally determined. In support of the assumption that Vm &gt; E<sub>Cl</sub>, the lysosomal membrane potential has been estimated to be in the -30 – -10 mV range (Koivusalo et al., Traffic 2011; Steinberg et al., JCB 2010; Sonawane et al., JBC 2002, Cang et al., Cell 2013) and E<sub>Cl</sub> is likely to be in the range of the typical plasma membrane value of -60mV, based on estimates of Cl<sup>−</sup> concentrations in lysosomes and the cytosol (Steinberg et al., JCB 2010). Under our normal experimental conditions ([Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>in</sub> = 150 mM, [Cl<sup>−</sup>]<sub>out</sub> = 10 mM) E<sub>Cl</sub> = -68 mV. In support of the second scenario (Vm &lt; ECl), the Brilliant laboratory found the melanosomes of OCA2-deficient mice to be less acidic compared with WT using DAMP and anti-DNP staining (Puri et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000). However, this change in pH cannot be directly attributed to the absence of a Cl<sup>−</sup> conductance mediated by OCA2 because these melanosomes have biogenesis and maturation defects and are likely to lack other proteins important for pH and membrane voltage regulation.</p><p>Our ability to come up with a clear model is hindered by the fact that there are many unknown variables that could contribute to the regulation of organellar pH and Vm and that might be different between melanosomes and endolysosomes. The effect of the Cl<sup>−</sup> conductance on the pH of the lumen could be a more complex mechanism mediated by additional channels and transporters. It is possible that melanosomes may have voltage-sensitive channels or enzymes, similar to endolysosomes (Cang et al., Nature Chem. Biol. 2014), which could be affected by OCA2 to regulate pH. In endolysosomes expressing OCA2, other ion channels might become regulated by heterologous OCA2 (TRPML, TPC, etc.) to indirectly modulate pH. In melanosomes, there are a number of membrane proteins with predicted ion transport function (SLC45A2, SLC24A5, etc.) that could contribute to this pathway by directly transporting H<sup>+</sup> or by modulating H<sup>+</sup> transport mechanisms. Because endolysosomes and melanosomes express different proteins that contribute to ion transport and might have different Vm, in addition to the hypothesized different luminal pH, it is also possible that OCA2 expression does not have the same effect on the pH of endolysosomes compared to the pH of melanosomes. Thus, until we better understand melanosome membrane conductance and signaling, our model depicting pH regulation by OCA2 remains highly speculative.</p><p>We now include a brief paragraph discussing our hypothetical model.</p><p><italic>4) The family of voltage-pulse-evoked currents (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4F</italic></xref><italic>) are far noisier than the ramp-evoked IV curves of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4E</italic></xref><italic>, and this discrepancy raises concerns. In addition, the currents of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4F</italic></xref> <italic>are rather redundant to those of 4E, and could be removed, but the large difference on primary data quality should be explained in the authors' response</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the melanosomal recordings from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> are lower quality than the currents recorded in response to ramps. We included them with the intention of showing current kinetics in response to voltage steps. We think these recordings look so noisy because whole-melanosome recordings, in particular from RPE melanosomes, are especially unstable in response to prolonged voltage pulses, compared with ramps. We also recognize the redundancy in the data and removed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, as suggested. In place, we have added summary data from the ramp-elicited currents in RPE melanosomes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) Albinism mutations. All three reported mutations presumably cause albinism, but the K614E mutation seems to generate completely normal currents. The authors never address this discrepancy, which is difficult to reconcile with the claimed function of the protein</italic>.</p><p>We were also surprised by the lack of localization or whole-organelle current phenotype for the K614E variant, and do not have a definitive answer regarding why it is associated with oculocutaneous albinism. This mutation was found in a German patient with albinism who had an additional OCA2 mutation (W679C), perhaps each mutation inherited from one parent (Passmore et al., Hum Genet 1999). A similar mutation (K614N) was found in a Tanzanian patient who also had a deletion in the second allele of the gene (Spritz et al., Am J Hum Genet 1995). In contrast, the V443I mutation is very common – it has been described in more than 10 studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ifpcs.org/albinism/oca2mut.html">http://www.ifpcs.org/albinism/oca2mut.html</ext-link>) – and is, by itself, sufficient to cause oculocutaneous albinism.</p><p>Therefore, it is possible that the K614E mutation has a mild localization or functional phenotype that we are not able to detect using overexpression. Endogenous OCA2 is present at low amounts, thus even “modest” exogenous expression by viral transduction will likely increase the endogenous OCA2 levels by at least 10 fold. We speculate that the high expression levels could mask a mild defect in localization to melanosomes or in protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is also possible that the K614E mutation, found in a conserved cytoplasmic loop, affects the regulation of OCA2 function via an unknown mechanism present in the cytoplasm, which is lost during organelle dissection. But we have no way of addressing this concern in a more effective way.</p></body></sub-article></article>
