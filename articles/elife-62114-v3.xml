Recent studies suggest that memory deficits are more susceptible to phosphorylated tau (Ptau) than amyloid-beta. However, little is known regarding the neurocognitive mechanisms linking Ptau and memory-related decline. Here, we extracted data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ptau collected at baseline, diffusion tensor imaging measure twice, 2 year apart, and longitudinal memory data over 5 years. We defined three age- and education-matched groups: Ptau negative cognitively unimpaired, Ptau positive cognitively unimpaired, and Ptau positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment. We found the presence of CSF Ptau at baseline was related to a loss of structural stability in medial temporal lobe connectivity in a way that matched proposed disease progression, and this loss of stability in connections known to be important for memory moderated the relationship between Ptau accumulation and memory decline.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>structural connectivity</kwd><kwd>medial temporal lobe</kwd><kwd>alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>phosphorylated tau</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NR015452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Feng V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 AG024904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Feng V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-12-2-0012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Feng V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylated tau was related to a loss of structural stability in medial temporal lobe connectivity, and this loss of stability moderated the relationship between phosphorylated tau accumulation and memory decline.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of both amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins that lead to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jack et al., 2015</xref>). The dominant view in the literature is that Aβ pathology triggers tau aggregation, strongly supported by evidence from autosomal dominant AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hardy, 2002</xref>). However, there have been important recent findings from sporadic AD that suggest that hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that are no longer governed by normal cellular removal mechanisms play a necessary and underappreciated role in AD progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Musiek and Holtzman, 2015</xref>), with some authors even suggesting that this may be the primary step in the disease needed for subsequent AB aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnsten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braak and Del Tredici, 2015</xref>). In addition, a recent study found that tau-positron emission tomography (PET), but not β-amyloid–PET, could predict longitudinal brain atrophy in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La Joie et al., 2020</xref>). Perhaps for this reason, across animal and human studies, phosphorylated tau (Ptau), rather than Aβ, seems to better reflect cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giannakopoulos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hedden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitchell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schöll et al., 2016</xref>). However, for Ptau to become a potentially meaningful therapeutic target for preventing or slowing dementia progression, it is essential to better understand the mechanisms linking Ptau and cognitive deficits.</p><p>Both in vivo and in vitro findings support that abnormal tau appears to originate in the anterior medial temporal lobe (MTL) before spreading to anterior-temporal (AT) and posterior-medial (PM) regions of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braak and Del Tredici, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2016</xref>). Cumulative evidence suggests that AD is a <italic>connectome</italic> disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai and He, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Damoiseaux et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delbeuck et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rose et al., 2000</xref>), and abnormal tau spreads via neuronal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clavaguera et al., 2009</xref>). MTL is strongly connected with both the AT and PM systems, with anterolateral entorhinal cortex showing preferential connectivity with anterior regions overlapping with the AT system and parahippocampal gyrus and posteromedial entorhinal cortex with posterior regions overlapping with the PM system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maass et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Navarro Schröder et al., 2015</xref>). The accumulation of abnormal tau in the MTL and subsequent spread to these cortical memory systems are likely to be particularly relevant for understanding memory deficits in AD, as these systems play dissociable roles in human memory: the AT system is specific for object-related stimuli (i.e., semantic memory) and the PM is specific for remembering scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davachi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that damage to the integrity of neural connections between the MTL, AT, and PM may be a mechanism by which Ptau accumulation leads to cognitive decline.</p><p>Several studies have examined the relationship between the functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berron et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cope et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franzmeier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franzmeier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maass et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ossenkoppele et al., 2019</xref>) and structural connectivity and tau pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Tau propagation from the entorhinal cortex to anterior and posterior brain regions that overlap with the AT and PM memory systems has been shown to relate to connectivity strength as measured by functional connectivity in cognitively normal adults, consistent with the idea that tau spreads via neuronal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, tau pathology is related to worse performance in object memory tasks involving the AT system relative to scene memory tasks involving the PM system in cognitive normal older adults, also matching the proposed spread of the disease via neuronal connections, as tau burden was much higher in the AT system compared with the PM system in the early stages of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnsten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maass et al., 2019</xref>). While single measures of functional and structural connectivity can give clues into the spread of Ptau, abnormalities in the longitudinal integrity of the structural connectivity may directly reflect loss of axonal integrity from tau pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conturo et al., 1999</xref>). Especially during predementia AD stages when AD pathology is relatively mild, the loss of this integrity due to tau pathology might help explain how tau accumulation in the MTL leads to memory deficits. Synthesizing these separate lines of evidence, we suspect that the longitudinal integrity of the structural connections of the MTL may link Ptau accumulation and episodic memory decline in predementia AD syndromes.</p><p>Here, we capture the longitudinal integrity of the structural connectivity by calculating correlations across multiple time points to give a measure of stability. This novel concept has been first applied to functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaufmann et al., 2017</xref>). An emerging study suggests that a functional connectome stability measure is associated with cognition (average and rate of episodic memory decline) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ousdal et al., 2020</xref>). Traditional univariate tract-wise analysis first derives a change score of each tract and then compares it across participants. Conversely, the stability measure calculates the pattern similarity between two time points across multiple connections within participants, in which subtle changes of individual connections may affect the stability score. The stability measure may therefore be suitable to capture subtle structural changes in the predementia AD stage.</p><p>We aimed to examine the relationship between structural stability, Ptau, and episodic memory. We extracted data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, focusing on participants with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ptau collected at baseline, as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measure twice, 2 years apart with the baseline measure corresponding to Ptau measurement. In addition, we extracted episodic memory data at baseline (anchored by Ptau measurement) and throughout four additional years.</p><p>We had several hypotheses: first, based on the idea that the accumulation of Ptau in MTL in the predementia AD stages causes a loss of integrity in the axons that connect MTL to AT and PM systems, we hypothesized that higher CSF Ptau levels will be associated with decreased MTL-related structural stability. Specifically, we examined stability within the MTL, as well as in MTL-AT and MTL-PM connections. Second, given that tau tangles deposit early in the AT lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnsten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braak and Del Tredici, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maass et al., 2019</xref>), we hypothesized that Ptau first affects the stability in the MTL and MTL-AT in the predementia stages, followed by MTL-PM as the disease progresses and tau pathology worsens and spreads to posterior brain regions. Finally, given that MTL and related structures play a central role in episodic memory, we hypothesized that MTL-related structural stability might be associated with tau-related episodic memory decline.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We extracted data from ADNI participants with CSF Ptau collected at baseline, DTI measure twice, 2 year apart, and longitudinal episodic memory data over 5 years.

We did this by first examining the relationship between Ptau at baseline and longitudinal white matter stability across three groups (CN Ptau–, CN Ptau+, and MCI Ptau+). CN Ptau+ and MCI Ptau+ had decreased stability in MTL and MTL-AT compared to CN Ptau-, while MCI Ptau+ further showed decrease in MTL-PM stability relative to both CN Ptau– and CN Ptau+ groups, suggesting that Ptau relates to structural stability in a temporal pattern that matches its proposed spread from the MTL via neuronal connections. Furthermore, the stability in MTL, MTL-AT, and MTL-PM predicted average episodic memory over 5 years, suggesting that damage to these pathways specifically relates to episodic memory decline. Importantly, structural stability in MTL moderated the effect of Ptau on the rate of memory change, suggesting that structural stability in MTL may be a candidate as a mechanistic link between the accumulation of Ptau and cognitive decline.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ptau influences the white matter structural stability</title><p>Comparing groups with varied degrees of Ptau abnormality (Ptau+ vs. Ptau–) and/or cognitive deficits (CN vs. MCI), MTL structural stability was disrupted both within MTL and between MTL and AT in CN Ptau+ and MCI Ptau+ relative to CN Ptau–, and the disruption was further extended to MTL-PM connections in MCI Ptau+ relative to both CN Ptau– and CN Ptau+. This is consistent with the proposed model of Ptau spread from the MTL via neuronal connections. In a recent longitudinal study examining Ptau’s influence on the structural connectome in the preclinical stage of AD, elevated Ptau was associated with changes primarily in MTL and MTL-AT regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Another study found that Ptau accumulation in posterior cingulate cortex (a region of PM) could be predicted by baseline mean diffusivity (MD) in MTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobs et al., 2018</xref>). Noticeably in our study, the relationship between Ptau and structural stability was robust, as it was barely affected by neurodegeneration, Aβ, or age. In summary, our results add to previous literature suggesting that tau pathology may act as the primary mechanism for changes in white matter structural integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>White matter structural stability predicts longitudinal episodic memory</title><p>In line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobs et al., 2018</xref>), our study revealed a robust relationship between structural stability in MTL, MTL-AT, and MTL-PM connections and average episodic memory. Additionally, stability of MTL related to the decline rate of memory over time. Literature suggests that the decline in episodic memory can be predicted by changes in functional connectivity between select regions (e.g., cortico-striatal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fjell et al., 2016</xref>], subcortical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ousdal et al., 2020</xref>], default mode networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Staffaroni et al., 2018</xref>], and posterior medial temporal lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salami et al., 2016</xref>]). Our findings add to this literature by showing that an index reflecting the longitudinal integrity of MTL connections relates to episodic memory decline over time, suggesting that changes in structural integrity of within MTL connections over the course of several years co-occur with episodic memory decline. These results suggested that MTL-related structural connections might serve as potential therapeutic targets for preventing memory decline in the early stage of AD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>MTL structural stability links Ptau and longitudinal episodic memory</title><p>Previous research has shown that MTL structural connectivity influences downstream PM Ptau, and changes in both MTL white matter and PM Ptau influenced memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacobs et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is unclear whether changes in MTL structural connectivity are a result of accumulated Ptau and whether these changes present a mechanism by which Ptau may lead to decreases in episodic memory. In the current study, we found that levels of Ptau were related to decreases in MTL structural stability and that these changes were in turn related to decreases in episodic memory. A model showed that decreases in the stability of within MTL connections significantly predicted episodic memory decline, suggesting that changes in these connections resulting from increased Ptau are associated with decreases in episodic memory. Synthesizing the relationship between Ptau and structural stability, as well as structural stability and episodic memory, we found MTL structural stability moderated the relationship between Ptau and rate of memory change. Ptau’s predictive strength for cognition is overall limited, which interferes with its clinical value for early detection of cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansson and Mormino, 2018</xref>). Structural stability in MTL may be a viable biomarker and early intervention target addressing the linkage between pathology and cognition. It is possible that the observation of a stronger relationship between more Ptau and faster rate of memory decline in those with higher MTL stability might be driven by greater variance in this group, caused by the inclusion of both stable individuals with overall low connectivity as well as consistently high connectivity. To assess this, we looked at the number of spread of individuals across these groups based on their mean structural connectivity in MTL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, see Materials and methods for details). The stable group contains 12 high–high MD and 15 low–low MD subjects, while the instable group contains 12 high–high MD and nine low–low MD subjects. While there are more low-low subjects in the stable group, the ratio of low-low to high–high is similar across these groups, suggesting increased variance is unlikely to drive the strong relationship with cognition in the high-stability group.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Dichotomized mean MD and stability of MTL.</title><p> <supplementary-material id="table2sdata1"><label>Table 2—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Dichotomized mean MD and stability of MTL.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-62114-table2-data1-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material> </p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Mean MD of MTL at year 0</th><th>Mean MD of MTL at year 2</th><th>Stability of MTL</th><th>CN Ptau– <break/>(N = 26)</th><th>CN Ptau+ <break/>(N = 18)</th><th>MCI Ptau+ <break/>(N = 30)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Stable</td><td>8 (30.8%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>4 (13.3%)</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Stable</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>3 (10.0%)</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Stable</td><td>6 (23.1%)</td><td>1 (5.6%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Stable</td><td>4 (15.4%)</td><td>7 (38.9%)</td><td>4 (13.3%)</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Instable</td><td>2 (7.6%)</td><td>6 (33.3%)</td><td>4 (13.3%)</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Instable</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>2 (11.1%)</td><td>8 (26.7%)</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Instable</td><td>3 (11.5%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>3 (10.0%)</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>Low</td><td>Instable</td><td>3 (11.5%)</td><td>2 (11.1%)</td><td>4 (13.3%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Note: Mean MD is the averaged MD across all connections within MTL. MD, mean diffusivity; MTL, medial temporal lobe.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations.

Second, Ptau is determined using one-time measurement from CSF rather than longitudinal PET. All regionally specific hypotheses on tau accumulation are based on previous studies, rather than observations in the current study. Finally, the 2 year interval for DTI data was relatively short, which may not be sufficient to capture reliable changes in structural connectivity in predementia AD. Longer follow-up period may reveal the significant interaction effect between Ptau and covariates (e.g., Aβ) in predicting the structural stability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data source</title><p>Data were obtained from ADNI GO and ADNI2 database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/">adni.loni.usc.edu</ext-link>).

Non-brain tissue was removed using FSL’s Brain Extraction Tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith, 2002</xref>). We then registered DWI images with the T1 anatomical images using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTS/">http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTS/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Network construction</title><p>To extract brain connectome, we employed an established structural connectome processing pipeline (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). First, we applied a reproducible probabilistic tractography algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Girard et al., 2014</xref>) to diffusion MRI data to generate streamlines across the whole brain. We used 0.2 mm step size and 25° angle threshold. Next, we defined the cortical, subcortical, and brainstem regions on T1 anatomical images for each participant using FreeSurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>). From the FreeSurfer segmentation, 34 regions per hemisphere were identified using Desikan-Killiany atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desikan et al., 2006</xref>), as well as 17 subcortical and brainstem structures: the brain stem, and bilateral segmentations of thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, accumbens, and cerebellum. Together, we obtained 85 nodes per participant. For each pair of nodes, we extracted the streamlines connecting them. Next, we calculated the mean of mean diffusivity (MD), an indicator of myelination and axonal thickness, along each streamline to describe the connectivity (edge) between the connected nodes. This procedure generated an 85-by-85 symmetric MD-based structural connectivity matrix per participant at both baseline (year 0) and 2 year follow-up (year 2). Of note, previous studies have shown that MD is more sensitive than other metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) to white matter alterations associated with MCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2017</xref>) and AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2017</xref>), with MD also predicting conversion to dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fellgiebel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2007</xref>). Physiologically, the absolute diffusion, which is quantified by MD, is a more sensitive marker of neurodegeneration than FA, which simply quantifies the anisotropy of the diffusion tensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Cabronero et al., 2010</xref>). These findings motivated us to choose MD over other metrics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Stability measure</title><p>For each individual, we computed longitudinal stability by calculating a within-participant Pearson correlation coefficients between year 0 and year 2 across connections. Each individual has stability scores for MTL, MTL-AT, and MTL-PM, respectively: the score for MTL is based on the 15 connections within MTL, MTL-AT based on the 48 unique connections between MTL and AT system, and MTL-PM based on 60 unique connections between MTL and PM system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the average mean diffusivity (MD) matrices for each group at year 0 and year 2, respectively.</p><p>The traditional univariate analysis only considers the overall magnitude of the network (e.g., the average MD across all connections within MTL network). By contrast, the stability measure is interested in the pattern of connectivity and reflects change in the patterns of MD across connections. This measure is purposefully meant to be agnostic to the mechanism by which stability is impacted across individuals; it is designed to capture changes in the pattern of connectivity that we believe occur in response to pathology. It may be that pathology causes connections to be reduced in strength, but other connections may show corresponding increases as a result. To understand how this measure related to overall connectivity, we averaged the MD measures across all connections within MTL to get a mean MD score for MTL network for each individual. Then we used the median as a cut-off to dichotomize the mean MD score to ‘high’ and ‘low’ for baseline (year 0) and 2 year follow-up (year 2), respectively. Similarly, we split stability of MTL to ‘stable’ and ‘instable’ at the median. The mean MD scores of 2 years and the MTL stability were dichotomized into two levels, over and under the cut point, forming eight groups in total. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> displays the prevalence of eight groups in the CN/MCI samples. As we can see, it is possible that subjects maintained the same level of mean MD from baseline to follow-up (e.g., low–low or high–high), but their MD patterns actually changed and became instable. Thus, the traditional univariate analysis may not be as sensitive as the stability measure in detecting these subtle structural changes in the predementia AD stage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Episodic memory measure</title><p>Episodic memory is a standardized composite score derived from multiple measures using factor analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crane et al., 2012</xref>), on the memory-related domains of the Mini-Mental Status Examination, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition subscale, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and Logical Memory Test. The average standardized episodic memory composite score is 0 among the entire ADNI sample (including those with cognitive impairment). We had follow-up data for episodic memory for all participants for up to 4 years (from baseline to a 4 year follow-up). To assess the association between longitudinal structural stability, baseline Ptau, and episodic memory, an average episodic memory score is calculated by averaging episodic memory over 5 years. Since we were interested in prediction of memory in the future, average memory score was used instead of baseline memory. Rate of memory change was determined by calculating the slope obtained from the linear regression line created by all available time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Covariates</title><p>We consider baseline demographics and factors associated with AD or episodic memory (i.e., age, Aβ, and neurodegeneration) as covariates in selected analysis. The cut-off for age was ≥75 years old since it has been widely used to classify young-old (65–74) and old-old (75+) in previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Field and Minkler, 1988</xref>). Aβ were derived from CSF aliquots and measured using Elecsys CSF immunoassays at the University of Pennsylvania. The cut-off for positive Aβ was &lt;976.6 pg/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suárez-Calvet et al., 2019</xref>). A log-data transformation was applied to fit the skewed Aβ distribution into a normal distribution when used as a continuous variable. Neurodegeneration was quantified using structural MRI data by calculation of AD signature cortical thickness, consisting of posterior brain regions, including bilateral inferior and middle temporal lobes, entorhinal cortex, and fusiform gyrus, based on automated cortical parcellation using the Desikan-Killiany Atlas with Freesurfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). Higher values in AD signature cortical thickness indicate greater cortical thickness and lower severity in neurodegeneration. The cut-off for abnormal neurodegeneration was &lt;2.77 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jack et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>To determine between-group differences in demographic and clinical information, one-way ANOVA and chi-square tests were used for continuous or categorical variables, respectively.</p><p>To examine the relationship between baseline CSF Ptau and structural stability, we conducted one-tailed independent t-tests between (1) CN Ptau+ and CN Ptau–; (2) MCI Ptau+ and CN Ptau–; and (3) MCI Ptau+ and CN Ptau+.

While the earliest changes in structural connectivity were found within the MTL, and between the MTL and AT system, MTL and MTL-PM stability was related to better average episodic memory and change in episodic memory over five years. The research question of how tau impacts specific structural networks is important to further understand episodic memory impairment in aging and Alzheimer's disease, and the concept of &quot;stability&quot; provides a novel means by which to assess changes in structural integrity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction:</p><p>a) The authors state that hyperphosphorylated tau proteins are &quot;necessary for subsequent Aβ aggregation&quot;. However, the prevailing view in the field is that Aβ aggregation is not dependent on concurrent tau pathology (ex. autosomal dominant AD). Please amend.</p><p>b) The &quot;PM&quot; system is referred to as &quot;posterior-MTL&quot;, but there are no MTL regions in their PM network. It would be helpful to use the terminology &quot;posterior-medial&quot; when referring to &quot;PM&quot;, as well as citing Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012, which first introduced this framework.</p><p>d) In the Introduction the authors state that the &quot;MTL is more strongly connected to the AT than PM systems&quot;, however this is not accurate. In the papers they cite (especially Navarro Schröder, 2015), some regions of the MTL (such as parahippocampal gyrus and posteromedial entorhinal cortex) are more strongly connected to the PM system.</p><p>e) I believe Berron et al., showed mostly reduced MTL-AT functional connectivity in CU Ab+ vs CU Ab- and while there are some reduced connections between the MTL-AT with increased p-tau levels, increasing p-tau levels are much more robustly associated with reduced MTL-PM connectivity in CU Ab+.</p><p>f) Maass et al., report findings on functional task-based activity rather than functional connectivity</p><p>g) In the Introduction, the findings from Schröder et al., and Maass et al., are interpreted as indicating stronger associations between the MTL and the AT system. I believe these two papers report functional subregions in the entorhinal cortex that are differentially connected with two parallel processing streams (in the MTL and the neocortex) and the hippocampus, which means that the MTL is strongly connected with both the AT and PM systems.</p><p>h) The hypotheses in the Introduction could be formulated more clearly. What for example is meant by &quot;tau pathology worsens&quot;? It might be beneficial for the reader to refer to the stereotypical spatial progression pattern of tau accumulation.</p><p>i) In the fourth paragraph of the Introduction it should read, &quot;An emerging study suggests that a functional connectome stability measure is associated with cognition (average and rate of episodic memory decline).&quot;</p><p>Materials and methods and Results:</p><p>a) The rationale for the specific ROIs for MTL, AT, and PM networks is not clear, particularly as some of their selections differ from previous work. For example, the parahippocampal gyrus is a key region of the PM network, yet is placed in the MTL network here. Additionally, including more non-MTL AT regions, such as inferior temporal gyrus, could be beneficial to make the number of AT and PM regions more equivalent (3 regions/36 connections vs. 6 regions/60 connections), as more regions may inherently make the PM network more stable. Please cite appropriate references.</p><p>b) Could the authors include a visualization of the streamlines/connections between bilateral regions in order to understand whether that overlaps mainly with the aforementioned tracts. It would further help if the authors could elaborate in more detail on the underlying structural tracts, where they believe the signal is coming from and show examples of streamlines between MTL regions.</p><p>c) I was curious why the authors did not look at a pure baseline measure of memory performance at the first time point as a cleaner cross-sectional measure. Could the authors elaborate on that?</p><p>d) In the GLM, the authors report that their stability measure was associated with age (Model 2). However, they do not include age as a covariate in all other models. The same is true for other important covariates such as sex and years of education given that they are potentially related to CSF p-Tau and memory performance.</p><p>e) The authors should assess the relationships in models 3-5 while considering the effects of sex, age, and education. For model 5, given that stability is associated with age, how can the authors be sure that the moderating effect is driven by stability and not (also) by age? Regarding model 5, could the authors perform a mediation analysis to specifically test whether there is a significant indirect effect of CSF p-Tau via the stability measure on memory performance and decline while accounting for continuous age, sex, education and amyloid? In this framework the authors could also examine to what extent stability explains the effect of tau on memory (partial vs. full mediation).</p><p>f) &quot;Stability&quot; is interpreted as a positive aspect of structural integrity. However, it is possible that subjects with low MD measures at baseline stayed low at follow-up, and thus were &quot;stable&quot; (highly correlated) but have weak connectivity and low white matter integrity? This could be particularly common in the MTL in the MCI group, as damage from Ptau may have already occurred. Similarly, were there any subjects who had higher MD at follow-up, who were then &quot;unstable&quot; but increasing in connectivity (biologically less likely)? A breakdown of these different groups (high-MD stable, low-MD stable, high-low MD instable, low-high MD instable) and their prevalence in the CN/MCI samples would be informative.</p><p>g) Regarding the relationship between MTL structural stability, Ptau, and memory over 5 years in the whole sample – did you also test whether MTL-AT predicted average episodic memory? According to Figure 4, it appears that you did. Please include this info in the main text.</p><p>h) It would be helpful to have a figure (perhaps in the supplement) that shows the average mean diffusivity (MD) matrices for each group at each time point. This would allow readers to better understand the level of variability and raw values of these connectivity measures.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>a) The finding of a stronger relationship between more Ptau and faster rate of memory decline in those with higher MTL stability (Figure 5) seems to run counter to the other findings where &quot;stability&quot; reflects structural integrity. Could this be explained by the &quot;high stability&quot; group containing both low-low MD and high-high MD subjects, allowing a strong relationship with cognition to emerge? I would like to see some consideration of this point in the Discussion.</p><p>b) In the stability group comparisons results (Figure 2A), the contrast between CN Ptau+ and MCI Ptau+ is currently not performed. From the figure, it appears that there may be a significant difference between those groups only in MTL-PM. This missing result would support their other findings because it would suggest that lower stability in MTL-PM connections might be related to the expression of clinical symptoms. Please amend and discuss accordingly.</p><p>c) While there was no interaction between CSF Aβ or neurodegeneration with Ptau on stability, was there a direct correlation between continuous levels of CSF Aβ or neurodegeneration with stability? If not, it helps support the finding that stability is specifically related to Ptau. Further, how do you interpret the age group interaction between Ptau and stability?</p><p>d) It is not clear why MTL-AT stability would not relate to episodic memory (average and rate of change) but MTL and MTL-PM would?

Please cite appropriate references.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid concern. Numerous studies have shown that medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures including the hippocampus and the surrounding hippocampal region consisting of the parahippocampal and entorhinal neocortical regions, are crucial for long-term memory. In terms of brain anatomy, parahippocampal gyrus receives input mainly from visuospatial association areas and provides major input to the entorhinal cortex, which in turn feeds directly into the hippocampus (Davachi et al., 2003). At the functional level, parahippocampal gyrus plays an important role in episodic memory relating to associative memory, source memory, and recollection (Aminoff et al., 2013). Given the anatomy and function of the parahippocampal gyrus, we consider it to belong to the MTL memory network.</p><p>We further clarified the rationale in the Results: “Since the hippocampus and the surrounding hippocampal region including the parahippocampal cortex and entorhinal cortex, are the primary regions supporting memory processing (Davachi et al., 2003), we consider them to belong to the MTL memory network. Thus, the MTL system includes entorhinal, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus in both hemispheres.”</p><p>We included the bilateral inferior temporal gyrus into the non-MTL AT regions as the reviewer suggested and updated the results. We now added in the method: “In line with previous literature (Berron et a.,l 2020, Ranganath and Ritchey 2012), the AT system includes bilateral inferior temporal, temporal polar, lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex, while the PM system includes bilateral posterior and isthmus cingulate, lateral occipital cortex, precuneus, and thalamus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Could the authors include a visualization of the streamlines/connections between bilateral regions in order to understand whether that overlaps mainly with the aforementioned tracts. It would further help if the authors could elaborate in more detail on the underlying structural tracts, where they believe the signal is coming from and show examples of streamlines between MTL regions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have added the Figure 1B to visualize the streamlines between MTL related regions in a representative participant. We now added in the Results:</p><p>“For visualization purposes, we presented the connections generated between MTL related structures in a representative participant in Figure 1B. The connections within MTL include the hippocampal cingulum bundle and fornix. The connections between MTL and AT largely overlap with the anterior segments of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), while the connections between MTL and PM mainly involve the cingulum bundle and posterior segments of ILF and IFOF.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) I was curious why the authors did not look at a pure baseline measure of memory performance at the first time point as a cleaner cross-sectional measure. Could the authors elaborate on that?</p></disp-quote><p>The stability measure is based on the information from both baseline and 2 year follow up. It’s more clinically meaningful to predict cognition in the future (up to four year follow-up) rather than the baseline collected prior to the stability measure. We now added in the Materials and methods:</p><p>“To assess the association between the longitudinal structural stability, baseline Ptau, and episodic memory, an average episodic memory score is calculated by averaging episodic memory over 5 years.

To keep the paper more focused, we didn’t report these negative findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) &quot;Stability&quot; is interpreted as a positive aspect of structural integrity. However, it is possible that subjects with low MD measures at baseline stayed low at follow-up, and thus were &quot;stable&quot; (highly correlated) but have weak connectivity and low white matter integrity? This could be particularly common in the MTL in the MCI group, as damage from Ptau may have already occurred. Similarly, were there any subjects who had higher MD at follow-up, who were then &quot;unstable&quot; but increasing in connectivity (biologically less likely)? A breakdown of these different groups (high-MD stable, low-MD stable, high-low MD instable, low-high MD instable) and their prevalence in the CN/MCI samples would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we want to clarify that the stability is a similarity measure, which reflects information in the patterns of MD across multiple connections, rather than only changes in mean MD. We agree with the reviewer that it’s possible that some subjects with low average MD at baseline and follow-up could show relatively high stability, while other could show low stability if their MD patterns changed across specific connections. We also want to clarify that, while it is possible that a loss of integrity causes poor stability due to an overall reduction in connections caused by pathology, it is also possible that pathology in certain connections could cause them to decrease connectivity, while other connections show corresponding increases as a result. Stability as a similarity measure is ambiguous to the mechanism by which pathology causes connections to change, but we believe that change in the overall pattern of connectivity in itself is meaningful.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we averaged the MD measures across all connections within MTL to get a mean MD score for MTL network. Then we used the median as a cutoff to dichotomize the mean MD score to “high” and “low”. Similarly, we dichotomized stability as “stable” vs. “instable”. The Table 2 in the manuscript displays the prevalence in the CN/MCI samples.</p><p>As we can see from Table 2, the prevalence of low-low stable individuals is actually not common in the MCI group (13.3%). In the Materials and methods, we now added:</p><p>“The traditional univariate analysis only considers the overall magnitude of the network (e.g., the average MD across all connections within MTL network). […] Thus, the traditional univariate analysis may not be as sensitive as the stability measure in detecting these subtle structural changes in the predementia AD stage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) Regarding the relationship between MTL structural stability, Ptau, and memory over 5 years in the whole sample – did you also test whether MTL-AT predicted average episodic memory?

As can be seen in Table 2, the stable group contains 12 high-high MD and 15 low-low MD subjects, while the instable group contains 12 high-high MD and 9 low-low MD subjects. As described above, since stability is calculated using all connections, rather than mean MD, instability is not restricted to high-low or low-high MD subjects. We now added in the Discussion:</p><p>“It is possible that the observation of a stronger relationship between more Ptau and faster rate of memory decline in those with higher MTL stability might be driven by greater variance in this group, caused by the inclusion of both stable individuals with overall low connectivity as well as consistently high connectivity. To assess this, we looked at the number of spread of individuals across these groups based on their mean structural connectivity (Table 2). The stable group contains 12 high-high MD and 15 low-low MD subjects, while the instable group contains 12 high-high MD and 9 low-low MD subjects. While there are more low-low subjects in the stable group, the ratio of low-low to high-high is similar across these groups, suggesting increased variance is unlikely to drive the strong relationship with cognition in the high stability group.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In the stability group comparisons results (Figure 2A), the contrast between CN Ptau+ and MCI Ptau+ is currently not performed. From the figure, it appears that there may be a significant difference between those groups only in MTL-PM.

We have conducted the contrast between CN Ptau+ and MCI Ptau+ and updated the results and discussion accordingly.</p><p>In the Results, we modified the sentences: “In line with our hypothesis that MTL and MTL-AT stability is affected by Ptau early in the predementia AD stage, compared to CN Ptau-, structural stability was significantly lower in CN Ptau+ in MTL (t(42)=-2.11, p = 0.022) and MTL-AT (t(42)=-2.57, p = 0.007). Decreased structural stability was further found in MTL (t(54)=-2.61, p = 0.006) and MTL-AT (t(54)=-3.55, p &lt; 0.001) in MCI Ptau+, compared to CN Ptau-. In line with our hypothesis that MTL-PM is affected later in disease progression, we found a significantly lower stability in MTL-PM in MCI Ptau+, compared to CN Ptau+ (t(46)=-5.12, p &lt; 0.001) and CN Ptau- (t(54)=-3.89, p &lt; 0.001, Figure 2A).”</p><p>In Discussion, we modified the sentence: “CN Ptau+ and MCI Ptau+ had decreased stability in MTL and MTL-AT compared to CN Ptau-, while MCI Ptau+ further showed decrease in MTL-PM stability relative to both CN Ptau- and CN Ptau-+ groups, suggesting that Ptau relates to structural stability in a temporal pattern that matches its proposed spread from the MTL via neuronal connections”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) While there was no interaction between CSF Aβ or neurodegeneration with Ptau on stability, was there a direct correlation between continuous levels of CSF Aβ or neurodegeneration with stability? If not, it helps support the finding that stability is specifically related to Ptau. Further, how do you interpret the age group interaction between Ptau and stability?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now examined the direct correlation between continuous levels of age, CSF Aβ or neurodegeneration with stability in model 2 and updated the result in the main text and Figure 3.
