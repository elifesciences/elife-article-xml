gene <italic>KCNT1</italic> in patients with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), most of which are resistant to current therapies. Defining the neuron types most vulnerable to KCNT1 GOF will advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide refined targets for precision therapy efforts. Here, we assessed the effects of heterozygous expression of a <italic>Kcnt1</italic> GOF variant (<italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup>) on K<sub>Na</sub> currents and neuronal physiology among cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in mice, including those expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV), to identify and model the pathogenic mechanisms of autosomal dominant <italic>KCNT1</italic> GOF variants in DEEs. Although the <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> variant had no effects on glutamatergic or VIP neuron function, it increased subthreshold K<sub>Na</sub> currents in both SST and PV neurons but with opposite effects on neuronal output; SST neurons became hypoexcitable with a higher rheobase current and lower action potential (AP) firing frequency, whereas PV neurons became hyperexcitable with a lower rheobase current and higher AP firing frequency. Further neurophysiological and computational modeling experiments showed that the differential effects of the <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> variant on SST and PV neurons are not likely due to inherent differences in these neuron types, but to an increased persistent sodium current in PV, but not SST, neurons. The <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> variant also increased excitatory input onto, and chemical and electrical synaptic connectivity between, SST neurons. Together, these data suggest differential pathogenic mechanisms, both direct and compensatory, contribute to disease phenotypes, and provide a salient example of how a pathogenic ion channel variant can cause opposite functional effects in closely related neuron subtypes due to interactions with other ionic conductances.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KCNT1</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>action potential</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH/NINDS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS130042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weston</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH/NINDS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS031348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frankel</surname><given-names>Wayne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH/NINDS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33NS109521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weaver</surname><given-names>C David</given-names></name><name><surname>Emmitte</surname><given-names>Kyle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH/NINDS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54OD020351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frankel</surname><given-names>Wayne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH/NINDS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS110945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weston</surname><given-names>Matthew C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An epilepsy-associated potassium channel variant causes neuron-type-dependent alterations in ionic currents, neuronal excitability, and network connectivity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heterozygous missense variants have been identified in the sodium-gated potassium channel gene <italic>KCNT1</italic> in more than 200 individuals exhibiting a wide spectrum of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), with the majority being classified as either epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures or autosomal dominant or sporadic sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonardi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heron et al., 2012</xref>). Each of these epilepsy syndromes result in early-onset, frequent seizures that are largely pharmacoresistant and often accompanied by a range of cognitive, psychiatric, and motor impairments. Thus, there is a critical need for a better understanding of how heterozygous expression of these <italic>KCNT1</italic> variants in the developing brain alters neuronal physiology and network behavior to lead to such devastating neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p><italic>KCNT1</italic> encodes a tetrameric potassium channel that is widely expressed in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons of the brain, particularly those of the cerebellum, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharjee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gertler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rizzi et al., 2016</xref>). Although its precise role in normal physiology is not well understood, at least in some neuronal types, KCNT1 is activated by a persistent inward sodium leak (Na<sub>P</sub>) current at rest, where it has a proposed role in fine tuning neuronal excitability by countering the effects of the Na<sub>P</sub> current across subthreshold voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budelli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hage and Salkoff, 2012</xref>). Consistent with this role, loss-of-function (LOF) studies using mouse models lacking KCNT1, and the associated sodium-activated potassium (K<sub>Na</sub>) current, have shown enhanced action potential (AP) firing across multiple neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evely et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez-Espinosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reijntjes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Characterizations of pathogenic DEE-associated <italic>KCNT1</italic> variants in heterologous cells found that nearly all cause gain-of-function (GOF) effects on the channel, increasing the associated K<sub>Na</sub> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hinckley et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McTague et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milligan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Based on LOF studies, this would be expected to reduce neuronal excitability; however, it is difficult to predict the effects of these GOF variants on AP generation in neurons, particularly among neuronal subtypes, a priori.</p><p>To address this knowledge gap, we previously generated and characterized a mouse model expressing a human ADNFLE-associated <italic>KCNT1</italic> GOF variant (Y796H or Y777H in mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shore et al., 2020</xref>). Although heterozygous expression of the <italic>KCNT1</italic>-Y796H variant is sufficient to cause severe childhood epilepsy in humans, we only observed rare behavioral seizures in heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> mice see Discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shore et al., 2020</xref>); however, we identified hyperexcitable, hypersynchronous cortical networks and frequent, early-onset seizures in homozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> mice. As a potential underlying mechanism of these network alterations, we demonstrated that homozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression increases subthreshold K<sub>Na</sub> currents and reduces excitability in GABAergic neuron populations, particularly in those classified as non-fast spiking (NFS), but it does not alter glutamatergic neuron excitability. We further observed evidence of homeostatic compensation and network remodeling downstream of K<sub>Na</sub> current increases during development, including increased excitatory input onto glutamatergic and NFS GABAergic neurons, and enhanced homotypic synaptic connectivity. Although these findings provide a strong mechanistic basis for understanding how KCNT1 GOF disrupts neuronal physiology and network behavior to lead to seizure disorders, key issues remain unresolved. First, considering the heterozygous nature of <italic>KCNT1</italic> GOF variants in the overwhelming majority of <italic>KCNT1</italic>-related DEE patients, it is crucial to determine whether heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression results in similar neuronal impairments and network alterations to those with homozygous expression. Second, more recent studies, using both in silico modeling and additional construct-valid mouse models, have similarly identified impairments in GABAergic neuron excitability downstream of KCNT1 GOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gertler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuchenbuch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2024</xref>), indicating impaired inhibition as a shared pathogenic mechanism in <italic>KCNT1</italic>-related DEEs; however, precisely which GABAergic subtypes are most impacted, and how, remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we assessed the effects of heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression on K<sub>Na</sub> currents and neuronal physiology among cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, including those expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV). Initial assessments of cortical neuron populations with heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression showed strikingly similar effects on K<sub>Na</sub> currents and AP generation to those with homozygous expression, although not surprisingly, these effects were lesser in magnitude. Across all cortical neuron types examined, the heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> variant caused a range of effects on neuronal excitability and AP generation, from no change (glutamatergic and VIP GABAergic) to decreased excitability (SST GABAergic) to increased excitability (PV GABAergic). Neuron types that showed no change had K<sub>Na</sub> currents that were only significantly increased at suprathreshold voltages and exhibited a steeper voltage dependence of activation. Interestingly, both SST and PV neurons showed similar increases in K<sub>Na</sub> currents across subthreshold voltages, however, only PV neurons had additional increases in the persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, which modeling experiments indicated was sufficient to overcome the effects of KCNT1 GOF and cause an overall increase in AP generation. SST neurons also showed an increase in excitatory input, and in homotypic electrical and chemical coupling. Taken together, these data provide further evidence of the enhanced vulnerability of GABAergic neurons, particularly those expressing SST and PV, to KCNT1 GOF. Moreover, these data show that heterozygous expression of a single <italic>KCNT1</italic> GOF variant can result in a complex array of neuron-type-dependent effects, both direct and indirect, each potential contributor to the neural circuit pathology underlying <italic>KCNT1</italic>-related DEEs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression alters the shape and frequency of APs in NFS GABAergic neurons</title><p>We previously identified frequent, early-onset seizures in mice with homozygous expression of the <italic>Kcnt1</italic> GOF variant Y777H (hereafter referred to as YH-HOM), and as a potential underlying pathological mechanism, we demonstrated that homozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression drastically impairs AP shape and generation in NFS GABAergic cortical neurons, with lesser effects on fast spiking (FS) GABAergic, and no significant effects on glutamatergic, cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shore et al., 2020</xref>). Considering that patients with <italic>KCNT1</italic>-associated epilepsy are predominantly heterozygous for <italic>KCNT1</italic> GOF variants, it is crucial to determine whether heterozygous expression of these variants, which likely leads to the formation of heteromeric channels consisting of wildtype (WT) and mutant subunits, results in similar neuronal impairments. To assess neuron subtype-specific effects of heterozygous <italic>KCNT1</italic> GOF on membrane properties and AP firing, we isolated and cultured cortical neurons from pups with heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression (hereafter referred to as YH-HET), and their WT littermates, at postnatal day 0 (P0). After infecting the cultured neurons with AAV-<italic>CaMKIIa</italic>-GFP to facilitate glutamatergic neuron identification, we performed whole-cell, current-clamp analysis between 13 and 17 days in vitro (DIV). Moreover, to compare to homozygous KCNT1 GOF effects observed previously, the recorded neurons were classified as glutamatergic, FS GABAergic, or NFS GABAergic, based on GFP expression, AP parameters, and evoked synaptic responses (see Methods).</p><p>Current-clamp recordings from YH-HET and WT glutamatergic neurons showed no significant differences in any membrane or AP shape property measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A<sub>1</sub></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), similar to observations from the homozygous KCNT1 GOF studies. Accordingly, AP firing frequencies across increasing current steps in YH-HET glutamatergic neurons were not altered compared with those of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B<sub>1</sub></xref>). For FS GABAergic neurons, we previously showed that homozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression increases the rheobase—the minimal amount of current necessary to induce an AP—and reduces the AP firing frequency. Heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression did not alter the rheobase, or any other passive or active membrane property of FS GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A<sub>2</sub></xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although YH-HET FS GABAergic neurons appeared to fire fewer APs than their WT counterparts, particularly at higher current steps, this effect was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B<sub>2</sub></xref>). Lastly, we previously showed that homozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression has the strongest effects in NFS GABAergic neurons, showing a decrease in input resistance, accompanied by an increase in rheobase and a reduction in AP firing frequency. YH-HOM NFS GABAergic neurons also have narrower AP half-widths and larger afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) than those of WT. Although heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression in NFS GABAergic neurons did not cause a significant decrease in input resistance (WT: 171 ± 16; YH-HET: 146 ± 14, p = 0.19), it did increase the rheobase and reduce the AP firing frequency, particularly at lower current steps, relative to those of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>3</sub></xref>). YH-HET NFS GABAergic neurons also had narrower APs, larger AHPs, and more depolarized AP thresholds than those of WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Importantly, in each of these neuron subtypes, heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> expression increased K<sub>Na</sub> currents with distinct, voltage-dependent patterns that appeared strikingly similar to those reported with homozygous expression. For instance, we previously showed that, across negative potentials, YH-HOM and WT glutamatergic neuron K<sub>Na</sub> currents are indistinguishable, whereas at more positive potentials (&gt;+30 mV), the <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> variant causes significant increases in K<sub>Na</sub> currents.

First, to determine whether there are similar changes in synaptic connectivity in YH-HET networks, we performed paired recordings of glutamatergic (excitatory, E) and GABAergic (inhibitory, I) neurons and alternatively stimulated each neuron at 0.1 Hz to test baseline connection probability and strength at the four possible motifs (E–E, I–E, E–I, and I–I). Connection probability was not altered in YH-HET networks at any of the motifs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, left bar graphs), and the amplitudes of the evoked postsynaptic currents (ePSCs) between connected neurons were not different between genotypes for any of the four connection types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, right bar graphs), indicating grossly normal synaptic interactions among glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in YH-HET networks. Next, to assess potential alterations in synaptic activity, we recorded spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and sIPSCs) onto voltage-clamped glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. Unlike the observation of an increase in sEPSC frequency onto YH-HOM glutamatergic neurons, there was no difference in sEPSC, or sIPSC, frequency onto YH-HET glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B<sub>1</sub></xref>). Furthermore, although we previously found no alterations in sPSC frequency onto YH-HOM GABAergic neurons, sEPSC and sIPSC frequencies were both slightly reduced onto YH-HET GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B<sub>2</sub></xref>). Finally, to assess the net effect of altered sPSC activity onto YH-HET neurons, we calculated the E/I ratio, based on the relative frequency and size of the sPSCs, and found no difference in the E/I ratio onto either YH-HET neuron type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B<sub>3</sub></xref>).

About 80–90% of cortical GABAergic neurons fall into three, largely non-overlapping populations that can be identified by their expression of unique markers: the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein PV (~40%), the neuropeptides SST (~30%), and VIP (~15%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). The majority of PV-expressing neurons have been characterized as FS, and VIP-expressing as NFS, whereas SST-expressing neurons, although largely thought to show NFS firing properties, also contain a population that exhibits an FS-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Large et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>KCNT1</italic> is expressed at higher levels in both human and mouse cortical GABAergic neurons expressing PV and SST, than in those expressing VIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gertler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shore et al., 2020</xref>).

YH-HET SST neurons also showed a reduction in the membrane time constant and an increase in membrane capacitance, which was accompanied by an increase in soma size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), compared with those of WT SST neurons.

As expected, based on their hypoexcitable membrane properties, the YH-HET SST neurons fired fewer APs across all current steps relative to WT SST neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C<sub>2</sub></xref>). In contrast to SST neurons, but consistent with their decreased rheobase current, YH-HET PV neurons fired more APs across all current steps relative to their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C<sub>3</sub></xref>).

Together, these data showed that, as hypothesized, KCNT1 GOF indeed strongly reduces the excitability of SST neurons, but unexpectedly, it also causes a hyperexcitable effect in PV neurons; thus, the same ion channel mutation can lead to opposite effects on excitability in the two largest GABAergic neuron subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> variant increases KCNT1-mediated currents across subthreshold voltages in SST- and PV-expressing GABAergic neurons</title><p>Are the observed differential effects of KCNT1 GOF on GABAergic neuronal physiology due to distinct patterns of K<sub>Na</sub> current increases among GABAergic neuron subtypes? To answer this question, we first recorded K<sub>Na</sub> currents from GABAergic neurons cultured and labeled as described above, by applying voltage steps to voltage-clamped neurons and comparing the delayed outward current before and after the addition of TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A<sub>1–3</sub></xref>).

In past studies, the lack of selective KCNT1-specific inhibitors necessitated the use of indirect methods, such as TTX application or Na<sup>+</sup> replacement, to estimate the magnitude of K<sub>Na</sub>. However, more recently, we identified and validated a small-molecule, selective KCNT1 channel inhibitor termed VU0606170 or VU170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spitznagel et al., 2020</xref>). To further validate the specificity of this small molecule, we applied voltage steps to voltage-clamped neurons lacking KCNT1 and KCNT2 channels, isolated and cultured from <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>; <italic>Kcnt2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> double knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez-Espinosa et al., 2015</xref>), and we compared the delayed outward current before and after the addition of either 10 µM VU170 or 0.5 µM TTX. This analysis indicated a non-specific outward VU-sensitive current that started around −10 mV and peaked at +50 mV (~1 nA peak current compared with ~3 nA in WT neurons), which was not present using TTX subtraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Across negative potentials, there was an inward TTX-sensitive current, which again is likely due to the persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, whereas there was little to no outward VU-sensitive current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), validating the utility of VU170 in isolating K<sub>Na</sub> currents across this voltage range.</p><p>To better assess KCNT1-mediated currents in GABAergic subpopulations and disentangle potential confounds of using TTX, particularly across negative potentials, we applied the same voltage step protocol as in the TTX subtraction experiments but applied 10 µM VU170 instead. In all three WT GABAergic neuron subtypes, subtraction of the VU170 trace from the control trace revealed nA-sized outward currents at depolarized potentials, and in YH-HET neurons, the overall VU170-sensitive current was increased relative to those of WT, as measured by a significant effect of genotype using a linear model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A<sub>1–3</sub>, B<sub>1–3</sub></xref>). Pairwise comparisons at each voltage step showed voltage-dependent differences in current increases among the YH-HET neuron subtypes. For YH-HET VIP neurons, a significant increase in the VU170 current was only observed at +50 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B<sub>1</sub></xref>), whereas subthreshold currents were indistinguishable from those of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C<sub>1</sub></xref>). Previously, we similarly observed K<sub>Na</sub> current increases only at more positive potentials in YH-HOM glutamatergic neurons, and like YH-HET VIP neurons, their membrane and AP properties were unaltered by expression of the YH variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shore et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, in YH-HET SST neurons, significant increases occurred at more negative voltage steps, from −60 to −30 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C<sub>2</sub></xref>). These changes were similar to those observed with TTX treatment, but slightly larger, possibly due to the lack of the counteracting effect of the persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, which is also blocked by TTX. In contrast to the TTX results, YH-HET PV neurons showed an increase in VU170-sensitive currents, with significant increases from −70 to −50 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C<sub>3</sub></xref>). Taken together, these data identify distinct patterns of K<sub>Na</sub> current increases among GABAergic subtypes, and for VIP and SST neurons, these current increases are consistent with the observed effects of KCNT1 GOF on neuronal physiology. On the other hand, PV neurons showed subthreshold-specific K<sub>Na</sub> current increases that were highly similar to, and overlapping with, those of SST neurons; thus, differential K<sub>Na</sub> current increases alone likely do not account for the opposite effects of KCNT1 GOF on physiology observed in these two neuron types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>Y777H</sup> variant increases KCNT1-mediated currents across subthreshold voltages in somatostatin (SST)- and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A<sub>1</sub>–A<sub>3</sub></bold>) Representative traces in control (top), 10 µM VU170 (middle), and the difference current (bottom) calculated by subtracting the membrane current response to voltage steps (−80 to +50 mV) from a holding potential of −70 mV in VU170 from the response in control external solution in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-, SST-, and PV-expressing, wildtype (WT) (black) and YH-HET (colors) neurons.

Because GABAergic subtypes exhibit varying morphologies and express unique repertoires of ion channels, which are known to give rise to their characteristic membrane and AP firing properties, we hypothesized that at least some of the observed differential effects of KCNT1 GOF, in particular the opposite effects in SST and PV neurons, are due to these inherent, neuron-type-dependent differences. To test this hypothesis, we simulated the effect of KCNT1 GOF in compartmental models of these three cortical neuron types. We used a KCNT1 conductance with the Na<sup>+</sup> dependence constrained by prior studies in neurons (EC<sub>50</sub> = 40 mM, slope 3.5; see Materials and methods) and the voltage dependence based on the activation curves from our own experimental data of the VU170-sensitive current in each subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

At the network and whole-animal level, we previously showed that homozygous expression of the YH variant in mice increases homotypic synaptic connectivity (E–E and I–I) and the E/I ratio, resulting in hypersynchronous, hyperexcitable YH-HOM cortical networks and frequent seizures.

With this goal in mind, we assessed the effects of heterozygous <italic>Kcnt1</italic> GOF on K<sub>Na</sub> currents and AP generation among cortical glutamatergic neurons and all three major GABAergic neuron subtypes, including those expressing VIP, SST, and PV.</p><p>Using two methods to isolate and measure the KCNT1-mediated current, VU170 and TTX subtraction, we observed voltage-dependent differences in current increases among the YH-HET neuron types. YH-HET glutamatergic and VIP neurons showed KCNT1-mediated current increases across suprathreshold voltages, whereas YH-HET SST and PV neurons had current increases across subthreshold voltages. These neuron-type-dependent effects of KCNT1 GOF on K<sub>Na</sub> current increases are similar to those observed previously in YH-HOM, glutamatergic and GABAergic neuron subpopulations using TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shore et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, these results are similar to those reported in a recent study using a different KCNT1 GOF mouse model (human R474H, mouse R455H), which showed K<sub>Na</sub> current increases selectively across positive potentials in glutamatergic, but across positive and negative potentials in FS and NFS GABAergic, neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2024</xref>). The mechanism underlying these neuron-type-dependent KCNT1 GOF effects on K<sub>Na</sub> current increases is unknown, however, we have observed differences even in WT KCNT1 channel activation curves between glutamatergic and VIP neurons (steeper slopes of activation) and SST and PV neurons (shallower slopes of activation), suggesting there are factors affecting KCNT1 channel kinetics that are inherent to each neuron type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Future studies should investigate these potential factors including (1) differential expression of alternative KCNT1 splice forms, some of which are known to have different activation kinetics, (2) differential expression of other channels such as KCNT2, which can form heteromers with KCNT1 and alter its biophysical properties, and (3) differential expression and/or localization of, and/or coupling to, sodium channels that act as the source of KCNT1 channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hage and Salkoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joiner et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the differential KCNT1 GOF effects on K<sub>Na</sub> currents, we observed a range of effects on membrane properties and AP generation among the cortical neuron populations. We observed no effects on YH-HET glutamatergic and VIP neurons, whereas YH-HET SST neurons showed reduced AP firing, with decreased input resistance and increased rheobase, and YH-HET PV neurons showed increased AP firing, with decreased rheobase. As a complementary approach, we performed in silico electrophysiology using our measured neuron-type-specific KCNT1 channel activation kinetics, with and without GOF, for each neuron type. For glutamatergic and VIP neurons, the steeper slopes of activation limited the effects of GOF on intrinsic excitability, whereas for SST neurons, the shallower slope of activation decreased the input resistance, increased the rheobase, and impaired AP generation downstream of KCNT1 GOF. Each of these modeling results are similar to those observed using in vitro electrophysiology, indicating direct K<sub>Na</sub> current-to-KCNT1 GOF phenotype relationships in these neuron types.</p><p>Conversely, for PV neurons, unlike the experimental observation of increased YH-HET PV neuron excitability, in silico electrophysiology predicted a slight reduction in PV neuron excitability downstream of KCNT1 GOF. In support of this in silico prediction, in a different KCNT1 GOF mouse model, heterozygous expression of the human L456F variant indeed reduced AP firing of PV neurons, without altering any other membrane properties or AP parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gertler et al., 2022</xref>). The opposite effect of KCNT1 GOF on PV excitability between these two studies may simply result from variant-specific alterations in KCNT1 channel kinetics; however, both GOF variants showed a similar lack of effect on membrane properties and AP generation of glutamatergic neurons. Alternatively, the opposite effects could be due to the different experimental conditions used in the two studies, including (1) different preps and mouse ages (acute slices from P42 to P60 mice vs. DIV 13 to 17 cultured neurons from P0 pups) and (2) different brain regions (hippocampal vs. cortical). The idea of brain region-dependent effects of ion channel variants is not unprecedented, as a recent study showed that a potassium channel GOF variant causes opposite effects on excitability in the same neuron type from different brain regions (hippocampal CA1 vs. cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons), and this opposite effect was suggested to be due to the compensatory upregulation of sodium channels in one neuron type but not the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Varghese et al., 2023</xref>). Taken together, these findings illustrate the importance of interrogating not only multiple neuron types but also multiple brain regions to fully unravel the complexity underlying KCNT1 GOF-related neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Evidence of potential neuron and network compensatory responses to KCNT1 GOF</title><p>In a healthy brain, there are multiple homeostatic compensation mechanisms to maintain neuronal and network activity at their proper physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debanne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Debanne and Russier, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turrigiano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang and Prescott, 2023</xref>), whereas in a brain with epilepsy-causing genetic mutations or injury, it is thought that failure of homeostatic compensation can result in hypersynchronous, hyperexcitable networks and, ultimately, seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Issa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lignani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Staley, 2015</xref>). As YH-HET mice have only been observed to have infrequent seizures and YH-HET networks appear largely intact, it is plausible that there are adaptive or homeostatic mechanisms downstream of the YH variant that limit KCNT1 GOF effects largely to those observed at the current and neuron level. These regulatory mechanisms may include alterations in ion currents and/or synaptic input to restore proper AP shape or neuronal excitability, or alterations in chemical and/or electrical connectivity to stabilize neural networks.</p><p>Neuronal excitability is regulated by the inward and outward flow of opposing currents through sodium and potassium channels; thus, it is not surprising that mutations affecting these channels can lead to compensatory up- or downregulation of other ion channels or currents to maintain excitability and proper neuron function. In this study, our in silico electrophysiology predictions of YH-HET PV neuron excitability were opposite to those of our in vitro electrophysiology data; thus, we hypothesized that there may be a compensatory increase in an ion current that counteracts the increased K<sub>Na</sub> current selectively in YH-HET PV neurons. Accordingly, we identified a subthreshold increase in the persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, across a similar voltage range to the increased K<sub>Na</sub> current, in YH-HET PV, but not SST, neurons. Furthermore, in silico approaches indicated that this increased <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> was sufficient to overcome the effects of KCNT1 GOF and cause an overall increase in AP generation in YH-HET PV neurons, which aligned with our experimental data. Similar compensatory mechanisms have been identified in other models such as the downregulation of multiple potassium channels in a sodium channel (<italic>Scn2a</italic>) LOF mouse model of epilepsy, resulting in neuronal hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), or the upregulation of Na<sup>+</sup> currents in response to increased potassium channel activity in a developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> neural circuit, resulting in restored intrinsic excitability and network stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pratt and Aizenman, 2007</xref>). Notably, another KCNT1 GOF model (<italic>Kcnt1</italic>-R455H) showed upregulation of a sodium channel (Na<sub>v</sub>1.6), accompanied by an increase in transient and persistent sodium currents, in <italic>Kcnt1</italic>-R455H cortical neurons, but the effects of Nav1.6 upregulation were not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>As the persistent sodium current has been shown to act as a source of cytoplasmic sodium ions for KCNT1 channel activation in some neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hage and Salkoff, 2012</xref>), one might expect that the compensatory increase in <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> in YH-HET PV neurons would further increase, rather than counteract, K<sub>Na</sub> currents. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information on the relative locations of the <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> and KCNT1 channels, as well as the kinetics of sodium transfer to KCNT1 channels, among cortical neuron subtypes, and even less is known in the context of KCNT1 GOF neurons; thus, it is difficult to predict how alterations in one of these currents may affect the other. One plausible reason that increased <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> would not alter K<sub>Na</sub> currents in YH-HET PV neurons is that the particular sodium channels that are responsible for the increased <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> are not located within close proximity to the KCNT1 channels. Moreover, homeostatic mechanisms that modify the length and/or location of the sodium channel-enriched axon initial segment (AIS) in neurons in response to altered excitability are well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuba et al., 2010</xref>); thus, it is possible that in YH-HET PV neurons, the length or location of the AIS is altered, leading to uncoupling of the sodium channels that are responsible for the increased <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> to the KCNT1 channels. Future studies will aim to further investigate potential mechanisms of neuron-type-specific alterations in Na<sub>P</sub> and K<sub>Na</sub> currents downstream of KCNT1 GOF.</p><p>In addition to the KCNT1 GOF current-mediated impairments in SST neuron excitability, we identified several potential compensatory YH-HET SST synaptic and network alterations. For instance, there was an increased frequency of sEPSCs onto YH-HET SST neurons, suggestive of a compensatory increase in excitatory input to counteract their reduced intrinsic excitability and increase their AP firing, as has been observed previously in hypoexcitable SST neurons in another epilepsy model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halabisky et al., 2010</xref>). There was also an increase in chemical and electrical coupling between YH-HET SST neurons. Although SST neurons normally show a relatively low rate of homotypic chemical coupling, particularly in the adult cortex, more than half of nearby SST neuron pairs are coupled electrically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amitai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu and Agmon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016</xref>). This coupling is thought to be important for fine tuning neural circuits by regulating such processes as synchronous AP firing, synaptic integration, and network rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcamí and Pereda, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connors, 2017</xref>). The observed increase in electrical coupling should not only contribute to the reduced intrinsic excitability properties of individual YH-HET SST neurons, increasing their capacitance and decreasing their input resistance, but may also act as a homeostatic mechanism to restore synchronicity and stability to YH-HET SST networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lane et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parker et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, how might the YH-HET variant-induced alterations to SST and PV neurons, both direct and adaptive, ultimately contribute to neural network behavior and seizure propensity in YH-HET mice? The paucity of effects on synaptic activity and connectivity in YH-HET networks, relative to those of YH-HOM, suggests that the current- and neuron-level effects of the YH-HET variant are below some threshold required to induce broader network hyperexcitability and seizures. Moreover, as described above, several of the proposed homeostatic mechanisms, such as increased excitatory input onto, and connectivity between, SST neurons and increased <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> in PV neurons, should theoretically act to suppress pathological network activity in YH HET mice. However, predicting the downstream effects of altered SST and PV intrinsic excitability is not straightforward, particularly with the emerging appreciation of both anti- and pro-epileptic roles for these neuron types in seizure initiation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dudok et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magloire et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, studies using genetic mouse models of DEEs have identified seemingly paradoxical, and sometimes ephemeral, roles of interneurons in disease progression. For instance, in an <italic>SCN8A</italic> GOF DEE mouse model, increased <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> causes initial SST hyperexcitability followed by depolarization block, and in parallel, chemogenetic activation of WT SST neurons mimics these effects, leading to seizure generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wengert et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, in a <italic>KCNQ2/3</italic> LOF DEE model, PV-specific <italic>Kcnq2/3</italic> deletion causes early PV hyperexcitability that is thought to increase seizure susceptibility via homeostatic potentiation of excitatory transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soh et al., 2018</xref>). Lastly, in an <italic>Scn1a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mouse model of Dravet syndrome, PV neurons are transiently hypoexcitable during development, whereas later they show an increased firing rate, both interictally and at seizure onset, and a decrease in synchrony in the transition to seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Favero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tran et al., 2020</xref>). These studies illustrate the challenges in connecting altered interneuron intrinsic excitability with network behavioral outcomes not only because of the contradictory nature of some of these connections but also because of the often transient nature of interneuron phenotypes during disease progression. Thus, future studies should aim to assess neuron-type-specific effects of the YH variant at different developmental time points in both YH-HET mice, with rare seizures, and YH-HOM mice, with frequent seizures, to better understand the contributions of interneuron dysfunction to network pathology and seizure generation in KCNT1 GOF-related epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations and conclusions</title><p>The in vitro and in silico nature of this study are limitations. Although the cultured VIP, SST, and PV neurons showed characteristic electrophysiological properties, it is unknown how much overlap there is between the in vitro and in vivo populations. For instance, it is possible that our culture conditions select for more mature neurons of each type or preferentially support the survival of subpopulations; thus, we may be assessing KCNT1 GOF effects on a small portion of a given subtype. However, an advantage of the in vitro prep is that the compensatory alterations we observe are not likely consequences of seizure activity, which has been shown to alter interneuron properties in epilepsy models. Furthermore, the in silico neurons we used to model each neuron type were designed to accurately reflect the morphological and electrophysiological properties of each subtype, but they may lack more detailed features of ion channels, such as post-translational modifications and subcellular localizations, that can have important functional effects. Our KCNT1 model conductance is also hampered by an incomplete understanding of the relationship between Na<sup>+</sup> influx, membrane voltage, and channel gating in neurons.</p><p>Moreover, our K<sup>+</sup> current measures using <italic>Kcnt1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>; <italic>Kcnt2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> double knockout neurons clearly showed the presence of an outward VU170-sensitive current across positive potentials, indicating non-specific activity of this small molecule, potentially to the ERG K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spitznagel et al., 2020</xref>). This off-target effect of VU170 may contribute to the overall increase in outward K<sup>+</sup> currents seen in our VU170- vs. TTX-subtracted currents in all neuron types across positive potentials, and it limits the interpretation of the VU170-sensitive K<sub>Na</sub> current data within this range. Finally, although it is well known that temperature changes can alter neuron physiology, the electrophysiological recordings in this study were performed at room temperature rather than physiological temperature. In this study, we further assessed the effect of temperature (22 vs. 35°C) on rheobase, AP amplitude, and maximal AP firing frequency among WT and YH-HET PV neurons and showed that both groups responded similarly. Previously, we also showed that the effects of the homozygous YH variant on glutamatergic and NFS GABAergic neuron excitability were highly similar between cultured recordings at room temperature (~22°C) and slice recordings at 32°C. Taken together, these data suggest that the reported neurophysiological phenotypes downstream of the YH variant are likely not temperature dependent.</p><p>Despite the potential limitations, this study provides three major findings that advance our understanding of the relationship between ion channel function and disease. First, heterozygous <italic>KCNT1</italic> expression causes changes in current flow and neuron excitability that are qualitatively similar to homozygous expression, but of a lower magnitude; however, the synaptic activity and connectivity changes are different, which likely leads to the discrepancy in seizure incidence. This finding suggests a non-linear relationship between GOF, at the level of the ion channel current, and disease severity. Second, the same <italic>KCNT1</italic> variant can produce opposite effects on neuron excitability in closely related GABAergic neuron subtypes, and these opposite effects are likely due to compensation in one neuron type (PV) that is absent in the other (SST). Previous studies have observed opposite effects on neuronal excitability due to Na<sup>+</sup> channel variants, but the underlying mechanism, when explored, was proposed to be intrinsic differences in ion channel expression, not compensation. Third, we observed increased synaptic and gap junction connectivity among SST neurons, demonstrating that the effects of KCNT1 GOF extend to structural alterations as well. The effects of this increased connectivity, especially by gap junctions, on neuronal excitability and network behavior offers an exciting avenue for future research. Finally, it will be critical to determine whether these alterations downstream of KCNT1 GOF potentiate or attenuate network pathology and seizure activity, thus providing a better understanding of disease mechanisms and prompting novel therapeutic design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

For experiments to assess KCNT1 effects on GABAergic subtypes, approximately 4 × 10<sup>10</sup> GC of AAV9-<italic>hSyn</italic>-DIO-mCherry (Addgene) were also added to each well to mark Cre-expressing neurons. Every 3–4 days, 20–40% of the media was replaced with fresh NBA plus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Whole-cell recordings were performed with patch-clamp amplifiers (MultiClamp 700B; Molecular Devices) under the control of Clampex 10.3 or 10.5 (Molecular Devices, pClamp, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link>). Data were acquired at 20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 6 kHz. The series resistance was compensated at 70%, and only cells with series resistances maintained at less than 15 MΩ were analyzed. Patch electrodes were pulled from 1.5 mm o.d. thin-walled glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments) in five stages on a micropipette puller (model P-97; Sutter Instruments). Internal solution contained the following: 136 mM K-gluconate, 17.8 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM ATP, 0.3 mM GTP, 12 mM creatine phosphate, and 50 U/ml phosphocreatine kinase. Alternatively, internal solution contained: 136 mm KCl, 17.8 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.6 mm MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mm ATP, 0.3 mm GTP, 12 mm creatine phosphate, and 50 U/ml phosphocreatine kinase. The pipette resistance was between 2 and 4 MΩ. Standard extracellular solution contained the following (in mM): 140 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.3, 305 mOsm). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–23°C), with the exception of the current-clamp experiments to compare the effects of temperature on neuronal physiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). For these recordings, all current-clamp parameters were measured first at room temperature, then the temperature of the external solution was heated to 35°C using a ThermoClamp Inline Heater (ThermoClamp-3; AutoMate Scientific), and the measurements were repeated. Whole-cell recordings were performed on cortical neurons from control and mutant groups in parallel on the same day (day 13–17 in vitro). All experiments were performed by two independent investigators blinded to the genotypes.</p><p>For current-clamp experiments, the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of neurons were tested by injecting 500 ms square current pulses incrementing in 20 pA steps, starting at −100 pA. Resting membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) was calculated from a 50-ms average before current injection. The membrane time constant (<italic>τ</italic>) was calculated from an exponential fit of current stimulus offset. Input resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub>In</sub>) was calculated from the steady state of the voltage responses to the hyperpolarizing current steps. Membrane capacitance was calculated by dividing the time constant by the input resistance. APs were evoked with 0.5 s, 20 pA depolarizing current steps. Rheobase was defined as the minimum current required to evoke an AP during the 500 ms of sustained somatic current injections. AP threshold was defined as the membrane potential at the inflection point of the rising phase of the AP. AP amplitude was defined as the difference in membrane potential between the AP peak and threshold, and the AHP was the difference between the AP threshold and the lowest <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> value within 50ms. The AP half-width was defined as the width of the AP at half-maximal amplitude. To obtain the neuron’s maximum firing frequency, depolarizing currents in 20 pA steps were injected until the number of APs per stimulus reached a plateau phase. The membrane potential values were not corrected for the liquid junction potential. GABAergic neurons were classified as FS if their maximum mean firing rate reached above 60 Hz and their AP half-widths increased by less than 25% during 1 s of sustained firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casale et al., 2015</xref>). All others were considered NFS.</p><p>For voltage-clamp experiments to measure synaptic currents, neurons were held at −70 mV, except for evoked IPSC measurements, for which neurons were held at 0 mV. AP-evoked EPSCs were triggered by a 2-ms somatic depolarization to 0 mV. The shape of the evoked response, the reversal potential and the effect of receptor antagonists [10 μM NBQX (Tocris Bioscience) or 20 μM bicuculline (BIC, hello bio)] were analyzed to verify the glutamatergic or GABAergic identities of the currents. Neurons were stimulated at 0.1 Hz in standard external solution to measure basal-evoked synaptic responses. Electrophysiology data were analyzed offline with AxoGraph X software (AxoGraph Scientific, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014284">SCR_014284</ext-link>). Spontaneous synaptic potentials were recorded in control solution with either NBQX or BIC to isolate EPSCs or IPSCs, respectively. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and analyzed using template-based miniature event detection algorithms implemented in the AxoGraph X. The threshold for detection was set at three times the baseline SD from a template of 0.5 ms rise time and 3 ms decay. The E/I ratio was calculated as the product of the sEPSC frequency and charge over the sum of the sEPSC frequency and charge and the product of the sIPSC frequency and charge.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>K<sub>Na</sub> and KCNT1 current measurements</title><p>For voltage-clamp experiments to measure the sodium-activated K<sup>+</sup> current or KCNT1-mediated current, neurons were held at −70 mV and given 1 s voltage pulses in 10 mV steps over a range of −80 to +50 mV. Recordings were obtained for each cell in standard extracellular solution or extracellular solution containing 0.5 µM TTX or 10 µM VU170. TTX or VU170 was applied directly on the recorded neuron with a custom-built fast flow perfusion system capable of complete solution exchange in less than 1 s to minimize the time interval between control and drug recordings and current rundown. Current traces from the TTX or VU170 solution were subtracted from the current traces obtained from the standard solution. The difference current over the 100ms at the end of the voltage pulse was considered the steady-state K<sub>Na</sub> current. The same protocol was used for outside-out patch experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title><italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> current measurements</title><p>For voltage-clamp experiments to measure the persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current, neurons were held at −80 mV and given a 5-s voltage ramp at 20 mV/s. The ramp was repeated every 10 s. Recordings were obtained for each cell in standard extracellular solution or extracellular solution containing 0.5 µM TTX. TTX was applied directly on the recorded neuron with a custom-built fast flow perfusion system capable of complete solution exchange in less than 1 s to minimize the time interval between control and TTX recordings. The first current trace after TTX application was subtracted from the averaged current traces obtained from the standard solution. At this time point, the effect of TTX on the Na<sup>+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> current is minimal, while the persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current is maximally inhibited. This allowed us to isolate the persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current from K<sub>Na</sub> and obtain a more accurate estimate of changes in <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Neuron modeling</title><p>Model neurons (~10 per class) representing excitatory (Pyramidal Cell, PC), SST (Martinotti Cell, MC), PV (Large Basket Cell, LBC), and VIP neurons (Bipolar Cell, BP) were downloaded from the EPFL/Blue Brain project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/downloads.html">https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/downloads.html</ext-link>), and implemented in the NEURON environment. Because no KCNT1-like conductance was present in the original models, a Hodgkin-Huxley KCNT1 model conductance was created with both Na<sup>+</sup>- and voltage-dependent gates and inserted into the dendritic, somatic, and axonal compartments of model neurons (0.03 S/cm<sup>2</sup>). The Na<sup>+</sup> dependence was modeled after Bischoff et al. (EC<sub>50</sub> = 40 mM, slope 3.5), and the voltage dependence was modeled after our own experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), corrected to account for the calculated liquid junction potential in the experimental data. To verify that this approach reproduced experimental data, voltage step protocols were run in NEURON with 10 and 0 mM internal Na<sup>+</sup>. ‘K<sub>Na</sub>’ currents were obtained by subtraction, and the amplitude and kinetics of the resulting currents were verified to be similar to experimental values. To model the effects of KCNT1 GOF, the EC<sub>50</sub> for Na<sup>+</sup> was decreased to either 35 or 30 mM, because the Y796H variant was previously shown to increase the Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of the channel. These changes resulted in moderate increases in the current above WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), consistent with the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Modeling data were generated by running current clamp protocols in NEURON for each of the model neurons and analyzed in the same way as experimental data. For modeling the increase in <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub>, the control <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> conductance was set to 0.001 times the conductance of the transient Na<sup>+</sup> current in each compartment. This produced <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> currents approximately 1% of the peak of the transient Na<sup>+</sup> current. KCNT1 GOF was modeled by decreasing the Na<sup>+</sup> EC<sub>50</sub> to 30 mM and the <italic>I</italic><sub>NaP</sub> increase was modeled by increasing its conductance twofold, in accordance with experimental data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunostaining, imaging, and quantification</title><p>For live imaging of GABAergic subtypes in vitro, cortical neurons isolated and cultured from VIP-Cre, SST-Cre, and PV-Cre pups, were infected with AAV-<italic>CamKIIa</italic>-GFP and AAV-<italic>hSyn</italic>-DIO-mCherry viruses at DIV 1 to mark glutamatergic and Cre-expressing, GABAergic neurons, respectively.

The fixed neurons were then incubated in blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton-100 in 1× PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by incubation with a Neu-N primary antibody (Synaptic Systems 266-004) diluted in blocking buffer (1:500) overnight at 4°C. The next day, the neurons were washed three times with PBS for 10–15 min, incubated with goat anti-guinea pig, Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody (Invitrogen A21450) in blocking buffer (1:1000) for 1 hr at room temperature, and washed again three times with PBS for 10–15 min. The coverslips were then flipped and mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount G with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images (1024 × 1024 pixels) of Neu-N to mark all neurons, <italic>CamKIIa</italic>-GFP to mark glutamatergic neurons, and <italic>hSyn</italic>-DIO-mCherry to mark Cre-expressing neurons, were obtained using a DeltaVision Restoration Microscopy System (Applied Precision/GE Life Sciences) with an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope with a ×20 oil objective, SoftWoRx software, and a CoolSNAP-HQ charge-coupled device digital camera (Photometrics). Image exposure times and settings were kept the same between groups in a culture and were optimized to ensure that there were no saturated pixels.

To test for statistical significance for all whole-cell electrophysiology experiments, we used generalized linear mixed models in SPSS [28.0 Chicago, III (IBM, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link>)], which allows for within-subject correlations and the specification of the most appropriate distribution for the data. Because neurons and animals from the same culture or animal are not independent measurements, culture or litter was used as the subject variable, and animals, neurons, and voltage steps were considered within-subject measurements. All data distributions were assessed with the Shapiro–Wilk test. Datasets that were significantly different from the normal distribution (p &lt; 0.05) were fit with models using the gamma distribution and a log link function, except for synaptic connection probability, which was fit with the binomial distribution and probit link. Normal datasets were fit with models using a linear distribution and identity link. We used the model-based estimator for the covariance matrix and goodness of fit was determined using the corrected quasi likelihood under independence model criterion and by the visual assessment of residuals.

In humans, this mutation as well as multiple other heterozygotic mutations produce very severe early-onset seizures and produce a major disruption of all intellectual function. In contrast, in mice, this heterozygous mutation appears to have no behavioral phenotype or any increased propensity to seizures. A relevant phenotype is, however, evident in mice with the homozygous mutation, and the authors have previously published the results of similar experiments with the homozygotes. As perhaps expected, the neuronal effects of the heterozygous mutation presented in this manuscript are generally similar but markedly smaller than the previously published findings on homozygotes. There are, however, some interesting differences, particularly on PV+ interneurons, which appear to be more excitable than wild type in the heterozygotes but more excitable in the heterozygotes. This raises the interesting question, which has been explicitly discussed by the authors in the revised manuscript, as to whether the reported changes represent homeostatic events that suppress the seizure phenotype in the mouse heterozygotes or simply changes in excitability that do not reach the threshold for behavioral outcomes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92915.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Shore et al. investigate the consequent changes in excitability and synaptic efficacy of diverse neuronal populations in an animal model of juvenile epilepsy.

This variant corresponds to the human Y796H variant found in a family with Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal lobe epilepsy. The occurrence of GOF variants in potassium channel encoding genes is well known, and among potential pathophysiological mechanisms, impaired inhibition has been documented as responsible for KCNT1-related DEEs.

In humans, this mutation as well as multiple other heterozygotic mutations produce very severe early-onset seizures and produce a major disruption of all intellectual function. In contrast, in mice, this heterozygous mutation appears to have no behavioral phenotype or any increased propensity to seizures. A relevant phenotype is, however, evident in mice with the homozygous mutation, and the authors have previously published the results of similar experiments with the homozygotes. As perhaps expected, the neuronal effects of the heterozygous mutation presented in this manuscript are generally similar but markedly smaller than the previously published findings on homozygotes. There are, however, some interesting differences, particularly on PV+ interneurons, which appear to be more excitable than wild type in the heterozygotes but more excitable in the heterozygotes. This raises the interesting question, which has been explicitly discussed by the authors in the revised manuscript, as to whether the reported changes represent homeostatic events that suppress the seizure phenotype in the mouse heterozygotes or simply changes in excitability that do not reach the threshold for behavioral outcomes.</p><p>Strengths and Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors find that the heterozygous mutation in PV+ interneurons increases their excitability, a result that is opposite from their previous observation in neurons with the corresponding homozygous mutation. They propose that this results from the selective upregulation of a persistent sodium current INaP in the PV+ interneurons. These observations are very interesting ones, and they raised some issues in the original submission:</p><p>A) The protocol for measuring the INaP current could potentially lead to results that could be (mis)interpreted in different ways in different cells. First, neither K currents nor Ca currents are blocked in these experiments. Instead, TTX is applied to the cells relatively rapidly (within 1 second) and the ramp protocol is applied immediately thereafter. It is stated that, at this time, Na currents and INaP are fully blocked but that any effects on Na-activated K currents are minimal. In theory this would allow the pre- to post- difference current to represent a relatively uncontaminated INaP. This would, however, only work if activation of KNa currents following Na entry is very slow, taking many seconds. A good deal of literature has suggested that the kinetics of activation of KNa currents by Na influx vary substantially between cell types, such that single action potentials and single excitatory synaptic events rapidly evoke KNa currents in some cell types. This is, of course, much faster than the time of TTX application. Most importantly, the kinetics of KNa activation may be different in different neuronal types, which would lead to errors that could produce different estimates of INaP in PV+ interneurons vs other cell types.</p><p>In their revised manuscript, the authors have provided good data demonstrating that, at least for the PV and SST neurons, loss of KNa currents after TTX application is slow relative to the time course of loss of INaP, justifying the use of this protocol for these neuronal types.</p><p>B) As the authors recognize, INaP current provides a major source of cytoplasmic sodium ions for the activation. An expected outcome of increased INaP is, therefore, further activation of KNa currents, rather than a compensatory increase in an inward current that counteracts the increase in KNa currents, as is suggested in the discussion.</p><p>The authors comment in the rebuttal that, despite the fact that sodium entry through INaP is known to activate KNa channels, an increase in INaP does not necessarily imply increased KNa current. This issue should be addressed directly somewhere in the text, perhaps most appropriately in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added the following new paragraph to the Discussion section of the manuscript to address this concern:</p><p>“As the persistent sodium current has been shown to act as a source of cytoplasmic sodium ions for KCNT1 channel activation in some neuron types (Hage &amp; Salkoff, 2012), one might expect that the compensatory increase in INaP in YH-HET PV neurons would further increase, rather than counteract, KNa currents. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information on the relative locations of the INaP and KCNT1 channels, as well as the kinetics of sodium transfer to KCNT1 channels, among cortical neuron subtypes, and even less is known in the context of KCNT1 GOF neurons; thus, it is difficult to predict how alterations in one of these currents may affect the other. One plausible reason that increased INaP would not alter KNa currents in YH-HET PV neurons is that the particular sodium channels that are responsible for the increased INaP are not located within close proximity to the KCNT1 channels. Moreover, homeostatic mechanisms that modify the length and/or location of the sodium channel-enriched axon initial segment (AIS) in neurons in response to altered excitability are well described (Grubb &amp; Burrone, 2010; Kuba et al., 2010); thus, it is possible that in YH-HET PV neurons, the length or location of the AIS is altered, leading to uncoupling of the sodium channels that are responsible for the increased INaP to the KCNT1 channels. Future studies will aim to further investigate potential mechanisms of neuron-type-specific alterations in NaP and KNa currents downstream of KCNT1 GOF.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) The numerical simulations, in general, provide a very useful way to evaluate the significance of experimental findings. Nevertheless, while the in-silico modeling suggests that increases in INaP can increase firing rate in models of PV+ neurons, there is as yet insufficient information on the relative locations of the INaP channels and the kinetics of sodium transfer to KNa channels to evaluate the validity of this specific model.</p><p>The authors have now put in all of the appropriate caveats on this very nicely in the revised manuscript.</p><p>(2) The effects of the KCNT1 channel blocker VU170 on potassium currents are somewhat larger and different from those of TTX, suggesting that additional sources of sodium may contribute to activating KCNT1, as suggested by the authors. Because VU170 is, however, a novel pharmacological agent, it may be appropriate to make more careful statements on this. While the original published description of this compound reported no effect on a variety of other channels, there are many that were not tested, including Na and cation channels that are known to activate KCNT1, raising the possibility of off-target effects.</p><p>In the revised version, the authors have added more to the manuscript on this issue and have added a very clear discussion of this to the text (in the discussion section).</p><p>This is a very clear and thorough piece of work, and the authors are to be congratulated on this. My one remaining suggestion would be to make an explicit statement about whether increased sodium influx through INaP channels, which is thought to activate KNa channels, would be likely to increase KNa current in these neurons (see comment 1B).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to comment 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Shore et al. investigate the consequent changes in excitability and synaptic efficacy of diverse neuronal populations in an animal model of juvenile epilepsy. Using electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings from dissociated neuronal cultures, the authors find diverging changes in two major populations of inhibitory cell types, namely somatostatin (SST)- and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons, in mice expressing a variant of the KCNT1 potassium channel. They further suggest that the differential effects are due to a compensatory increase in the persistent sodium current in PV interneurons in pharmacological and in silico experiments. It remains unclear why this current is selectively enhanced in PV-interneurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Heterozygous KCNT1 gain of function variant was used which more accurately models the human disorder.</p><p>(2) The manuscript is clearly written, and the flow is easy to follow. The authors explicitly state the similarities and differences between the current findings and the previously published results in the homozygous KCNT1 gain of function variant.</p><p>(3) This study uses a variety of approaches including patch clamp recording, in silico modeling and pharmacology that together make the claims stronger.</p><p>(4) Pharmacological experiments are fraught with off-target effects and thus it bolsters the authors' claims when multiple channel blockers (TTX and VU170) are used to reconstruct the sodium-activated potassium current.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) This study mostly relies on recordings in dissociated cortical neurons. Although specific WT interneurons showed intrinsic membrane properties like those reported for acute brain slices, it is unclear whether the same will be true for those cells expressing KCNT1 variants, especially when the excitability changes are thought to arise from homeostatic compensatory mechanisms. The authors do confirm that mutant SST-interneurons are hypoexcitable using an ex vivo slice preparation which is consistent with work for other KCTN1 gain of function variants (e.g. Gertler et al., 2022). However, the key missing evidence is the excitability state of mutant PV-interneurons, given the discrepant result of reduced excitability of PV cells reported by Gertler et al in acute hippocampal slices.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The present manuscript by Shore et al. entitled Reduced GABAergic Neuron Excitability, Altered Synaptic Connectivity, and Seizures in a KCNT1 Gain-of-Function Mouse Model of Childhood Epilepsy&quot; describes in vitro and in silico results obtained in cortical neurons from mice carrying the KCNT1-Y777H gain-of-function (GOF) variant in the KCNT1 gene encoding for a subunit of the Na+-activated K+ (KNa) channel. This variant corresponds to the human Y796H variant found in a family with Autosomal Dominant Nocturnal Frontal lobe epilepsy. The occurrence of GOF variants in potassium channel encoding genes is well known, and among potential pathophysiological mechanisms, impaired inhibition has been documented as responsible for KCNT1-related DEEs. Therefore, building on a previous study by the same group performed in homozygous KI animals, and considering that the largest majority of pathogenic KCNT1 variants in humans occur in heterozygosis, the Authors have investigated the effects of heterozygous Kcnt1-Y777H expression on KNa currents and neuronal physiology among cortical glutamatergic and the 3 main classes of GABAergic neurons, namely those expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV), crossing KCNT1-Y777H mice with PV-, SST- and PV-cre mouse lines, and recording from GABAergic neurons identified by their expression of mCherry (but negative for GFP used to mark excitatory neurons).</p><p>The results obtained revealed heterogeneous effects of the variant on KNa and action potential firing rates in distinct neuronal subpopulations, ranging from no change (glutamatergic and VIP GABAergic) to decreased excitability (SST GABAergic) to increased excitability (PV GABAergic).

However, I would still recommend including the ex vivo slice recordings in mutant PV-interneurons as the authors proposed in their rebuttal. The I-V recordings using sequential TTX and VU170 blockade in WT SST and PV-interneurons that are provided in the rebuttal are interesting and may point to a preferential expression of persistent sodium currents in PV-interneurons normally. It would be helpful to readers as a supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>As proposed in the rebuttal, we are currently recording PV neurons using ex vivo slice preparations from WT and Kcnt1-YH Het mice. We look forward to including those data in a future manuscript.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the differences in INaP between WT PV and SST neurons are notable. The data provided in the rebuttal were only from 5 neurons/group, and they were meant to illustrate a side-by-side comparison of TTX and VU170 subtraction methods to assess KNa currents. However, in Figure 7 of the manuscript, we performed more robust measurements of INaP and observed differences in the current between WT PV and SST neurons. Thus, we’ve added the following sentence to the Results section:</p><p>“Interestingly, the mean peak amplitude of INaP in WT PV neurons was 70% larger than that in WT SST neurons (-1.42 ± 0.16 vs. -0.85 ± 0.07 pA/pF; Fig. 7B and 7D), suggesting there may be differences in sodium channel expression, localization, or regulation inherent to each neuron type that confer their differential response to KCNT1 GOF.”</p><p>References</p><p>Grubb, M.
