In most cases, degrons allow recognition by components of the cytosolic ubiquitin proteasome system. Currently, all of the identified degrons only function within the cytosol. Using <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, we identified the first short linear sequences that function as degrons from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. We show that when these degrons are transferred to proteins, they facilitate proteasomal degradation through the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) system. These degrons enable degradation of both luminal and integral membrane ER proteins, expanding the types of proteins that can be targeted for degradation in budding yeast and mammalian tissue culture. This discovery provides a framework to target proteins for degradation from the previously unreachable ER lumen and builds toward therapeutic approaches that exploit the highly conserved ERAD system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>degrons</kwd><kwd>protein degradation</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation</kwd><kwd>ERAD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F32GM136020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharninghausen</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007315</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dennison</surname><given-names>Devon D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM128592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Ryan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A generalizable approach to identify sequence features driving degradation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) provides useful tools for enabling ER-localized protein degradation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein degradation plays an essential role in regulating diverse cellular processes including cellular signaling, metabolic adaptation, and cell cycle regulation. The ubiquitin proteasome system is the primary cellular degradation route, accounting for over 80% of protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collins and Goldberg, 2017</xref>). Ubiquitination requires the concerted action of the ubiquitination cascade comprising E1 ubiquitin activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, and E3 ubiquitin ligases. For ubiquitin, in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> there is 1 E1, 11 E2s, and &gt;60 E3s whereas mammals have 2 E1s, ~40 E2s, and &gt;600 E3s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clague et al., 2015</xref>). The specificity of the ubiquitination process is primarily driven by the E3 ubiquitin ligases and a major challenge in ubiquitin biology is the identification of the sequences that target proteins for degradation (called ‘degrons’).</p><p>Degrons are usually short linear motifs and, by definition, are sufficient to confer degradation when transferred to otherwise stable proteins. Degrons can be acquired, or inherent. Acquired degrons are generally post-translational modifications that can be based on proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, or acetylation. Inherent degrons are features of the primary polypeptide sequence formed by linear or conformational epitopes. Inherent degrons can be shielded when proteins are appropriately folded or incorporated into larger protein complexes. The first degrons to be discovered were at the amino-terminus of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmair et al., 1986</xref>) and these N-degrons were eventually summarized as the ‘N-end rule’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varshavsky, 2011</xref>), and later the ‘N-degron pathways’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Varshavsky, 2019</xref>). Recent systems-level analyses have expanded the availability of known degrons broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geffen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mashahreh et al., 2022</xref>), with a series of ‘C-end rules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2018</xref>), and additional variations of the N-degron pathways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Timms and Koren, 2020</xref>). Even with a wide range of physiological roles for protein degradation, degrons are still unidentified for most E3 ubiquitin ligases. All known degrons target cytosolic proteins for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome and the identification of degrons for a few key ubiquitin ligases has enabled exploitation of the proteasome to facilitate targeted protein degradation of ‘undruggable’ cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Samarasinghe and Crews, 2021</xref>). However, many proteins that originate from the lumen of membrane-encapsulated organelles are also degraded using the proteasome and degrons for these organelles are mysterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christianson and Carvalho, 2022</xref>). Therefore, targeting proteins for degradation from within organelles requires a detailed understanding of local organellar protein quality control systems.</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) represents the organelle with the largest flux of proteins, with over 40% of proteins translocated into the ER before trafficking to other organelles or secretion from the cell. Both soluble luminal proteins and integral membrane proteins are folded in the ER and undergo quality control before being released into the secretory pathway. At the ER, the primary protein quality control pathways are, collectively, referred to as endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) and these systems are highly conserved among all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huyer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vashist and Ng, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foresti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khmelinskii et al., 2014</xref>). One such system, the Hrd1-centric ERAD complex, recognizes proteins not passing quality control and retrotranslocates them from the ER lumen to the cytosol for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> the Hrd1 complex comprises five proteins: Hrd1, Hrd3, Usa1, Der1, and Yos9. In the cytosol, this pathway requires a highly conserved AAA-ATPase (Cdc48), its cofactors (Ufd1 and Npl4), and the ubiquitination proteasome system to degrade ERAD substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bays et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ye et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarosch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rabinovich et al., 2002</xref>). Soluble, luminal ERAD substrates are retrotranslocated by hetero-oligomers of Hrd1/Der1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mehnert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pisa and Rapoport, 2022</xref>), or in some cases, homo-oligomers of Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldridge and Rapoport, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schoebel et al., 2017</xref>). Hrd1 is sufficient for the basic functions of ERAD but without the other complex components, loses the specificity that normally defines the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denic et al., 2006</xref>). This system has broad specificity and seems to be able to distinguish folded and unfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stein et al., 2014</xref>). Despite nearly three decades of study, degrons (neither sequences nor features) that allow degradation through the Hrd1-centric ERAD pathway remain a complete mystery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Needham et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have identified the first short luminal degrons of the Hrd1-centric ERAD pathway. We demonstrate that a degron can be functionalized to drive protein degradation from the ER lumen, a previously inaccessible cellular location. We show that this technology can drive degradation of both soluble, luminal ER proteins and integral membrane ER proteins. This degron works in both budding yeast and mammalian tissue culture. This work provides an exciting and simple method of targeting proteins for degradation from within the ER by exploiting the highly conserved ERAD system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of ER-localized degrons</title><p>The ER is the primary location for protein quality control within the secretory pathway, but how ER protein quality control systems distinguish folded from unfolded proteins is unclear. We wanted to understand the degrons recognized within the ER lumen and started by designing an ER-targeted reporter of protein stability. We targeted a tandem fluorescent protein timer (tFT) to the ER to function as a reporter of protein stability (ER-tFT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). tFTs contain a fast-maturing fluorescent protein (here, superfastGFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher and DeLisa, 2008</xref>) and a slower-maturing fluorescent protein (here, mCherry; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>) and have been used effectively to identify N-terminal degrons that function in the cytosol and nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khmelinskii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kats et al., 2018</xref>). By measuring the ratio of mCherry to GFP fluorescence, a protein’s stability can be assessed; the lower the ratio, the more unstable the protein. To test whether the ER-tFT could successfully distinguish stable from unstable proteins, we compared the ER-tFT to a well-characterized, unstable, luminal ERAD substrate, KHN, tagged with the tFT (KHN-tFT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using a cycloheximide chase followed by immunoblotting, we found the ER-tFT was quite stable, while the KHN-tFT was degraded with a half-life of less than 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vashist et al., 2001</xref>). Using flow cytometry, the two proteins were also distinguishable following cycloheximide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). After establishing the tFT reporter could distinguish protein stability within the ER, we turned our attention to identifying luminal degrons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized degrons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting the ER-tandem fluorescent protein timer (tFT) and KHN-tFT constructs, which contain an ER-targeting signal sequence (SS), mCherry (red), superfastGFP (green), and the HDEL ER retention sequence.

Using PCR with degenerate primers, we generated an unbiased pentapeptide library encoded in a DNA fragment to use for homologous recombination in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). The theoretical amino acid diversity of a pentapeptide library is 3.2 million (20<sup>5</sup>). We transformed the library into wild-type yeast and obtained 1.2 million transformants. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting we separated cells expressing the pentapeptide-ER-tFT by their mCherry/GFP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). We collected an ‘unstable’ bin (exhibiting a low mCherry/GFP ratio), which encompassed 4% of the sorted cells, for sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>The sequencing results of the unstable sorted bin illuminated an enrichment of pentapeptides beginning with isoleucine and leucine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). Specifically, isoleucine at the first position was present in 17.7% of unstable pentapeptides while leucine was present in 14.8%. Based on codon usage in a random sampling, isoleucine was predicted to appear 4.7% of the time (3/64 codons) giving a 3.8-fold enrichment in our dataset. Leucine was predicted to appear at a specific position 9.4% of the time (6/64 codons) giving a 1.6-fold enrichment in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). When compared to the input library abundance, enrichment corresponds to 2.7- and 1.5-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Rather than attempting to build a consensus sequence that would have to report on many steps in ER quality control, we selected pentapeptide sequences present in the unstable bins that broadly represented the enrichment trends we observed to individually clone and characterize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).</p><p>We compared the stability of six different pentapeptides with isoleucine or leucine at position one to ER-tFT alone, to KHN-tFT, and to a set of randomly selected pentapeptides. KHN-tFT was the least stable, followed by pentapeptides selected from the unstable bin and containing isoleucine or leucine at position one. Several of the randomly selected pentapeptides exhibited a slight reduction in stability, relative to ER-tFT alone, but pentapeptides selected from the unstable bin were consistently less stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Encouraged by our results, we sought to find a peptide sequence that would match KHN-tFT instability. We found that repeats of IHPYW, one of the most unstable sequences, dramatically decreased protein stability, with a 20 amino acid 4X(IHPYW) repeat successfully resembling the KHN control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). On the other hand, simply repeating a stable control sequence (GNRWG) did not destabilize the protein (control variant 1 [ConV1], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Based on these results, we concluded that the 4X(IHPYW) sequence, which we called DegV1 (<underline>Deg</underline>ron <underline>V</underline>ariant 1), functions as an ER-localized degron.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DegV1 is an ERAD-dependent degron degraded by the proteasome</title><p>We next tested whether DegV1 functioned as an ER luminal degron by transferring it from the original ER-tFT reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) to a second protein known to fold in the ER lumen. We targeted the LaG16 anti-GFP nanobody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fridy et al., 2014</xref>) to the ER using the mating factor alpha signal sequence and an ER retention signal (ER-NbGFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). First, to ensure the signal sequence was removed and did not contribute to the DegV1 degron, we compared the molecular weight of a cytosolic NbGFP (without signal sequence), a cytosolic DegV1-NbGFP (without signal sequence), and the ER-DegV1-NbGFP (with signal sequence) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Based on the size of the ER-DegV1-NbGFP compared to DegV1-NbGFP, we concluded that ~90% of the ER-targeted construct had the signal sequence removed and uncleaved signal sequence was unlikely to factor into the function of DegV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Using a cycloheximide chase, the ER-NbGFP protein alone was quite stable, but embedding DegV1 after the N-terminal signal sequence destabilized ER-NbGFP with a half-life of approximately 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This result validated DegV1 as the first, relatively short, degron sequence that can be used for targeting ER luminal substrates for degradation. Next, we tested if DegV1 could also function as an internal or C-terminal degron. To test whether the DegV1 sequence worked within internal loops, we used the same nanobody scaffold but replaced the complementary determining region 3 with DegV1 and found that the presence of an internal DegV1 made no difference in protein stability when compared to the nanobody alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Testing DegV1 at the C-terminus of the NbGFP was complicated by the requirement for an ER retention signal. We integrated the DegV1 sequence immediately before the HDEL retention signal, and, again, this resulted in no change in the stability of the NbGFP target protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The ER retention signal is an important component of this construct’s innate stability, because loss of the HDEL signal, with or without the DegV1 sequence at the extreme C-terminus, results in degradation in the vacuole or secretion from the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the DegV1 degron was capable of acting as an ER luminal degron, but only when positioned at the N-terminus of ER-localized proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DegV1 is an endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD)-dependent degron degraded by the proteasome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The apparent molecular weight of anti-GFP nanobodies were assessed (NbGFP-Flag) either with or without signal sequence, in the presence or absence of DegV1, were assessed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag antibody.

The majority of protein degradation occurs at the proteasome, so we next tested whether DegV1-tagged proteins were degraded by the proteasome. We confirmed ER-GFP was ER-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and examined the stability of the fluorescent ER-localized construct GFP alone, or with DegV1 or ConV1 in cells treated for 2 hr with the proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib and/or cycloheximide. The stability of ER-GFP alone was similar either in the presence (dashed outline) or absence (solid outline) of bortezomib (panel 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Appending DegV1 immediately after the signal sequence resulted in degradation of ER-GFP (solid blue line), which was inhibited by adding bortezomib (dashed line, panel 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This indicated DegV1 targets the luminal ER-GFP for proteasomal degradation. As expected, appending a control sequence (ConV1) of the same length was similarly stable to ER-GFP alone and stability was not affected by bortezomib (solid line versus dashed line, panel 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, DegV1-targeted luminal ER substrates were degraded by the proteasome.</p><p>Proteasomal degradation of luminal ER proteins is mediated by the Hrd1-ERAD system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bordallo et al., 1998</xref>). Consequently, we suspected that Hrd1-centered ERAD mediates DegV1-targeted proteasomal degradation. Again, we tested the stability of ER-GFP in cells lacking the central component to the Hrd1-ERAD system, the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1. The steady-state levels of ER-GFP alone or with ConV1 were similar in the absence of Hrd1 and remained unaffected by proteasome inhibition (panels 1 and 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In contrast, DegV1-containing ER-GFP was more stable in an <italic>hrd1Δ</italic> strain, and bortezomib resulted in little further stabilization of DegV1-containing GFP (panel 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), possibly from a small fraction being incompletely translocated into the ER. In the absence of Hrd1, we observed some ER leakage of ER-DegV1-GFP to the vacuole and appearance of a degradation resistant GFP fragment that resembled the known luminal ERAD substrate, CPY*-GFP (indicated by * in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Altogether, these results are consistent with a role for Hrd1 in the degradation of ER-DegV1-GFP.</p><p>To further test the role of Hrd1 in DegV1-targeted degradation of luminal ER substrates, we tested additional soluble ER proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>) that were, otherwise, relatively stable in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). As expected, when DegV1 was appended to the ER-NbGFP, we found the protein was unstable, with a half-life of approximately 30 min in a cycloheximide chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Next, we tested whether other known components of the Hrd1 ERAD complex were required for DegV1 degradation. We found that, with the notable exception of Yos9, the previously identified components of the ERAD-L complex (Hrd1, Hrd3, Der1, and Usa1) were required for DegV1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). Conversely, the Doa10 ubiquitin ligase was not required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). Consistently, degradation of each of DegV1-containing proteins were inhibited by either treating cells with bortezomib or genetic deletion of Hrd1.</p><p>When DegV1-containing proteins were targeted to the ER lumen, Hrd1-ERAD was required for their degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–J</xref>). We tested whether DegV1 would also function as a degron in the cytosol by removing the signal sequence. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that DegV1 also mediated proteasome-dependent degradation when localized to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, in contrast to ER-localized DegV1, when DegV1-containing proteins were localized to the cytosol, Hrd1 was not required for their degradation through the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In these experiments, we confirmed that DegV1 targets heterologously expressed ER luminal proteins for ERAD-mediated proteasomal degradation. We next tested whether DegV1 could target endogenous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins for degradation. We transplanted DegV1 onto three different classes of endogenous, ER-localized proteins. First, we used the endogenous protein Suc2. We used the Suc2 signal sequence followed by either DegV1, or ConV1, an HA tag, the Suc2 coding sequence, a Flag tag, and an HDEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). With ConV1, Suc2 was stable over several hours, and, based on the modified glycosylation pattern, even appeared to be partially trafficked from the ER. In contrast, with DegV1 Suc2 was dramatically destabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we attached DegV1 to a type I integral membrane ER protein, called Big1, that has its N-terminus in the ER lumen and contains a single transmembrane segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azuma et al., 2002</xref>). We replaced the signal sequence of Big1 with the signal sequence of mating factor alpha followed by either DegV1 or ConV1, an HA tag, and the Big1 coding sequence. DegV1 was also able to destabilize the integral membrane protein Big1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Finally, we attached DegV1 or the control sequence to the N-terminus of Elo1, a multi-spanning integral membrane protein with seven probable transmembrane segments and the N-terminus in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toke and Martin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nie et al., 2021</xref>). We found that DegV1 was capable of driving degradation for the multi-spanning membrane protein Elo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

In contrast, for ER-DegV1-mNG proteasomal inhibition resulted in a dramatic accumulation of protein within 8 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Remarkably, at 24 hr of bortezomib treatment ER-DegV1-mNG accumulated to similar levels compared to ER-ConV1-mNG, suggesting that the low steady-state level of ER-DegV1-mNG was caused by continuous degradation, rather than a general expression problem.</p><p>ERAD-dependent proteasomal degradation also requires the AAA-ATPase p97/VCP (Cdc48 in yeast). Therefore, we tested the stability of the ER-mNG proteins after treatment with the VCP inhibitor CB5083 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to the bortezomib treatment, we found that treatment with CB5083 resulted in stabilization of ER-DegV1-mNG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). As the CB5083 incubation length increased, we found that the levels of ER-DegV1-mNG approached those of the stable, control proteins. To confirm that bortezomib and CB5083 were preventing the active degradation of ER-DegV1-mNG, rather than just improving expression, we analyzed the degradation of the ER-mNG proteins in the presence of bortezomib or CB5083. We confirmed that, without addition of bortezomib or CB5083, ER-ConV1-mNG was stable while ER-DegV1-mNG was degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). When we pretreated cells with either bortezomib or CB5083 and inhibited translation with emetine, we found that the degradation of ER-DegV1-mNG was completely inhibited. Finally, we tested whether Hrd1 was required for degradation of ER-DegV1-mNG in mammalian cells. Using either wild-type or Hrd1 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2017</xref>), we followed degradation of ER-DegV1-mNG and found that the degron-containing protein was stabilized in the absence of Hrd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that DegV1 functions as an Hrd1-dependent ER-localized degron in mammalian cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identified the first short, linear, degron motifs that target proteins for degradation from the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We focused on functionalizing these motifs and found that DegV1 works with folded, luminal, and completely soluble proteins as well as integral membrane proteins with differing topologies. It works with both exogenous and endogenous proteins that are otherwise stable. This degron appears to only work at the N-terminus of nascent proteins, rather than internally or C-terminally. Importantly, DegV1 is degraded through the Hrd1-ERAD axis using the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Furthermore, we found that DegV1 works across eukaryotes in the mammalian cell culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our data highlight a robust, highly potent degron that can be used for targeted protein degradation from the ER lumen and membrane.</p><p>Despite a growing understanding of how the ERAD system functions, the fundamental question of how degrons are recognized by ERAD remains unanswered. Here, we identified a number of different degrons, that remain to be completely characterized, but focused on a single degron (DegV1). It is somewhat surprising that DegV1 seems to only work as an N-terminal degron, but it is possible that when DegV1 is positioned anywhere except the N-terminus, DegV1 could be buried within other parts of the proteins. Although this position-dependent effect is simply a result of the methods used to identify this particular degron, it highlights the importance of future work to identify degrons capable of acting in different positions within a protein (amino terminal, internal, and carboxyl terminal). However, the sequence ‘IHPYW’ forming the basis of DegV1 appears to be relatively uncommon in nature and is not present in other proteins encoded in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome. In fact, DegV1 appears to be absent from the currently annotated and available fungal genomes in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cherry et al., 2012</xref>). Based on our selection criteria, IHPYW alone is unlikely to be the most potent ER degron. In fact, we were able to demonstrate that just by increasing the length of our short degron, we could improve the degron to be more like that of a full ERAD substrate protein. We expect that in most unfolded proteins, multiple short linear degrons would contribute to effective recognition and degradation by quality control systems.</p><p>Even with the limitations, we were able to demonstrate the utility of DegV1 and future degrons by illuminating that degrons can function even in evolutionarily distant species (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>). This was somewhat surprising because specific degrons transferred between fungi and animals are not always functionally conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timms et al., 2019</xref>). It should be noted that the degradation rates of our degron-containing proteins are similar to the rates of other well-characterized ERAD substrates. We interpret these results to mean that DegV1 is degraded in a manner consistent with that of endogenous ERAD substrates. The retrotranslocation process itself appears to function by unfolding, or mostly unfolding, its substrates. Few protein transport systems can transport fully folded proteins across a lipid bilayer with the notable exceptions being the twin arginine transporter system (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berks, 2015</xref>) and peroxisomal import machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glover et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNew and Goodman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Romano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skowyra and Rapoport, 2022</xref>). However, previous studies in the ERAD field provide conflicting accounts over the ability to transport fully folded proteins from the ER to cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tirosh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhamidipati et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). What is certain is that glycosylated ERAD substrate proteins are retrotranslocated across the ER membrane, with the N-linked glycans representing a similar steric challenge compared to secondary structure or smaller folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grotzke et al., 2013</xref>). Because DegV1 allows degradation of fully folded proteins, it is possible that the proteins are transported in a fully folded state. Although, it seems unlikely that a single heterodimeric channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) or homodimeric channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schoebel et al., 2017</xref>) would be able to transport a fully folded substrate. Perhaps, a substrate could occupy multiple ERAD complexes, could require other unidentified proteins, or could use mechanics similar to the peroxisomal machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). However, we favor the idea that the targeted proteins are likely recognized and transported in an unfolded state after ERAD complex engagement. Future studies are needed to identify and characterize the molecular mechanisms that underpin this unexpected observation and it will be important to understand whether the core ERAD machinery, ER chaperones, or perhaps additional unidentified components are required.</p><p>Here, we have created the first tool that can be used to begin to answer these outstanding questions. We’ve identified a genetically encoded sequence that is easily manipulatable for targeting proteins for degradation from a previously unreachable cellular localization. The approach we’ve used will, eventually, enable targeted protein degradation from the ER to target physiologically, or pathophysiologically, relevant proteins. We anticipate that this platform will allow targeting and manipulation of a wide range of previously inaccessible proteins, not only for basic research, but for translational studies and, eventually, biomedical therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Cell lysates were normalized to the same concentrations in Laemmli sample buffer and heated to 65°C for 5 min prior to separation by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, immunoblotted with antibodies (anti-HA from Roche, anti-β-actin from Cell Signaling, HRP-linked ECL rabbit-IgG and rat-IgG from Cytiva), and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL Select Western blotting detection reagent, Cytiva) using a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad). For quantification of the immunoblot band intensities, we used ImageLab version 6.1 (Bio-Rad). Band intensities were normalized to β-actin protein in the sample quantified within each lane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Yeast pentapeptide library generation</title><p>We designed an in vivo gap repair strategy for cloning our pentapeptide libraries into the ER-tFT. The plasmid backbone was based on pRS416 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christianson et al., 1992</xref>) and contained a <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter (also known as GPD or GAPDH), the signal sequence from mating factor alpha, mCherry, GFP, an HDEL ER retention signal, and the <italic>CYC1</italic> terminator. To prevent the peptide library from potentially disrupting signal sequence cleavage, two amino acids (Ala and Ser) after the signal sequence cleavage site were left upstream of the library. The final N-terminal amino acid sequence of the ER-tFT library after translocation and signal peptide cleavage is ASXXXXX.</p><p>To generate the pentapeptide DNA library fragment with homology arms to ER-tFT, four PCRs were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) with Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs, M0530S). We started by generating a linear DNA template to reduce bias in our PCRs. Using pRP01 and primers prRP07 and prRP08, we amplified a 1025 bp fragment with 524 bp upstream (overlapping the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter and signal sequence) and 495 bp downstream (overlapping mCherry) of the library insertion (EcoRI) site in pRP01. This fragment (fragment 1) was gel-purified (QIAGEN, 28104) to remove any residual plasmid and contain only a linear template.</p><p>Fragment 2, containing the upstream homology arm, was generated through PCR using fragment 1 (the linear DNA template) with primers prRP10 and prRP29 to amplify a 512 bp fragment, which included homology with both the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter and signal sequence and contained the random DNA library insertions. Fragment 3, containing the downstream homology arm, was generated in a PCR using fragment 1 (the linear DNA template) from the first PCR with primers prRP09 and prRP51 to generate a 146 bp fragment, which included random DNA in the library position along with homology arms in mCherry. Only 102 bp of homology was included in the mCherry coding region to limit the number of mutations found in mCherry included by homologous recombination. When we included longer homology arms into mCherry, we found that our screening procedure was selective enough to identify mutations in mCherry which could lead to false ‘unstable’ hits (data not shown).</p><p>To generate the PCR product for homologous recombination containing overlapping homology arms to the target plasmid (pRP01), we gel-purified fragments 2 and 3 and mixed the DNA in an equimolar ratio. Using primers prRP29 and prRP51, we used 25 PCR cycles to generate a 605 bp fragment 4 (containing the pentapeptide library and homology arms covering 488 bp upstream and 111 bp downstream of the library cut site). Fragment 4 was purified and mixed at a 30:1 molar ratio with purified pRP01 (digested with EcoRI) immediately before yeast electroporation.</p><p>The library transformation into yeast strain yRB203 was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benatuil et al., 2010</xref>). Cells were grown overnight to stationary phase in YPD media, shaking at 225 rpm and 30°C. An aliquot of the overnight culture was used to inoculate 400 mL of YPD media at 0.3 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL. Cells were grown for approximately 5 hr until 1.6 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL was reached and collected by centrifugation at 3200×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed twice by 200 mL of ice-cold water and once by 200 mL of electroporation buffer (1 M sorbitol/1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, sterile filtered). The cell pellet was then resuspended in 80 mL of 100 mM LiAc/10 mM DTT, split into two aliquots of 40 mL, and each was incubated in a 250 mL culture flask for 30 min at 30°C, shaking at 225 rpm. Next, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with 200 mL of ice-cold electroporation buffer, and resuspended to 2.4 mL in electroporation buffer. The cell resuspension was evenly divided into six pre-chilled Bio-Rad Gene Pulser cuvettes (0.2 cm electrode gap) and kept on ice for 10 min with DNA. One reaction was used as a no DNA control, one reaction received digested vector only, and four cuvettes received 3 µg of digested vector and 9 µg fragment 4. Cells were electroporated at 2.5 kV and 25 µF, with time constants varying from 4.0 to 4.3 ms. Cells were gently transferred from each cuvette into 8 mL of a 1:1 mix of 1 M sorbitol:YPD in culture tubes (25 m diameter) and incubated at 30°C, with shaking at 220 rpm. After 1 hr, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and inoculated into 1 L SC dropout media (-ura) at 0.2 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL. Dilutions from the electroporated cells were also plated on SC dropout plates and grown for 2 days at 30°C to determine the library transformation size (approximately 1.2 million for the library described here).</p><p>Electroporated cells were grown for ~18 hr while shaking at 30°C until reaching 0.5 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL. Control strains expressing ER-tFT (pRP01) and KHN-tFT (pRP08) were also cultured in parallel. The strains and library were then treated with DMSO only (Sigma-Aldrich, D2650) or 50 µg/mL cycloheximide (EMD Millipore, 239763) for 2 hr. After treatment, the cells were pelleted, washed once in 1× PBS, resuspended in 1× PBS containing 1 µM Sytox Blue (Invitrogen, S11348), and incubated at 4°C prior to cell sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting</title><p>Cells were sorted on a MoFlo Astrios Cell Sorter (Beckman Coulter) running Summit software.

Events were gated to select for yeast cell-sized events, single cells, live cells, and mCherry-GFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The mCherry/GFP ratio for each cell in the final gated population was displayed as a histogram. The ER-tFT and KHN-tFT controls were used to help define where to draw the low mCherry/GFP ratio (unstable) bin for sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In total, 13 million mCherry-GFP positive events were sorted from the pentapeptide-ER-tFT library, &gt;10 times over the library size. The sorted cells were grown at 30°C with shaking in 5 mL of SC dropout media for 24 hr and expanded to 25 mL cultures overnight. 10 OD<sub>600</sub> of both the ‘unstable’ bin and unsorted pentapeptide-ER-tFT library were pelleted and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C prior to DNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>DNA extraction and amplicon sequencing preparation</title><p>DNA extraction was performed essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kats et al., 2018</xref>).

Partial adapters for Illumina sequencing were added by 25 cycles of PCR using primers prRP37 and prRP38 (annealing temperature of 60°C using Phusion DNA polymerase). PCR products were purified (QIAGEN, 28104), normalized to 20 ng/µL using a QuBit 3 (Invitrogen, Q32854), and sent for amplicon sequencing using Genewiz Amplicon-EZ (now Azenta Life Sciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Amplicon-EZ analysis</title><p>Sequences from the two Amplicon-EZ samples (unstable bin and input library) were analyzed for quality, trimmed, aligned, and translated by Genewiz (now Azenta Life Sciences).

From the translated sequences, the pentapeptide region was isolated and divided into positions #1–5 (P1-P5). The amino acid count was the sum of occurrences for each amino acid at each position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>, AA Analysis Sheet). We then divided the amino acid frequency at each position for the library or unstable sorted bin by the expected amino acid frequency based on the number of codons that encode a given amino acid.

Overnight cell density was typically around ~4–5 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL. In the morning, cells were diluted to 0.2 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL in SC dropout media and grown at 30°C shaking at 1000 rpm for ~5 hr or until the OD<sub>600</sub>/mL of the cultures was ≥0.5. Cells were pelleted at 3200×<italic>g</italic> and the supernatant was removed by aspiration prior to resuspension in SC dropout media at 2 OD<sub>600</sub>/mL. For experiments using cells treated with 50 µg/mL cycloheximide or 50 µM bortezomib, cells were transferred directly into new 96-well plates (Grenier Bio-One, 650185). To account for slowed growth by these treatments, in the same plates the untreated/DMSO-treated cells were diluted by ⅓ with fresh media. During the treatment periods, cells were incubated at 30°C while shaking at 600 rpm. After treatment, cells were pelleted at 3200×<italic>g</italic>, washed once with 1× PBS, and resuspended in 1× PBS with 1 µM Sytox Blue (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 4°C during flow cytometry analysis on a MACSQuant VYB (Miltenyi) running MACSQuantify software (version 2.13.2). Sytox Blue was followed using the 405 nm laser and 452/45 nm emission filters. SuperfastGFP was followed using the 488 nm laser and 452/45 nm emission filters. mCherry was followed using the 561 nm laser 615/20 nm emission filters.

They then determine the stability of these constructs in a high throughput FACS-sorting procedure and identify a set of peptides that route the construct to proteasomal degradation. Increasing the copy number of one of these peptides further decreases the stability of the construct. This polypeptide resembles a &quot;degron&quot; for ER proteins, because it also targets other ER proteins with different topological and folding properties for degradation. It only works when placed at the amino-terminus of a protein and utilizes components of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase complex, a well-established quality control ubiquitin ligase in the ER membrane. Importantly, the degron also targets ER-proteins in mammalian cells.</p><p>The authors convincingly show that fusion of their newly identified degron to the amino terminus of ER-resident proteins with different topology suffices to target them for proteasomal degradation. The data for this are well-founded and contain appropriate controls. While technically sound, the study does only give superficial information on general properties of the degron and its recognition by cellular factors. Further simple experiments would have addressed a number of important points. The authors only provide data about the composition of the identified amino acid sections from the high-throughput approach and the statistical preference for certain amino acids at individual positions. They do not study degron composition experimentally by substituting individual amino acids with other residues and analyzing protein stability. Increasing the numbers of the initially identified degron pentamer increases substrate turnover, but the basis for this remains unclear. Each copy may be actively involved in better recognition, elongation of the degron may facilitate accessibility by recognition factors or multiplying the short amino acid stretch may generate new signatures at the amino-terminus that are more readily recognized by a quality control machinery. Consequently, this study does not allow conclusions to be drawn about general properties of degron composition and/or structure. The degron also functions with cytoplasmic proteins, suggesting that similar characteristics of a polypeptide attract the attention of quality control systems also in other cellular compartments. However, the authors did not pursue this finding further, e.g. by identifying factors for degron recognition in the cytoplasm. It would have been particularly interesting to test whether the degron would initiate degradation when placed at cytoplasmically-exposed amino termini of membrane-bound ER proteins. Information on degron properties is required to better understand principles of substrate recognition by protein quality control pathways and to design constructs for targeting endogenous proteins via proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89606.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Sharninghausen et al use a generic screening platform to search for short (5 amino acid) degrons that function in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of budding yeast. The screen did indeed identify a number of sequences which increased the rate of degradation of their test proteins. Although the effect of the single degron was rather modest the authors could show that by mutimerising the sequence (4x) they obtained degrons that functioned fairly efficiently. Further characterisation indicated that the degrons only functioned when placed at the N-terminus of the target protein and, were dependent on both the proteasome and the segregase Cdc48 (p97) for degradation. The authors also demonstrated that degradation was via the ERAD pathway.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In general, the data presented is supportive of the conclusions drawn and the authors have thus identified a sequence that can be appended onto other ER targeted proteins to mediate their degradation within the lumen of the ER. How useful this will be to the community remains to be seen.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the observation that such mutimerised sequences can act as degrons is an interesting curiosity, it is not clear that such sequences function in vivo. In fact the DegV1 sequence used throughout the paper is not present in any yeast or fungal proteins and the fact that it has to be located at the N-terminus of the protein to induce degradation is at odds with the idea that proteins to be degraded need to be unfolded. Thus, the role of such sequences in vivo is questionable.</p><p>Comments on revised manuscript:</p><p>Although the role of such degron sequences remains to be determined in vivo, it is clear that the authors have developed a tool that could be useful to the scientific community. The specific points raised were appropriately addressed by the authors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89606.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sharninghausen</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Jiwon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dennison</surname><given-names>Devon D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Ryan D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their constructive feedback and overall positive response to our manuscript. Reviewer #1 had no specific recommendations, so below we address Reviewer #2’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Specific points</p><p>(1) In Fig. 1H peptides selected are much more stable than the positive control KHN-FT, but they appear to be less stable than randomly selected 5 amino acid sequences. Are the differences</p><p>between the randomly selected sequences and the selected sequences statistically significant.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the feedback. Yes, the differences are statistically significant by one-way ANOVA and the Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests, we’ve updated the figure legend to indicate this fact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Fig. 1I the FACS profile of 4x looks like that of KHN, but it is very difficult to see in the figure. Looking at the quantitation in Fig. 1J it is impossible to compare KHN with 4x as the KHN is on the baseline. Could this be improved by using a log scale to present the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We’ve improved the figure so the KHN is easier to see. In addition, we’ve attempted different way to display these results, but settled on scaling the data between 1 and 0 as our comparison points. We’ve updated the main figure to more clearly show this result so the KHN is easier to compare.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Fig. 2G and Fig. 2F don't really match up. It looks from Fig. 2G like there is still some degradation in the hrd1 deletion strain, but this is not reflected in the quantitation (Fig. 2H).</p></disp-quote><p>To our eyes, the degradation in a hrd1null appears to be quite small, which seems to be reflected in the quantification (~20% decrease over 90 minutes).
