Tissue-resident macrophages in most organs rely on local M-CSF. However, it is unclear what specific cells in the bone marrow produce M-CSF to maintain myeloid homeostasis. Here, we found that Adipoq-lineage progenitors but not mature adipocytes in bone marrow or in peripheral adipose tissue, are a major cellular source of M-CSF, with these Adipoq-lineage progenitors producing M-CSF at levels much higher than those produced by osteoblast lineage cells. The Adipoq-lineage progenitors with high CSF1 expression also exist in human bone marrow. Deficiency of M-CSF in bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors drastically reduces the generation of bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts, leading to severe osteopetrosis in mice. Furthermore, the osteoporosis in ovariectomized mice can be significantly alleviated by the absence of M-CSF in bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors. Our findings identify bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors as a major cellular source of M-CSF in bone marrow and reveal their crucial contribution to bone marrow macrophage development, osteoclastogenesis, bone homeostasis, and pathological bone loss.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>M-CSF</kwd><kwd>osteoclast</kwd><kwd>bone marrow macrophages</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>AdipoQ-expressing progenitors</kwd><kwd>Csf1</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>Adipose</kwd><kwd>bone homeostasis</kwd><kwd>bone marrow adipocyte progenitors</kwd><kwd>bone marrow adipoq+ cells</kwd><kwd>bone marrow</kwd><kwd>scRNAseq</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>postmenopausal osteoporosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR078212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Baohong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR068970</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Baohong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR071463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Baohong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR075585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenblatt</surname><given-names>Matthew B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG045040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jean X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013352</institution-id><institution>Tow Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rosensweig Genomics Center at the Hospital for Special Surgery</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Baohong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AQ-1507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jean X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors as a novel and major cellular source of M-CSF in mice and humans, which controls bone marrow macrophage development, osteoclastogenesis, and bone mass in physiological and pathological conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), encoded by the <italic>Csf1</italic> gene, is a growth factor that plays a crucial role in the proliferation, differentiation, survival and function of myeloid lineage cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stanley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ross, 2006</xref>). The global absence of <italic>Csf1</italic> in the <italic>Csf1<sup>op</sup>/ Csf1<sup>op</sup></italic> mice, which carry an inactivating mutation in the coding region of <italic>Csf1</italic>, leads to tissue macrophage deficiency, growth retardation and skeletal abnormality. The severe osteopetrosis, shortened long bones and failure of dental eruption in <italic>Csf1<sup>op</sup>/ Csf1<sup>op</sup></italic> mice attest to the essential role of M-CSF for osteoclast generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cecchini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felix et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiktor-Jedrzejczak et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wiktor-Jedrzejczak et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshida et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>Osteoclasts are giant multinucleated cells responsible for bone resorption. They are derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage and are a specialized terminally differentiated macrophage. Osteoclasts play an important role not only in physiological bone development and remodeling, but also actively contribute to musculoskeletal tissue damage and accelerating the progression of postmenopausal osteoporosis and inflammatory arthritis. Osteoclasts and their progenitors express the M-CSF receptor c-Fms. M-CSF is essential for the entire process of osteoclast differentiation, from the generation of osteoclast precursors to the formation and survival of mature osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ross, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanaka et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng and Teitelbaum, 2013</xref>). M-CSF also acts together with β3 integrin to regulate actin remodeling in osteoclasts to enable osteoclasts to spread, migrate, fuse, and form actin rings to facilitate bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ross, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ross and Teitelbaum, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Insogna et al., 1997</xref>). These findings underscore the indispensable role of <italic>Csf1</italic> in not only monocyte to macrophage development, but also osteoclast differentiation, function and survival, which directly influences bone mass.</p><p>M-CSF is expressed by a variety of cells, such as endothelial cells, myoblasts, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cecchini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schrader et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clinton et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fibbe et al., 1988</xref>). This diversity of cellular sources of M-CSF is likely due to the need to support a widely distributed network of tissue-resident macrophages, which require M-CSF for their development, function, and homeostasis. Under physiologic conditions, circulating M-CSF is mainly produced by vascular endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clinton et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roth and Stanley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryan et al., 2001</xref>). The role of circulating M-CSF in tissue macrophage support appears to be highly context dependent. For example, macrophages in kidney and liver are highly dependent on circulating M-CSF. Bone marrow resident macrophages, however, appear to not require circulating M-CSF, indicating the importance of local M-CSF produced in bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cecchini et al., 1994</xref>). Osteocytes embedded in bone express M-CSF that contributes to bone mass maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Werner et al., 2020</xref>). Although in vitro studies show that M-CSF is expressed by an osteoblast cell line, calvarial osteoblastic cells and a cloned bone marrow stromal cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanaka et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elford et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naparstek et al., 1986</xref>), there is no clear evidence supporting whether osteoblasts express M-CSF in vivo and the contributions of osteoblast-derived M-CSF to macrophage and bone homeostasis in vivo is unclear. Therefore, it is largely unknown what specific bone marrow cellular population mainly produces this critical cytokine.</p><p>The rapid evolution of scRNAseq technology provides an opportunity to investigate transcriptomics at the individual cell level. In this study, we utilized bone marrow scRNAseq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tikhonova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolgalev and Tikhonova, 2021</xref>), and identified a group of unique bone marrow cells featuring Adipoq expression that highly express <italic>Csf1</italic>. The level of <italic>Csf1</italic> expressed by these bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitor cells is much higher than that produced by osteoblast lineage cells. We further demonstrated the functional importance of the <italic>Csf1</italic> expressed by bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors in macrophage development, osteoclastogenesis and bone mass maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scRNAseq reveals Adipoq-lineage progenitors as a main cellular source expressing <italic>Csf1</italic> in bone marrow</title><p>Along with the rapid progress of single-cell RNAseq technology, single-cell transcriptomics provides an unprecedented assessment of tissue cellular composition and gene expression profile at individual cell resolution. We took advantage of a recently published dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolgalev and Tikhonova, 2021</xref>), which integrated three bone marrow scRNAseq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tikhonova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>), and analyzed the expression profiles of non-hematopoietic bone marrow cells. <italic>Adipoq</italic> is found to be most highly expressed in the cluster MSPC-adipo (mesenchymal progenitor cells-adipo lineage)/Adipoq-lineage progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and D</xref>) as a marker of this cell population among the clusters. This MSPC-Adipo cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolgalev and Tikhonova, 2021</xref>) was described as the adipo-primed mesenchymal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tikhonova et al., 2020</xref>), adipocyte progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>), Adipo-CAR (Cxcl12-Abundant Reticular) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>), Lepr-MSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>), or marrow adipogenic lineage precursors (MALPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>) identified in bone marrow. Since we utilized Adipoq Cre mice to investigate the function of this progenitor population, we used the nomenclature bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors to designate these cells throughout this study. We found the Adipoq-lineage progenitors to be highly enriched for bone marrow stromal cell markers important for the hematopoietic niche, such as <italic>Lepr</italic>, <italic>Cxcl12</italic> and <italic>Kitl</italic>, but also express unique genes, such as <italic>Lpl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Figure 3A). These cells labeled by Adipoq Cre were relatively quiescent, with about 4% cells incorporating BrdU under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Although SVF cells express Csf1, these cells do not express Adipoq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

On the other hand, mineral apposition rate (MAR) and bone formation rate (BFR) were not affected in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice, indicating normal osteoblastic function in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since osteoclasts are derived from the myeloid macrophage lineage, we examined bone marrow macrophage populations. CD11b+Ly6 C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes were similar between control and Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice. CD11b+F4/80+macrophages were reduced by almost half in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This decrease in macrophages reflects the effects of M-CSF deficiency, as M-CSF is critical for macrophage development. We further stimulated bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with LPS and found that the inflammatory response of BMMs, indicated by inflammatory gene induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and the activation of MAPK or NF-κB pathways in response to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), was similar between the BMMs derived from the control and Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice. To further test the importance of M-CSF produced by bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors for osteoclastogenesis, we cultured whole bone marrow ex vivo without exogenous M-CSF to test whether the Adipoq-lineage cell-produced M-CSF is sufficient to function together with RANKL to induce osteoclast differentiation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, RANKL can induce osteoclast differentiation in the control bone marrow cultures even without addition of M-CSF, but it failed to induce osteoclastogenesis in the Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> bone marrow culture. When recombinant M-CSF was added back to the bone marrow cultures, the osteoclast formation in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> cell cultures was similar to that in the control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results demonstrate that the M-CSF secreted by bone marrow resident Adipoq-lineage progenitors is critical for osteoclastogenesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Csf1 deficiency in Csf1<sup>ΔAdipoq</sup> mice suppresses the populations of bone marrow macrophages and osteoclasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TRAP staining and histomorphometric analysis of histological sections obtained from the metaphysis region of distal femurs of 12-week-old male <italic>Csf <sup>f/f</sup></italic> and Csf1<sup>ΔAdipoq</sup> mice (n = 5/group).

We developed the ovariectomy (OVX) model in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice to study the contribution of Adipoq+ cell-produced M-CSF to the estrogen-deficiency induced osteoporosis, which mimics postmenopausal bone loss. Uterine weight was measured six weeks after surgery to assess the success of the OVX. Uterine weights were decreased approximately 75% in OVX groups compared with the sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), indicating comparable and effective estrogen depletion in both control and Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice. OVX did not alter <italic>Csf1</italic> expression in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). μCT analysis showed that OVX significantly reduced bone mass indicated by a decrease in BV/TV, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, Conn-Dens. and an increase of trabecular spacing compared with the sham group in the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Although OVX also decreased the bone mass of Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice, the extent of bone loss was less than that of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Significant changes were identified between the control and Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice in several μCT parameters. For example, a decrease in trabecular BV/TV after OVX: 35.1% in the control vs 20.9% in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice; a decrease in Tb. N after OVX:11.34% in the control vs 7.97% in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice; a decrease in Conn-Dens after OVX: 39.7% in the control vs 14.56% in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice; an increase in Tb. Sp after OVX: 12.51% in the control vs 1.97% in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice. Furthermore, the bone mass was markedly higher in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice than control mice after OVX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, column 4 vs 2), indicating a significant role for the M-CSF secreted by Adipoq + cells in estrogen-deficiency induced bone loss. OVX is an osteoclastogenic stimulus. Thus, osteoclast formation as indicated by osteoclast surface and numbers was significantly enhanced by OVX in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Bone histomorphometric analysis further showed significantly greater osteoclast numbers and surface area in control mice with OVX than Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice with OVX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Despite an increase in osteoclast surface in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice after OVX, osteoclast numbers were not significantly influenced by OVX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). As bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors are a key cell population expressing M-CSF, these results indicate that the absence of M-CSF in these cells appears to enable osteoclast linage cells to be resistant to environmental osteoclastogenic stimuli, such as OVX, thereby mitigating pathologic bone loss.

In this study, we identified bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors as a new cellular source of M-CSF expression, which contributes substantially to the bone marrow macrophage development, physiological bone mass maintenance and pathological bone destruction via controlling osteoclast formation. Bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors also produce RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2021</xref>), an essential cytokine to induce osteoclast differentiation. These findings collectively highlight the significance of bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis and bone metabolism, as well as the potential translational implications of appropriately targeting this cell population in treating pathologic bone loss.</p><p>The osteopetrotic phenotype in long bones is similar between Adipoq Cre-driven <italic>Csf1</italic> (our results) and RANKL conditional KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, Adipoq Cre-driven RANKL conditional KO mice also exhibit osteopetrosis in lumbar bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), while Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice do not. The mechanisms underlying this difference are unclear. A possibility is that cells other than Adipoq-expressing cells in lumbar presumably produce sufficient M-CSF or IL34 that could compensate the loss of M-CSF by Adipoq-lineage progenitors. This difference also implicates the presence of distinct cellular compartments and microenvironments between long bones and vertebral bones.</p><p>Adipoq is not only highly expressed in the bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors but also in lipid-laden adipocytes in fat tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry and Rodeheffer, 2013</xref>), such as peripheral inguinal and epididymal adipose tissue. However, unlike the wide expression of Adipoq in lipid-laden adipocytes to Adipoq-lineage progenitors in bone marrow, Adipoq is expressed in mature lipid-laden adipocytes but not their progenitors in peripheral adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry and Rodeheffer, 2013</xref>). Additionally, unlike bone marrow Adipoq+ progenitors, these peripheral Adipoq+ cells nearly do not produce M-CSF. The cells producing RANKL usually appear to simultaneously express M-CSF, such as osteocytes and bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors (our findings and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Werner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2021</xref>). This is not the case for peripheral Adipoq+ adipocytes, which express neither RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2017</xref>) nor M-CSF (our findings). The unique expression of M-CSF and RANKL by bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors is a feature that distinguishes this cell population from other adipose depots.</p><p>Bone marrow macrophages are reduced by approximately half in the Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice, but macrophages in other tissues/organs are not significantly affected. These results indicate a strong local regulation of macrophage development by bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors via M-CSF. It was thought that M-CSF secreted by cells in certain tissues could affect M-CSF levels in other tissues/organs via circulation. However, research using <italic>Csf1<sup>op</sup>/ Csf1<sup>op</sup></italic> mice with the restoration of circulating M-CSF shows that some tissues/organs are dependent much more on local than circulating M-CSF, such as bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cecchini et al., 1994</xref>). Our results support this finding and further demonstrate that Adipoq-lineage progenitors are a crucial cellular source of M-CSF that controls macrophage and osteoclast populations in bone marrow. It is unclear but interesting why macrophage development and osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow is more dependent on local M-CSF. This is presumably a unique mechanism by which bone marrow microenvironment decouples osteoclastogenesis and marrow monocytic development from systemic regulation of tissue-resident macrophages, allowing for marrow homeostasis.</p><p>The bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors only constitute approximately 0.08% of bone marrow cells. However, the deficiency of M-CSF produced by this small Adipoq+ cell population leads to around a 50% increase in trabecular bone mass and an over 50% reduction of bone marrow macrophages. These results together with the scRNAseq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrate that Adipoq-lineage progenitor cells in bone marrow produce substantially more M-CSF than osteoblast lineage cells. Thus, Adipoq-lineage progenitors are a major cellular source of M-CSF for bone marrow. We also observed that the osteopetrotic phenotype in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice is not as strong as <italic>Csf1<sup>op</sup>/ Csf1<sup>op</sup></italic> mice. Literature show that M-CSF expression was found in cultures of osteoblastic cells, an osteocyte cell line and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanaka et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Werner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elford et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>). Despite scRNAseq analysis showing that osteoblasts do not express <italic>Csf1</italic>, the MSPC-Osteo population does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The possibility of M-CSF expression by osteoblasts also exists, which needs further assessment in vivo in addition to scRNAseq approach. Collectively, the M-CSF produced by MSPC-Osteo cells, osteocytes and potentially osteoblasts could partially compensate for the loss of M-CSF from bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitor cells.</p><p>M-CSF functions through its receptor c-Fms to exert various biological activities. IL34 was identified later as an additional ligand for c-Fms. Although it also binds to other receptors aside from c-Fms, IL34 has, at least partially, functional redundancy with M-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lelios et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike M-CSF that is broadly and highly expressed by almost every tissue, IL34 is found highly expressed in brain and skin and plays an important role in the differentiation and maintenance of microglia and Langerhans cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lelios et al., 2020</xref>). The vascular endothelial cells in spleen also produce IL34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakamichi et al., 2012</xref>). The results from scRNAseq datasets show that IL34 is expressed in bone marrow, largely by Adipoq-lineage progenitors but also moderately by pericytes and slightly by MSPC-Osteo cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolgalev and Tikhonova, 2021</xref>). This indicates that Adipoq-lineage progenitors are highly likely a major cellular source of IL34 in bone marrow. Spleen has a reservoir of RANK+/CSF-1<italic>R</italic>+osteoclast precursors, which can home to bone marrow to differentiate to mature osteoclasts in response to RANKL, IL34 and/or M-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakamichi et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Il34</italic> expression in bone marrow was not affected in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice. These mechanisms collectively may partially compensate for M-CSF function and alleviate the osteopetrotic and macrophage deficiency phenotype in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice.</p><p>Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the question on whether Adipoq-lineage progenitors consist exclusively of adipogenic cells. In addition to Adipoq-lineage progenitors, Adipoq Cre also labels other clusters. However, the expression levels of <italic>Adipoq</italic> and frequency of Adipoq+ cells in other cell populations are relatively low. For example, the integrated scRNAseq dataset we analyzed shows that <italic>Adipoq</italic> is expressed at a low level (with scaled mean expression at 0.68, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolgalev and Tikhonova, 2021</xref>) in a small proportion of MSPC-osteo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and small amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffery et al., 2022</xref>; about 4%) of osteoblasts in 8 or 12-week-old mice are Adipoq-lineage. A recent report found that in 24-week-old mice, about 15–40% of osteoblasts are marked with Adipoq Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeffery et al., 2022</xref>). This raises a few important possibilities that will need to be distinguished in future work. One possibility is that the Adipoq-lineage cells (adipo-CAR cells/MALPs) have minor or latent osteogenic potential that may become more evident under specific conditions, such as in older animals. However, balanced against this is the alternative that Adipoq-cre could primarily target a population of solely adipogenic adipo-CAR cells but that its specificity is imperfect, leading to progressive low levels of deletion in a separate population expressing very low levels of Adipoq, such as osteo-CAR cells. An additional possibility is that the Adipoq-lineage cells may themselves actually be further subdivided into multiple component cell types, including a major adipogenic and a separate minor osteogenic subpopulation. Ultimately, at the root of these issues is that Adipoq cre primarily defines one or possibly more lineages of cells rather than a cell type within those lineages. Therefore, application of further markers to fractionate the adipoq-lineage into its component cell types will be needed to resolve these possibilities, focusing on whether any potential osteogenic activity present can be fractionated away from the primary adipogenic activity present.</p><p>Of note, the <italic>Adipoq</italic> expression level and positive cell proportion are much higher in bone marrow Adipoq lineage progenitors than the levels seen in osteoblast lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolgalev and Tikhonova, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2021</xref>) or endothelial cells in bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emoto et al., 2022</xref>). For example, the MSPC-Adipo cluster (Adipoq-lineage progenitors) has 6441 cells with the highest level (scaled mean expression level at 3.01 per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolgalev and Tikhonova, 2021</xref> at Single Cell Portal) of <italic>Adipoq</italic> seen among bone marrow cells analyzed. In contrast, the MSPC-osteo cluster consists of 2247 cells with a very low <italic>Adipoq</italic> expression level (scaled mean expression level at 0.68 per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolgalev and Tikhonova, 2021</xref> at Single Cell Portal). Taken together with both average expression level and cell numbers in each cluster, the relative overall contribution to <italic>Adipoq</italic> expression by MSPC-osteo vs the Adipoq-lineage progenitors is 7.8% ([2247x0.68]/[6441x3.01]). Therefore, the expression of <italic>Adipoq</italic> in MSPC-osteo cluster is marginal compared to that in the Adipoq-lineage progenitors. These data make Adipoq as an important marker to identify bone marrow Adipoq lineage progenitors. Overall, our work not only validates prior research identifying adipoq-lineage cells, identified as MALPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), as a key osteoclast regulatory population, but also further extends the scope of their functions to encompass M-CSF production and regulation of macrophages.</p><p>In addition to its function in development and postnatal homeostasis, M-CSF is a key factor contributing to pathological bone destruction. In OVX induced osteoporosis model, we found that the extent of bone loss in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice was less than that of the control mice, and the bone mass was significantly higher in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice than control mice after OVX. These results indicate a significant role for the M-CSF produced by Adipoq + cells in estrogen-deficiency induced bone loss. Interestingly, however, no genotype by OVX interaction term was seen in two-way ANOVA, even though there is a significant difference in the post-OVX bone mass between genotypes. The difference in baseline bone mass pre-OVX between genotypes could presumably complicate and compromise the significance analysis of genotype by OVX interaction. Further study, for example, using inducible Adipoq-cre mice, is needed to compare whether Adipoq-lineage progenitors-derived M-CSF specifically regulates OVX responses or pathological bone loss induced by other stimuli, or is instead more involved in basal homeostasis. Broad blockade of M-CSF, however, is not clinically feasible because this may suppress macrophage survival and function in a variety of important tissues and organs. Our results show that lack of M-CSF in bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors does not affect macrophage populations outside of the bone marrow. These findings suggest that targeting bone marrow Adipoq-lineage progenitors themselves or the mechanisms regulating their production of M-CSF could be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent pathological bone destruction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Primary antibodies were freshly diluted in blocking buffer and were incubated with the slices overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS, secondary antibodies (1:2000 dilution with blocking buffer) were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Samples were then washed and mounted with antifade mounting solution with DAPI (Life technologies, P36941). Imaging was employed using a Zeiss Axioscan 7 Slide Scanner.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Bone marrow cells were directly flushed out by quick centrifuge (from 0 to 9400 g, approximately 15 s at room temperature) after cutting both ends of long bones, then resuspended by PBS (Corning, 21040CV) and filtered through 70 μm cell strainer (FALCON,352350). The cells were spun down at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) and Inguinal WAT (IngWAT) were isolated from mice and minced into small pieces by scissors and then digested by the digestion buffer (a-MEM [Gibco, 12561056] with 2 mg/ml collagenase II [Worthington, LS004176] and 2% BSA [Gemini Bio, 700–100 P]) for 40 min in a rotary incubator at 250 rpm at 37 °C. The cells were then filtered through 70 μm cell strainer and spun down at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. One third of spleen was mashed with the plunger end of a syringe through the 70 μm cell strainer. The splenic cells were then spun down at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Red blood cells in cell pellets were lysed by ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, A1049201). Cells were stained with antibodies in 200 μl of the staining buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, 15575020)) on ice for 30 min, and then washed by 2 ml of the staining buffer. Cells were resuspended in the staining buffer and analyzed using a FACS Symphony flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). DAPI was used for live/dead staining. Flowjo V10.7.1 was used for analysis. The same gating strategy was applied to flow samples from the control and Csf1<sup>ΔAdipoq</sup> mice. The antibodies used for flow cytometry included anti-CD45-PerCP/Cyanine5.5 (Biolegend, clone QA17A26,1:200), anti-Ly6G-Brilliant Violet 711 (Biolegend, clone 1A8, 1:200), anti-CD11b-Alexa Fluor 700 (Biolegend, clone M1/70, 1:200), anti-F4/80- APC/Cyanine7 (Biolegend, clone BM8, 1:200), and anti-Ly6C-Brilliant Violet 510 (Biolegend, clone HK1.4, 1:200).</p><p>For BrdU staining, 10-week-old female Adipoq Cre-mTmG reporter mice were injected (i.p.) with 200 mg/kg BrdU (B5002, Sigma) 24 hr and 3 hr before sacrifice. The bone marrow cells were flushed out from long bones. The bones were then cut into small pieces and digested as described in the FACS method. The bone marrow cells and the digested bone solution were collected together, filtered through 70 μm cell strainer and spun down at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Red blood cells in cell pellets were lysed by ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, A1049201). After cell viability staining (Live/Dead Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain kit, L23105 ThermoFisher Scientific) and CD45/CD31/Ter119 cell surface antigen staining, the cells were treated using eBioscience BrdU Staining Buffer (00-5525-00) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The flowcytometry was then performed as described above with the isotype control antibody (Biolegend, Clone MOPC-21, 400119, 5 μg/sample) and the anti-BrdU antibody (Biolegend, clone 3D4, 364114, 5 μg/sample).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)</title><p>Bone marrow cells from 12-week-old male Adipoq Cre-mTmG reporter mice were harvested as above.

Dnase I (2 units/ml, Sigma,4716728001) was then added. After 5 min, the digested bone solution and bone marrow cells were collected together, filtered through 70 μm cell strainer and spun down at 500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Red blood cells in cell pellets were lysed by ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, A1049201).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: William P Cawthorn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The work has potential but requires essential additional data to support the central claim that bone marrow AdipoQ-lineage progenitors are a major source of M-CSF that determines bone mass. Particularly, it is necessary for the authors to (1) test if M-CSF is also from other sources (peripheral adipose tissue, other bone cells etc.); (2) assess M-CSF protein levels using histological methods; (3) clarify the identity of AdipoQ-lineage cells; (4) assess the cortical bone properties and conduct mechanical testing of the Csf1∆AdipoQ mice; and (5) clarify if the phenotype results from the Csf1∆AdipoQ mice is exclusively from decreased M-CSF or also from the changes of other factors (eg. IL-34). In addition, the authors should consider addressing other concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Abstract:</p><p>– It would be helpful if the authors could specify how they define AdipoQ-lineage progenitors in the abstract (i.e. AdipoQCre).</p><p>– &quot;The postmenopausal osteoporosis in a mouse model&quot; is not accurate. It should be replaced by &quot;ovariectomized mice&quot;.</p><p>2. Introduction:</p><p>– RE: &quot;there is no clear evidence supporting whether osteoblasts and osteocytes express M-CSF in vivo…&quot;. A published study from one of the coauthors seems to have already addressed this issue: JBMR Plus. 4:e10080.</p><p>3. Results:</p><p>– The authors should explain briefly why they designated Adipoq+ cells in scRNAseq as MSPC-adipo. Do these cells express any MSPC markers?</p><p>– The qPCR experiment shown in Figure 1E is extremely important for supporting the major conclusion. Despite the importance, the authors examined only one gene expression (Csf1). The authors should also demonstrate expression levels of other genes that may serve as a control, such as Lpl.</p><p>– They should also clarify that Csf1 was expressed approximately 4-fold higher in AdipoQ+ cells compared to other mature adipocytes.</p><p>– RE: &quot;the bone loss extent was less in the Csf1dAdipoQ mice than in the control mice&quot; Can the authors specify which data they refer to?</p><p>4. Discussion:</p><p>– &quot;AdipoQ is exclusively expressed…&quot;: this sentence needs to be revised, as it is not entirely accurate.</p><p>- It would be helpful if the authors could also discuss the similarities and differences of bone phenotypes between AdipoQCre-driven M-CSF and RANKL CKO models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Congratulations on making this exciting discovery from scRNA-seq datasets and validating it in animal models. The functional studies indicate that AdipoQ cells in the bone marrow produce appreciable amounts of Csf1 and this is one means by which they have an outsized effect on bone remodeling. There are many strengths to the data and presentation as listed in the public comments. I have a few questions and suggestions for improving the study and manuscript.</p><p>1) AdipoQ-Cre mice are not included as a control in osteopetrosis experiments. Do you have any phenotyping data on these animals from your colony?</p><p>2) Are there any differences in cortical bone properties? Mechanical testing of Csf1∆AdipoQ mice would help to determine if they are really osteopetrotic?</p><p>3) Are there any differences in vertebral BMD in Csf1∆AdipoQ mice?</p><p>4) The phenotyping of the Csf1∆AdipoQ mice is somewhat superficial. Does IL-34 decrease in Csf1∆AdipoQ mice? What about other cytokines and transcripts? Has a scRNA-seq or even bulk RNA-seq analysis been done on the bone marrow of Csf1∆AdipoQ mice and controls to examine transcriptomic changes other than M-CSF in these animals?</p><p>5) Does adding M-CSF back Csf1∆AdipoQ bone marrow cultures induce osteoclast formation? The assay seems to have been done in medium containing phenol red, which may have slowed differentiation and is why cultures were 10 days long. What happens to osteoclast differentiation in phenol red-free medium?</p><p>6) Do AdipoQ+ cells exist in human bone marrow? If so, do these human cells produce M-CSF?</p><p>7) There are no in vitro assays of macrophage function (e.g., LPS stimulation).</p><p>8) Show SD instead of SEM in figures.</p><p>9) Figure 1A: Please label the clusters in the UMAP plot with numbers for those who are color blind.</p><p>10) Figure 1C does not appear to be the same as that generated on the Single Cell Portal (link here), which is linked to the site, according to the methods, where these data are housed (https://osf.io/ne9vj). Specifically, chondrocytes seem to make more Csf1 than shown in Figure 1C. Please explain.</p><p>11) Figure 1E. BMA and BM-AdipoQ only have two data points. Please increase to at least three. Ideally, it would be more for all groups.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>a. The most-important issue to address in this paper is whether the bone and macrophage phenotypes result exclusively from loss of M-CSF expression in bone marrow (BM) AdipoQ-lineage progenitors, or if decreased M-CSF from peripheral adipose depots also contributes to these phenotypes. The specific points are as follows:</p><p>1. Firstly, the authors repeatedly state that Csf1 expression in adipocytes or peripheral adipose tissues is minimal and therefore cannot contribute to their phenotype. For example:</p><p>i) Pages 4-5, &quot;AdipoQ+ cells in peripheral adipose tissue and mature bone marrow adipocytes almost do not express M-CSF&quot;. Please can you provide evidence to support this, e.g. a reference or some direct data? As noted above, transcriptomic profiles show relatively high expression of Csf1 in mouse white adipose tissue, suggesting that such peripheral adipose tissues do contribute to systemic M-CSF.</p><p>ii) Page 5, &quot;&quot;Besides bone marrow, peripheral adiposes contain a large amount of AdipoQ+ mature adipocytes. These cells however do not produce Csf1 (Figure 1E).&quot;</p><p>iii) Page 7: &quot;peripheral AdipoQ+ adipocytes… express neither RANKL nor M-CSF (our findings and (29)). The unique expression of M-CSF and RANKL by bone marrow AdipoQ-lineage progenitors is a feature that distinguishes this cell population from other adipose depots.&quot; But this is not the case: the Fan 2017 paper does not assess M-CSF expression, while many studies demonstrate that white and brown adipocytes do express M-CSF</p><p>However, there is ample evidence showing that adipocytes and adipose tissue have high M-CSF expression and that this has biological functions, e.g.</p><p>– https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12257-020-0023-8</p><p>– https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC508735/</p><p>– https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/tools/profileGraph.cgi?ID=GDS3142:1460220_a_at</p><p>2. Secondly, qPCR is used to compare Csf1 expression between mature adipocytes and the BM AdipoQ-lineage progenitors (Figure 1E). This seems to be the basis of the authors' conclusion that there is minimal M-CSF production from peripheral adipose tissue. However, qPCR comparison across such different tissue types is fraught with difficulties and is highly dependent on using a suitable housekeeping gene. Here, Gapdh is used as a housekeeping gene; please show the expression of Gapdh across the five cell types. If expression is highly variable then this will greatly influence the normalized Csf1 values. this is expressed at a similar level across the five cell types, or is its expression very variable? It is also more informative to assess protein expression, rather than transcript expression.</p><p>Please address these issues as follows:</p><p>3. To better interpret figure 1E please include a supplemental figure showing Gapdh expression across the five cell types. I also recommend that you use several housekeeping genes (e.g. Gapdh, Tbp, Ppia, rn18s), calculate the geometric mean of their expression, and normalise Csf1 to this mean value (Vandesompele et al., 2002).</p><p>4. It is essential to compare Csf1 expression in peripheral adipose tissue vs whole bone marrow in control vs KO mice. Ideally, you would analyse Csf1 transcripts in adipocytes and stromal vascular cells from peripheral adipose tissue, to determine the cellular source of the Csf1. You would then analyse M-CSF protein in whole adipose tissue and whole bone marrow from the control vs KO mice. If both of these analyses cannot be done (transcript in fractionated tissue; protein in whole tissues) then the most-informative analysis would be for M-CSF protein in whole tissues. This would show if the KO alters overall protein expression in peripheral adipose tissue and/or in bone marrow.</p><p>b. AdipoQ-Cre cannot distinguish between MSPC-Adipo and MSPC-Osteo.</p><p>A second major point is that it is not clear if the BM AdipoQ-lineage progenitors correspond to the MSPC-Adipo cells only, or if they also include the MSPC-Osteo cells described in figure 1. Indeed, the MSPC-Osteo cells also express Adipoq (Figure 1D) and even low-level Cre expression from the Adipoq promoter will be sufficient to ablate Csf1 in these cells. This is an issue because on page 7 you conclude, &quot;These results together with the scRNAseq data in Figure 1 demonstrate that AdipoQ-lineage progenitor cells in bone marrow produce substantially more M-CSF than osteoblast lineage cells&quot;, while in the results (page 4) you state, &quot;Given that bone marrow AdipoQ-lineage progenitors constitute only about 0.08% of bone marrow cells (Suppl. Figure 1), these results support that bone marrow AdipoQ-lineage progenitors are the major cellular source of M-CSF expression in the bone marrow.&quot; However, if Csf1 is also deleted in many of the MSPC-Osteo cells then you can't draw this conclusion. Are you able to check if the Csf1-deltaAdipoQ model maintains Csf1 expression in the MSPC-Osteo cells while ablating Csf1 in the MSPC-Adipo cells? If this cannot be assessed experimentally then please update the Discussion to clearly state this limitation of the model. Please also update Supplemental Figure 1 to show the % of MSPC-Osteo cells in the bone marrow (if this % is very high then it adds to the concern that deletion of Csf1 in the MSPC-Osteo cells may be influencing the decrease in total Csf1 expression in BMSCs).</p><p>References</p><p>Berry, R., and Rodeheffer, M.S.

The inclusion of scRNAseq data from human bone marrow is particularly welcome and informative, as is the analysis of M-CSF protein in bone marrow of the control and CKO mice. I and the other two reviewers also questioned the identity of the MSPC-Adipo and MSPC-Osteo populations and whether Adipoq expression can sufficiently distinguish these. Here, the authors have now convincingly explained why Adipoq is a suitably robust marker for the MSPC-Adipo population.</p><p>Despite these very helpful and informative responses, the following issues remain to be adequately addressed:</p><p>1. Does the CKO phenotype result only from a lack of M-CSF production from BM Adipoq-lineage progenitors, or do other cells contribute to this phenotype?</p><p>This was raised by Reviewer 1 (point 1) and me (Reviewer 3, point 1). One concern is that, because WAT has high expression of M-CSF (Csf1), and because Adipoq is expressed in WAT, the Adipoq-Cre may delete Csf1 in WAT and this may contribute to the CKO phenotype. The authors have tried to address this in several ways, including analysis of M-CSF protein in WAT adipocytes and SVF from control mice, and updating their qPCR analysis of Csf1 expression across various cell types (Figure 3A and 3D in the revised manuscript). These updates are helpful and demonstrate clearly that M-CSF is produced from SVF, but not adipocytes, of WAT. Together with previous data showing that Adipoq-Cre does not target WAT SVF, these data suggest that the CKO model will not have altered M-CSF expression in WAT. However, the way to address this, as requested in the previous reviews, is to measure the expression of Csf1 transcripts and/or M-CSF protein in the adipocyte and SVF fractions of WAT from control vs CKO mice. The authors have not done this, and therefore it remains to be conclusively proven that the CKO phenotype results exclusively from M-CSF depletion in the BM Adipoq-lineage progenitor cells. I agree that this is the likely explanation, but the contribution of WAT SVF cells cannot be conclusively ruled out. Therefore, I think the authors must either measure Csf1 transcripts (and/or M-CSF protein) in the WAT SVF of the control vs CKO mice, thereby fully addressing this possibility; or they should update the Discussion clearly stating that this possibility is one remaining limitation of the present study, however unlikely it may be.</p><p>2. Related to the previous point, the authors have updated the qPCR analysis (now Figure 3A) by using both Gapdh and Actb as housekeeping genes. However, I didn't see Actb data in the source data file. Please can this be included? The source data does show that Gapdh is relatively consistent across the cell types, but its expression is still lowest in the BM Adipoq-lineage progenitors and therefore this lower housekeeping gene expression will be increasing the apparent Csf1 expression in these cells. In addition, this figure compares the BM Adipoq-lineage progenitors only to adipocytes; it would be more informative to compare the expression to WAT SVF since we now know that it is the SVF, not the adipocytes, that is the source of M-CSF in WAT.</p><p>3. Contrary to the authors' conclusions, their data show that the CKO does not alter the effect of OVX on bone loss (Figure 7). Both I (point k.) and Reviewer 1 (point 4) questioned the conclusions from the OVX study. The data for this clearly show that the genotype influences bone parameters in both sham and OVX mice, but it does not obviously alter the OVX effect within each genotype. The authors have tried to address this by showing the % change that OVX causes for each parameter, in each genotype (Figure 7C). This is not illogical, but it is also not statistically informative and therefore doesn't address our original critique. I asked the authors to do a 2-way ANOVA and test if there is a significant &quot;genotype x OVX&quot; interaction, i.e. does the CKO alter the OVX effect? This was a very straightforward request, but the authors have not done it. Thankfully, they have provided the source data, so I decided to do the analysis myself (my analysis file (Prism) can be downloaded at https://www.dropbox.com/t/WAZb3y34d8p4Skzn). This analysis shows that there is a genotype x OVX interaction for trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp), but not for any of the other parameters tested. I decided to do a further 3-way ANOVA, across all five of the parameters tested (normalizing each to the average for each parameter) to give even more power to detect any genotype x OVX interactions. This reveals a &quot;genotype x OVX&quot; P value of 0.947, which demonstrates conclusively that there is no overall effect of the CKO on OVX-induced bone loss.</p><p>This conclusion is robust and does not undermine interest in the manuscript: it isn't essential that the BM Adipoq-lineage-derived M-CSF contributes to OVX-induced bone loss, so the authors shouldn't feel compelled to make this conclusion when the data don't support it. Indeed, it is interesting that BM Adipoq-lineage-derived M-CSF may influence bone remodelling in some circumstances but not in others.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82118.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The work has potential but requires essential additional data to support the central claim that bone marrow AdipoQ-lineage progenitors are a major source of M-CSF that determines bone mass.

Does IL-34 decrease in Csf1∆AdipoQ mice? What about other cytokines and transcripts?

General osteoclastogenic cultures in our lab usually take 4-5 days but not 10 days to obtain giant osteoclasts because exogenous M-CSF (20ng/ml) and RANKL are both added to the cultures, which facilitate the differentiation process. However, in this paper, we wanted to test if endogenous MCSF, which level is lower than that of exogenous M-CSF we usually use for culture, is able to induce osteoclastogenesis. The WT cell cultures took 10 days to differentiate to mature osteoclasts because exogenous M-CSF was not added.

The most-important issue to address in this paper is whether the bone and macrophage phenotypes result exclusively from loss of M-CSF expression in bone marrow (BM) AdipoQ-lineage progenitors, or if decreased M-CSF from peripheral adipose depots also contributes to these phenotypes. The specific points are as follows:</p><p>1. Firstly, the authors repeatedly state that Csf1 expression in adipocytes or peripheral adipose tissues is minimal and therefore cannot contribute to their phenotype. For example:</p><p>i) Pages 4-5, &quot;AdipoQ+ cells in peripheral adipose tissue and mature bone marrow adipocytes almost do not express M-CSF&quot;. Please can you provide evidence to support this, e.g. a reference or some direct data? As noted above, transcriptomic profiles show relatively high expression of Csf1 in mouse white adipose tissue, suggesting that such peripheral adipose tissues do contribute to systemic M-CSF.</p><p>ii) Page 5, &quot;&quot;Besides bone marrow, peripheral adiposes contain a large amount of AdipoQ+ mature adipocytes. These cells however do not produce Csf1 (Figure 1E).&quot;</p><p>iii) Page 7: &quot;peripheral AdipoQ+ adipocytes… express neither RANKL nor M-CSF (our findings and (29)). The unique expression of M-CSF and RANKL by bone marrow AdipoQ-lineage progenitors is a feature that distinguishes this cell population from other adipose depots.&quot; But this is not the case: the Fan 2017 paper does not assess M-CSF expression, while many studies demonstrate that white and brown adipocytes do express M-CSF</p><p>However, there is ample evidence showing that adipocytes and adipose tissue have high M-CSF expression and that this has biological functions, e.g.</p><p>– https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12257-020-0023-8</p><p>– https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC508735/</p><p>– https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/tools/profileGraph.cgi?ID=GDS3142:1460220_a_at</p></disp-quote><p>Answers to (i) and (ii): We performed western blot to analyze M-CSF protein expression in peripheral adipose.

On the contrary, M-CSF was nearly undetectable in the peripheral mature adipocytes isolated from adipose (Figure 3D). These data collectively support that mature adipocytes are not a significant source of M-CSF as evidenced by nearly undetectable M-CSF expression compared to the Adipoq-lineage progenitors.

However, qPCR comparison across such different tissue types is fraught with difficulties and is highly dependent on using a suitable housekeeping gene. Here, Gapdh is used as a housekeeping gene; please show the expression of Gapdh across the five cell types. If expression is highly variable then this will greatly influence the normalized Csf1 values. this is expressed at a similar level across the five cell types, or is its expression very variable? It is also more informative to assess protein expression, rather than transcript expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We increased the replicates of each group cells in Figure 3A (the old Figure 1E) to five/group.

To better interpret figure 1E please include a supplemental figure showing Gapdh expression across the five cell types. I also recommend that you use several housekeeping genes (e.g. Gapdh, Tbp, Ppia, rn18s), calculate the geometric mean of their expression, and normalise Csf1 to this mean value (Vandesompele et al., 2002).</p></disp-quote><p>The GAPDH expression is pretty similar among samples (Source data of the cycles provided along with the manuscript).</p><p>According to the reviewer’s recommendation, we used geometric mean of Gapdh and Actb expression, and happily found that the results of Csf1 expression turned out even better, with 20-fold higher in AdipoQ lineage progenitor cells than in other mature adipocytes. We appreciate the reviewer’ recommendation that helped us obtain more robust results. The data are now shown in Figure 3A and Figure 3-Suppl Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is essential to compare Csf1 expression in peripheral adipose tissue vs whole bone marrow in control vs KO mice. Ideally, you would analyse Csf1 transcripts in adipocytes and stromal vascular cells from peripheral adipose tissue, to determine the cellular source of the Csf1. You would then analyse M-CSF protein in whole adipose tissue and whole bone marrow from the control vs KO mice. If both of these analyses cannot be done (transcript in fractionated tissue; protein in whole tissues) then the most-informative analysis would be for M-CSF protein in whole tissues. This would show if the KO alters overall protein expression in peripheral adipose tissue and/or in bone marrow.</p></disp-quote><p>As addressed to Q1, Q2, we have examined M-CSF at protein levels; please also refer to the answers to Q1, Q2 and Figure 3B, C, D. Basically, M-CSF was nearly undetectable in the peripheral mature adipocytes isolated from adipose (Figure 3D), or mature adipocytes in bone marrow (Figure 3C). M-CSF is expressed in SVF, but AdipoQ is not (Figure 3D). We also showed a drastic decrease in M-CSF protein expression in bone marrow AdipoQ+ cells in C<italic>sf1<sup>∆AdipoQ</sup></italic> mice compared to the WT control mice. The results are shown in Figure 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. AdipoQ-Cre cannot distinguish between MSPC-Adipo and MSPC-Osteo.</p><p>A second major point is that it is not clear if the BM AdipoQ-lineage progenitors correspond to the MSPC-Adipo cells only, or if they also include the MSPC-Osteo cells described in figure 1. Indeed, the MSPC-Osteo cells also express Adipoq (Figure 1D) and even low-level Cre expression from the Adipoq promoter will be sufficient to ablate Csf1 in these cells. This is an issue because on page 7 you conclude, &quot;These results together with the scRNAseq data in Figure 1 demonstrate that AdipoQ-lineage progenitor cells in bone marrow produce substantially more M-CSF than osteoblast lineage cells&quot;, while in the results (page 4) you state, &quot;Given that bone marrow AdipoQ-lineage progenitors constitute only about 0.08% of bone marrow cells (Suppl. Figure 1), these results support that bone marrow AdipoQ-lineage progenitors are the major cellular source of M-CSF expression in the bone marrow.&quot; However, if Csf1 is also deleted in many of the MSPC-Osteo cells then you can't draw this conclusion. Are you able to check if the Csf1-deltaAdipoQ model maintains Csf1 expression in the MSPC-Osteo cells while ablating Csf1 in the MSPC-Adipo cells? If this cannot be assessed experimentally then please update the Discussion to clearly state this limitation of the model. Please also update Supplemental Figure 1 to show the % of MSPC-Osteo cells in the bone marrow (if this % is very high then it adds to the concern that deletion of Csf1 in the MSPC-Osteo cells may be influencing the decrease in total Csf1 expression in BMSCs).</p></disp-quote><p>The molecular features between MSPC-Adipo and MSPC-osteo are distinct (Figure 1). The MSPC-Adipo cluster (AdipoQ-lineage progenitors) has 6441 cells with the highest level (scaled mean expression level at 3.01) of AdipoQ among bone marrow. In contrast, the MSPC-osteo cluster consists of 2247 cells with a very low AdipoQ expression level (scaled mean expression level at 0.68). Taken together with both average expression level and cell numbers in each cluster, the relative overall contribution to AdipoQ expression by MSPC-osteo vs MSPC-Adipo is 7.8% ((2247 x 0.68)/(6441 x 3.01)). Therefore, the expression of AdipoQ in MSPC-osteo cluster is marginal compared to that in MSPC-Adipo. The major AdipoQ Cre driven cells are MSPC-adipo in bone marrow.

The inclusion of scRNAseq data from human bone marrow is particularly welcome and informative, as is the analysis of M-CSF protein in bone marrow of the control and CKO mice. I and the other two reviewers also questioned the identity of the MSPC-Adipo and MSPC-Osteo populations and whether Adipoq expression can sufficiently distinguish these. Here, the authors have now convincingly explained why Adipoq is a suitably robust marker for the MSPC-Adipo population.</p><p>Despite these very helpful and informative responses, the following issues remain to be adequately addressed:</p><p>1. Does the CKO phenotype result only from a lack of M-CSF production from BM Adipoq-lineage progenitors, or do other cells contribute to this phenotype?</p><p>This was raised by Reviewer 1 (point 1) and me (Reviewer 3, point 1). One concern is that, because WAT has high expression of M-CSF (Csf1), and because Adipoq is expressed in WAT, the Adipoq-Cre may delete Csf1 in WAT and this may contribute to the CKO phenotype. The authors have tried to address this in several ways, including analysis of M-CSF protein in WAT adipocytes and SVF from control mice, and updating their qPCR analysis of Csf1 expression across various cell types (Figure 3A and 3D in the revised manuscript). These updates are helpful and demonstrate clearly that M-CSF is produced from SVF, but not adipocytes, of WAT. Together with previous data showing that Adipoq-Cre does not target WAT SVF, these data suggest that the CKO model will not have altered M-CSF expression in WAT. However, the way to address this, as requested in the previous reviews, is to measure the expression of Csf1 transcripts and/or M-CSF protein in the adipocyte and SVF fractions of WAT from control vs CKO mice. The authors have not done this, and therefore it remains to be conclusively proven that the CKO phenotype results exclusively from M-CSF depletion in the BM Adipoq-lineage progenitor cells. I agree that this is the likely explanation, but the contribution of WAT SVF cells cannot be conclusively ruled out. Therefore, I think the authors must either measure Csf1 transcripts (and/or M-CSF protein) in the WAT SVF of the control vs CKO mice, thereby fully addressing this possibility; or they should update the Discussion clearly stating that this possibility is one remaining limitation of the present study, however unlikely it may be.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this relevant point. Indeed, we have performed the requested experiment of measuring Csf1 expression in the SVF, finding no evidence of alteration in Csf1f/f;adipoq-cre mice (new Figure 4-Suppl Figure 2). We note our additional data discussed by the reviewer and provided in Figure 3D demonstrating that WAT adipocytes do not express Csf1/M-CSF (Figure 3D). These results are consistent with the additional data we added demonstrating that adipoq-cre does not target SVF cells (new Figure 4-Suppl Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to the previous point, the authors have updated the qPCR analysis (now Figure 3A) by using both Gapdh and Actb as housekeeping genes. However, I didn't see Actb data in the source data file. Please can this be included? The source data does show that Gapdh is relatively consistent across the cell types, but its expression is still lowest in the BM Adipoq-lineage progenitors and therefore this lower housekeeping gene expression will be increasing the apparent Csf1 expression in these cells. In addition, this figure compares the BM Adipoq-lineage progenitors only to adipocytes; it would be more informative to compare the expression to WAT SVF since we now know that it is the SVF, not the adipocytes, that is the source of M-CSF in WAT.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this question. The Actb data has been provided in ‘Figure 3—figure supplement 1’ source data. The expression of Actb is also relatively consistent across the cell types.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to compare expression of Csf1 in BM adipoq-lineage progenitors to WAT SVF, and we have added additional data to Figure 3A showing that WAT SVF expresses Csf1, the levels of which are lower than those expressed in the BM adipoq-lineage progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Contrary to the authors' conclusions, their data show that the CKO does not alter the effect of OVX on bone loss (Figure 7). Both I (point k.) and Reviewer 1 (point 4) questioned the conclusions from the OVX study. The data for this clearly show that the genotype influences bone parameters in both sham and OVX mice, but it does not obviously alter the OVX effect within each genotype. The authors have tried to address this by showing the % change that OVX causes for each parameter, in each genotype (Figure 7C). This is not illogical, but it is also not statistically informative and therefore doesn't address our original critique. I asked the authors to do a 2-way ANOVA and test if there is a significant &quot;genotype x OVX&quot; interaction, i.e. does the CKO alter the OVX effect? This was a very straightforward request, but the authors have not done it. Thankfully, they have provided the source data, so I decided to do the analysis myself (my analysis file (Prism) can be downloaded at https://www.dropbox.com/t/WAZb3y34d8p4Skzn). This analysis shows that there is a genotype x OVX interaction for trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp), but not for any of the other parameters tested. I decided to do a further 3-way ANOVA, across all five of the parameters tested (normalizing each to the average for each parameter) to give even more power to detect any genotype x OVX interactions. This reveals a &quot;genotype x OVX&quot; P value of 0.947, which demonstrates conclusively that there is no overall effect of the CKO on OVX-induced bone loss.</p><p>This conclusion is robust and does not undermine interest in the manuscript: it isn't essential that the BM Adipoq-lineage-derived M-CSF contributes to OVX-induced bone loss, so the authors shouldn't feel compelled to make this conclusion when the data don't support it. Indeed, it is interesting that BM Adipoq-lineage-derived M-CSF may influence bone remodelling in some circumstances but not in others.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which is well taken. In OVX induced osteoporosis model, we found that the extent of bone loss in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice was less than that of the control mice, and the bone mass was significantly higher in Csf1<sup>∆Adipoq</sup> mice than control mice after OVX. These results indicate a significant role for the M-CSF produced by Adipoq+ cells in estrogen-deficiency induced bone loss. Interestingly, however, as the reviewer commented, no genotype by OVX interaction term was seen in two-way ANOVA, even though there is a significant difference in the post-OVX bone mass between genotypes. The difference in baseline bone mass pre-OVX between genotypes could presumably complicate and compromise the significance analysis of genotype by OVX interaction. Further study, for example, using inducible Adipoq-cre mice, is needed to compare whether Adipoqlineage progenitors-derived M-CSF specifically regulates OVX responses or pathological bone loss induced by other stimuli, or is instead more involved in basal homeostasis.
