deleterious immediate and long-term consequences. Yet the molecular mechanisms and genetic targets promoting the selective vulnerability of different neural subtypes to dysfunction and degeneration remain unclear. Translating experimental models of blunt force trauma in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to concussion in mice, we identify a conserved neuroprotective mechanism in which reduction of mitochondrial electron flux through complex IV suppresses trauma-induced degeneration of the highly vulnerable dopaminergic neurons. Reducing cytochrome C oxidase function elevates mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, which signal through the cytosolic hypoxia inducing transcription factor, <italic>Hif1a</italic>, to promote hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDHE1α. This critical enzyme initiates the Warburg shunt, which drives energetic reallocation from mitochondrial respiration to astrocyte-mediated glycolysis in a neuroprotective manner. These studies demonstrate a conserved process in which glycolytic preconditioning suppresses Parkinson-like hypersensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to trauma-induced degeneration via redox signaling and the Warburg effect.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury that results from a sudden blow or jolt to the head. Symptoms can include a passing headache, dizziness, confusion or sensitivity to light, but experiencing multiple concussions can have drastic repercussions in later life.</p><p>Studies of professional athletes have shown that those who experience one or more concussions are prone to developing Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, two well-known neurodegenerative diseases. Both conditions involve the progressive loss or breakdown of nerve cells, called neurons. But exactly how this so-called neurodegeneration of brain cells stems from the original, physical injury remains unclear.</p><p>Head trauma may cause damage to the structural support of a cell or disrupt the flow of electrical impulses through neurons. Energy use and production in damaged cells could shift into overdrive to repair the damage. The chemical properties of different types of brain cells could also make some more vulnerable to trauma than others. Besides neurons, star-shaped support cells in the brain called astrocytes, which may have some protective ability, could also be affected.</p><p>To investigate which cells may be more susceptible to traumatic injuries, Solano Fonseca et al. modelled the impacts of concussion-like head trauma in roundworms (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) and mice. In both animals, one type of neuron was extremely vulnerable to cell death after trauma. Neurons that release dopamine, a chemical involved in cell-to-cell communication and the brain’s reward system, showed signs of cell damage and deteriorated after injury. Dopaminergic cells, as these cells are called, are involved in motor coordination, and the loss of dopaminergic cells has been linked to both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>Astrocytes, however, had a role in reducing the death of dopaminergic neurons after trauma. In experiments, astrocytes appeared to restore the balance of energy production to meet the increased energy demands of impacted neurons. Single-cell analyses showed that genes involved in metabolism were switched on in astrocytes to produce energy via an alternative pathway. This energetic shift facilitated via astrocytes may help mitigate against some damage to dopamine-producing neurons after trauma, reducing cell death.</p><p>This work furthers our understanding of cellular changes in the concussed brain. More research will be required to better characterise how this immediate trauma to cells, and the subsequent loss of dopaminergic neurons, impacts brain health long-term. Efforts to design effective therapies to slow or reverse these changes could then follow.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>traumatic brain injury</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-2061-20210327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>Peter M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG061338</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>Peter M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR150089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>Peter M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Clayton Foundation for Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>Peter M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00AG042495</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>Peter M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Promoting a Warburg-like shift in astrocytic metabolism through reduced mitochondrial electron transport accommodates the energetic burden caused by brain trauma without overwhelming cellular respiration and redox to salvage dopaminergic neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Selective vulnerability of different neuronal subtypes to dysfunction, degeneration, and death underlies all neurological diseases. Differential interplay between genetic and environmental factors contribute to this neuronal selectivity. Environmental stimuli have the capacity to trigger pathogenic cascades contingent on genetic factors. Such is the case for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and concussion, in which the initial biomechanical insult precipitates numerous cellular and systemic alterations with the potential to promote neurological dysfunction and progressive neurodegeneration. In particular, ionic imbalances, cytoskeletal disruption, aberrant proteostasis, genomic instability, and mitochondrial dysfunction within neurons and support cells initiate systemic abnormalities including metabolic impairment, vascular disruption, inflammation, blood-brain barrier defects, and reduced cerebral blood-flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giza et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, the stochastic nature of the mechanical insult has complicated our ability to define the underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration. It remains unclear whether the inherent chemical properties of different neuronal subtypes confer varying degrees of vulnerability to trauma-induced neurodegeneration. Additionally, the genetic contribution to this widespread disorder is poorly understood, genetic effectors are likely to amplify the cellular and systemic aberrations initiated by the mechanical insult. Thereby, we hypothesize that genetic targeting and modulation may be sufficient to suppress the ensuing neurodegeneration after concussive brain injury.</p><p>Metabolic fluctuations in the brain occurring with age or injury have been linked with neurological health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camandola and Mattson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marino et al., 2007</xref>). The neurometabolic cascade resulting from concussion is characterized by erratic fluctuations in metabolism, which are hypothesized to accommodate the energetic demand required for neuronal repolarization and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giza and Hovda, 2001</xref>). Brain energetics relies heavily on two metabolic pathways including mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cytosolic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasischke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pellerin and Magistretti, 1994</xref>). The astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) entails astrocytic production and transport of the glycolytic by-product, lactate, to neurons which preferentially oxidize it rather than glucose to meet their energetic demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Magistretti et al., 1999</xref>). Immediately following injury, rodent brains display signs of decreased oxidative phosphorylation that can persist for weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilmer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiong et al., 1997</xref>). Conversely, the injured brain transiently elevates normoxic glycolysis in humans and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergsneider et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sokoloff et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshino et al., 1991</xref>), suggesting an energetic reallocation through astrocytic means. This metabolic shift is a phenomena observed in cancer cells and is termed the Warburg effect, in which aerobic glycolysis is favored over oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Warburg, 1956</xref>). Thus, the injured brain initially undergoes a Warburg-like response, but how this metabolic shift occurs within the astrocyte-neuron axis and its ability to impact neurological function and degeneration after concussion is not well understood.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conserved hypersensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to trauma-induced degeneration</title><p>In contrast to the cellular and network complexity of the human brain, the adult nematode, <italic>C. elegans,</italic> possesses 302 post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">White et al., 1986</xref>). A simple nervous system offers the opportunity to rapidly screen different neural subtypes and gene products in pursuit of uncovering neurodegenerative mechanisms that translate to the mammalian brain. To this end, we developed a collision-based, rapid deceleration model of trauma in which high-frequency, multidirectional agitation delivers a well-calibrated injury to a large population of worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Egge et al., 2021</xref>). To determine whether the inherent biochemical properties of different neural subtypes impart variable sensitivity to blunt force trauma, dopaminergic, GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic neurons were individually monitored using targeted GFP expression. Fluorescence retention in individual neurons housed in the central nerve ring was measured to assess viability at various time points post-trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nass et al., 2002</xref>). When compared to age-matched non-injured counterparts, dopaminergic neurons displayed the greatest reduction in fluorescence with a 42.1% (+/−1.4%) loss in signal intensity within 24 hr after injury, indicative of elevated sensitivity to degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Microscopic examination of dopaminergic neurons revealed phenotypes characteristic of neuronal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gennarelli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kilinc et al., 2009</xref>) 24 hr after injury, including fluorescence beading in dendritic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conserved vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to trauma-induced degeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Post-trauma GFP retention in different <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuronal subtypes by large-particle flow cytometry. n=two sorts, n=1181 worms (dopaminergic), n=1265 worms (GABAergic), n=1115 worms (glutamatergic), n=3139 worms (serotonergic), and n=1117 worms (cholinergic).

This injury impaired immediate righting reflex response, indicating temporary loss of consciousness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Seven days after injury, dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra exhibited signs of increased apoptosis as evidenced by enhanced immunofluorescence staining of cleaved caspase-3, and a 59.06% (+/−3.03%) loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons was observed 28 days post-trauma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Open-head models of rodent brain injury consistently report necrotic tissue loss at or near the lesion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hall et al., 2005</xref>). Yet, one study demonstrates neuronal loss within the substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, closed-head brain injury without cranial fracture revealed no significant cleaved caspase-3 staining in the hippocampus, thalamus and visual cortex seven days post-injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–I</xref>). Furthermore, neuroinflammation was not evident in the immunolabeling of microglia (IBA1) with CD68-positive inflammatory cytoplasmic granules or in the transcriptional activation of known inflammatory targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J–K</xref>). Dopaminergic neurons within the midbrain comprise the nigrostriatal circuit, which influences voluntary movement. In concussed mice, we observed reduced latency on the accelerating rotarod and decreased resting state ambulation coincident with dopaminergic degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Thus, modeling blunt force trauma in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and concussive injury in mice demonstrate conserved hypersensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to biomechanical insult.</p><p>To determine the physical strain on brain regions proximal and distal to the injury site, we developed a computational biophysical model of TBI. Specifications for our closed-head trauma device were incorporated into a detailed finite element model (FEM) with ~2.5 million 3D solid elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). To capture stress and strain across the entire brain, six distinct material properties were assigned to accurately represent varying brain regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Biophysical modeling revealed a stress wave propagating throughout the mouse brain due to linear impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). By FEM analysis, a peak effective stress of 22.8 kPa (corresponding principal strain of 8.3%) first appeared in the cortex region at 0.31 ms. Then, stress propagated to 28.62 kPa (corresponding principal strain of 23.6% at the thalamus and 18.5% at the substantia nigra) at 0.85 ms post-injury in the thalamus and substantia nigra region. After impacting, a stress wave caused another peak effective stress of around 30 kPa (corresponding principal strain of 40.9% at the brainstem region and 27.0% at the thalamus region) at 1.64 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Thus, dopaminergic neurons may be sensitized to biomechanical insults due to inherent physiological properties since non-invasive, linear impact generates a strain within the midbrain comparable to brain regions closer to the impact site that lack evidence of neuronal death.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Concussive head trauma propagates strain throughout the brain.</title><p>Heat map of representative brain shows predicted maximum principal strain at (<bold>A</bold>) 0.85 ms and (<bold>B</bold>) 1.64 ms after initial impact.

Supporting this conserved response, we observed HIF1α protein stabilization in <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1K</xref>) as well as transcriptional upregulation of established glycolytic <italic>Hif1a</italic> targets in <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brains, including critical enzymes in the Warburg shunt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicates that mild elevation of ROS caused by reduced ETC function, promotes a <italic>Hif1a</italic> mediated Warburg-like effect in the brain, which reduces the chance of overwhelming mitochondrial respiratory capacity under the strong energetic demand of TBI. To examine the necessity of this Warburg shift in our neuroprotective model, we administered the pharmacological Warburg inhibitor, dichloroacetate (DCA), and observed that <italic>Surf1</italic> mutants were no longer protected against trauma-induced neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1R</xref>). Consistent with earlier reports of rodent brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lazzarino et al., 2019</xref>) and SURF1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), <italic>pdp-1</italic> expression was repressed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> after blunt force injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>).

Thus, modulating PDC activity through the key regulatory factors is sufficient to suppress trauma-induced neurodegeneration in both mice and worms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The molecular details of TBI and its immediate and long-term consequences can be discovered using a translational animal model approach. To this end, we describe a comparative animal model to identify conserved molecular mechanisms operating in TBI. The worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> is amenable to high throughput genetic, biochemical, and behavioral studies, while the mouse is used to further uncover and validate conserved genetic targets and molecular mechanisms. These complementary models allowed us to characterize an evolutionary conserved, hypersensitive neuronal subtype to physical insult. Rather than being a stochastic mechanism of progressive tissue degeneration dictated by the type and site of injury, the physiological properties and regulatory mechanisms inherent to different neuronal subtypes likely determine their vulnerability to trauma. This is evidenced by sensitivity of dopaminergic neurons to biomechanical insult in both our randomized, high-frequency trauma model in worms and concussive injury in mice. Furthermore, these complementary models were used to demonstrate that genetic modification of a single gene can suppress degeneration of this neuronal subtype following concussive injury.</p><p>Pharmacological induction of Parkinsonian phenotypes, including death of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, requires highly oxidative drugs that irreversibly inhibit mitochondrial ETC complexes I and III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Subramaniam and Chesselet, 2013</xref>). Yet, our studies demonstrate that ETC complex IV insufficiency protects dopaminergic neurons from trauma-induced degeneration. We attribute these neuroprotective effects to a metabolic shift away from mitochondrial respiration, which minimizes or even abolishes transient oxidative stress in the neuron and suppresses dopaminergic degeneration. Although often thought of as unavoidable toxic byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation, ROS can have beneficial roles in the cell as a signaling molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guzy et al., 2005</xref>). In our complementary models of blunt force injury, we believe that both toxic and protective mechanisms of ROS are operating, which historically has been difficult to discern.</p><p>Trauma-induced hyperglycolysis was reported decades ago yet its cellular resolution and pathophysiological role have remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergsneider et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carpenter et al., 2015</xref>). The astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle is a crucial mechanism by which the brain maintains energetic homeostasis. Perturbations to this system have been reported in neurodegenerative disorders and contribute to disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mason, 2017</xref>). Our data suggests that preemptively repressing mitochondrial respiration initiates a Warburg-like response in astrocytes as an attempt to restore homeostatic energetics. Thus, the injured brain likely induces hyperglycolysis in astrocytes as a protective mechanism to mitigate the oxidative damage resulting from over-activated mitochondrial respiration. Cerebral metabolic preconditioning presents a plausible prophylactic method for individuals at higher risk for TBI. Interestingly, neuroinflammation does not correlate with the rapid emergence of dopaminergic neurodegeneration in our study. However, neuroinflammation and other factors likely contribute to the later stages of this neurodegenerative condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McKee et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, longitudinal studies are required to further characterize disease progression, including neuroinflammation and proteotoxicity, after the initial loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Adult mice of at least 8 weeks of age were used in this study. <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3698949">MGI:3698949</ext-link>) were obtained from Massimo Zeviani (University of Cambridge).

The modular weight system consisted of a 50 ml polypropylene conical tube filled with lead buckshot, which weighted 220 g when filled. Before injury, mice were anesthetized with vaporized isoflurane/oxygen in a chamber connected to an inhalation anesthesia system (Cat. No. 901810; VetEquip). Vaporizer settings were set to 3% USP grade isoflurane and 2.5 lpm USP grade oxygen. After being anesthetized, mice were placed on a thick memory foam cushion resting on a height-adjustable platform. Once the desired site of impact was localized on the head of mice, the impactor tip was placed directly in contact with that site and the weight was dropped by activating an electronic trigger. After mice were injured, they were placed on their backs to record their righting reflex recovery time and allowed to recover. After recovery, mice were placed back in their cage with food and water ad libitum. Control mice received only anesthesia and were not subjected to impact, but their righting reflex recovery time was also recorded in the same manner as the injured mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Finite element analysis</title><p>Biomechanical responses of the mouse brain under impact were analyzed using the commercial finite element (FE) code ABAQUS (Dessault Systemes Simulia Corp., Providence RI).

Ambulation was measured via laser beam breaks for 5 days in mice housed individually in cages equipped with laser beams and other probes meant to determine changes in metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA extraction</title><p>Four biological repeats of age-matched adult <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brains were collected for each of the following conditions: <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> uninjured, <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> injured, <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> uninjured, <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> injured at time-points 2 hr post-injury and 7 days post-injury. Mouse brains were harvested in TRIzol (Cat. No. 15596018; Thermo Fisher Scientific), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Brains were triturated with syringes and freeze-thawed three times, followed by a chloroform/isopropanol extraction process. The RNA pellets were washed twice with ethanol, air-dried, and reconstituted in 20 μl ddH<sub>2</sub>O. RNA quality (260/280, 260/230 ratio) and concentration was determined using the DS-11 FX+ spectrophotometer (DeNovix, Inc, Wilmington, DE).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Illumina sequencing RNAseq analysis</title><p>Quality control, mRNA purification, and paired-end 150 bp Illumina sequencing were performed by Novogene (Sacramento, CA). mRNA was enriched using oligo(dT) beads, randomly fragmented in fragmentation buffer, and reverse transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers. Following first-strand synthesis, Illumina sysnthesis buffer was added with dNTPs, RNase H, and <italic>E. coli</italic> polymerase I to synthesize the second strand by nick-translation. The cDNA library was purified, underwent terminal repair, A-tailing, and ligation of adapters before PCR enrichment. The cDNA library concentration was quantified with a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) and sized with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). RNAseq statistical analysis was performed using CLC software (version 9.0, CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). Data is presented as reads per kilobase million (RPKM) with values normalized to control levels and made relative to 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Single nuclei isolation, purification, and RNA sequencing</title><p>Single nuclei isolation methods were adapted from 10x Genomics protocols CG000212 Rev B and CG000124 Rev D. <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Surf1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> brains were harvested under cold sterile 1x Dulbecco’s PBS (without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>). Immediately after harvesting, the cortex, olfactory bulbs and cerebellum were removed on an ice block and discarded. Brains were then triturated and lysed using the Nuclei PURE Prep Isolation Kit (Cat. No. NUC-201, Sigma). Briefly, brains were homogenized under cold Nuclei PURE Lysis Buffer and mechanically triturated with sterile pipettes and pipette tips of decreasing sizes until creating a uniform suspension. Suspensions were then filtered through 70 μm, 40 μm, and 30 μm cell strainers to remove cell debris. Myelin removal proceeded using the Debris Removal Solution (Cat. No. 130-109-398, Miltenyi) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Single nuclei were isolated and purified via density gradient centrifugation with the Nuclei PURE sucrose cushion solution (Cat. No. NUC-201, Sigma) at a centrifugation speed of 13,000 rcf. Nuclei was resuspended in 1x Dulbecco’s PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 20 U/μl RNase inhibitor (Cat. No. AM2694, Invitrogen). Single nuclei suspensions were submitted to the Next Generation Sequencing Core at UT Southwestern Medical Center for sequencing and library preparation. Briefly, nuclei were loaded with Single Cell 3’ Gel Beads into a Next GEM Chip G and run on the Chromium Controller. GEM emulsions were incubated and then broken. Silane magnetic beads were used to clean up GEM reaction mixture. Read one primer sequence was added during incubation and full-length, barcoded cDNA was then amplified by PCR after cleanup. Sample size was checked on the Agilent Tapestation 4200 using the DNAHS 5000 tape and concentration was determined by the Qubit 4.0 Fluorimeter (ThermoFisher) using the DNA HS assay. Samples were enzymatically fragmented and underwent size selection before proceeding to library construction. During library preparation, Read two primer sequence, sample index, and both Illumina adapter sequences were added. Subsequently, samples were cleaned up using Ampure XP beads and post library preparation quality control was performed using the DNA 1000 tape on the Agilent Tapestation 4200. Final concentration was ascertained using the Qubit DNA HS assay. Samples were loaded at 1.6 pM and run on the Illumina NextSeq500 High Output Flowcell using V2.5 chemistry. Run configuration was 28x98x8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Single nuclei RNA-seq data analysis</title><p>Raw gene counts were obtained by aligning the FASTQ files to <italic>Mus musculus</italic> mm10 as reference genome using CellRanger Software (v5.0.0) and then analyzed using Seurat-3.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). Genes detected in &lt;0.2% of the nuclei and from mitochondrial and sex chromosomes (X and Y) were filtered out. Nuclei that had &gt;12,000 UMI, &lt;300 genes, and/or &gt;12% mitochondrial content were further excluded. After quality control, 5140 nuclei (primary dataset) were further analyzed for their gene expression profiles. Post filtering, the expression values were log-normalized, scaled with a factor of 10,000 and regressed to covariates (percent mitochondrial content and number of genes per nuclei), with Seurat's SCTransform method and integrated. The nuclei were then assessed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction, followed by shared nearest neighbor (SNN) modularity optimization (Louvain algorithm) based clustering algorithm to identify the clusters. The clusters were visualized using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensional reduction technique. Cell types were assigned to clusters based on enrichment of marker genes from top expressed genes as follows: Excitatory neurons (<italic>Rbfox3</italic>), GABAergic neurons (<italic>Gad1,Gad2</italic>), Dendrocytes (<italic>Cacng4</italic>), Astrocytes (<italic>Gaj1, Aqp4</italic>), and Dopaminergic neurons (<italic>Slc6a3, Slc18a2, Ddc</italic>). Astrocyte and neuronal clusters were subclustered (secondary dataset) and then exclusively studied using the same approach as described above. Pairwise differential gene expression analysis tests were performed with Wilcox test within Seurat. The expression of specific genes within clusters were visualized using the DotPlot function in Seurat. The average expression of these genes in the dot plot was calculated by using the normalized gene counts, natural-log transforming them using log1p, and then scaling them using a z-transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>RNAi administration</title><p>Worm strains were grown on HT115 <italic>E. coli</italic> harboring RNAi constructs from either the Ahringer or Vidal RNAi libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rual et al., 2004</xref>). The L4440 empty vector (EV) RNAi construct was used for control treatments. RNAi strains were grown in small cultures before inoculating larger cultures in Terrific broth (TB) and grown for 15 hr on an orbital shaker at 37°C. After 15 hr, cultures were treated with 1 mM IPTG and incubated for an additional 4 hr at 37°C to induce expression. Cultures were then centrifuged at 4000 x g and bacterial pellets were re-suspended to specific concentrations in TB before being spread on 100 mm NGM plates containing a final concentration of 1 mM IPTG and 0.1 mg/ml carbenicillin. Optical density (OD600) of RNAi-producing bacterial cultures was used to standardized and equalize cell number for multiple RNAi construct combinations. For titrated single RNAi construct treatments, induced HT115 bacteria expressing a single RNAi construct was diluted with L4440 empty vector HT115 bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Large-particle flow cytometry</title><p>Large-particle flow cytometry was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egge et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, flow cytometry of <italic>C. elegans</italic> was performed on a COPAS FP-250 flow cytometer (Union Biometrica, Holliston, MA) and an automated sample introduction system LP Sampler (Union Biometrica) fitted with 96-well plates. M9 buffer was utilized as the sample solution for worm flow. The COPAS GP sheath reagent (PN: 200-5070-100, Union Biometrica) was used as sheath solution. Prior to every run, laser power and flow rates are calibrated by use of GP control particles (Cat. No. 310-5071-001; COPAS Biosorter, Union Biometrica) as recommended by the manufacturer. From experiment to experiment, we maintain a consistent PTM laser power for each respective fluorophore. Flow data was collected in FlowPilot software (Union Biometrica).

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were obtained via timed mating by detection of a vaginal plug was used to obtain embryonic day 13.5 embryos. Embryos were dissected in cold 1x PBS to remove the head and all inner organs, leaving only the carcass. After finely mincing the carcass in cold 1x PBS, the pieces were allowed to settle, and PBS was aspirated. The tissue was then enzymatically dissociated with 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA at 37°C for 5 m. The tissue was then mechanically dissociated using a 1 ml pipette tip until homogeneous and passed through a nylon cell strainer (45 μm). Cells were cultured in DMEM-Hi glucose (Sigma-Aldrich; 4.5 g/L glucose, supplemented with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate), 10% fetal bovine serum (heat inactivated), and supplemented with penicillin streptavidin. All cultures were confirmed to be negative for mycoplasma with the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Cat.

The authors detail a neuronal subtype specific response to blunt force trauma in two different animal models. They also uncover a conserved shift in cellular metabolism that plays a protective role against neuronal death following injury.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Glycolytic preconditioning in astrocytes mitigates trauma-induced neurodegeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers and I are in agreement that the subject of the manuscript is of high interest and that the data largely support the assertions, but some assertions are less well supported and methodological details and some controls are insufficient. We believe this is a worthwhile manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but should be revised with some additional data and controls. In terms of additional experiments/data, we would ask that you focus on those that are crucial to the claims made within the text. These include the essential revisions listed below. While many of these are textual changes, some of these will require new data including data the first 4 points listed below. It was also pointed out that the n was very low (n=3) for many experiments, and while it is not feasible to ask to increase the n across all experiments, please very clearly note in the text where the low n could affect interpretation or reproducibility of the results. All of the reviewer comments are also listed below, and we would also strongly recommend making changes for the additional clarity and typographical changes recommended in the reviews that would improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Additional experiments:</p><p>1. Caspase 3 staining following injury should be done for thalamus and cortex of injured mice to show that the neurodegeneration is midbrain dopaminergic neuron specific, rather than just the hippocampus, which is farther than the midbrain from the site of impact.</p><p>2. Clarification or modification/retesting of the worm cox5b RNAi protocol: As written, worms are injured and then placed into RNAi lawns to suppress de novo translation of cox5b to the effect of mitigating ROS production. However, this does not make sense, since ROS production should be able to be generated with existing mitochondrial protein complexes and not necessarily require new protein. This would suggest the vast literature of &quot;tired old mitochondrial proteins are the cause of ROS&quot; is collectively wrong. Resolve this apparent conflict. Possible methods may use cycloheximide to halt general translation or use of tet on/off systems controlling target protein expression.</p><p>3. Restaining and/or reimaging figure 1C (see below).</p><p>4. Panel 5B: Please run all samples on a single western blot and show results as a single boxed area. When western blots are presented such as this it is difficult to determine an effect of &quot;injury&quot;.</p><p>Textual revisions: I strongly recommend reading reviewer 3's thorough review and verifying/modifying all of the typographical / nomenclature/ clarity changes requested.</p><p>1. Line 46: Unclear statement. Clarify</p><p>2. Line 113-115: please temper statement</p><p>3. Line 139: modify for clarity.</p><p>4. Line 159 to 161: modify for clarity.</p><p>5. Line 219 to 221: temper statement.</p><p>6. Line 82: Change &quot;degeneration&quot; to &quot;injury&quot;.</p><p>7. Line 175/190: Was a correlation statistically evaluated? If so, please report results. If not, change wording. Perhaps use &quot;corresponded&quot;.</p><p>8. Line 203: Replace &quot;activation&quot; with something more precise such as &quot;upregulation&quot; or &quot;increased transcription&quot;. The word activation implies signaling or physiological response.</p><p>9. Line 212: Change &quot;spatial&quot; to &quot;cellular&quot;.</p><p>10. Line 219 to 221: soften claim.</p><p>Figure/Table Revisions:</p><p>Please provide timepoints for all relevant figures where not listed. Also please carefully label control and TBI mice in each panel where relevant, and provide n where not clear.</p><p>Table 1. Better describe and clarify if parameters are for mouse brain or rat brain. If they are for rat, then provide the correct parameters for mouse brain. If the title is in error, then correct the title.</p><p>Figure 1. Panel C: Requires a reference map or annotations directly on the image to determine the precise anatomical location(s) pictured in the micrographs. If this is the midbrain Substantia nigra, please label SNp, SNr, VTA, etc. If this is not precisely in that area, additional tissue staining may be required to identify cell types. TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) is a marker of catecholaminergic cells and not specifically a marker of dopaminergic cells. Staining with TH will therefore include dopaminergic and noradrenergic cells which vary in their distribution throughout the midbrain to pons. If needed use dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) in addition to TH to differentiate dopaminergic cells from noradrenergic cells.</p><p>Panel E: It is unusual for uninjured mice to fall off the rotorod so quickly, especially when they were previously trained on the task two days prior. Provide data for all tested speeds if available.</p><p>Both Table 1 and Figure S2 indicate the finite element model includes or can include analysis of cerebellum and brainstem. Data on brainstem and cerebellum should be supplied as they are significant areas of innervation to and projections from the areas under study. Further, they are intimately involved in both righting reflex and locomotion and may lend to the interpretation of this and future studies.</p><p>Figure 3C: Similar to Figure 1, provide outlines of regional anatomy and quantitation of TH vs &quot;other cells&quot;. For 3C-F, baseline results should be reported.</p><p>Figure 4a: Include latency information.</p><p>Figure S1: Provide information and details/controls for Panel F (see reviewer 3 comment).</p><p>Methods Revisions:</p><p>Details in the methods section need to be better described throughout, examples of which include:</p><p>– The <italic>C. elegans</italic> blunt force trauma model is not well described in the methods section. Additionally, since N. Egge et al., 2021 already performed an RNAi screen of dopaminergic neuron GFP retention following injury (but used a different quantification metric), it would be informative to know how strong the effect of cox5b RNAi is in comparison to the top hits in the previous screen.</p><p>– In Figure S1C, how were the neurons counted? Is there a co-stain?</p><p>– In Table 1, the material properties of rat brain regions are listed, is this a fair comparison to make while modeling the mouse brain?</p><p>– Surf KO mice were described to have rotarod defects in C. Dell'agnello et al., 2007, so in figure 3E and F, it would be useful to know the baseline levels of performance prior to injury.</p><p>– Unclear how the experiment in Figure S3E was performed, and the conclusions derived from this experiment are also confounding.</p><p>– Single nuclei isolation, purification, and RNA sequencing: The reported dissection method will produce single nuclei representing subcortical / diencephalic structures, midbrain, pontine and medullary tissues. Interpretation of snRNAseq results cannot therefore be attributed to represent midbrain or striatal cell populations.</p><p>– Statistical Analysis: It is inadequate to state &quot;Post-hoc analysis was determined by Prism recommendation&quot;. Please provide details on the types and specific uses of post-hoc analyses.</p><p>– Motor Analysis: What make, model and manufacturer is the Rotorod being reported? On the testing day, how many times were the mice tested and does the reported &quot;latency to fall&quot; represent the average? If it does not represent the average, what does it represent?</p><p>– Confocal imaging: Was a single image plane acquired or were they z-stack images? How were the images controlled between subjects / slices? If they were z-stacks, what was the step size? How were the images displayed in the manuscript- were they single planes or z-stacks? Were all the image volumes identical?</p><p>– Protein extraction and western blotting: Reported methods do not appear to include the use of a phosphatase inhibitor. Therefore western blots showing any changes in phosphorylation may be related more to target protein abundance and not differential phosphorylation. Westerns blots therefore ought to include probes against the non-phosphorylated &quot;total&quot; target protein then in order to help interpret apparent expression changes.</p><p>– Media acidification assay: Product numbers and formulation of DMEM is critical for the interpretation of the reported method. At present the method description appears inadequate to provide the type of data desired or reported. Further, cell counts must be performed after the assay is performed since mitochondrial mutations are known to alter population growth kinetics.

Inhibition of ETC Complex IV results in an astrocyte mediated Warburg like shift in metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which is sufficient to counteract an increase in toxic ROS production in injured neurons.

Though risk factors for poor outcomes following TBI, such as those thought to precipitate Alzheimer's disease are intensely studies, conserved mechanisms of injury and resiliency factors with the potential to prevent poor outcomes remain largely unknown. In this study by Fonseca and colleagues, the study team leverages a combination of model systems (e.g. <italic>C. elegans</italic>, mice, cell systems) to identify the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons following physical trauma. Through a series of well-reasoned and articulate experiments, the study team presents evidence that suppression of function at the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex IV may reduce the loss of dopaminergic neurons following TBI, in part by driving astrocyte-mediated lactate shuttling to reduce oxidative phosphorylation in vulnerable neurons. This is potentially a very significant finding with wide ranging implications not only for acute injury care but potentially chronic neurodegenerative disease as well. A clear strength of the study is its approach to identifying evolutionarily-conserved mechanisms of selective dopaminergic vulnerability to TBI, which will likely be critical to identifying actionable targets in human TBI. The study is well written with an interesting and thoughtful narrative. The weakness of the paper is primarily the under-reporting of methodological details essential to reproducing the work, inadequate controls to verify results, and a paucity of data supporting major claims and conclusions.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>Line 46: Unclear statement. Clarify.</p><p>Line 82: Change &quot;degeneration&quot; to &quot;injury&quot;.</p><p>Line 97 to 100: TBI-induced deficits in voluntary movement are well established and may have multiple causes unrelated to SN / DA injury. Interestingly, changes in &quot;disinhibition and risk seeking&quot;, another classical Parkinsonian trait and more cleanly associated with dopaminergic dysfunction, has been reported in TBI in human subjects (self-report) and mouse TBI models (using novel object recognition tests). Provide results of novel object recognition tests to demonstrate unencumbered behavioral / functional impairment related to dopaminergic injury / degeneration in this mouse model. Evaluate the correlation between behavioral results with the degree of dopaminergic loss across SNr, SNc, VTA, etc.</p><p>Line 113-115: Caution and conservativeness is warranted in this closing statement. This study has not adequately compared and contrasted the profiles of neuronal injury across the SNc/Midbrain with those of the thalamus and therefore its inappropriate to suggest that the inherent physiological properties of dopaminergic neurons sensitizes them to biomechanical insults [as compared with the thalamus]. Indeed several studies have noted substantial thalamic alterations associated with repeated TBI, whereas few have identified dopaminergic pathology.</p><p>Line 139: As written, your statement makes it sound as though though evolution has selected for the protection of DA neurons against TBI by reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity, which I do not think you intend to convey. Perhaps, &quot;suppressing trauma-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons through reduction in cytochrome C oxidase activity is sufficient to conserve dopaminergic function in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> to mice.&quot;?</p><p>Major concern Line 150 to 151: If I am understanding correctly… As written, worms are injured and then placed into RNAi lawns to suppress de novo translation of cox5b to the effect of mitigating ROS production. However, this does not make sense, since ROS production should be able to be generated with existing mitochondrial protein complexes and not necessarily require new protein.

Animals were not trained on a rotating rod prior to testing, but rather exposed to the Rotarod machine chamber for 2 minutes (3 times daily). For testing, animals were placed on the rod with accelerating speed (0-24 rpm in 120 s) for all experiments. Latency to fall was recorded electronically in seconds by the apparatus and values were averaged per group for reporting. The clock was stopped if an animal held to the rod on two consecutive rotations and if the animal failed to fall after 120 s. Animals were returned to their cage after each trial.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Confocal imaging: Was a single image plane acquired or were they z-stack images?

Briefly, brain parenchyma images were collected as Z-stacks with 1 µm steps as follows: midbrain micrographs 20 µm/10x objective/5 tile Z-stacks, cortex micrographs 10 µm/40x objective/5 tile Z-stacks, hippocampus micrographs 20 µm/10x objective/8 tile Z-stacks, thalamus micrographs 5 µm/40x objective/2 tile Z-stacks. Number of tiles to be collected was determined by completely covering the brain structure of interest (i.e. midbrain 1x5 tiles, hippocampus 2x4 tiles). Tiled images were stitched with the Leica LAS X software. Cell culture micrographs were collected from cells grown on glass coverslips with a total of 10 fields collected with a 40x objective for image processing and analysis. Brain parenchyma images are displayed as maximal intensity projections of Z-stacks. Cell culture images are displayed as single plane micrographs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Protein extraction and western blotting: Reported methods do not appear to include the use of a phosphatase inhibitor.

In brief, we use 3% USP grade isoflurane and 2.5 lpm USP grade oxygen.

This claim is convincingly validated in a <italic>C. elegans</italic> model of blunt force trauma that they previously developed (N. Egge et al., 2021). The authors use a weighted drop model of traumatic brain injury in mice to find a similar hypersensitivity to neurodegeneration in dopaminergic midbrain neurons, but it is unclear if this is specific as other relevant brain areas like the thalamus and cortex have not been assayed.</p><p>The authors also identify a key neuroprotective role for ETC complex IV inhibition following injury. Inhibition of ETC Complex IV results in an astrocyte mediated Warburg like shift in metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which is sufficient to counteract an increase in toxic ROS production in injured neurons. These observations are reached using an impressive array of experimental techniques, ranging from metabolomic profiling to single nuclei RNA sequencing, with the authors providing multiple lines of evidence in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mouse models in support of these novel findings.</p><p>Additional experiments:</p><p>– Caspase 3 staining following injury must be done for thalamus and cortex of injured mice to show that the neurodegeneration is midbrain dopaminergic neuron specific, rather than just the hippocampus, which is farther than the midbrain from the site of impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included new indirect immunofluorescence micrographs and quantifications for the respective brain regions (thalamus and cortex). This additional data complements our existing analysis of the midbrain and hippocampus. In brief, there was no significant change in immunostained cleaved caspase 3 signal intensity seven days post-concussion in both the thalamus or the cortex. These new data are included in the revised manuscript in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is the Warburg shift in <italic>C. elegans</italic> dependent on non-neuronal cells?

These new properties for the revised model have been updated in Table 1 and additional text included in the revised methods section.

In the rodent, we observed a higher resting or basal ROS levels in Surf1 mutants but reduced ROS induction after trauma in the Surf1 mutant. We hypothesize that mild increases in ROS prior to injury can initiate a neuroprotective metabolic shift to glycolysis. Upon the metabolic demand of injury, cells rely less on mitochondrial respiration and do not overwhelm the ETC. Thus, we would predict that mitochondrial perturbations would increase basal levels of ROS and as long as they do not reach toxic levels, they can promote a protective metabolic switch. In this manner, it is a hermetic response. It remains to be determined whether these various ETC RNAi constructs can mitigate trauma-induced ROS fluctuations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

However, we do not use the MEF cells at any point in the manuscript to assess “selective vulnerability” since no viability assays were performed on these cultured cells. The MEFs were more amenable for super-resolution analysis and provided a much clearer demonstration of how loss of SURF1 can impact mitochondrial morphology.

Though risk factors for poor outcomes following TBI, such as those thought to precipitate Alzheimer's disease are intensely studies, conserved mechanisms of injury and resiliency factors with the potential to prevent poor outcomes remain largely unknown. In this study by Fonseca and colleagues, the study team leverages a combination of model systems (e.g. <italic>C. elegans</italic>, mice, cell systems) to identify the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons following physical trauma. Through a series of well-reasoned and articulate experiments, the study team presents evidence that suppression of function at the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex IV may reduce the loss of dopaminergic neurons following TBI, in part by driving astrocyte-mediated lactate shuttling to reduce oxidative phosphorylation in vulnerable neurons. This is potentially a very significant finding with wide ranging implications not only for acute injury care but potentially chronic neurodegenerative disease as well. A clear strength of the study is its approach to identifying evolutionarily-conserved mechanisms of selective dopaminergic vulnerability to TBI, which will likely be critical to identifying actionable targets in human TBI. The study is well written with an interesting and thoughtful narrative. The weakness of the paper is primarily the under-reporting of methodological details essential to reproducing the work, inadequate controls to verify results, and a paucity of data supporting major claims and conclusions.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>Line 46: Unclear statement.
