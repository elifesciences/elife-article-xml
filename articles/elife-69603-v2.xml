midluteal endometrium leads to a short implantation window after which the uterine mucosa either breaks down or is transformed into a robust matrix that accommodates the placenta throughout pregnancy. To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we established and characterized endometrial assembloids, consisting of gland-like organoids and primary stromal cells. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that decidualized assembloids closely resemble midluteal endometrium, harbouring differentiated and senescent subpopulations in both glands and stroma. We show that acute senescence in glandular epithelium drives secretion of multiple canonical implantation factors, whereas in the stroma it calibrates the emergence of anti-inflammatory decidual cells and pro-inflammatory senescent decidual cells. Pharmacological inhibition of stress responses in pre-decidual cells accelerated decidualization by eliminating the emergence of senescent decidual cells. In co-culture experiments, accelerated decidualization resulted in entrapment of collapsed human blastocysts in a robust, static decidual matrix. By contrast, the presence of senescent decidual cells created a dynamic implantation environment, enabling embryo expansion and attachment, although their persistence led to gradual disintegration of assembloids. Our findings suggest that decidual senescence controls endometrial fate decisions at implantation and highlight how endometrial assembloids may accelerate the discovery of new treatments to prevent reproductive failure.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>At the beginning of a human pregnancy, the embryo implants into the uterus lining, known as the endometrium. At this point, the endometrium transforms into a new tissue that helps the placenta to form. Problems in this transformation process are linked to pregnancy disorders, many of which can lead to implantation failure (the embryo fails to invade the endometrium altogether) or recurrent miscarriages (the embryo implants successfully, but the interface between the placenta and the endometrium subsequently breaks down).</p><p>Studying the implantation of human embryos directly is difficult due to ethical and technical barriers, and animals do not perfectly mimic the human process, making it challenging to determine the causes of pregnancy disorders. However, it is likely that a form of cellular arrest called senescence, in which cells stop dividing but remain metabolically active, plays a role. Indeed, excessive senescence in the cells that make up the endometrium is associated with recurrent miscarriage, while a lack of senescence is associated with implantation failure.</p><p>To study this process, Rawlings et al. developed a new laboratory model of the human endometrium by assembling two of the main cell types found in the tissue into a three-dimensional structure. When treated with hormones, these ‘assembloids’ successfully mimic the activity of genes in the cells of the endometrium during implantation. Rawlings et al. then exposed the assembloids to the drug dasatinib, which targets and eliminates senescent cells. This experiment showed that assembloids become very robust and static when devoid of senescent cells.</p><p>Rawlings et al. then studied the interaction between embryos and assembloids using time-lapse imaging. In the absence of dasatinib treatment, cells in the assembloid migrated towards the embryo as it expanded, a process required for implantation. However, when senescent cells were eliminated using dasatinib, this movement of cells towards the embryo stopped, and the embryo failed to expand, in a situation that mimicks implantation failure.</p><p>The assembloid model of the endometrium may help scientists to study endometrial defects in the lab and test potential treatments. Further work will include other endometrial cell types in the assembloids, and could help increase the reliability of the model. However, any drug treatments identified using this model will need further research into their safety and effectiveness before they can be offered to patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endometrium</kwd><kwd>embryo implantation</kwd><kwd>organoid</kwd><kwd>assembloid</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>decidualisation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>212233/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brosens</surname><given-names>Jan Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MRC Doctoral Training Partnership</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N014294/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rawlings</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Warwick-Wellcome Trust Translational Partnership</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rawlings</surname><given-names>Thomas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The study of embryo-endometrial interactions in assembloid co-cultures identifies novel mechanisms of reproductive failure.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Upon embryo implantation, the cycling human endometrium transforms into the decidua of pregnancy to accommodate the placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). Transition between these physiological endometrial states requires intensive tissue remodelling, a process termed decidualization. Notwithstanding that decidualization in early pregnancy cannot be studied directly, a spectrum of prevalent reproductive disorders is attributed to perturbations in this process, including recurrent implantation failure and recurrent pregnancy loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dimitriadis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Macklon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, the sequence of events that renders the endometrium receptive to embryo implantation has been investigated extensively, starting with obligatory oestrogen-dependent tissue growth following menstrual repair. As a consequence of rapid proliferation of stromal fibroblasts and glandular epithelial cells (EpCs), which peaks in the upper third of the functional layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ferenczy et al., 1979</xref>), endometrial volume and thickness increases multifold prior to ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raine-Fenning et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dallenbach-Hellweg, 1981</xref>). After the postovulatory rise in progesterone levels, proliferation of EpCs first decreases and then ceases altogether in concert with the onset of apocrine glandular secretions, heralding the start of the midluteal window of implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dallenbach-Hellweg, 1981</xref>). Concurrently, uterine natural killer (uNK) cells accumulate and endometrial stromal cells (EnSCs) start decidualizing in a process that can be described as ‘inflammatory programming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chavan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Erkenbrack et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Salker et al., 2012</xref>). Morphological decidual cells, characterized by abundant cytoplasm and enlarged nuclei, emerge upon closure of the 4-day implantation window, meaning that the endometrium has become refractory to embryo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). In pregnancy, decidual cells form a robust, tolerogenic matrix in which invading trophoblast cells cooperate with local immune cells to form a haemochorial placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aplin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vento-Tormo et al., 2018</xref>). In non-conception cycles, however, falling progesterone levels and influx of neutrophils lead to breakdown of the superficial endometrial layer and menstrual shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jabbour et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we highlighted the importance of cellular senescence in endometrial remodelling during the midluteal implantation window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). Senescence denotes a cellular stress response triggered by replicative exhaustion or other stressors that cause macromolecular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muñoz-Espín and Serrano, 2014</xref>). Activation of tumour suppressor pathways and upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16<sup>INK4a</sup> (encoded by <italic>CDKN2A</italic>) and p21<sup>CIP1</sup> (<italic>CDKN1A</italic>) lead to permanent cell cycle arrest, induction of survival genes, and production of a bioactive secretome, referred to as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The composition of the SASP is tissue-specific but typically includes proinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Birch and Gil, 2020</xref>). Acute senescence, characterized by transient SASP production and rapid immune-mediated clearance of senescent cells, is widely implicated in processes involving physiological tissue remodelling, including during embryo development, placenta formation, and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Muñoz-Espín and Serrano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van, 2014</xref>). By contrast, persisting senescent cells cause chronic inflammation or ‘inflammaging’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Birch and Gil, 2020</xref>), a pathological state that underpins ageing and age-related disorders. We demonstrated that inflammatory reprogramming of EnSC burdened by replication stress leads to the emergence of acute senescent cells during the implantation window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). Upon successful implantation and continuous progesterone signalling, decidual cells co-opt uNK cells to eliminate their senescent counterparts through granule exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). Clearance of senescent decidual cells likely necessitates recruitment of bone marrow-derived decidual precursor cells, which confer tissue plasticity for rapid decidual expansion in early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Diniz-da-Costa et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, lack of clonogenic decidual precursor cells and a pro-senescent decidual response are linked to recurrent pregnancy loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lucas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tewary et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Based on these insights, we hypothesized that acute senescence is integral to successful implantation by creating conditions for anchorage of the conceptus in an otherwise tightly adherent decidual matrix. To test this hypothesis, we developed an ‘assembloid’ model, consisting of endometrial gland-like organoids and primary EnSC, which recapitulates the complexity in cell states and gene expression of the midluteal implantation window, improving resemblance to endometrial tissue in comparison with existing co-culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cheung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rawlings, 2021</xref>). We used this model to establish co-cultures with human blastocysts and demonstrate that aspects of different pathological states associated with implantation failure and miscarriage can be recapitulated in endometrial assembloids by modulating decidual senescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of endometrial assembloids</title><p>Organoids consisting of gland-like structures are established by culturing endometrial EpCs seeded in Matrigel in a chemically defined medium containing growth factors and signal transduction pathway modulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: Table 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boretto et al., 2017</xref>). Gland-like organoids grown in this medium, termed expansion medium, are genetically stable, easily passaged, and can be maintained in long-term cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boretto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turco et al., 2017</xref>). Oestradiol (E2) promotes proliferation of gland-like organoids and cooperates with NOTCH signalling to activate ciliogenesis in a subpopulation of EpC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haider et al., 2019</xref>). Further, treatment with a progestin (e.g. medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA]) and a cyclic AMP analogue (e.g. 8-bromo-cAMP) induces secretory transformation of gland-like organoids in parallel with expression of luteal-phase marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boretto et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We modified the gland-like organoid model to incorporate EnSC. To this end, midluteal endometrial biopsies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: Table 2) were digested and gland-like organoids established from isolated EpC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In parallel, purified EnSC were propagated in standard monolayer cultures. At passage 2, single-cell suspensions of EnSC were combined with organoid EpC, seeded in hydrogel, and cultured in expansion medium supplemented with E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The hydrogel matrix comprised 97% type I and 3% type III collagens, which are both present in midluteal endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oefner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aplin et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aplin and Jones, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iwahashi et al., 1996</xref>), and has a predicted in-use elastic modulus (Pa) of comparable magnitude to non-pregnant endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bagley, 2019</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, gland formation was unperturbed by the presence of EnSC and assembloids resembled the architecture of native endometrium more closely than organoids. Further, decidualization of assembloids with 8-bromo-cAMP and MPA for 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) resulted in robust secretion of decidual prolactin (PRL) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy provided further evidence that decidualizing assembloids mimic luteal phase endometrium, exemplified by laminin deposition by decidualizing EnSC, induction of osteopontin (<italic>SPP1</italic>) and accumulation of glycodelin (encoded by <italic>PAEP</italic>) in the lumen of secretory glands, and downregulation of the progesterone receptor (<italic>PGR</italic>) in both stromal and glandular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Establishment of endometrial assembloids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic for establishing endometrial assembloids.

To test this hypothesis, parallel gland-like organoids and assembloids were established from three endometrial biopsies and decidualized with E2, 8-bromo-cAMP, and MPA for 4 days in either expansion medium, base medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: Table 1), or base medium with each exogeneous factor added back individually.

Add-back of individual factors did not restore the glandular response, with the exception of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Addition of NAC at low concentration (1.25 mM) to base medium resulted in a robust glandular response in assembloids. Thus, in subsequent experiments assembloids were grown in expansion medium supplemented with E2 and then decidualized in minimal differentiation medium (MDM), consisting of base medium containing NAC, E2, 8-bromo-cAMP, and MPA.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of a minimal differentiation medium for endometrial assembloids.</title><p>Parallel gland-like organoids (red) and assembloids (blue) were established from three endometrial biopsies and decidualized with 8-bromo-cAMP and MPA for 4 days in either expansion medium (ExM), base medium (BM), or BM with each exogeneous factor added back individually (+).

The glandular component of undifferentiated assembloids harboured actively dividing EpC (EpS1; n = 198) as well as EpC-expressing marker genes of E2-responsive proliferative phase endometrium (EpS2; n = 692), including <italic>PGR</italic> and <italic>CPM</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). EpS3 (n = 29) consisted of ciliated EpC, expressing an abundance of genes involved in cilium assembly and organization, including <italic>DNAI1</italic> and <italic>TUBA4B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Ciliated cells are the only glandular subpopulation present in both undifferentiated and decidualized assembloids. In vivo, EpS3 marker genes transiently peak during the early-luteal phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Decidualization of endometrial assembloids led to the emergence of two distinct EpC subsets, EpS4 (n = 434) and EpS5 (n = 208). Both clusters expressed canonical endometrial ‘receptivity genes’ (annotated in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), that is, genes used in a clinical test to aid the timing of embryo transfer to the window of implantation in IVF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Díaz-Gimeno et al., 2011</xref>). In agreement, induction of EpS4 and EpS5 marker genes in vivo coincides with the transition from early- to midluteal phase. However, while expression of EpS4 marker genes, including <italic>SOD2</italic>, <italic>MAOA,</italic> and <italic>PTGS1</italic>, generally peaks during the midluteal window of implantation, EpS5 genes tend to persist or peak during the late-luteal phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additional mining of the data revealed that transition from EpS4 to EpS5 coincides with induction of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and p21<sup>CIP1</sup> in parallel with upregulation of 56 genes encoding secretory factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, several canonical implantation factors secreted by this subpopulation are also well-characterized SASP components, including dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (<italic>DPP4;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), growth differentiation factor 15 (<italic>GDF15;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Basisty et al., 2020</xref>), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (<italic>IGFBP3;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elzi et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, EpS5 consists of senescent EpC producing an implantation-specific SASP.</p><p>Decidualized endometrial assembloids also harboured a sizable population of ambiguous cells expressing both epithelial and stromal genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). A hallmark of this subset, termed ‘transitional population’ (TP; n = 472), is the induction of long non-coding RNAs involved in mesenchymal-epithelial and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (MET/EMT), such as <italic>NEAT1</italic> (nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1) and <italic>KCNQ1OT1</italic> (KCNQ1 opposite strand/antisense transcript 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). GO analysis showed that both EpS5 and the transitional population comprised secretory cells involved in ECM organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, while EpS5 genes are implicated in neutrophil activation (a hallmark of premenstrual endometrium), genes expressed by the transitional population are uniquely enriched in GO terms such as ‘wound healing’, ‘regulation of stem cell proliferation’, ‘blood coagulation’, and ‘blood vessel development’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which points towards a putative role in tissue repair and regeneration.</p><p>The stromal fraction of undifferentiated assembloids consisted of actively dividing EnSC (stromal subpopulation 1 [SS1]; n = 434) and E2-responsive EnSC (SS2; n = 874) expressing proliferative phase marker genes, such as <italic>PGR</italic>, <italic>MMP11</italic>, and <italic>CRABP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As anticipated, decidualization of assembloids for 4 days led to a preponderance of pre-decidual cells (SS3; n = 495) as well as emerging decidual cells (SS4; n = 87) and senescent decidual cells (SS5; n = 118) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Each of these subpopulations expressed marker genes identified previously by scRNA-seq reconstruction of the decidual pathway in standard primary EnSC cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>). Pre-decidual cells in SS3 express <italic>HAND2</italic>, a key decidual transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marinić et al., 2021</xref>), as well as previously identified genes encoding secreted factors, including <italic>VEGFA</italic> (vascular endothelial growth factor A), <italic>CRISPLD2</italic> (a progesterone-dependent anti-inflammatory response gene coding cysteine-rich secretory protein LCCL domain containing 2)<italic>, IL15</italic> (interleukin 15), and <italic>TIMP3</italic> (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>). Novel candidate pre-decidual genes were also identified, such as <italic>DDIT4</italic> (DNA damage-inducible transcript 4), encoding a stress response protein intimately involved in autophagy, stemness, and antioxidative defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miller et al., 2020</xref>). Decidual cells (SS4) and senescent decidual cells (SS5) express <italic>SCARA5</italic> and <italic>DIO2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), two stroma-specific marker genes identified by scRNA-seq analysis of mid- and late-luteal endometrial biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>). SS3 and SS4 genes mapped to the early- and midluteal phase of the cycle, whereas SS5 genes peak in the late-luteal phase, that is, prior to menstrual breakdown. Notably, the transcriptomic profiles of SS3 and SS5 are enriched in GO terms such as ‘Wound healing’, ‘Response to hypoxia’, and ‘Inflammatory response’, suggesting that both clusters comprise stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). However, the nature of the cellular stress response differs between these populations with only senescent decidual cells (SS5) expressing genes enriched in categories such as ‘Embryo implantation’, ‘Cellular senescence’, ‘Aging’, and ‘Leukocyte activation’. By contrast, few notable categories were selectively enriched in decidual cells (e.g. ‘Mesenchymal cell differentiation’), rendering the lack of GO terms that pertain to stress, inflammation, or wound healing perhaps the most striking observation. In keeping with the GO analysis, senescent decidual cells (SS5) express a multitude of SASP-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), including matrix metallopeptidases (e.g. <italic>MMP3</italic>, <italic>7</italic>, <italic>9</italic>, <italic>10</italic>, <italic>11,</italic> and <italic>14</italic>), insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (e.g. <italic>IGFBP1</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, <italic>6,</italic> and <italic>7</italic>), growth factors (e.g. <italic>AREG</italic>, <italic>FGF2</italic>, <italic>FGF7</italic>, <italic>HGF</italic>, and <italic>VEGFA</italic>) and growth factor receptors (<italic>PDGFRA</italic> and <italic>PDGFRB</italic>), cytokines (e.g. <italic>LIF</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic>, <italic>IL1A</italic>, and <italic>IL11</italic>), chemokines (e.g. <italic>CXCL8</italic> and <italic>CXCL1</italic>), and members of the TGF-β superfamily of proteins (e.g. <italic>GDF15</italic>, <italic>INHBA</italic>, and <italic>BMP2</italic>). By contrast, decidual cells are characterized by expression of a unique network of secretory genes, some encoding ECM proteins (e.g. <italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>COL3A1</italic>, and <italic>LAMA4</italic>) and other known decidual markers (e.g. <italic>PRL</italic>, <italic>PROK1,</italic> and <italic>WNT4</italic>) as well as factors involved in uNK cell chemotaxis and activation (e.g. <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CXCL14</italic>, and <italic>IL15</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, single-cell analysis of undifferentiated and decidualized assembloids revealed a surprising level of cellular complexity. Each epithelial and stromal subpopulation appears functionally distinct and maps to a specific phase of the menstrual cycle. Transition between cellular states is predicated on changes in cell cycle status, ranging from actively dividing cells in proliferating assembloids to the emergence upon differentiation of highly secretory senescent epithelial and decidual subpopulations, resembling premenstrual endometrium.

Within the multitude of predicted complex interactions, three broad categories can be discerned. First, there are non-selective interactions involving ligands produced by all subpopulations in one compartment acting on receptors expressed by all subsets in the other compartment. Second, there are semi-selective stromal-epithelial interactions involving three or four subpopulations across both compartments. For example, binding of WNT5A secreted by all decidual stromal subsets to FZD3 (frizzled class receptor 3) expressed on all EpCs represents a non-selective receptor-ligand interaction, whereas binding of WNT5A or WNT4 to FZD6 is a predicted semi-selective interaction, involving all stromal subsets (SS3-5) and EpS4 but not EpS5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). While FZD3 activates the canonical β-catenin pathway, FZD6 functions as a negative regulator of this signalling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corda and Sala, 2017</xref>). Finally, we identified only three highly selective receptor-ligand interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), two of which involved secretion of decidual ligands, prolactin (PRL) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), acting on their cognate receptors expressed on receptive EpC (EpS4). CXCL12-dependent activation of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been shown to promote motility of EpC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>), whereas PRL is a lactogenic hormone that stimulates glandular secretion in early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burton et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to stromal-epithelial communication, non-selective interactions are predicted to be rare between decidual subsets. Instead, communication appears governed largely by a combinatorial network of receptor-ligand interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For example, colony stimulating factor 3 (CSF3) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) produced by senescent decidual cells (SS5) are predicted to impact selectively on pre-decidual cells (SS3), whereas secretion of inhibin A (INHBA) may engage both pre-decidual and decidual cells (SS4). Other interactions are predicted to govern crosstalk between SS3 and SS4, such as modulation of the WNT pathway in response to binding of R-spondin 3 (RSPO3) to leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4). A striking observation is the overrepresentation of receptor tyrosine kinases implicated in SS3 and SS5 signal transduction as well as the involvement of receptors that signal through downstream cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, including CSF3 receptor (CSF3R) and CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van der Voort et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Tyrosine kinase-dependent stress responses determine the fate of decidual cells</title><p>The CellPhoneDB analysis inferred that epithelial-stromal crosstalk in assembloids is robust, buffered by numerous non-selective interactions, whereas decidual subsets are reliant on selective receptor-ligand interactions and activation of distinct signal transduction pathways. For example, the predicted tyrosine kinase dependency of pre-decidual (SS3) and senescent decidual cells (SS5) raised the possibility that these subpopulations can be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>), a second-generation, broad-spectrum ATP-competitive protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilera and Tsimberidou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2010</xref>). To test this supposition, we generated single-cell transcriptomic profiles of assembloids decidualized for 4 days in the presence of dasatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We found that decidualization in the presence of dasatinib had a dramatic impact on stromal subpopulations, virtually eliminating senescent decidual cells (SS5, n = 7) and increasing the abundance of decidual cells ninefold (SS4, n = 882; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Apart from a modest reduction in pre-decidual cells (SS3), dasatinib also impacted markedly on transitional cells, reducing their numbers by 76%. By contrast, the effect on epithelial populations was confined to a modest reduction in senescent EpC (EpS5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Further, relatively few genes were perturbed significantly (FDR-corrected p&lt;0.05) upon dasatinib treatment in epithelial populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the stroma, dasatinib triggered a conspicuous transcriptional response in pre-decidual (SS3) and transitional cells, whereas gene expression in decidual cells (SS4) and the few remaining senescent decidual cells (SS5) was largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In transitional cells, dasatinib simultaneously upregulated genes encoding canonical mesenchymal markers (e.g. <italic>SNAI2</italic>, <italic>TWIST2</italic>, <italic>ZEB1</italic>, <italic>COL1A1</italic>, and <italic>FBN1;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Owusu-Akyaw et al., 2019</xref>) and decidual factors (e.g. <italic>SCARA5</italic>, <italic>FOXO1</italic>, <italic>GADD45A</italic>, <italic>IL15</italic>, <italic>CXCL14</italic>, and <italic>SGK1;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>), suggesting that MET accounts for the emergence of this population upon decidualization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). In pre-decidual cells, dasatinib inhibited the expression of a network of genes enriched in GO categories such as ‘Response to wounding’ (FDR-corrected p=3.5 × 10<sup>–5</sup>), ‘Response to stress’ (FDR-corrected p=3.8 × 10<sup>–5</sup>), and ‘Response to oxidative stress’ (FDR-corrected p=1.3 × 10<sup>–4</sup>), indicative of a blunted stress response. To substantiate this finding, we measured the secreted levels of CXCL8 (IL-8), a potent inflammatory mediator implicated in autocrine/paracrine propagation of cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acosta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kuilman et al., 2008</xref>), in assembloids decidualized with or without dasatinib. CXCL14, IL-15, and TIMP3 levels were also measured to monitor the decidual response. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, dasatinib completely abrogated the release of CXCL8 by pre-decidual cells while markedly enhancing subsequent secretion of CXCL14, IL-15, and TIMP3, which are involved in effecting immune clearance of senescent decidual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these observations not only support the CellPhoneDB predictions but also indicate that the amplitude of the cellular stress response during the pre-decidual phase determines the subsequent decidual trajectory, with low levels accelerating differentiation and high levels promoting cellular senescence and MET.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Tyrosine kinase-dependent stress responses determine the fate of decidual cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of experimental design.

Conversely, we reasoned that lack of senescent decidual cells or unconstrained SASP should simulate pathological implantation environments associated with implantation failure and early pregnancy loss, respectively. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a simple implantation model by embedding human embryos in endometrial assembloids. To this end, assembloids were first decidualized for 96 hr in the presence or absence of dasatinib, washed and cultured in embryo medium, consisting of MDM with added supplements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: Table 1). Day 5 human blastocysts were placed into small pockets created in the decidualized assembloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), one embryo per assembloid, and individual co-cultures imaged using time-lapse microscopy over 72 hr. Co-cultured blastocysts (n = 5) expanded markedly when placed in decidualized assembloids that were not pre-treated with dasatinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy revealed intense cellular movement in the stromal compartment as well as evidence that interaction between migratory decidual cells and polar trophectoderm promotes adherence and early invasion of the embryo (SI <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Retrieval and processing of one attached embryo demonstrated proliferating polar trophectoderm and expression of OCT4 and GATA6 in the epiblast and hypoblast, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). A major limitation of this implantation model is that persistence of senescent decidual cells also causes gradual disintegration of the assembloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). By contrast, pre-treatment with dasatinib, which accelerates decidualization and all but eliminates decidual senescence, resulted in much more robust assembloids. However, all embedded blastocysts (n = 5) failed to expand in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Further, movement of the decidual matrix was greatly reduced and directed migration or attachment of decidual cells to the blastocyst was not observed (SI <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Secreted levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) did not differ between co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that all embryos remained viable over the 72 hr observation period. Thus, while our experimental design precluded modelling of physiological embryo implantation, aspects of different pathological endometrial states underlying reproductive failure, that is, implantation failure and miscarriage, were recapitulated in assembloids.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Impact of decidual senescence in assembloids on co-cultured human blastocysts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram showing experimental design.

While assembloids complement and advance other recently described endometrial organoid models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boretto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cheung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fitzgerald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luddi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turco et al., 2017</xref>), they still lack the cellular complexity of native endometrium, including uNK cells, macrophages, and vascular cells. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that aspects of pathological implantation events can be recapitulated in assembloids, rendering them useful as novel models to study mechanisms of reproductive failure and evaluate potential therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Single-cell analysis of differentiating endometrial assembloids indicates that the sequence of events leading up to the implantation window, and beyond, requires divergence of both glandular EpC and EnSC into differentiated and senescent subpopulations, a process likely determined by the level of replication stress incurred by individual cells in the preceding proliferative phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrate that acute senescence in glandular EpC (EpS5) underpins production of an implantation-specific SASP, comprising canonical implantation factors and growth factors, such as amphiregulin (<italic>AREG</italic>) and epiregulin (<italic>EREG</italic>), implicated in transforming cytotrophoblasts into extravillous trophoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, the transcriptome profile of differentiated EpC (EpS4) revealed a pivotal role for this subpopulation in prostaglandin and glycodelin synthesis. Prostaglandins, and specifically PGE2, are indispensable for implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ruan et al., 2012</xref>), whereas glycodelin is an abundantly secreted, multifaceted glycoprotein involved in blastocyst attachment, trophoblast differentiation, and immune modulation in early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Further, differentiated EpC highly express <italic>SLC2A1</italic>, encoding the major glucose transporter GLUT1. Glucose is required for glycogen synthesis, an essential component of glandular secretions that nourishes the conceptus prior to the onset of placental perfusion around 10 weeks of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burton et al., 2020</xref>). The fate and function of senescent EpC in pregnancy are unknown. Arguably, localized secretion of proteinases by senescent EpC may promote breakdown of the surrounding basement membrane, thereby facilitating endoglandular trophoblast invasion and access to histotrophic nutrition in early gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huppertz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moser et al., 2010</xref>). In non-conception cycles, the abundance of p16<sup>INK4</sup>-positive glandular EpC rises markedly during the late-luteal phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that senescent EpC are progesterone-independent and likely responsible for glandular breakdown in the superficial endometrial layer at menstruation.</p><p>Decidual transformation of EnSC in assembloids unfolded largely as anticipated from previous studies, that is, starting with an acute pre-decidual stress response and leading to the emergence of both decidual and senescent decidual subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). Like their epithelial counterparts, senescent decidual cells have a conspicuous secretory phenotype. We identified 56 and 72 genes encoding secreted factors upregulated in senescent epithelial and decidual subpopulations, respectively. However, only 15 genes were shared, indicating that the SASP generated in both cellular compartments is distinct. As glandular secretions drain into the uterine cavity, the embryonic microenvironment is therefore predicted to change abruptly upon breaching of the luminal epithelium. Recent comparative metabolomics of apical and basolateral endometrial gland-like organoid secretomes also supports the prediction of an asymmetrical profile of glandular secretions in the pre- and post-implantation microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Simintiras et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Based on computational predictions of ligand-receptor interactions, we demonstrated that the decidual response in assembloids can be targeted pharmacologically with only modest impact on glandular function and, by extension, the preimplantation embryo milieu. Specifically, dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was highly effective in blunting the pre-decidual stress response, leading to a dramatic expansion of anti-inflammatory decidual cells and near-total elimination of senescent decidual cells. Dasatinib also inhibited the emergence of TP and shifted the transcriptional profile of the remaining transitional cells towards a decidual phenotype. An analogous population of ambiguous cells expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal marker genes was recently identified in midluteal endometrium by scRNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>). Further, based on CellPhoneDB and GO analyses, transitional cells are predicted to be highly autonomous and involved in tissue regeneration, in line with experimental evidence that MET drives re-epithelization of the endometrium following menstruation and parturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Owusu-Akyaw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the level of endogenous cellular stress generated by the endometrium during the window of implantation calibrates the subsequent decidual trajectory, either promoting the formation of a robust decidual matrix or facilitating tissue breakdown and repair. Further, an in-built feature of both trajectories is self-enforcement as decidual cells recruit and activate uNK cells to eliminate their senescent counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kong et al., 2021</xref>), whereas senescent decidual cells induce secondary senescence in neighbouring decidual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brighton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ozaki et al., 2017</xref>) and, plausibly, uNK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rajagopalan and Long, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Clinically, recurrent pregnancy loss, defined as multiple miscarriages, is associated with loss of endometrial clonogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lucas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Diniz-da-Costa et al., 2021</xref>), uNK cell deficiency and excessive decidual senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tewary et al., 2020</xref>), and rapid conceptions (also referred to as ‘superfertility’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dimitriadis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ticconi et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, lack of a proliferative gene signature in midluteal endometrium and premature expression of decidual PRL have been linked to recurrent implantation failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berkhout et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koot et al., 2016</xref>), a pathological condition defined by a failure to achieve a pregnancy following transfer of one or more high-quality embryos in multiple IVF cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Polanski et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned that these aberrant implantation environments can be recapitulated in assembloids by manipulating the level of decidual senescence. In line with these predictions, the presence of senescent decidual cells created a permissive environment in which migratory decidual cells interacted with expanding blastocysts, although continuous SASP production also promoted breakdown of the assembloids. Conversely, in the absence of senescent decidual cells, non-expanding embryos became entrapped in a robust but stagnant decidual matrix. These observations are in keeping with previous studies demonstrating that implantation of human embryos depends critically on the invasive and migratory capacities of decidual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berkhout et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gellersen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grewal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weimar et al., 2012</xref>). Our co-culture experiments also highlighted the shortcomings of assembloids as an implantation model, including the lack of a surface epithelium to create distinct pre- and post-implantation microenvironments and the absence of key cellular constituents, such as innate immune cells.</p><p>In summary, parsing the mechanisms that control implantation has been hampered by the overwhelming complexity of factors involved in endometrial receptivity. Our single-cell analysis of decidualizing assembloids suggests that this complexity reflects the reliance of the human endometrium on rapid E2-dependent proliferation and replicative exhaustion to generate both differentiated and senescent epithelial and stromal subpopulations in response to the postovulatory rise in progesterone. We demonstrate that senescent cells in both cellular compartments produce distinct bioactive secretomes, which plausibly prime pre-implantation embryos for interaction with the luminal epithelium and then stimulate encapsulation by underlying decidual stromal cells. Based on our co-culture observations, we predict that a blunted pre-decidual stress response causes implantation failure because of a lack of senescence-induced tissue remodelling and accelerated decidualization. Conversely, a heightened stress response leading to excessive decidual senescence may render embryo implantation effortless, albeit in a decidual matrix destined for breakdown and repair. Finally, we demonstrated that pre-decidual stress responses can be modulated pharmacologically, highlighting the potential of endometrial assembloids as a versatile system to evaluate new or repurposed drugs aimed at preventing reproductive failure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical approvals, endometrial samples, and human blastocysts</title><p>Endometrial biopsies were obtained from women attending the Implantation Research Clinic, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire National Health Service Trust.

RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Manchester, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000. All RNA samples were stored at –80°C until use. Reverse transcription was performed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription (RT) Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (QIAGEN). Input RNA was determined by the sample with lowest concentration within each experiment. Genes of interest were amplified using PrecisionPlus SYBR Green Mastermix (PrimerDesign, Southampton, UK). Amplification was performed in 10 µl reactions containing 5 μl PrecisionPlus 2× master mix, 300 nM each of forward and reverse primer, nuclease-free water, and 1 µl of cDNA or water control. Amplification was performed for 40 cycles on an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (qPCR).

Duoset solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Bio-Techne, Abingdon, UK) were used for the detection of PRL (DY682), TIMP3 (DY973), IL-8 (DY208), IL-15 (DY247), CXCL14 (DY866), and HCG (DY9034). Assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured on a PheraStar microplate reader (BMG LABTECH Ltd, Aylesbury, UK), with background subtraction from absorbance measured at 540 nm. Protein concentration was obtained using a four-parameter logistic regression analysis and interpolation from the curve. As medium was collected at different timepoints in a time-course culture, secreted levels were not normalized to total cell or protein contents.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single-cell capture, library preparation, and sequencing</title><p>Assembloids were dissociated to single cells by incubation of gel droplets with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase I for 10 min in a 37°C water bath for 10 min with regular vigorous shaking.

Pooled beads were processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>) and sequenced using a NextSeq 500 with high-output 75-cycle cartridge (Illumina, Cambridge, UK) by the University of Warwick Genomics Facility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Initial single-cell RNAseq data processing was performed using Drop-Seq_tools-2.3.0 (DropseqAlignmentCookbook_v2Sept2018, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mccarrolllab.com/dropseq">http://mccarrolllab.com/dropseq</ext-link>) and as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>). To select high-quality data for analysis, cells were included when at least 200 genes were detected, while genes were included if they were detected in at least three cells. Cells with more than 5000 genes were excluded from the analysis as were cells with more than 5% mitochondrial gene transcripts to minimize doublets and low quality (broken or damaged) cells, respectively. The Seurat v3 standard workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) was used to integrate datasets from biological replicates. Clustering and nearest-neighbour analysis was performed on the full integrated dataset using principal components 1:15 and a resolution of 0.6. The ‘subset’ function was applied for interrogation of specific experimental conditions and timepoints. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed on differentially expressed genes from specified ‘FindMarkers’ comparisons in Seurat v3 using the Gene Ontology Consortium database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ashburner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">THE GENE ONTOLOGY, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">THE GENE ONTOLOGY, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mi et al., 2013</xref>). Dot plots of significantly enriched GO terms (FDR-adjusted p&lt;0.05) were generated in RStudio (version 1.2.5042). CellPhoneDB was used to predict enriched receptor-ligand interactions between subpopulations in decidualizing assembloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Efremova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vento-Tormo et al., 2018</xref>).

This work provides important insights into the etiology of pregnancy failure in women and may accelerate the discovery of new treatments to improve reproductive health.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Modelling the impact of decidual senescence on embryo implantation in human endometrial assembloids&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Thomas E Spencer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gunter Wagner (Reviewer #2); Hugo Vankelecom (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The story is not always easy to follow if not completely submerged in this field of endometrial receptivity, decidualization, importance of senescence, of NK cells, etc. Authors should at certain points be more focused and should less diverge from the subject (certainly in the Discussion) which would better retain the attention of the reader to the central message of the study. Also, the Abstract could be simplified in this regard. Moreover, the paper will highly benefit from a graphical abstract of summarizing figure, since messages conveyed are not easy for the broader reader.</p><p>2) The epithelial organoid cultures are referred to as glandular organoids throughout the manuscript; however, the cultures may contain a mixed population of glandular and luminal epithelial cells. It would be beneficial to clarify the proportion of glandular and luminal epithelial cells within the culture. This can be done using established markers of endometrial glandular epithelial cells such as FOXA2.</p><p>3) The authors should consider testing their minimal differentiation medium to determine whether it's sufficient to induce a stromal cell response, rather than only testing the secretory response of the endometrial epithelium. If these tests have been done, the authors should consider mentioning them at the place in the text where the epithelial secretion response is discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. As the manuscript introduces a new co-culture model of endometrial stroma and epithelial cells, the authors must describe the relative proportion of cells used to establish co-culture. Specifically, a 1:1 (v/v) ratio of different cell types is ill-defined and will make replication difficult as pellet size can depend on the amount of organoid disruption. Please clarify to enhance reproducibility.</p><p>2. The epithelial organoid cultures are referred to as glandular organoids throughout the manuscript; however, the cultures may contain a mixed population of glandular and luminal epithelial cells. It would be beneficial to clarify the proportion of glandular and luminal epithelial cells within the culture. This can be done using established markers of endometrial glandular epithelial cells such as FOXA2.</p><p>3. Although the authors have introduced a new model that likely will advance our understanding of implantation and pregnancy loss in the future, it is unclear if it provides an advancement in the study of uterine stromal cell decidualization. An unaddressed question from this study is the impact of epithelial cells on stromal cell decidualization. In the future, it will be necessary to directly compare this model with 3D stromal cell culture in the absence of epithelial cells.</p><p>4. In Figure 6, the authors should provide images in the z-plane to show definitive attachment. Likewise, it is advisable to define firm attachment in line 349. As this is only observed as an n=1, the location of the embryo may be a fixation artifact. Additionally, it would not be expected for the trophectoderm to attach to glandular organoids on the side of the basal lamina. Thus, the authors should address the polarity of the organoids should be explored.</p><p>5. Line 259 refers to EpC5 when it should be EpS5.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>P 7: I would be interested in your thinking about the role of NAC in the base medium. There is a role for NOX4 and ROS in decidualization, so should NAC not be inhibiting decidualization?</p><p>Line 157: the role of the level of stress is not really addressed in this paper as I see it, i.e. there is no comparison between more or less replication. May be this statement is not helpful here.</p><p>Also it seems not clear how your experimental model deals with differences between luteal phase changes and those caused by the embryo. Do you expect cAMP signaling be part of the spontaneous decidualization in the cycle or dependent on embryo attachment?</p><p>Line 237: PDGFRA and -B are receptors not growth factors.</p><p>Line 276: EpC4 should be EpS4.</p><p>281 to 282: isn't that always the case?</p><p>Random thought: Given what you write about spread of senescence to neighboring cells, I am wondering whether menstruation results from the withdrawal of DSC directed recruitment of uNK???</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The story is not always easy to follow if not completely submerged in this field of endometrial receptivity, decidualization, importance of senescence, of NK cells, etc. Authors should at certain points be more focused and should less diverge from the subject (certainly in the Discussion) which would better retain the attention of the reader to the central message of the study. Also, the Abstract could be simplified in this regard. Moreover, the paper will highly benefit from a graphical abstract of summarizing figure, since messages conveyed are not easy for the broader reader.</p><p>2) Although the term assembloids has mostly been used for constructs combining organoids from different tissues or multiple cell types, it sounds okay and can be used here.</p><p>3) The use of a single, very broad tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor seems a bit crude as perturbation approach. Not all TKs act in similar processes. Do the authors have an idea about more specific TK pathways that may be involved, starting from their data? It could be interesting to just touch on one of them to zoom in on more specific molecular mechanisms. Or will authors elaborate on this in follow-up studies? Moreover, the effect of dasatinib could also be briefly confirmed with another broad TK inhibitor (although experiments with a more specific one would be rather preferred to fine-tune the focus). In lines 424-426, authors claim a role for the &quot;level of endogenous cellular stress …&quot; from the impact of dasatinib; however, TK signaling does not only underlie celluar stress. Please explain this better.</p><p>4) Authors describe the epithelial compartment in the organoids/assembloids as glandular. Do they have indications from their scRNA-seq data that may point to presence of some luminal epithelium? As far as the reviewer remembers, other scRNA-seq studies may have shown this (Fitzgerald et al., PNAS 2019; Cohrane group; Turco group in BioRxiv). Please discuss.</p><p>5) The study should briefly discuss similarities and differences with a recent paper of the Kessler group (Cell Rep 2021) also having designed an epithelial-stromal co-culture model.</p><p>Specific comments on the different parts:</p><p>Impact statement:</p><p>– &quot; … reveals novel mechanisms of reproductive failure …&quot; should be somewhat toned down since not extensively supported yet, e.g. to &quot;… may lead to new insights into …&quot; or &quot; … will help to unravel/decipher …&quot;.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>– line 37-38: not understandable for the broader reader.</p><p>– line 40: &quot;… mesenchymal-epithelial transition, processes involved in endometrial breakdown and regeneration&quot;: is this sufficiently accepted among endometrium researchers to include it in the Abstract? I would suggest to remove this here.</p><p>– Line 46-47: is rather hypothetical for an abstract.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>– Line 67: &quot;phenotypic decidual cells&quot;? Please explain or rephrase.</p><p>– Lines 107-109: &quot;… demonstrate that different pathological states can be recapitulated …&quot;: this conclusion sounds too far, since authors use only one approach (i.e. the broad TK inhibitor), which cannot be immediately extrapolated to multiple (&quot;different&quot;) pathological states. This generality is indeed not supported yet by experiments; some more proof-of-principle experiments would then be needed (e.g. even Crispr/Cas could be considered). This conclusion is repeated in lines 361-362 and should also there be moderated.</p><p>Results:</p><p>– Line 111, 153: &quot;simple&quot;: why is this adjective used? As compared to?</p><p>– Line 113: &quot;progenitor cells&quot;: it is not known whether organoids are formed by &quot;progenitors&quot; (neither is there conclusive evidence that they exist); this should be removed.</p><p>– Line 122: also Boretto et al. 2017 should be mentioned here.</p><p>– Line 127: how was the 1:1 ratio defined or controlled since organoids were not dissociated into single cells (see Methods line 539)? This is important technical information for a new model.</p><p>– Line 137: &quot;… mimic luteal phase endometrium&quot;: please, show some stainings of primary tissue to support this.</p><p>– Line 162-1645: authors compare day 4 assembloids (undifferentiated), thus being in a proliferative phase, with assembloids in decidualized phase (meaning 4 days longer in culture in non-proliferative conditions). I guess the authors took this into account for DEG/GO analysis, by extracting the impact of cell cycle genes? Please explain.</p><p>– Lines 172-173: &quot;actively dividing EpC&quot; and &quot;EpC with marker genes of the E2-responsive proliferative endometrium&quot;: both are proliferative, so what is their exact difference then? What are the in vivo counterparts of both subclusters? Same question applies to the stromal subclusters SS1 and SS2 (lines 206-207).</p><p>– Line 180: canonical endometrial receptivity genes: please indicate them in the figure, or mention a few here in the text.</p><p>– Lines 193 …: regarding the transitional population (TP): what may be the in vivo correlate? What could be the in vivo function of the TP? The TP appears not to be found in the in vivo endometrium (see Figure 3C). Line 257: there is a lack of crosstalk of TP with other cells, so is the TP an in vitro population not present in vivo? Should be discussed.</p><p>– Line 218: &quot;… novel pre-decidual genes were also identified&quot; … moderate to &quot;novel candidate pre-decidual genes …&quot;.</p><p>– Lines 247…: &quot;… transition between cellular states is predicated …&quot;. This could be further supported by applying pseudotime analysis (using Monocle, RNAvelocity, …). Did the authors consider or perform this?</p><p>– Line 299: dasatinib needs somewhat more introduction/explanation here. How does it work? What does it exactly do?</p><p>– Line 315: TP develop by MET: what are the predicted source cells then? No relevant information available from pseudotime analysis?</p><p>– Line 328-331: this conclusion is not clear from the data; please rephrase and/or include in graphical abstract.</p><p>– Line 342: please immediately specify that exactly one embryo is added per assembloid drop/well.</p><p>– Line 358: all embryo cocultures were found to secrete hCG; thus the 'receptive' co-cultures (without dasatinib) do not show more features of correct interaction ('pregnancy') than the dasatinib-treated ones? Please discuss.</p><p>– Some typo's: line 259: EpS5; line 276: EpS4.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>– Lines 364-373: This part is not really to the point, and could be removed to better retain the focus.</p><p>– Line 423: &quot;… MET drives re-epithelialization …&quot;. how sure is this in the field? Has this recently been unequivocally underpinned? If not, please moderate.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>– Line 526-527: if I understand well, authors use 95% Matrigel/5% cells in medium (1:20), which is high and completely different from other studies using lower % of Matrigel; please confirm or explain.</p><p>– ELISAs: how were secretions in the medium normalized to the number of organoids/cells present in the assembloid drop? Were they normalized to extracted cellular protein b-actin? Or in other words, how was the number of organoids/cells in the structures standardized among wells/plates/independent experiments for secreted protein measurements?</p><p>Figures:</p><p>– Figure 2: PAEP and SPP1 in ExM/E2/cAMP/MPA are indicated as non-significantly different; is this true or correct?</p><p>– Figure 3 C and E: in vivo: please add reference of these data in the legend.</p><p>– Figure 6D: right figure is not explained.</p><p>– Figure 6: &quot;… attached by proliferating polar trophectoderm&quot;: is &quot;proliferating&quot; supported by experimental evidence? Please show then.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions for improved or additional experiments</p><p>– The authors should consider testing their minimal differentiation medium to determine whether it's sufficient to induce a stromal cell response, rather than only testing the secretory response of the endometrial epithelium. If these tests have been done, the authors should consider mentioning them at the place in the text where the epithelial secretion response is discussed.</p><p>– Line 166 and 167 mentions the dotted line in figure 3B.

It appears that only the RNA expression data is used for this experiment, so can it be assumed that the two proteins are both interacting, even if they are both expressed? The CellPhoneDB data should be validated.</p><p>– Line 316: Why does the fact that dasatinib upregulates mesenchymal genes and decidual factors in transitional cells show that MET causes the transitional cells to emerge during decidualization? More evidence is needed for this claim.</p><p>– Line 361: Please clarify which different pathological endometrial states were recapitulated.</p><p>– Is there data demonstrating that implantation failure is associated with insufficient senescence?</p><p>– The &quot;assembloids&quot; are new but there are renditions of the 3D models using epithelial cells and stromal cells that are published and could be cited for comparison purposes. Given the different way the stromal cells were cocultured (in hydrogel) in the assembloid, the morphology is unique and the transcriptomics are new.</p><p>– Single cell RNA-seq of organoids have been performed by Spencer's group although they did not have the cocultured stromal cells. In that sense, the scRNA-seq of epithelial/stromal assembloids have revealed new data and it would be interesting to determine how epithelial transcriptomics changed in the presence of stromal cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Modelling the impact of decidual senescence on embryo implantation in human endometrial assembloids&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Consequently, the implantation process is often reduced and equated to breaching of the luminal epithelium by an embryo. In mice, a polytocous rodent, the barrier function of the luminal epithelial plays a critical role in synchronising implantation of multiple embryos, which can transiently arrest development (diapause) in the uterine cavity while awaiting a maternal nidation signal (estrogen). Implantation in humans, on the other hand, normally involves a single embryo, often harbouring complex chromosomal errors and lacking the ability to transiently arrest development while awaiting a maternal implantation signal (which does not appear to exist). Hence, whether the barrier function of the luminal endometrium epithelium in mice is maintained or degraded in humans is questionable and, by extension, so is the prevailing implantation paradigm. More importantly, the major hurdle at implantation in humans, and other menstruating primates, is not synchronised implantation of multiple blastocysts, but transformation of cycling endometrium into the decidua of pregnancy robust enough to accommodate a deeply invading placenta throughout gestation. This process inevitably requires intense tissue remodelling and the underlying mechanisms that control endometrial fate decision at implantation are explored in this study. Hence, we make no apologies for describing the major cellular players in this process. In fact, all the players involved in endometrial remodelling (acute senescent cells, differentiated cells, innate immune cells, and chronic senescent cells) will be instantaneously recognisable to anyone working in the field of tissue remodelling, whether in the context of development, wound healing, ageing or even cancer. Nevertheless, we appreciate this request for more clarity.

Further, in the Garcia-Alonso preprint article, label transfer from in vivo single-cell data onto the gland-like organoid dataset reveals very few luminal epithelial cells to our eyes, and expression of luminal epithelial markers (e.g. LGR5, <italic>SOX9</italic>,WNT7A<sup>high</sup>) appears lost upon hormonal differentiation of organoids. It is also notable that the overlap in epithelial gene expression between gland fragments and organoids reported by Turco et al., (PMID: 28394884) was fairly low (30-37%), suggesting that cells do undergo a phenotypic change in vitro, although the full gene lists are not available alongside that paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should consider testing their minimal differentiation medium to determine whether it's sufficient to induce a stromal cell response, rather than only testing the secretory response of the endometrial epithelium. If these tests have been done, the authors should consider mentioning them at the place in the text where the epithelial secretion response is discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now tested the decidualization response of primary endometrial stromal cells in standard 2D cultures to the minimal differentiation medium supplemented with E2, cAMP and MPA (MDM+E2+cAMP+MPA) in comparison to our standard differentiation medium for 2D cultures (2% DCC-DMEM+cAMP+MPA). Further, the impact of assembloid expansion medium supplemented with E2 (ExM+E2) during the growth phase was compared to that of our standard growth medium (10% DCC-DMEM) for primary cultures. Secreted levels of IL-8 (released by pre-decidual cells without corresponding induction at mRNA level) and CXCL14 and TIMP3 (induced upon decidualization) were monitored in two biologically independent cultures. Unfortunately, access to endometrial biopsies is currently very limited because of the impact of the pandemic on our research clinic. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, kinetics of decidual secretions were identical under all treatment conditions, characterised by a rapid but transient rise in IL-8 secretion on day 2 of decidualization and followed by accelerated rise in CXCL14 and TIMP3 secretion by day 4. Further, when subjected to the same differentiation medium (2% DCC-DMEM+cAMP+MPA), primary endometrial stromal culture grown first in ExM+E2 tended to secrete lower IL-8 levels on day 2 of decidualization but higher CXCL14 and TIMP3 levels by day 4 when compared to cultures first grown in 10% DCC-DMEM. These observations reinforce our assertion that the amplitude of initial pre-decidual stress response is determined during the preceding proliferative phase and that a blunted pre-decidual stress response accelerates decidualization and vice versa.

Although the authors have introduced a new model that likely will advance our understanding of implantation and pregnancy loss in the future, it is unclear if it provides an advancement in the study of uterine stromal cell decidualization. An unaddressed question from this study is the impact of epithelial cells on stromal cell decidualization. In the future, it will be necessary to directly compare this model with 3D stromal cell culture in the absence of epithelial cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you – we appreciate this point. In fact, as part of a different project, we are assessing if stromal cells from control subjects can attenuate epithelial defects in gland-like organoids of women with recurrent missed miscarriage. As implied by the Reviewer, endometrial assembloids are indeed a powerful tool to dissect how defects in one cellular compartment influence differentiation response in the other compartment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 6, the authors should provide images in the z-plane to show definitive attachment. Likewise, it is advisable to define firm attachment in line 349. As this is only observed as an n=1, the location of the embryo may be a fixation artifact. Additionally, it would not be expected for the trophectoderm to attach to glandular organoids on the side of the basal lamina. Thus, the authors should address the polarity of the organoids should be explored.</p></disp-quote><p>The time-lapse imaging shows decidualizing stromal cells extending toward the polar trophectoderm of the blastocyst and making contact by 46-50 hours in co-culture. Please see Figure 6—figure supplement 1, where stromal cell migration is demarcated by a dotted white line. Migrating cells continue to surround the embryo at this site and then draw the embryo toward the assembloid matrix. We are confident in the attachment of this embryo since it remained associated with the assembloid through transfer from the culture well into fixation and washing solutions, postage and staining processes while unattached embryos were lost during processing. However, we have removed the word ‘firm’ from the text to avoid potential overstatement. Future work will involve more extensive imaging and the use of additional labels to confirm implantation and outgrowth. Interestingly, endoglandular trophoblast invasion has been reported in human pregnancies (PMID: 13362122, PMID: 26493408), including at very early post-implantation. So, while we agree that initial embryo-endometrium interaction in vivo would not be expected to involve the basal lamina of glands, this may well occur shortly after implantation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

There is a role for NOX4 and ROS in decidualization, so should NAC not be inhibiting decidualization?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the mechanisms accounting for the beneficial action of NAC in our model warrant further exploration. However, the concentration of NAC used in the minimal differentiation medium is an order of magnitude lower than needed for ROS clearance (MDM contains 1.25 mM NAC, 10-15 mM NAC) is used elsewhere (PMID: 17343919, PMID: 19498006, PMID: 31885807, PMID: 33585475). Therefore, we speculate that low-dose NAC may not constrain decidualization-associated ROS production in assembloids, yet confer some protection against oxidative cell death and therefore beneficial upon differentiation. Additional roles for NAC include serving as a reserve of amino acid cysteine and maintaining redox homeostasis, which may also contribute to its beneficial effects in minimal differentiation medium (PMID: 18671159, PMID: 20602078). We have now stated in the text that NAC was used at low concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 157: the role of the level of stress is not really addressed in this paper as I see it, i.e. there is no comparison between more or less replication.

We believe indeed that this is indeed the case. In the absence of an implanting embryo, and in response to falling progesterone (which disables the uNK-decidual cell partnership/cooperation), unopposed bystander senescence driven by mounting SASP is anticipated to cause sterile inflammation in the superficial layer, triggering a concatenation of events that ultimately results in menstrual breakdown. Across the menstrual cycle, expression of canonical senescence-associated genes generally rises sharply during the late-secretory phase. It is also plausible that transient senescence-associated inflammation in the superficial layer prior to menstruation ‘primes’ endometrial progenitors residing in the basal layer to promote tissue regeneration in the next cycle. The biological basis for this assertion is that transient SASP induces de-differentiation of cells to a more progenitor-like state and ‘lock-in’ of stem cells, thereby accelerating tissue regeneration upon resolution of SASP. Thus, it is conceivable, if not likely, that endometrial repair mechanisms become poised to be activated prior to menstruation. Notably, persistent, chronic SASP causes stem cell depletion and reduces regenerative capacity of tissues, a process widely believed to drive ageing and age-related disorders.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The story is not always easy to follow if not completely submerged in this field of endometrial receptivity, decidualization, importance of senescence, of NK cells, etc. Authors should at certain points be more focused and should less diverge from the subject (certainly in the Discussion) which would better retain the attention of the reader to the central message of the study.

Moreover, the effect of dasatinib could also be briefly confirmed with another broad TK inhibitor (although experiments with a more specific one would be rather preferred to fine-tune the focus).

The reasons for this are not entirely clear but may relate to the use of the basement membrane matrix, Matrigel, in their model. Indeed, clustering of their stromal lineage is very restricted to the periphery of the organoids, while our stromal cells form a matrix throughout the gel droplet. Thus, the approach taken by Cheung et al., i.e. using iPSC-derived stromal cells, has the advantage of being able to model mechanisms of lineage commitment. However, our model successfully incorporates primary endometrial stromal cells in a collagen matrix to model the functional layer of the endometrium. This offers a more physiological approach to study implantation processes in patient-specific assembloids, investigate endometrial dyshomeostasis, and evaluate therapeutic intervention. Additionally, our characterisation of a minimal differentiation medium further advances a more physiological model, enabling intrinsic cell-cell communications to regulate growth and differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments on the different parts:</p><p>Impact statement:</p><p>– &quot; … reveals novel mechanisms of reproductive failure …&quot; should be somewhat toned down since not extensively supported yet, e.g. to &quot;… may lead to new insights into …&quot; or &quot; … will help to unravel/decipher …&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you – done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract:</p><p>– line 37-38: not understandable for the broader reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, amended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– line 40: &quot;… mesenchymal-epithelial transition, processes involved in endometrial breakdown and regeneration&quot;: is this sufficiently accepted among endometrium researchers to include it in the Abstract?

Emerging cells exhibit features of migratory capacity characteristic to fibroblasts (i.e. intracellular microtubular systems and pseudopodial projections), but basement membrane formation and intercellular desmosomes in line with epithelial function (PMID: 2064209). These luminal EpC closely relate to the underlying EnSC, therefore mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) is the most likely mechanism to explain the rapid repair process (PMID: 30407544) since tissue shedding largely precludes the likelihood that other LE progenitors are present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods:</p><p>– Line 526-527: if I understand well, authors use 95% Matrigel/5% cells in medium (1:20), which is high and completely different from other studies using lower % of Matrigel; please confirm or explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Our protocol uses a Cells-to-Matrigel ratio of 1:20 (v/v) as described by Turco and colleagues (PMID: 28394884) in their method for the establishment of gland-like organoids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– ELISAs: how were secretions in the medium normalized to the number of organoids/cells present in the assembloid drop? Were they normalized to extracted cellular protein b-actin? Or in other words, how was the number of organoids/cells in the structures standardized among wells/plates/independent experiments for secreted protein measurements?</p></disp-quote><p>We controlled the seeding density of assembloid cultures as described above and in the manuscript. Cells were harvested entirely for staining or single-cell sequencing experiments, so we were unable to extract cellular protein from these cohorts. ELISAs were performed in secretions from samples which were grown in parallel (i.e. not sequential) experiments so densities could be assessed objectively. Statistical analysis took pairing into account.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures:</p><p>– Figure 2: PAEP and SPP1 in ExM/E2/cAMP/MPA are indicated as non-significantly different; is this true or correct?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the lack of statistical significance was unexpected. We have reviewed the statistical analysis (Friedman test and Dunn’s multiple comparisons <italic>post-hoc</italic> test, significant accepted at <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) for these data and the results presented are correct. This is likely due to the spread of the data (note the logarithmic axis), despite consistent induction of <italic>SPP1</italic> in all 3 cultures. We used primary cells in these experiments, thus patient variability is the probable source of variance – however induction was seen across all patients, independent of phenotypic differences, indicating a robust response within the model. Culture in the NAC+ media was the only condition which appeared to support induction of both markers (regardless of the statistical outcome) and thus was selected for further experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3 C and E: in vivo: please add reference of these data in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, now added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6D: right figure is not explained.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 6D shows the changes in diameters of embryos (µm) over 72 hours of time-lapse imaging, as determined in ImageJ.

If these tests have been done, the authors should consider mentioning them at the place in the text where the epithelial secretion response is discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>See response above (Essential Revisions, point 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 166 and 167 mentions the dotted line in figure 3B. Please add an explanation for the dotted line circles.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. The dotted circles were intended to highlight ciliated and TP populations. These populations were not segregated by the UMAP co-ordinates referenced, which we note broadly segregated the populations into stroma/epithelium and Day0/Day4. We have amended the Figure legend to make this clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 172-173: Please provide more clarity on the difference between actively dividing epithelial cells and epithelial cells expressing markers of proliferating endometrium.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity. EpS1 represents a highly proliferative epithelial population, enriched in expression cell cycle genes and functional GO terms relating to DNA replication, centromere complex assembly and chromosome organisation. By contrast, EpS2 represents cells enriched for proliferative phase endometrial genes with GO terms including ‘reproductive structure development’, ‘epithelial cell development’ and ‘response to hormone’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 218: Were these novel pre-decidual genes verified in human pre-decidual samples? Can the authors confirm that they are not artifacts of their culture system?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this query. Actually, upon closer scrutiny of the literature, both <italic>DDIT4</italic> (PMID: 29447340) and <italic>P4HA2</italic> (PMID: 25781565) have already been implicated in the decidualization process, although not as yet mapped to pre-decidual cells. Mining of publicly available microarray data (GEO dataset GDS2052 and manuscript Figure 3E) confirmed their expression in early luteal phase endometrium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please clarify how ligands and receptors were chosen to be entered into the CellPhoneDB program.</p></disp-quote><p>CellPhoneDB is an online, publicly available repository of ligands, receptors and their interactions (https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb), which integrates various existing datasets and new manually reviewed information. In order to use this computational tool, expression counts and cell metadata were extracted from our single-cell data for decidualizing cells (i.e. those populations present in D4 cultures) according to pipelines provided by the CellPhoneDB vignette. The CellphoneDB package then derives enriched receptor–ligand interactions between two cell types based on expression of a receptor by one cell type and a ligand by another cell type (as described here: https://www.cellphonedb.org/explore-sc-rna-seq). We chose to exclude integrin-interactions from our analysis and focus on cell-cell interactions rather than cell-ECM, but future investigation of these is certainly of interest to the progression of the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 260: Please clarify the CellPhoneDB data. It appears that only the RNA expression data is used for this experiment, so can it be assumed that the two proteins are both interacting, even if they are both expressed? The CellPhoneDB data should be validated.</p></disp-quote><p>CellphoneDB is a curated repository of ligands and receptors, and their interactions, which is used to predict biologically relevant interacting ligand-receptor partners computationally from single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) data. During the analysis pipeline, CellphoneDB considers the absolute expression levels of ligands and receptors within each cell type (using counts data) and applies empirical shuffling to calculate which ligand–receptor pairs display significant cell-type specificity. This predicts molecular interactions between cell populations via specific protein complexes and generates potential cell–cell communication networks. The dasatinib experiments were based on CellphoneDB predictions and in, that sense, constitute a validation experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 316: Why does the fact that dasatinib upregulates mesenchymal genes and decidual factors in transitional cells show that MET causes the transitional cells to emerge during decidualization? More evidence is needed for this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer. We amended the text and now state that the data only suggest that these cells are of stromal origins. This conjecture is supported indirectly by studies highlighted the critical role of MET in endometrial repair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 361: Please clarify which different pathological endometrial states were recapitulated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have elaborated this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is there data demonstrating that implantation failure is associated with insufficient senescence?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, direct evidence has come from Cornelis Lambalk and colleagues who demonstrated in a prospective cohort study premature expression of the decidualization marker PRL is associated with repeated implantation failure (RIF) (PMID: 31389284). This study was based on immunohistochemistry. At mRNA level, PRL is not a particularly useful marker to analyse the decidual response in whole endometrial samples. We recently reported much more specific marker genes selectively expressed in decidualising stromal cells (e.g. <italic>SCARA5</italic>) and senescent decidual cells (e.g. <italic>DIO2</italic>) in luteal endometrium. We can share with the Reviewer that an ongoing analysis of almost 800 endometrial biopsies indicates that RIF is associated with increased frequency of cycles characterised by excessive decidualisation (high SCARA5, low DIO2). Conversely, RPL is associated with excessive senescence (high DIO2, low SCARA5) and the frequency of cycles with excessive senescence increases stepwise with the number of previous miscarriages, and thus the recurrence risk of miscarriage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The &quot;assembloids&quot; are new but there are renditions of the 3D models using epithelial cells and stromal cells that are published and could be cited for comparison purposes. Given the different way the stromal cells were cocultured (in hydrogel) in the assembloid, the morphology is unique and the transcriptomics are new.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We are pleased to inform the Reviewer that we now have a comprehensive review of endometrial co-culture models under review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Single cell RNA-seq of organoids have been performed by Spencer's group although they did not have the cocultured stromal cells. In that sense, the scRNA-seq of epithelial/stromal assembloids have revealed new data and it would be interesting to determine how epithelial transcriptomics changed in the presence of stromal cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that comparison between the transcriptomes of epithelial organoid cultures and epithelial/stromal assembloids would be of interest both to ourselves and others. Unfortunately, the single-cell data for the previously published results are not publicly available. Differences in the culture conditions (matrix, media etc) may also confound comparisons between datasets generated in different labs. As mentioned in our response to Reviewer 1, we are in the process of assessing if stromal cells from control subjects can attenuate epithelial defects in gland-like organoids of women with recurrent missed miscarriage.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have addressed most of Reviewer 4's concerns.
