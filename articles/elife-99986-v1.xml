However, the mechanism of brain response to hypoxia remains unclear, thus limiting the development of interventional strategies. This study conducted combined analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome sequencing and extracellular vesicle transcriptome sequencing on hypoxic mouse brains, described cell–cell communication in the brain under hypoxia from intercellular and extracellular dimensions, confirmed that hemoglobin mRNA was transferred from non-neuronal cells to neurons, and eventually expressed. Then we further explored the role of exosomal hemoglobin transfer in vitro, using human-derived cell lines, and clarified that hypoxia promoted the transfer and expression of exosomal hemoglobin between endothelial cells and neurons. We found the vital function of exosomal hemoglobin to protect against neurological injury by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons. In conclusion, this study identified a novel mechanism of ‘mutual aid’ in hypoxia responses in the brain, involving exosomal hemoglobin transfer, clarified the important role of exosomal communication in the process of brain stress response, and provided a novel interventional perspective for hypoxia-related brain diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain-derived extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>hemoglobin</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial homeostasis</kwd><kwd>nerve injury</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32100925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005090</institution-id><institution>Beijing Nova Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z211100002121038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005090</institution-id><institution>Beijing Nova Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20230484436</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese Institutes for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CX23YQ01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Basic Research Cooperation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22JCZXJ00190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exosomal mRNA transfer from non-neuronal cells to neurons under hypoxia drives hemoglobin expression and preserves mitochondrial homeostasis as an intercellular protective mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-enclosed vesicles secreted by cells into the extracellular environment and are an important means of cell communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Niel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cocozza et al., 2023</xref>). EV-mediated communication can participate in the regulation of intercellular signals in physiological and pathological conditions by transferring different contents, such as bioactive lipids, non-coding RNAs, mRNAs, and proteins, and the process is closely related to the occurrence and development of various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kalluri and LeBleu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Korvenlaita et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fabbiano et al., 2020</xref>). Current research on the biological function of EVs is mostly focused on EVs in body fluids, such as plasma and saliva; however, although their acquisition is relatively simple, such EVs have low tissue specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, more in-depth studies have obtained and analyzed EVs from the extracellular environment in organs with complex structures, thus improving tissue specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mathieu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D’Acunzo et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, this still fails to identify the cell type from which they are derived, making it impossible to carry out more detailed analyses of directional interactions between cells. The development of single-cell/nuclear transcriptome sequencing (snRNA-seq) technology allows us to explore the heterogeneity of cells in complex organs, and the combination of snRNA-seq and tissue EVs transcriptome sequencing (EVs-RNA-seq) can help us clarify the source of tissue EVs and analyze the complex physiological and pathological conditions of organs, using the dual advantages of intracellular and extracellular approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Svensson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Hypoxia is a common stress response in the body that can mediate a series of physiological reactions, including embryonic development and bone marrow hematopoiesis. Hypoxia is also an important factor in various pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choudhry and Harris, 2018</xref>). As the most O<sub>2</sub>-dependent organ, the brain accounts for 20% of the resting O<sub>2</sub> consumption in humans and is thus highly sensitive to hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burtscher et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kann and Kovács, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Silver and Erecińska, 1998</xref>). Hypoxia is a key cause of many neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitroshina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burtscher et al., 2021b</xref>). Although there is known to be a close relationship between hypoxic stress and neurodegeneration, the responses of and damage to brain cells in hypoxic environments remain unclear. The application of snRNA-seq combined with tissue EVs-RNA-seq analysis can be used to comprehensively analyze the interactions among various cell types in the brain under hypoxic stress, thus helping us understand the mechanisms of neurodegenerative injury and identify potential therapeutic molecules for interventions.</p><p>Hemoglobin is a major protein involved in the transport and utilization of O<sub>2</sub> in the body. It is composed of globin and heme and is mainly expressed in red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gell, 2018</xref>). Previous studies found that hemoglobin also existed in the brain, mainly in neurons, where it was involved in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis and the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, and its expression level was significantly increased under hypoxic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auvinen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Singhal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schelshorn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferrer et al., 2011</xref>). However, recent studies found that hemoglobin may also be involved in the development of neurodegeneration; for example, α-synuclein pathology-hemoglobin-mitochondrial aggregates were found in Lewy bodies in patients with PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Killinger et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, neuronal hemoglobin induced dopaminergic neuron loss and cognitive deficits in the substantia nigra in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Santulli et al., 2022</xref>), and hemoglobin deposited in the cerebral cortex after intracerebral hemorrhage exerted neurotoxicity and induced neuronal death in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). In summary, the specific role of hemoglobin expression in neurons is controversial, and the role of hypoxia in the function of hemoglobin in neurons is still unknown.</p><p>In this study, we established a chronic hypoxia mouse model and identified one of the brain’s responses to hypoxia. Specifically, we found that non-neuronal cells in the brain regulate neuronal hemoglobin levels via EV-communication under hypoxic conditions, as revealed by the combined analyses of snRNA-seq and EVs-RNA-seq. We also established an in vitro hypoxia neuron model to investigate the specific molecular mechanism of neuroprotection, demonstrating that exosomal hemoglobin helped neurons resist hypoxic damage by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. In summary, this study found a new mechanism of exosomal hemoglobin delivery in the brain’s hypoxic response ‘mutual aid’, and clarified the important role of exosomal communication in the brain’s hypoxic stress response and resistance to injury. It provides a new research perspective for the prevention and treatment of hypoxic-ischemic-related brain diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypoxia induced the cognitive and motor dysfunction and neuropathological damage</title><p>In order to clarify the damage caused by hypoxia in the brain, we established a chronic hypoxia model in C57BL/6J mice using a closed and controllable hypoxic box; the mice were divided into a control group (Con) and a hypoxic treatment group (hypoxia for 28 days, H28d) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Behavioral tests and neuropathological staining were used to examine the effect of chronic hypoxia on neurological impairment and nerve damage. The results of the Y-maze tests showed that the alternation behavior was significantly decreased, and the novel object recognition tests showed that the exploration time of new objects was significantly reduced after hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia induced cognitive dysfunction in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To evaluate spontaneous movement, we performed an open-field test and recorded the motor function and cognitive function indicators of the two groups. The movement trajectory in the open field was significantly reduced in H28d group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Assuming that the total exercise times were similar in both groups, the exercise distance and speed were also significantly reduced in H28d mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results suggested that the motor function was impaired after hypoxia. In addition, H28d mice spent less time exploring the central area of the open field and crossing the central area, indicating anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypoxia induced neurological dysfunction and nerve injury in mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of chronic hypoxic mouse model construction.

Beyond the hypoxia-inducible factor signaling pathways, intercellular communication among diverse brain cell types is imperative for mitigating stress-induced damage in hypoxic conditions. Mounting evidence suggests that hypoxia enhances intercellular communication primarily through interactions involving EVs, thereby facilitating the transmission of various cargoes with distinct functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Korvenlaita et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Our research findings also indicate that hypoxia induces a significant enhancement in EVs-mediated communication among various cell types in the brain. Through the isolation and purification of tissue-derived EVs followed by transcriptomic sequencing analysis, we are able to describe changes in intercellular communication within the brain from an extracellular perspective. However, this method does not provide a comprehensive map of intracellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). Through the combined analysis of snRNA-seq and EVs-RNA-seq, we can accurately identify the cellular origin of brain-derived EVs, thus comprehensively revealing changes in intercellular communication within the brain induced by hypoxia.</p><p>To investigate this phenomenon, we employed a chronic hypoxia model in which mice were exposed to 7% O<sub>2</sub> for 28 days. This model aims to mimic systemic hypoxia-induced multi-organ damage, a condition observed in diseases such as high-altitude hypoxia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute hypoxic brain injury. The primary goal of this model is to explore how the brain adapts under extreme low-oxygen conditions and employs specific mechanisms to protect itself from hypoxia-induced damage. This approach provides valuable insight into diseases related to hypoxic-ischemic injury in the brain, including stroke and vascular dementia, offering a novel perspective for potential clinical applications.</p><p>This study elucidates a novel mechanism whereby various non-neuronal cells in the brain regulate hemoglobin levels in neurons through EV-communication under hypoxic stress, emphasizing the crucial role of EV communication in the brain’s response to hypoxia.</p><p>Hemoglobin, as the main protein carrying and transporting oxygen molecules in the body, is also expressed in neurons, but its precise function remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schelshorn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Russo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>). Current research suggests that hemoglobin expressed in the brains of PD patients participates in regulating intraneuronal oxygen homeostasis and maintaining mitochondrial stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vanni et al., 2018</xref>). However, other studies indicate that hemoglobin may exert neurotoxic effects by inducing oxidative stress and neuronal death, thereby contributing to the onset and progression of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Santulli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). To clarify the role of hemoglobin in the brain under hypoxic stress, this study, based on the elucidation of the mechanism by which non-neuronal cells regulate neuronal hemoglobin through EVs, conducted in vitro experiments. These experiments revealed that increased expression of EV-derived hemoglobin in neurons under hypoxia helps maintain mitochondrial homeostasis by sustaining mitochondrial membrane potential, thus aiding neurons in resisting hypoxic damage. This study clarified that the expression of exosomal hemoglobin in neurons contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis under stress and expanded the function of hemoglobin except transporting oxygen over a long range.</p><p>However, our research also had some limitations. First, we only clarified the hypoxic protective effect of hemoglobin on neuronal mitochondria in vitro and were unable to explain the inconsistency between the increase in neuronal hemoglobin expression and the decrease of mitochondrial activity observed in vivo. We speculated that some pathological changes may make hemoglobin, which is increased in response to hypoxia, unable to exert its mitochondrial protective effect, even more than making hemoglobin transform and exacerbating nerve damage. For example, previous studies reported large numbers of phosphorylated α-synuclein and hemoglobin aggregates in Lewy bodies in PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Killinger et al., 2022</xref>), and we previously confirmed that chronic hypoxia increased α-synuclein phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2022</xref>). We therefore speculate that hemoglobin is increased in response to hypoxia and then phosphorylated by α-synuclein binding to stay in the cytoplasm, thus losing its mitochondrial protective ability and form pathological depositions, inducing cell death. However, further studies are needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p>In summary, we used the combined analysis of snRNA-seq and EVs-RNA-seq to examine the effects of hypoxia on interactions among different cell types in the brain and clarify the hypoxic response mechanism of non-neuronal EVs communication pathways to dynamically regulate hemoglobin levels in neurons. We revealed that increased levels of exosomal hemoglobin in neurons may help neurons to resist hypoxic injury by protecting mitochondrial function. These results clarify the molecular mechanism by which various non-neuronal cells interact via the EVs pathway to help neurons resist hypoxic injury and highlight the important role of hemoglobin in hypoxia-related nerve injury, thus providing a new perspective for the prevention and treatment of various hypoxic-ischemic brain diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of chronic hypoxia model</title><p>A mouse model of chronic hypoxia was established in closed controlled hypoxic chambers (Ningbo Hua Yi Ning Chuang, China).

After treatment of hcMEC/D3 cells, the culture medium was collected and centrifuged at 300×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min at room temperature to remove cell debris, followed by 3000×<italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min to remove apoptotic bodies, and then filtered with a 0.22 μm filter membrane. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000×<italic>g</italic> for 30 min to remove large microbubbles (&gt;500 nm). The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 110,000×<italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 70 min, and the EVs in the precipitate were collected and re-suspended in PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>EV uptake detection</title><p>Dil solution (5 μM; Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher) was added to PBS containing EVs and incubated for 30 min. Excess dye in the labeled EVs was removed by ultracentrifugation at 110,000×<italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 1 h. The EVs were then washed three times by re-suspending the precipitate in PBS, and the final washing was re-suspended in PBS. PBS solution containing Dil-EVs was added to a culture dish containing SH-SY5Y cells, and Dil-EV uptake by the cells was observed under a confocal microscope after 24 h of culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Cell viability</title><p>Cells were inoculated into 96-well plates at a density of 2000–3000 cells per well. CCK-8 cell viability assay (New Cell and Molecular Biotech, China) was carried out as follows: DMEM (1:10) solution was added to each well of the cell plate containing cells and samples and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. The absorbance (optical density) of each well was then measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax i3, Molecular Devices, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Cytotoxicity detection</title><p>Cytotoxicity was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay (Roche, USA). The powder was dissolved in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and fully mixed to prepare a catalytic solution, followed by adding 250 μL of this catalytic solution to the dyeing solution (11.25 mL) and mixing to prepare the LDH reaction solution. Cell supernatant (100 μL) from each group was then added to a new 96-well plate and 100 µL LDH reaction solution was added and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. After incubation, 50 μL of termination solution was added to each well and gently mixed for 10 min, and the absorbance of each well at 490 nm was measured using a microplate reader.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-7"><title>Mitochondrial viability detection</title><p>Mitochondria in the cultured cells were labeled and their activity was detected using MitoTracker dye (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher), and the mitochondrial membrane potential was detected using JC-1 dye (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). MitoTracker dye was diluted to 50 nM with DMEM before staining, and JC-1 dye was diluted to 10 μg/mL with DMEM before staining, and stored in the dark at 4°C until use. After removing the original medium at the designated treatment end point, the cultured cells were digested and centrifuged at 1000×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes and then resuspended in DMEM with dye and incubated for 20 min. The dye-containing medium was then removed by centrifugation at 1000×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and the cells were washed twice with PBS, and then resuspended in PBS. The fluorescence intensity of each sample was detected using a BD LSRFortessa SORP flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, USA). Follow-up analysis was performed using FlowJo.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-8"><title>Cell death detection</title><p>Propidium iodide (PI)/Hoechst staining was used to detect primary neuronal cell death. The culture medium was discarded and the cells were washed three times with PBS, followed by incubation with PI (4 mM) and Hoechst (0.5 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 10 min, and washed with PBS for 5 min. Images were observed and captured by confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-9"><title>Exchange of endothelial cell-conditioned medium</title><p>Medium exchange was performed to determine if EC-conditioned medium could exert neuroprotective effects. hcMEC/D3 cells were subjected to hypoxia and the culture medium was then collected. Cell debris and apoptotic bodies were removed by gradient centrifugation and filtered with a 0.22 μm filter membrane to obtain EC-conditioned medium. The conditioned medium was added to SH-SY5Y cells that had been adherent for 12 h, and subsequent hypoxia treatment and cell detection were performed.</p><p>EV removal and medium-exchange experiments were used to determine if the EVs in EC-conditioned medium could exert neuroprotective effects. The collected conditioned medium was subjected to ultracentrifugation to remove EVs, followed by medium exchange and subsequent experiments.</p><p><italic>HBA1</italic> RNAi plasmid transfection combined with medium-exchange experiments was used to determine if <italic>HBA1</italic> mRNA in EVs from EC-conditioned medium had a neuroprotective role. The hcMEC/D3 cells were transfected with <italic>HBA1</italic> RNAi plasmid mixed with Lipofectamine 3000 and P3000 (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher) in advance for 24 h, followed by hypoxia and conditioned medium collection, and medium exchange and subsequent experiments were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data storage, recording, and statistical analysis were carried out using Excel and GraphPad Prism 10.0 software. The image data were analyzed using ImageJ. The Shapiro–Wilk tests and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used to check the normality of the variables. Unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests (two-tailed) were used to compare differences between two sets of normally distribution data with equal variance, otherwise, non-parametric tests were used. Differences among multiple groups were analyzed by one-way/two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test. Image data were analyzed by ImageJ. Data were expressed as mean ± standard error (SEM), and p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>C57BL/6J wild-type male mice used in the study were purchased from SPF (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

Please find our answers to the points raised by the reviewer below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) Hypoxia can induce endothelial cells to release exosomes carrying hemoglobin, however, how neurons are able to actively take up these exosomes? It is possible for other cells to take up these exosomes also? This point needs to be clarified in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s valuable comments. Regarding the question of how neurons actively uptake extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying hemoglobin mRNA, existing studies suggest that EVs can enter cells via three main pathways: direct fusion, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and phagocytosis (PMID: 25288114). Our experimental results show that neurons are able to actively uptake EVs from endothelial cells without any treatment, and hypoxic conditions did not significantly increase the uptake of endothelial EVs by neurons (Fig. 5A and I). As for the specific uptake mechanism, there is currently no definitive conclusion. Some studies have found that hypoxic-ischemic injury may induce neurons to upregulate Cav-1, which could enhance the uptake of endothelial-derived EVs via Cav-1-mediated endocytosis (PMID: 31740664), but this mechanism still requires further validation.</p><p>Regarding whether other cell types also take up these EVs, we focused on neurons based on existing literature and our own data, which show that the increased hemoglobin in the brain under hypoxic conditions is primarily found in neurons (Fig. 4H-J, PMID: 19116637). Moreover, we observed that, under hypoxic conditions, almost all non-neuronal supporting cells in the brain transcribe hemoglobin in large amounts and release it via EVs (Fig. 3J). Furthermore, we would like to emphasize that although neurons do not transcribe hemoglobin, we observed substantial expression of hemoglobin within neurons. This suggests that it may serve as an important protective mechanism for the brain. Therefore, the focus of our study is on the protective effect of EVs carrying hemoglobin mRNA on neurons, and the uptake by other cell types was not explored. We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s question, and we believe this is an intriguing avenue for further investigation. This could provide new insights for interventions in hypoxic brain injury, and we plan to delve into this topic in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The expression of hemoglobin in neurons is important for mitochondrial homeostasis, but its relationship with mitochondrial homeostasis needs to be further elucidated in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s valuable comments. We fully agree with the importance of hemoglobin expression in neurons for mitochondrial homeostasis. In this study, we have confirmed through in vitro experiments that when neurons are treated with conditioned medium from endothelial cells, they exhibit increased hemoglobin expression. This, in turn, enhances their resistance to hypoxia by restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing mitochondrial numbers, thereby effectively improving neuronal viability. Notably, this protective effect disappears when EVs are removed from the endothelial-conditioned medium or when hemoglobin in endothelial cells is disrupted, further supporting the notion that endothelial cells transfer hemoglobin via EVs, helping neurons express hemoglobin under hypoxic conditions and exert protective effects.</p><p>In summary, hemoglobin primarily helps maintain mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby supporting the restoration of energy metabolism and production under hypoxic conditions, which effectively improves the neuronal resistance to hypoxia. Although we were unable to explore the specific mechanisms of hemoglobin’s role in mitochondrial homeostasis in detail within this study, we recognize the importance of this aspect and plan to further investigate how hemoglobin regulates mitochondrial homeostasis and function in neurons in future research.</p><p>Once again, we greatly appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments. We will continue to optimize our research direction and look forward to further elucidating these important biological mechanisms in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) In Figures 1-3, the authors use &quot;Endo&quot; to represent endothelial cells, while in Figures 4-7, the abbreviation &quot;EC&quot; is used. Please standardize the format.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s suggestion. We will use “EC” consistently to refer to endothelial cells throughout the manuscript to ensure uniformity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In all qPCR statistical results, please italicize the gene names on the axis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable suggestion. We will make sure to italicize the gene names on the axis in all qPCR statistical results to adhere to the formatting requirements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the Western blot result of Figure 3C, what type of cell-derived exosomes does the Control group represent, and why can it be used as a control group for brain-derived exosomes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s insightful question. In Fig. 3C, the control group (Control) represents the cell lysate sample, which serves as a positive control in the EVs Western blot analysis. In this experiment, the positive control is primarily used to validate the specificity of the antibody and the accuracy of the experimental procedure. We used cell lysate as the control to confirm that the antibody can detect EV-associated markers in the cell lysates, thus providing a comparative basis for the identification of brain-derived EVs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 4F, the morphology of hemoglobin in the Con group and the H28d group is not entirely consistent with Figure 4H. Is this difference due to different experimental batches?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s careful observation. The observed difference may indeed be due to variations between different experimental batches. To ensure consistency of the results, we have updated the representative immunofluorescence images, which are now presented in Fig. 4H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Supplement the transcription and expression levels of hemoglobin in neurons under different treatment conditions after medium exchange with exosome removal and medium exchange after HBA1 interference.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable suggestions. We have added the experimental data regarding the exchange of culture medium after the removal of EVs. As shown in Fig. S6, the endothelial-derived medium without EVs does not enhance the hemoglobin levels in neurons under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, we have included the detection results of hemoglobin expression in neurons after <italic>HBA1</italic> interference, as shown in Fig. S7E-F. The results indicate that the culture medium derived from HBA1-interfered endothelial cells also fails to help neurons increase hemoglobin expression under hypoxic conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure S3 should be split to separately explain the increased exosome release induced by hypoxia, the non-toxic effect of endothelial cell culture medium on neurons, and the successful screening of the HBA1 interference plasmid.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s suggestions. Based on your feedback, we have split the original Fig. S3 into multiple parts to more clearly present the different experimental results. Specifically, the results of hypoxia-induced EVs release increase have been updated in Fig. S4, the non-toxic effects of endothelial cell culture medium on neurons are shown in Fig. S5, and the successful screening of the <italic>HBA1</italic> interference plasmid is presented in Fig. S7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Regarding the extracellular vesicles/exosomes, it should be expressed consistently in the whole manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s reminder.

We have corrected the formatting of “O2” to “O₂” in lines 70 and 80.</p><p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for taking the time to thoroughly examine our work, for their helpful feedback that has significantly contributed to improving our manuscript, and for their kind and encouraging words.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting study with a lot of data. Some of these ideas are intriguing. But a few major points require further consideration.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the detailed assessment of our study and pinpointing its current weaknesses. Please find our answers to all comments below.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) What disease is this model of whole animal hypoxia supposed to mimic? If one is focused on the brain, can one just use a model of focal or global cerebral ischemia?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s insightful question. The chronic hypoxia model we employed is designed to mimic the multi-organ damage caused by systemic hypoxia, which is relevant to clinical conditions such as high-altitude hypoxia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute hypoxic brain injury. In contrast to focal or global cerebral ischemia models, the focus of our study is on how the brain, under extreme systemic hypoxia, utilizes endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to transfer hemoglobin mRNA, thereby protecting neurons and aiding the brain’s response to hypoxia-induced damage.</p><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern that focal or global ischemia models are typically used to simulate localized brain hypoxia or ischemic injury. However, the core of our research is to explore the brain’s overall adaptive mechanisms under systemic hypoxic conditions. By using a systemic hypoxia model, we can more comprehensively simulate the effects of global hypoxia on the brain and uncover how the brain engages specific molecular mechanisms for self-protection. This approach offers a novel perspective on brain hypoxic-ischemic diseases and holds potential clinical applications, particularly in the study of stroke, vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), and related conditions.</p><p>Additionally, we have observed that hemoglobin significantly increases in the brain in an animal model of focal ischemia (as shown in Author response image 1 below). This finding further supports the idea that hemoglobin upregulation may be a universal protective mechanism for the brain’s response to hypoxic damage. While this part of the research is still ongoing, preliminary results suggest that both systemic hypoxia and focal ischemia might trigger protective effects through hemoglobin regulation.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The expression level of Hba-a1 in the brain of VCID mouse.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99986-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Therefore, the core of our study is to elucidate the brain’s self-protection mechanisms under systemic hypoxia, rather than focusing solely on cerebral ischemia models. We believe this approach provides new insights into the prevention and treatment of brain hypoxic-ischemic diseases, with significant clinical application potential.</p><p>In light of this, we have added a related discussion to the manuscript, clearly explaining the rationale for choosing the systemic hypoxia model. The updated content can be found on P11, Line 13-21 as follows: “To investigate this phenomenon, we employed a chronic hypoxia model in which mice were exposed to 7% oxygen for 28 days. This model aims to mimic systemic hypoxia-induced multi-organ damage, a condition observed in diseases such as high-altitude hypoxia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute hypoxic brain injury. The primary goal of this model is to explore how the brain adapts under extreme low-oxygen conditions and employs specific mechanisms to protect itself from hypoxia-induced damage. This approach provides valuable insight into diseases related to hypoxic-ischemic injury in the brain, including stroke and vascular dementia, offering a novel perspective for potential clinical applications.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) If this model subjects the entire animal to hypoxia, then other organs will also be hypoxic. Should one also detect endothelial upregulation and release of extracellular vesicles containing hemoglobin mRNA in non-CNS organs? Where do these vesicles go? Into blood?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable feedback. Indeed, in a whole-body hypoxia model, other organs are also affected by hypoxia. Therefore, future research may need to investigate the upregulation of endothelial cells in organs other than the central nervous system, as well as the release of EVs containing hemoglobin mRNA from these organs. However, in this study, we isolated EVs from the brain tissue in situ following perfusion with physiological saline, a method that effectively eliminates the influence of EVs from blood or other organs. As a result, our primary focus was on studying how EVs released by brain endothelial cells are actively taken up by neurons to exert neuroprotective effects. The potential for these EVs to enter the bloodstream and their subsequent fate is indeed a topic worthy of further investigation. Future research could offer new insights into the cross-organ effects of systemic hypoxia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) What other mRNA are contained in the vesicles released from brain endothelial cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable suggestions. We have further analyzed EVs derived from brain endothelial cells, and in addition to hemoglobin mRNA, these EVs also contain a variety of other mRNAs, including <italic>Vwf, Hbb-bt</italic>, <italic>Hba-a1</italic>, <italic>Hbb-bs</italic>, <italic>Hba-a2</italic>, <italic>Acer2</italic>, <italic>Angpt2</italic>, <italic>Ldha</italic>, <italic>Gm42418</italic>, <italic>Slc16a1</italic>, <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, <italic>B2m</italic>, <italic>Ctla2a</italic>, <italic>Ccnd1</italic>, and <italic>Hmgcs2</italic> (Log2FC &gt; 1.2). The biological processes associated with these mRNAs primarily involve: cell-substrate adhesion, regulation of cellular amide metabolic process, negative regulation of cell migration, negative regulation of cell motility, and negative regulation of cellular component movement. These processes may be closely related to the neuroprotective effects of endothelial cell EVs in a hypoxic environment, especially in terms of regulating cell behavior and maintaining cell structure and function. Additionally, these EVs contain multiple key factors associated with intracellular metabolism, movement, and migration, which may collectively influence neuronal function and survival. Notably, our study also found that mRNA of various hemoglobin subunits ranks among the top five in terms of abundance in the mRNA secreted by hypoxic endothelial EVs, further emphasizing the importance of hemoglobin mRNA in endothelial-derived EVs. Therefore, future research may explore the functions of these mRNAs and reveal how they act in concert to protect neurons from hypoxia-induced damage.</p><p>We have updated and added these results in Fig. S4, and have further elaborated on the findings in the revised figure. Once again, we thank the reviewer for the attention and valuable suggestions regarding our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Where do the endothelial vesicles go? Only to neurons? Or to other cells as well?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s important question. As previously mentioned, the focus of this study is to investigate how EVs carrying hemoglobin mRNA influence neuronal function. Through a combined analysis of single-cell transcriptomics and EV transcriptomics from brain tissue, we found that, besides neurons, almost all types of supportive cells in the brain and their secreted EVs contain a significant amount of hemoglobin mRNA (Fig. 3J, 4B). Notably, although neurons do not transcribe hemoglobin mRNA themselves, under hypoxic conditions, neurons significantly increase hemoglobin expression, resulting in a phenomenon where the transcription and expression levels of hemoglobin in neurons are inconsistent. This phenomenon has been observed both in our study and others (Fig. 4H-J, PMID: 19116637). This observation led us to focus on the active uptake of EVs by neurons and the potential neuroprotective effects they might bring.</p><p>Regarding whether other cell types uptake these EVs and their potential functions, although our current research is focused on neurons, this is indeed an important area for further investigation. Given that non-neuronal supportive cells may also transfer hemoglobin mRNA via EVs under hypoxic conditions, future research will further explore the uptake of EVs by different cell types and their roles in hypoxic adaptation.</p><p>We are particularly interested in the hemoglobin expression in neurons under hypoxic conditions and consider neurons to be the primary expressers of hemoglobin, providing a new perspective for exploring the neuroprotective role of hemoglobin. We plan to delve deeper into these issues in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Neurons can express endogenous hemoglobin. Is it useful to subject neurons to hypoxia and then see how much the endogenous mRNA goes up? How large is the magnitude of endogenous hemoglobin gene upregulation compared to the hypothesized exogenous mRNA that is supposed to be donated from endothelial vesicles?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable question. We have observed that, in the absence of treatment with endothelial cell-derived conditioned medium, there is no significant change in the transcription and expression levels of endogenous hemoglobin in neurons under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 5I, 6C-D). However, when neurons were treated with endothelial cell-conditioned medium, under the same hypoxic conditions, the transcription levels of hemoglobin increased by approximately 1.2-fold, and the expression levels increased by approximately 3.8-fold (Fig. 6B-D). Additionally, we have added pre-treatment experiments involving EVs depletion from the endothelial culture medium and HBA interference. The results show that, after these two pre-treatments, the conditioned medium lost its ability to enhance the transcription and expression of hemoglobin in neurons under hypoxic conditions (Fig. S6, S7D-F), further emphasizing the important role of endothelial EVs in this process. This finding indicates that endothelial-derived EVs significantly promote hemoglobin expression in neurons, and this effect is far greater than the upregulation of endogenous hemoglobin in neurons. Therefore, while neurons can express endogenous hemoglobin, exogenous hemoglobin significantly enhances its expression, which may help neurons tolerate the hypoxic environment and provide additional protection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Finally, it may be useful to provide more information and data to explain how the expression of this exogenous endothelial-derived hemoglobin binds to neuronal mitochondria to alter function.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable suggestion. As we previously mentioned, hemoglobin plays a protective role in neurons by maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, helping neurons restore energy metabolism and energy production under hypoxic conditions. We fully agree on the importance of this research direction. Several studies have shown that when hemoglobin is expressed in neurons, it predominantly localizes to mitochondria, which aligns with the physiological process of heme synthesis within mitochondria (PMID: 23187133). Furthermore, in the brains of Parkinson’s disease patients, the localization of hemoglobin in neuronal mitochondria is altered compared to normal conditions (PMID: 27181046). Therefore, the interaction between hemoglobin and mitochondria plays a crucial role in neuronal function.</p><p>Although existing research indicates the role of hemoglobin in neuronal mitochondria, studies in this area remain limited. We plan to further investigate how hemoglobin binds to mitochondria and its specific effects on mitochondrial function in our future work. We believe that a deeper understanding of this mechanism will provide essential theoretical insights into the effects of hypoxia on neurons and offer new potential strategies for neuroprotective therapies.</p><p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for taking the time to thoroughly examine our work, for their helpful feedback that has significantly contributed to improving our manuscript, and for their kind and encouraging words.</p></body></sub-article></article>
