JH is an acyclic sesquiterpenoid known to enter cells freely via diffusion because of its lipid-soluble character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Riddiford, 2020</xref>). JH binds its intracellular receptor methoprene-tolerant protein (MET), a basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) family protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jindra et al., 2021</xref>). MET forms a transcription complex with the transcription factor Taiman (TAI, also known as FISC, p160/SRC, and is a steroid receptor coactivator) to initiate gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>). An important gene in the JH pathway is Krüppel homologue 1 (<italic>Kr-h1</italic>), which encodes the zinc-finger transcription factor <italic>Kr-h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Minakuchi et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pecasse et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Kr-h1</italic> acts downstream of MET and is induced rapidly by JH to regulate larval growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Minakuchi et al., 2009</xref>). Other genes, for example, the early trypsin gene of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<italic>AaEt</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Noriega et al., 2003</xref>), JH-inducible 21 kDa protein (<italic>Jhp21</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>), JH esterase (<italic>Jhe</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wroblewski et al., 1990</xref>), vitellogenin (<italic>Vg</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> JH-inducible gene 1 (<italic>Jhi-1</italic>), and JH-inducible gene 26 (<italic>Jhi-26</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dubrovsky et al., 2000</xref>) are regulated by JH.</p><p>However, some studies suggest that cell membrane receptors also play essential roles in JH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jindra et al., 2021</xref>). For example, in <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are involved in JH-induced rapid increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, diacylglycerol, and intracellular calcium, leading to activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to phosphorylate MET and TAI, resulting in <italic>Kr-h1</italic> gene transcription in response to JH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). JH III, also via RTKs, leads to rapid calcium release and influx in <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> epidermal cells (HaEpi cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). JH induces MET phosphorylation to increase MET interacting with TAI, which enhances <italic>Kr-h1</italic> transcription in <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, JH through RTK and PKC protein kinase C (PKC) induces phosphorylation of ultraspiracle (USP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). The phenomenon that RTK transmits JH signal has long been predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ojani et al., 2016</xref>); however, the RTKs critical for JH signaling have yet to be identified from numerous RTKs in vivo.</p><p>RTKs constitute a class of cell surface transmembrane proteins that play important roles in mediating extracellular to intracellular signaling. Humans carry approximately 60 RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manning et al., 2002</xref>), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes 21 RTK genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sopko and Perrimon, 2013</xref>), <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> has 20 RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandratos et al., 2016</xref>), and the <italic>German cockroach</italic> genome identifies 16 RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>H. armigera</italic> has 20 RTK candidates with gene codes in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome by our analysis. The cotton bollworm is a well-known and worldwide distributed agricultural pest in Lepidoptera, which threatens cotton and many other vegetable crops by rapidly producing resistance to various chemical insecticides and Bt-transgenic cotton. Using <italic>H. armigera</italic> as a model, we focus on identifying the RTKs functioning as the JH receptors and demonstrating the mechanism. We screened the RTKs sequentially, including examining the roles of 20 RTKs identified in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome in JH-regulated gene expression to obtain primary candidates, followed by screening of the candidates by their roles in maintaining larval status, JH-induced rapid increase of intracellular calcium levels, JH-induced phosphorylation of MET and TAI, and affinity to JH. The cadherin 96ca (CAD96CA) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) were finally determined as JH cell membrane receptors by their roles in JH-regulated gene expression, maintaining larval status, JH-induced rapid increase of intracellular calcium levels, JH-induced phosphorylation of MET and TAI, and their JH-binding affinity. Their roles as JH cell membrane receptors were further determined by knockdown and knockout of them in vivo and cell lines, and overexpression of them in mammal HEK-293T heterogeneously. These data not only improve our knowledge of JH signaling and open the door to studying insect development but also present new targets to explore the new growth regulators to control the pest.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The screen of the RTKs involved in JH signaling</title><p>To explore which RTKs may be involved in JH signaling, a total of RTKs were identified in the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome.

CAD96CA and FGFR1 are essential in the JH signal pathway, and the loss-of-function of each is sufficient to trigger strong effects on pupation, suggesting they can transmit JH signal individually. The difference is that CAD96CA expression has no tissue specificity, and the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> gene is highly expressed in the midgut. A possibility is that CAD96CA and FGFR1 play roles by forming homodimer or heterodimer with each other or with other RTKs in tissues, which needs to be addressed in future studies.

These data suggest that JH exerts a complete regulatory role through cell membrane receptors and intracellular receptor, because the cell membrane receptors regulate the phosphorylation of the intracellular receptor MET1 and the interacting transcription factor TAI. The results from different insects suggest that JH via MET1, CAD96CA, and FGFR1 play roles in preventing metamorphosis.

We screened the RTKs transmitting JH signal primarily by examining some of JH-induced gene expression. By examining other genes or by other strategies to screen the RTKs might find new RTKs functioning as JH cell membrane receptors; however, the key evaluation indicators, such as the binding affinity of the RTKs to JH and the function in transmitting JH signal to maintain larval status are essential.</p><p>In addition, GPCRs also play a role in JH signaling. JH triggers GPCR, RTK, PLC, IP3R, and PKC to phosphorylate Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-subunit, consequently activating Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase for the induction of patency in <italic>L. migratoria</italic> vitellogenin follicular epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jing et al., 2018</xref>); JH activates a signaling cascade including GPCR, PLC, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and PKC, which induces vitellogenin receptor (VgR) phosphorylation and promotes vitellogenin (Vg) endocytosis in <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jing et al., 2021</xref>). JH activates a signaling cascade including GPCR, Cdc42, Par6, and aPKC, leading to an enlarged opening of patency for Vg transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, the dopamine D2-like receptor-mediated JH signaling promotes the accumulation of vitellogenin and increases the level of cAMP in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai and Palli, 2016</xref>). In <italic>H. armigera</italic>, GPCRs are involved in JH III-induced broad isoform 7 (Br-Z7) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). In summary, these published results indicate that RTKs and GPCRs contribute to JH signaling on the cell membrane; however, the GPCR functions as JH receptor needs to be addressed in the future study. The RNAi of RTKs does not affect JH-induced <italic>Jhi-1</italic> expression, which implies that other receptors exist, presenting a target for future study of the new JH III receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 to JH III</title><p>RTKs are high–affinity cell surface receptors for many cytokines, polypeptide growth factors, and peptide hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trenker and Jura, 2020</xref>). Up to now, there is no report that RTK binds lipid hormone. We determined that CAD96CA and FGFR1 have a high affinity to JH III by MST and ITC methods after they were isolated from the cell membrane.</p><p>The [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III detection method is used to determine <italic>Drosophila</italic> MET in vitro translation product binding JH III (Kd = 5.3 nM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miura et al., 2005</xref>), and <italic>Tribolium</italic> MET binding JH III (Kd = 2.94 nM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>). However, the commercial production of [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III has ceased, whereas the microscale thermophoresis (MST) method is a widely used method to detect protein binding of small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Welsch et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, MST was used in our study as the alternative method to measure the binding strengths of RTKs with JH III. Using the MST method, we determined that the saturable specific binding of <italic>Helicoverpa</italic> MET1 to JH III is Kd of 6.38 nM, which is comparable to that report for <italic>Drosophila</italic> MET and <italic>Tribolium</italic> MET determined using [<sup>3</sup>H]JH III, confirming MST method can be used to detect protein binding JH III. The CAD96CA exhibited saturable specific binding to JH III with a Kd of 11.96 nM, and FGFR1 showed a Kd of 23.61 nM, which is higher than that of MET1 for JH III, suggesting lower binding affinity of RTKs than the intracellular receptor MET1 for JH III. A similar phenomenon is reported in another study, the binding affinities of steroid membrane receptors are orders of magnitude lower than those of nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Falkenstein et al., 2000</xref>). NRK did not bind JH III. One possible explanation is that NRK has a low affinity to JH III and thus transmits JH signal without binding JH, or NRK requires association with other proteins to play roles. Our study provides new evidence for the binding of lipid hormones by RTK and a new method to study the binding of ligands to receptors.</p><p>We also verified the affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 with JH III through the ITC method, determining their respective Kd values as 79.6 and 88.5 nanomolar. ITC is a versatile analytical method for the character of molecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnson, 2021</xref>). ITC is applied in the membrane protein family, containing GPCRs, ion channels, and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Draczkowski et al., 2014</xref>). The ITC method requires relatively high ligand and receptor concentrations for better saturation curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rajarathnam and Rösgen, 2014</xref>). However, when we prepared a protein solution of 1000 nM, protein aggregation occurred, thus we used a protein solution with a concentration of 700 nM. The Kd value detected by ITC is slightly higher than the result of the MST method; the results are sufficient to confirm the high affinity of CAD96CA and FGFR1 binding to JH III.</p><p>Although JH I and JH II are natural hormones for lepidopteran larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schooley et al., 1984</xref>), <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>B. mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kayukawa et al., 2012</xref>) also respond to JH III.

JH III is a commercially available reagent; therefore, we used JH III to carry out the experiments in this study, and the results hypothesize the possibility of CAD96CA and FGFR1 binding other JHs in addition to JH III, which should be addressed in future study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relationship of cell membrane receptor and intracellular receptor</title><p>MET is determined as JH’s intracellular receptor by its characters binding to JH and regulating <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jindra et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, cell membrane receptors CAD96CA and FGFR1 are also able to bind JH III and transmit JH III signal to regulate a set of JH III-induced gene expression including <italic>Kr-h1</italic>. Obviously, both intracellular receptor MET and cell membrane receptor CAD96CA and FGFR1 are involved in JH III signaling as receptors. JH III transmits signal by cell membrane receptor and intracellular receptor at different signaling stages, with cell membrane receptor CAD96CA and FGFR1 inducing rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which regulates the phosphorylation of MET and TAI to enhance the function of MET for gene transcription, and the intracellular receptor MET regulates gene transcription by diffusion into cells based on its lipid characteristics.</p><p>The study in human cell line HEK293 shows that overexpression of <italic>B. mori</italic> JH intracellular receptor MET2 and its cofactor SRC together in HEK293 cells may induce JH-dependent luciferase reporter expression through a plasmid that contains the JH specific kJHRE (JH response element containing the E-box core sequence for JH binding; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kayukawa et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting JH can diffuse into cells to initiate a gene expression when the insect MET2 and SRC and kJHRE exist. Our study showed that overexpressing CAD96CA or FGFR1 in HEK-293T cells elicits Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation under JH III induction, suggesting CAD96CA or FGFR1 transmit a rapid signal of JH III in HEK-293T cells, which might trigger further cellular responses of HEK-293T to JH III. These data suggest that both cell membrane receptors CAD96CA and FGFR1 and intracellular receptor MET of JH can respond to JH. These proteins might be used as switches to induce a gene expression or regulate cell fate in heterogeneous cells by JH induction when the side effects are determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>CAD96CA and FGFR1 were involved in JH III signaling, including maintaining larval status, JH III-induced rapid intracellular calcium increase, gene expression, and phosphorylation of MET and TAI. CAD96CA and FGFR1 had high affinity to JH III and were possible cell membrane receptors of JH III and other JHs. CAD96CA and FGFR1 had a general role in transmitting the JH III signal for gene expression in various insect cells, suggesting their conserved roles in other insects. JH III transmits the signal by either cell membrane receptor or intracellular receptor at different stages in the signaling, with JH III transmitting the signal by cell membrane receptor CAD96CA and FGFR1 to induce rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which regulates the phosphorylation of MET and TAI to enhance the function of MET for gene transcription, and intracellular receptor MET regulates gene transcription by diffusion into cells based on its lipid characteristics. CAD96CA and FGFR1 can transmit JH signal to prevent pupation independently and cooperatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Then, 5 μL of the fluorescence molecule (target protein) was added to each tube and mixed well. With each tube holding a 10 μL volume in total, the tubes were incubated at 4 °C for 30–60 min. Finally, samples were removed with a capillary tube and tested with an MST Monolith NT.115 (NanoTempers, Munich, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Detection of RTK binding JH III by isothermal titration calorimetry</title><p>The protein purification method was described in the MST experiment. The isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay was performed using MicroCal PEAQ-ITC (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, U.K.). JH III was dissolved in ethanol, JH III stock solution to a final concentration of 10 μM with PBST buffer. The protein solution with same concentration ethanol, make sure the buffer identity. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, JH III (10 μM) was loaded in a syringe, and the protein solution (700 nM) was injected into the ITC cell. Injection of 3 μl of JH III solution over a period of 150 s at a stirring speed of 750 rpm was performed. For the control test, JH III solution was pumped into syringe, and the buffer was injected into the ITC cell. For the data, the experimental data were subtracted with that from the control test by analysis software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Methyl farnesoate, farnesol, methoprene binding assays, and competition assays</title><p>Methyl farnesoate (Echelon Biosciences, Utah, USA), farnesol (Sigma, San Francisco, CA, USA), and methoprene (Sigma, San Francisco, CA, USA) were dissolved in DMSO, respectively, diluted to the corresponding concentration, and the experimental method as described by the MST method for detection of binding. The competitive binding by MST requires fluorescent labeling of ligands (JH III). Currently, there is no suitable method to label JH III, and we only have fluorescently labeled receptors (target protein). The binding curve of adding both JH III and methoprene, but the maximum concentration of JH used in the experiment was 50 nM, while the concentration of methoprene was increasing. The Kd value is generated automatically by the software of the instrument.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>CRISPR/Cas9 system mediated knockout of <italic>Cad96ca</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic> or <italic>Met1</italic></title><p>The gRNAs were designed using the CRISPRscan tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.crisprscan.org/?page=sequence">https://www.crisprscan.org/?page=sequence</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and each consisted of an ~20-nucleotide (nt) region in complementary reverse to one strand of the target DNA (protospacer) with an NGG motif at the 3’ end (PAM) of the target site and a GGN at position (5’ end) of the T7 promoter. The sgRNA primer and universal primer were used as corresponding templates to obtain amplification products. Product transcription was carried out with a T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>Freshly laid eggs on gauze (within 2 hr) were collected from gauze using 0.1% (v/v) 84 solution and rinsed with distilled water. The eggs were affixed onto microscope slides using double-sided adhesive tape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zuo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zuo et al., 2018</xref>). A mixture of 100 ng/µL Cas9 protein (GenScript, New Jersey, USA) and 300 ng/µL gRNA for the injection into the eggs (per egg 2 nL was injected) within 4 hr of oviposition using a Pico-litre Microinjector (Warner Instruments, Holliston, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hou et al., 2021</xref>). The injected eggs were incubated at 26 ± 1 °C with 60 to 70% relative humidity for 3–4 days until they hatched. To detect the mutagenesis of <italic>H. armigera</italic> induced by CRISPR/Cas9, we used PCR to amplify the targeted genomic region obtained from fresh epidermis samples of larvae moulted from G0 individuals and used primers at approximately 50–200 base pairs upstream and downstream from the expected double strand break site by HiFi DNA Polymerase (Transgen, Beijing, China). For the wild-type group, 10 individuals were randomly selected for PCR products sequencing analysis. For the experimental group, individuals with the phenotypes of early pupation and dead were all subjected to sequencing analysis of PCR products. For the experimental group, individuals without significant phenotypes were randomly divided into three groups, and the mixed samples were used for sequencing analysis. The sequencing results showed overlapping peaks at the target sites, and these individuals were identified as mutants. The corresponding PCR products of 10 randomly selected mutant individuals were cloned into a pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Osaka, Japan) for sequencing, respectively. Six colonies from one individual were randomly picked for sequencing to identify the rates of mutation in an individual. The mutated sites were identified by comparison with the wild-type sequence. The ratio of the mutants in the PCR products was the editing efficiency. The editing efficiency of the <italic>Cad96ca</italic> mutant was 67%, that of the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutant was 61%, that of the <italic>Met1</italic> mutant was 72%, that of the <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutant was 69%, and that of the <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutant was 70%. To detect off-target activity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system-created <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mutants, we searched the <italic>H. armigera</italic> genome for homologues of the target sequences of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and found that the genes possibly included similar target sequences.

The Fluo-8 dye was diluted to 2 μM with DPBS, while the 20% PluronicF-127 solution was added for a final concentration of 0.02%. Add 100 µl Fluo-8 dye solution to each well. Then the plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed with DPBS three times. After 60 s stabilization of the cells, JH III (1 μM) was added to the cells to detect the intracellular calcium release to show the cells can respond JH III induction. After that, cells were treated with Calcium chloride (final concentration 1 mM) and JH III (final concentration 1 μM) to detect the extracellular calcium influx. DMSO was a solvent control of JH III.

In particular, its developmental functions are described as the &quot;status quo&quot; action, as its presence in the hemolymph (the insect blood) prevents metamorphosis-initiating effects of ecdysone, another important hormone in insect development, and maintains the juvenile status of insects.</p><p>While such canonical functions of JH are known to be mediated by its intracellular receptor complex composed of Met and Tai, there have been multiple reports suggesting the presence of cell membrane receptor(s) for JH, which mediate non-genomic effects of this terpenoid hormone. In particular, the presence of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that phosphorylate Met/Tai in response to JH and thus indirectly affect the canonical JH signaling pathway has been strongly suggested. Given the importance of JH in insect physiology and the fact that the JH signaling pathway is a major target of insect growth regulators, elucidating the identify and functions of putative JH membrane receptors is of great significance form both basic and applied perspectives.</p><p>In the present study, the authors identified candidate receptors for such cell membrane JH receptors, CAD96CA and FGFR1, in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Their in vitro analyses are conducted thoroughly using multiple methods, which overall support their claim that these receptors can bind to JH and mediate their non-genomic effects.</p><p>Their CRISPR-Cas-mediated mutagenesis in vivo shows that mutation of the two RTKs causes acceleration of pupation, which is consistent with the mutant phenotype of the intracellular JH receptor, Met1. Although this is different from the typical phenotype one would expect from JH signaling deficiency in lepidopteran insects (i.e. precocious metamorphosis), the results overall support their claim that these two RTKs modulate genomic JH effects by phosphorylating the intracellular receptors.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although their loss-of-function analyses suggest that the two RTKs likely have redundant functions in vivo, it is unclear whether they have any different functions in mediating JH functions in different physiological contexts. It also remains unknown whether other endogenous ligands for these RTKs affect canonical, genomic JH signaling in vivo.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97189.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yan-Xue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Xin-Le</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yan-Li</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiao-Pei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Qiao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jin-Xing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Xiao-Fan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Qingdao</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>[…] Weaknesses:</p><p>Unfortunately, the revised manuscript does not show significant improvement. While the identification of the receptors is highly convincing, important issues about the biological relevance remain unaddressed. First, the main point I raised about the first version of this article is that the redundancy and/or specificity of the two receptors should be clarified, even though I understand that it cannot be deeply investigated here. I believe that this point, shared by all reviewers, is highly relevant for the scope of this work. In this revised version, it is still unclear how to reconcile gain and loss-of-function experiments and the different expression profiles of the receptors. Second, the newly added explanations and pieces of discussion provided about the mild in vivo phenotypes of early pupation upon Cad96ca or Fgfr1 knock-out do not clarify the issue but instead put emphasis on methodological issues. Indeed, it is not clear whether the mild phenotypes reflect the biological role of Cad96ca and Fgfr1, or the redundancy of these two RTKs (and/or others), or some issue with the knock-out strategy (partial efficiency, mosaicism...). Finally, parts of the updated discussion and the modifications to the figures are confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for asking the questions. We performed additional experiments, including editing <italic>Met1</italic> individually (single knockout), <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (double knockout), and <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> together (triple knockout) using CRISPR/Cas9. The results showed that single mutation of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic> caused precocious pupation, respectively. The double mutation of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> caused earlier pupation and death compared to the single mutation of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> or <italic>Fgfr1</italic>. The triple mutation of <italic>Met1</italic>, <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> caused most serious effect on pupation time and death. These data suggested that both CAD96CA and FGFR1 can transmit JH signal to prevent pupation independently and cooperatively, and the JH exert a complete regulatory role through cell membrane receptors and intracellular receptor of JH. We increased the results in Lines 242-263 and discussion in Lines 328-375.</p><p>CAD96CA and FGFR1 have similar functions in JH signaling, including transmitting JH signal for <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression, larval status maintaining, rapid intracellular calcium increase, phosphorylation of transcription factors MET1 and TAI, and high affinity to JH III. CAD96CA and FGFR1 are essential in the JH signal pathway, and the loss-of-function of each is sufficient to trigger strong effects on pupation, suggesting they can transmit JH signal individually. The difference is that CAD96CA expression has no tissue specificity, and the <italic>Fgfr1</italic> gene is highly expressed in the midgut. A possibility is that CAD96CA and FGFR1 play roles by forming homodimer or heterodimer with each other or with other RTKs in tissues, which needs to be addressed in future studies. CAD96CA and FGFR1 transmit JH III signals in three different insect cell lines, suggesting their conserved roles in other insects.</p><p>The mild phenotypes shown in the previous picture, Fig 4E, were counted from all the surviving individuals injected with gRNA, including mutated and non-mutated individuals. In fact, there is no phenotype of pupation on time in the mutants. According to the first round of reviewers' comments, we found that it was inappropriate to count all the surviving individuals injected with gRNA, so we replaced the picture by counting the phenotypes of all successfully mutated individuals in the second version to avoid the confusion of the phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>[…] Weaknesses:</p><p>Results of their in vivo experiments, particularly those of their loss-of-function analyses using CRISPR mutants are still preliminary, and the results rather indicate that these membrane receptors do not have any physiologically significant roles in vivo. More specifically, previous studies in lepidopteran species have clearly and repeatedly shown that precocious metamorphosis is the hallmark phenotype for all JH signaling-deficient larvae. In contrast, the present study showed that Cad96ca and Fgfr1 G0 mutants only showed slight acceleration in their pupation timing, which is not a typical phenotype one would expect from JH signaling deficiency. This is inconsistent with their working model provided in Figure 6, which indicates that these cell membrane JH receptors promote the canonical JH signaling by phosphorylating Met/Tai. If the authors argue that this slight acceleration of pupation is indeed a major JH signaling-deficient phenotype in Helicoverpa, they need to provide more data to support their claim by analyzing CRISPR mutants of other genes involved in JH signaling, such as Jhamt and Met. An alternative explanation is that there is functional redundancy between CAD96CA and FGFR1 in mediating phosphorylation of Met/Tai. This possibility can be tested by analyzing double knockouts of these two receptors. Currently, the validity of their calcium imaging analysis in Figure 5 is also questionable. When performing calcium imaging in cultured cells, it is critically important to treat all the cells at the end of each experiment with a hormone or other chemical reagents that universally induce calcium increase in each particular cell line. Without such positive control, the validity of calcium imaging data remains unknown, and readers cannot properly evaluate their results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments.

Therefore, it still remains unclear whether these RTKs are completely required for pathway activation or only necessary for high activation levels during the last larval stage. While the authors have included some additional data, the mechanism by which different RTKs function in transducing JH signaling in a tissue specific manner is still unclear. As the authors note in the discussion, it is possible that other RTKs may also play a role in facilitating the transduction of JH signaling. Lastly, the study does not yet explain how RTKs with known ligands could also bind JH and contribute to JH signaling activation. Although receptor promiscuity has been suggested as a possible mechanism, future studies could explore whether activation of RTK pathways by their known ligands induces certain levels of JH transducer phosphorylation, which, in the presence of JH, could contribute to full pathway activation without the need for direct JH-RTK binding.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments.

It is not clear to me if they have tried or not. The Crispr/Cas9 approach might be difficult to put in place to test this interaction. However, couldn't the authors try the double knock-down compared to single knock-downs using dsRNA? This method gave convincing results to test the role of the putative receptors in mediating JH-induced developmental delay in vivo (Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

A similar explanation applies to the pupation phenotype itself... I am therefore wondering whether the Crispr/Cas9 approach (at the G0 generation) is the best strategy. Since the dsRNA knock-down gave efficient (and probably more reproducible) results according to Figure 1B-C, why not using the same approach for analyzing loss-of-function phenotypes?</p><p>(4) Similarly, this new paragraph regarding the knock-out strategy by Crispr is problematic: &quot;However, in the Cad96ca mutant, 86% of the larvae (an editing efficiency of 67% by TA clone analysis) had a shortened feeding stage in the sixth instar and entered the metamorphic molting stage earlier, showing early pupation, with the pupation time being 24 h earlier. In the Fgfr1 mutant, 91% of the larvae (an editing efficiency of 61%) had a shortened feeding stage in the sixth instar and entered the metamorphic molting stage earlier, showing early pupation, with the pupation time being 23 h earlier&quot; (lines 225-230).</p><p>- How does the editing efficiency relate to the mutation efficiency few lines earlier (not clearly explained in the methods)? Were the animals homozygous or heterozygous for the mutations? - A shortened feeding stage can only be invoked if previous developmental transitions are unaffected. Such statement should be supported by a better description of the developmental timing phenotype (as suggested already by reviewer 2).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions in (3) and (4). The editing rates of 67% and 61% for Cad96ca and Fgfr1 in individuals were calculated from the PCR products, indicating that the cells were mosaics by CRISPR/Cas9 editing.

In addition, RNAi of <italic>Cad96ca</italic> and <italic>Fgfr1</italic> was observed precocious pupation as was the case in CRISPR/Cas9, suggesting the RNAi can be used for the study of gene function in insect, especially when the gene editing is embryonic lethal&quot;.

The « pupation on time » (blue) category present in the first version of the figure has now disappeared for mutant animals. Why? In the first, my understanding was that, among the mutant animals, around 50% had precocious pupation. In the new version of the figure 4E, the &quot;pupation on time&quot; category is missing, and the percentages of early pupation are therefore strongly increased... The explanations provided in the text are not clear regarding the reanalysis of the mutant phenotypes. In the first version of the manuscript, the following explanation was given: &quot;In 61 survivors of Cas9 protein and Cad96ca-gRNA injection, 30 mutants were identified by the earlier pupation and sequencing (an editing efficiency of 49.2%)&quot;. Were all animals sequenced, or only the 30 displaying earlier pupation? Were the 31 others not sequenced or did they have no mutation? Could it be, as suggested by the first version of the figure, that some mutant animals did not display early pupation? It was indeed stated in the text that: &quot;CRISPR/Cas9 editing by Cad96ca-gRNA or Fgfr1-gRNA injection resulted in earlier pupation (Figure 4D) for about 23-24 h by comparison with normal pupation in 46% and 54% of larvae, respectively&quot;. This new version of the figure should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your reminder. The phenotype of pupation on time appeared in the first version, because we counted the phenotypes of all the surviving individuals injected with gRNA, that is, the survivors in Figure 4C, which including mutated and non-mutated individuals. According to the comments from first round of reviewers, we realized that it was inappropriate to count all the surviving individuals injected with gRNA, since there is no phenotype of pupation on time in the mutants. Therefore, in the second version, we replaced the picture by counting the phenotypes of all successfully mutated individuals, namely the mutants in Figure 4C.</p></body></sub-article></article>
