The initiator tRNA is usually recruited to the ribosome as part of a ternary complex composed of initiator tRNA, eIF2, and GTP. Although initiator tRNA recruitment was originally ascribed to another factor, eIF2A, it was later disproven and shown to occur via eIF2. Nonetheless, eIF2A is still considered a translation initiation factor because it binds the ribosome and shows genetic interactions with other initiation factors such as eIF4E. The exact function of eIF2A during translation initiation, however, remains unclear. Here, we use ribosome profiling and luciferase reporter assays to systematically test in HeLa cells the role of eIF2A in translation initiation, including translation of upstream ORFs. Since eIF2A is thought to take over the function of eIF2 when eIF2 is inhibited, we also test conditions where the integrated stress response is activated. In none of our assays, however, could we detect a role of eIF2A in translation initiation. It is possible that eIF2A plays a role in translation regulation in specific conditions that we have not tested here, or that it plays a role in a different aspect of RNA biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>eIF2A</kwd><kwd>eIF2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although eIF2A is thought to be a translation initiation factor, loss of eIF2A has no effect on cellular mRNA translation in either unstressed or stressed conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For cells and organisms to grow and develop properly, they require a machinery that translates mRNAs in a finely tuned manner. Alterations in the amount or activity of components of the translational machinery lead to severe pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tahmasebi et al., 2018</xref>). Of all the steps of protein production, translation initiation is considered to be the most precisely regulated and rate-limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palmiter, 1975</xref>). Translation initiation under normal physiological conditions is well studied and occurs through a cap-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hinnebusch and Lorsch, 2012</xref>) that relies on the recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit preloaded with a set of initiation factors to the 5’-end of mRNAs. Correct positioning of the 40 S at the 5’-end enables scanning, i.e., movement of the 40 S in a 5’ to 3’ direction in search of the first initiation codon (AUG) within an optimal context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</xref>). The ribosome uses the CAU anticodon of the initiator Methionine tRNA (tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup>) to identify the AUG start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozak, 1991</xref>). In the most common initiation pathway, tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> is delivered to the 40 S via the ternary complex which consists of eIF2 bound to GTP and the tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> itself. However, several alternative initiation factors have been reported to possess the ability to also interact and potentially deliver initiator tRNA: eIF2D, the DENR/MCTS1 complex, and eIF2A (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grove et al., 2024</xref>). We focus here on eIF2A, since its function is still elusive.</p><p>eIF2A was initially considered to be a functional analog of prokaryotic IF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shafritz and Anderson, 1970</xref>), however, later this role was reassigned to the above-mentioned heterotrimeric factor eIF2 (α, β, γ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levin et al., 1973</xref>). Unlike eIF2, eIF2A was proposed to recruit tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> to the 40 S in a GTP-independent but codon-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zoll et al., 2002</xref>), however, this activity was later challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dmitriev et al., 2010</xref>) by attributing it to eIF2D which co-purified with eIF2A in the initial study. Unlike eIF2, eIF2A is dispensable for organismal viability, as single knock-outs of <italic>eIF2A</italic> in model organisms such as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Komar et al., 2005</xref>)<italic>, C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>M. musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Golovko et al., 2016</xref>) show little or no phenotype. However, double knock-outs of <italic>eIF2A</italic> and <italic>eIF5B</italic> exhibit severe growth defects both in yeast and in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zoll et al., 2002</xref>) and eIF2A is synthetic lethal with eIF4E in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Komar et al., 2005</xref>). These genetic interactions suggest a role for eIF2A in translation initiation, however, the precise function of eIF2A is still not well defined, with contradictory results being reported. For example, eIF2A has been studied in the context of internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), where it was proposed to act both as a suppressor and an activator of IRES-mediated initiation. In yeast, eIF2A was reported to inhibit translation of URE2, GIC1, and PAB1 IRESes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reineke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reineke and Merrick, 2009</xref>). In Huh7 cells, knock-down of eIF2A was reported to hamper translation of a Hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES reporter upon ER-stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), while a subsequent study detected no effect on the HCV-IRES reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaafar et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, the knock-out of eIF2A in HAP1 cells did not affect translation of either a HCV-IRES reporter or a EMCV-IRES reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">González-Almela et al., 2018</xref>), nor did it affect the infection rate of Sindbis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sanz et al., 2019</xref>). Beyond IRES-mediated translation, eIF2A was reported to promote initiation from near-cognate start sites, initiated at leucine codons (CUG, GUG), by delivering elongator leucine tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> to the 40 S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Starck et al., 2016</xref>). Such eIF2A-driven non-AUG initiation events were proposed to play a crucial role in different aspects of cell physiology and disease progression: cellular adaptation during the integrated stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Starck et al., 2016</xref>), fine-tuning of mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 2014</xref>), tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>), and repeat-associated non-AUG translation in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonobe et al., 2018</xref>). Such non-AUG initiation by eIF2A implies that eIF2A should possess high affinity for leucine tRNAs, however, according to in vitro filter binding assays, eIF2A binds inefficiently to elongator tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> compared to initiator tRNA<sup>Met</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), although, as mentioned above, it is questionable whether eIF2A has any tRNA binding capacity at all. Furthermore, loss of <italic>eIF2A</italic> in several systems did not recapitulate these effects on non-AUG initiation in either non-stressed or stress conditions (caused either by amino acid depletion or sodium arsenate treatment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaikwad et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ichihara et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, one study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaikwad et al., 2024</xref> found that eIF2A has little or no role in translation initiation and uORF mediated-translation in yeast. Since in some cases mRNA translation in human cells can differ from mRNA translation in yeast, whether eIF2A also has such a minimal role in human cells remains to be clarified.</p><p>Due to these various discrepancies, we decided to study the role of eIF2A on mRNA translation and cellular fitness in human cells. For this, we generated <italic>eIF2A</italic> knock-out HeLa cells and applied ribosome profiling to analyze changes in mRNA translation. Overall, we find little contribution of eIF2A to cellular translation both under normal and stressed conditions in HeLa cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>eIF2A-KO HeLa cell lines have no proliferative defect or change in global translation rates</title><p>To study the impact of eIF2A on cellular translation, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate two independent eIF2A knockout (<italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup>) HeLa cell lines, in which different exons of <italic>eIF2A</italic> were targeted.

The eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> cells exhibit no defect in cellular proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which agrees with eIF2A having a dispensable role in organismal viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Golovko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Komar et al., 2005</xref>).

Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grove et al., 2023</xref> recently reported that increased levels of eIF2A in an in vitro translation system can suppress global translation initiation by directly binding and sequestering 40 S ribosomal subunits. Thus, an increase in cytosolic eIF2A, either due to increased total levels or due to shuttling out of the nucleus, could be a potential mechanism to suppress translation upon stress. To determine if either localization or global levels of eIF2A change in response to stress in HeLa cells, we performed subcellular fractionation and loaded on a gel nuclear and cytosolic fractions in proportion to their abundance in a cell (i.e. both fractions were lysed in equal volumes). In HeLa cells, eIF2A is present in both the cytosol and the nucleus, with higher levels in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Nonetheless, stress caused by tunicamycin treatment did not affect the subcellular distribution of eIF2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), nor overall eIF2A levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). To assess the localization of eIF2A with an orthogonal approach, we performed cell immunostaining. Since the eIF2A antibodies we have are not suitable for immunostaining, we overexpressed N-terminally FLAG-tagged eIF2A in HeLa cells treated cells with either DMSO or 100 µM sodium arsenite (SA) for 1 hr (condition used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). This revealed that overexpressed eIF2A was excluded from the nucleus, and showed a cytosolic, speckled staining pattern, which was not affected by SA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These results are consistent with what has been observed for endogenous eIF2A in HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">González-Almela et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanz et al., 2017</xref>). To check if cellular stresses affects eIF2A levels in HeLa cells, we treated cells with different agents at concentrations and timeframes that were previously reported to alter eIF2A levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Starck et al., 2016</xref>). However, we did not record significant changes in eIF2A levels with any of these treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). Nonetheless, we decided to test whether elevated levels of eIF2A would have the capacity to inhibit global translation levels in vivo. To this end, we overexpressed eIF2A and quantified global translation rates by OPP incorporation but did not observe any significant change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I-H</xref>). In sum, our results indicate that loss of eIF2A as well as eIF2A ectopic overexpression in HeLa cells has little or no impact on global translation and cellular proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ribosome profiling identifies no eIF2A-dependent transcripts</title><p>We next investigated whether loss of <italic>eIF2A</italic> causes a change in translation of specific mRNAs which might be overlooked when assaying total global translation.

We used <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> clone 1, since the exon targeted in this clone is further 5’ than in clone 2, thereby yielding a short, truncated protein of only 24 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Correlation analysis revealed that both footprint counts and total RNA counts were highly reproducible across technical triplicates in both control and <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, our data revealed the expected enrichment of footprints in the coding sequence versus UTRs, as well as distinct triplet periodicity, both hallmarks of ribosome profiling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Metagene analysis showed similar global profiles in footprint densities within ORFs in wild-type and <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> samples, in agreement with the data presented above that eIF2A is dispensable for global mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). A per-gene analysis identified only 15 genes in addition to eIF2A whose translation efficiency changes in <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is very different from our previous footprinting studies where we found that loss of DENR leads to reduced translation of 517 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohlen et al., 2020</xref>), loss of PRRC2A/B/C leads to altered translation of 109 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohlen et al., 2023</xref>), and expression of 4E-BP leads to altered translation of 605 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roiuk et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that in comparison eIF2A plays a minor role in translational regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We decided to validate some of these eIF2A-dependent candidates by immunoblotting, and to our surprise, amongst all the proteins we tested, only CCND3 showed reduced levels in one of the two <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). We then quantified mRNA levels for all the genes that we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). For NCAPH2, PPFIA1, and RPS6KB2, mRNA levels were either unchanged or reduced in the <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells, indicating that translation efficiency for these genes was either unchanged or increased upon loss of eIF2A, which does not agree with the ribosome profiling data. For CCND3, protein levels were reduced in KO1 and mRNA levels were not, consistent with a drop in CCND3 translation in these cells, but this effect was not reproduced in eIF2A KO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). Together, this indicates there is an enrichment for false-positives amongst the 15 genes identified by ribosome profiling. These results would be consistent with eIF2A having no effect on translation of any mRNA, with a few false positives coming through in the transcriptome-wide ribosome footprinting, as is always the case. Nonetheless, to test further whether translation of any of these candidates is altered upon loss of eIF2A, we generated reporter constructs by cloning the 5’-UTRs of these candidates upstream of Renilla luciferase, and then testing their expression in the presence or absence of eIF2A. We used this approach multiple times in the past to identify mRNAs whose translation is dependent on initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohlen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roiuk et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schleich et al., 2014</xref>). We succeeded in cloning 14 of the 15 5’ UTRs of the transcripts predicted to be eIF2A-dependent. None of the reporters, however, showed a consistent drop in translation in eIF2A KO1, eIF2A KO2, and siRNA-mediated eIF2A knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although we did not exclude a possible effect of eIF2A on translation via the 3’UTR or coding sequence of the 12 genes that we did not assay via immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>), our results indicate that eIF2A has little or no effect on translation of cellular mRNAs in HeLa cells under non-stressed conditions. Consistent with this, analysis of our ribosome footprinting data with anota2seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oertlin et al., 2019</xref>), also did not identify any transcripts with altered translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ribosome profiling of eIF2A-KO lines finds little impact of eIF2A on translation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribosome profiling identifies a handful of mRNAs sensitive to eIF2A depletion.

To perform this, we cloned a 5’ UTR reporter with a short 5’UTR (12 nt) where loading of the small ribosomal subunit should place the AUG in close proximity to the P-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, we tested a reporter bearing the EMCV IRES in the 5’-UTR, where initiation relies on close positioning of the 40 S to the AUG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davies and Kaufman, 1992</xref>). Translation of neither reporter, however, was affected by loss of eIF2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In sum, we were not able to find any transcript whose translation depends on eIF2A under non-stressed conditions in HeLa cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>eIF2A does not contribute to uORF translation</title><p>Several studies have reported that eIF2A can deliver alternative initiator tRNAs to uORFs with near-cognate start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Starck et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these reports, we tested if eIF2A depletion affects uORF translation in HeLa cells. First, we analyzed if translation initiation or termination on endogenous, AUG-initiated uORFs is altered in <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells. For this, we calculated a metagene profile of footprint reads at start and stop codons of all AUG-initiated uORFs, however, we could not detect any significant differences in uORF translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Since uORFs are elements that inhibit translation of the downstream main ORF (mORF), initiation factors that influence uORF translation also influence, as a consequence, translation of the downstream main ORF. Therefore, we checked if translation efficiency of the main ORF of uORF-bearing transcripts changes between eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> and control cells. For this w,e looked at the translation efficiency of different sets of transcripts: (1) all transcripts, (2) transcripts possessing AUG-initiated uORFs, or (3) transcripts containing uORFs starting with a near cognate initiation codon – CUG, GUG, or UUG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although essentially no genes show a significant change in translation efficiency when analyzed singly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), this aggregate analysis might identify significant trends caused by small changes in groups of transcripts. This analysis revealed, however, that translation of transcripts with near-cognate uORFs did not differ from the global distribution in translation efficiency of all transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Transcripts with AUG-initiated uORFs, however, did have a very slight, but statistically significant increase in translation efficiency, compared to the whole dataset (log2(fold change) of –0.03 vs –0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To validate this minor role of eIF2A in uORF translation, we tested various luciferase reporters in eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> cells. We placed Renilla luciferase under control of a 5’ UTR with no uORF (LMNB1, as a negative control) or the same 5’UTR where we synthetically introduced a uORF with different start codons or Kozak sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In line with our ribosome profiling data, all of these luciferase reporters showed no significant difference in expression in <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> or eIF2A overexpressing cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Considering that this luciferase assay is a readout for translation of the main ORF, and not the uORF directly, we also performed an experiment where we directly visualized uORF peptide production. For this purpose, we generated fluorescent reporters carrying a uORF coding for the SINFEKL peptide, which can be presented on the surface of cells expressing the H-2Kb Class I MHC complex (HEK293T-H2-Kb) where it can be detected with antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Starck et al., 2016</xref>). To assess the impact of eIF2A on the production of this peptide, we generated a HEK293T-H2-Kb, <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Like <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> HeLa cells, HEK293T-H2-Kb <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells also did not display any defect in proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) or global translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). This revealed, however, no difference in translation of the uORF peptide when comparing <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> to control cells, regardless of whether the uORF was initiated by an AUG codon or a near-cognate initiation codon, as detected by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This differs from what we previously observed upon loss of PRRC2A/B/C proteins, which caused increased expression of the uORF SINFEKL peptide and reduced expression of the downstream main ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohlen et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>eIF2A has little or effect on uORF translation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Synthetic reporters harboring uORFs with different start codons and initiation contexts do not show dependence on eIF2A.

We, therefore, induced the integrated stress response and tested the impact of loss of eIF2A on several different translational changes that occur – the global reduction in translation levels, the formation of stress granules, and induction of the few target genes such as ATF4 which evade the global reduction in translation and instead are translationally induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>). For this, we treated cells with tunicamycin or sodium arsenite to phosphorylate eIF2α (eIF2S1) by two independent kinases – PERK or HRI – and estimated global translation by assessing polysome profiles. Both treatments led to suppression of translation (compared <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), however, the magnitude of suppression was similar in <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> and isogenic control HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

To test whether eIF2A affects translation of any mRNA when eIF2 is inactive, we performed ribosome profiling on control and eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> HeLa cells treated with tunicamycin and compared these data to the data from non-stressed controls described above. The results showed good reproducibility across duplicates for both ribosome profiling and total RNA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, by comparing translation efficiency for all mRNAs in <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> versus control cells in the tunicamycin-treated condition, we did not find any transcript with significantly changed translation apart from eIF2A itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In line with this, we also did not find any significant changes in a metagene profile of footprints on all main ORFs in control and <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells upon tunicamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, it is possible that the induction of particular transcripts in response to stress may be affected in eIF2A-knock-out cells compared to controls. To test it, we compared changes in translation efficiency between untreated and treated cells in both control and <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells. This identified a small group of transcripts whose translation was more strongly induced in control cells than in <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Statistical analysis identified 12 transcripts that were significantly induced in control cells (log2 fold change of TE (TM/untreated) ≥ 1, p-adj &lt;0.05), but with blunted induction in <italic>eIF2A</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells (yellow dots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Translational induction of genes in response to eIF2α phosphorylation is thought to occur mainly via their 5’UTRs. Therefore, to study systematically the induction of these 12 transcripts, we cloned their 5’-UTRs into luciferase reporters. We succeeded in cloning the 5’UTRs of 11 out of the 12 transcripts. Transfection of these reporters and co-treatment with tunicamycin, however, did not show any impaired induction in <italic>eIF2A<sup>KO</sup></italic> cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that either the induction in translation of these transcripts relies on features outside of their 5’-UTRs, or these 12 transcripts are false positives from the ribosome footprinting.</p><p>Finally, we assessed if there is any impact of eIF2A loss on translation of uORF-containing transcripts upon tunicamycin treatment. First, we looked at the metagene profiles for footprints on all uORFs aligned to their start or stop codons, however, this did not show any significant changes, apart from a minor faster transition from initiation to elongation in eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>), which is the opposite of what one would expect. Next, we analyzed how the translation efficiency of transcripts containing either AUG- or near-cognate-initiated uORFs changes upon loss of eIF2A, compared to all transcripts, however, we did not find any significant changes in either case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Lastly, we tested the synthetic reporters containing uORFs with different start codons or Kozak sequences, described above, in the presence of tunicamycin but found no differences in translation in eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). In sum, overall, we find a very minor, or no contribution of eIF2A on translation upon stress in HeLa cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although eIF2A was discovered prior to eIF2α, its role in translation still remains unclear, with a broad range of different functions attributed to it (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komar and Merrick, 2020</xref>). In this study, we aimed to systematically assess the impact of eIF2A on translation regulation in HeLa cells. Our data show that more eIF2A is localized to the cytosol than the nucleus. Despite a previous report that eIF2A shuttles out of the nucleus in response to cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), we observed no change in its distribution between these compartments upon stress, consistent with previous findings in HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">González-Almela et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanz et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, eIF2A was reported to act as a global suppressor of translation, affecting all mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grove et al., 2023</xref>). This would result in increased global translation in <italic>eIF2A</italic> knock-out cells. However, we did not observe any change in bulk translation, as measured by OPP incorporation assays, upon loss or increased expression of eIF2A. In line with no impact of eIF2A on global translation, we also did not detect any proliferation defect of eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> cells, which fits with a dispensable role of eIF2A in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Golovko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Komar et al., 2005</xref>). This is further supported by our ribosome profiling data, which showed that only a few transcripts, if any, changed in their translation upon loss of eIF2A, while the vast majority of the translatome remained unaffected. Given that eIF2A was reported to modulate translation initiation through elements in the 5’-UTR (e.g. uORFs, repeats, etc.) we tested whether cloning the 5’-UTRs of affected transcripts into luciferase reporters would reveal eIF2A dependence, however, this was not the case. This suggests that if certain transcripts are affected by the lack of eIF2A this is not due to their 5’ UTRs and may rely on features in their CDS or 3’-UTRs.</p><p>The tRNA-binding properties of eIF2A remain a topic of debate. While initial studies reported that eIF2A could bind tRNA<sup>Met</sup> in a GTP-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zoll et al., 2002</xref>), the purification protocols used in these studies were later shown to result in eIF2D contamination, which was subsequently identified as the tRNA<sup>Met</sup> binding factor, whereas eIF2A showed no such affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dmitriev et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the contested tRNA-binding capabilities of eIF2A, several subsequent studies still reported a switch of tRNA delivery from eIF2α to eIF2A upon cellular stresses, when eIF2 activity is attenuated due to phosphorylation by one of the four ISR kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Starck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tusi et al., 2021</xref>). Taking this into consideration, we carried out ribosome profiling upon tunicamycin treatment, which results in eIF2α phosphorylation through PERK kinase. Surprisingly, also in this condition, we did not find any transcript whose translation is significantly affected when comparing eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> to control cells. However, we did find some transcripts whose induction was blunted in eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> cells. Since no transcript showed reduced translation in eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> cells compared to control cells in either the control or the tunicamycin condition, these must be transcripts which had mildly, but not significantly increased translation in the non-stressed condition and mildly, but not significantly reduced translation in the tunicamycin condition, leading to a significant difference when comparing the two treatment conditions. To further dissect if this defect in induction arises from elements within the transcript 5’-UTRs, we cloned their 5’UTRs into luciferase reporters, however, we found no significant difference between eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> and control cells. Given that the more straightforward analysis comparing translation efficiency in eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> versus control cells in the tunicamycin condition revealed no transcripts with altered translation, we think the most simple explanation is that also in the stressed condition where eIF2 function is suppressed, eIF2A does not impact translation in HeLa cells.</p><p>Several reports linked eIF2A function to uORF translation. Although our ribosome profiling data indicates that there are no obvious defects in translation of transcripts with uORFs, we nonetheless decided to test the impact of eIF2A on synthetic uORF reporters. We used reporters with uORFs initiated by either AUG or by near-cognate start codons, thereby testing the role of eIF2A in leaky scanning, reinitiation, and near-cognate initiation. Our data, however, show that none of the tested reporters was affected by eIF2A loss or overexpression in both non-stressed and stressed conditions, indicating that eIF2A is dispensable for uORF translation in HeLa cell lines. We did not detect increased translation (i.e. footprints) of any other initiation factor that can potentially deliver tRNAs in <italic>eIF2A</italic> knock-outs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), however we cannot exclude that the functional consequence of eIF2A loss is masked by another protein with redundant function.</p><p>Overall, our findings are fully in agreement with recent reports showing little or no effect on translation of eIF2A loss in yeast or human HEK293-T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gaikwad et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ichihara et al., 2021</xref>). Ichihara and colleagues generated eIF2A knockout HEK293-T cells and compared their translation to parental control cells via ribosome profiling. This revealed only 1 mRNA with reduced translation efficiency in non-stressed conditions and 4 mRNAs with reduced translation efficiency in cells treated with arsenite where eIF2 is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ichihara et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the lack of impact of eIF2A on mRNA translation does not appear to be specific to HeLa cells.</p><p>Historically, eIF2A was linked to translation because it was purified with other initiation factors and it shows synthetic lethality with eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Komar et al., 2005</xref>). Even though some of the initial tests with eIF2A showed no activity in reconstituted translational extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Merrick and Anderson, 1975</xref>), subsequent reports attributed different translational functions to eIF2A. Given that eIF2A contains an RNA-binding domain, it is possible that eIF2A plays a role in RNA trafficking or mRNA decay. The synthetic lethality between eIF2A and eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Komar et al., 2005</xref>) is interesting in this regard since eIF4E is also involved in the nuclear export of transcripts with 4E-SE elements. This raises the possibility that eIF2A might contribute to mRNA regulation beyond translation initiation. For instance, the last 50 amino acids of eIF2A are highly similar to PYM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diem et al., 2007</xref>), a protein that binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit and to Y14, an exon-junction complex protein.</p><p>In this study, we used predominantly HeLa cells, with some tests in HEK293T cells. Thus, we cannot rule out that in other cell types, eIF2A might have a function in translation initiation. eIF2A knockout mice have a reduced abundance of B-lymphocytes and dendritic cells in the thymic medulla, as well as lipid metabolism defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>). A recent study reported that mutation of <italic>eIF2A</italic> in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> via a MiMic transposon insertion into the second exon of <italic>eIF2A</italic> is lethal for the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowe and Montell, 2022</xref>). This is the first example of a lethal phenotype for eIF2A-loss in an organism, although this result needs to be confirmed with a clean knockout. The same study found that insertion of a different, piggyback transposon into the second intron resulted in viable, but infertile males due to failed sperm individualization, supporting the idea of cell-type specific function of eIF2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lowe and Montell, 2022</xref>). Whether these phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are due to a role of eIF2A in translation initiation, however, remains to be investigated. Overall, our results support the idea that eIF2A plays a minor, or no role in regulating translation initiation in human HeLa and HEK293T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">eIF2A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensemble</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSG00000144895</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HeLa</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DSMZ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ACC 57</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HeLa-eIF2A-KO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T-H2-Kb</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">gift from Rienk Offringa lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rienk Offringa lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T-H2-Kb-eIF2A-KO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="4">siRNA to eIF2A (mix of all 4 was used)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="4">Horizon discovery</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">D-014766–01</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GCUCCCAGGUUACGGGUUA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">D-014766–02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GAUUUGGAAUUGGGUAUUU</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">D-014766–03</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GCAGAUAAAGUUACAAUGC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">D-014766–04</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">CCACAAUCAGGAAACGAUA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent (oligos used to produce KO)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pair 8 sg_eIF2A 1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OMR064</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">CACCGCTCACCCAAAAATACTGTCC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent (oligos used to produce KO)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pair 8 sg_eIF2A 2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OMR065</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">AAACGGACAGTATTTTTGGGTGAGC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent (oligos used to produce KO)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pair 5 sg_eIF2A 1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OMR058</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">CACCGAATACTAATATATGTCCATG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent (oligos used to produce KO)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pair 5 sg_eIF2A 2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OMR059</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">AAACCATGGACATATATTAGTATTC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-ATF-4 (D4B8) (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">cat.

The following day, cells were treated either with DMSO or 1 µg/ml tunicamycin for 16 hr. After treatment, cells were quickly washed with ice-cold 1x PBS supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 and 800 µM Cycloheximide. After the wash, all residual solution was removed by gentle taping of the 15 cm dish on its side, followed by cell lysis with 150 µl of the following buffer: 0,25 M HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM MgCl2, 1 M KCl, 5% NP40, 1000 μM Cycloheximide. Cells were scraped into an Eppendorf tube and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The concentration of lysate was estimated using a nanodrop spectrophotometer, measuring RNA content against a water-blanked control. 150 μl of lysate was used for the total RNA preparation with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, cat. No. 74106). The remaining lysate was used for treatment with RNase I (100 Units per 120 µg of lysate) on ice for 30 min. Following digestion, the lysates were loaded on a 15–65% sucrose gradient, which was prepared in advance with the use of a Biocomp Gradient Master. The lysate was ultracentrifuged for 3 hr at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman Ultracentrifuge with a SW40Ti rotor. To collect the 80 S fraction the gradient was separated on a Biocomp Gradient Profiler system. The collected 80 S fractions were used for RNA extraction with acid-phenol. Briefly, the volume of the sample was adjusted to 700 µl with 10 mM Tris pH 7.0 and mixed with 750 µl of prewarmed acid phenol. Sample-phenol mix was incubated at 65° C with constant shaking at 1400 rpm for 15 min, followed by incubation on ice for 5 min. The sample was subsequently centrifuged at 20,000 g for 2 min and the supernatant was transferred into a new tube, containing 700 µl of acid phenol. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the sample was spun at 20,000 g for 2 min and the supernatant was transferred into the tube with 600 µl of chloroform. The sample was then mixed by vortexing and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 2 min. The supernatant fraction was transferred into a new tube and mixed with an equal volume of isopropanol, 2 µl of Glycoblue (Invitrogen AM9516), and 1/10 vol 3 M NaAc pH 5.2. To precipitate RNA, the sample was incubated overnight at –80° C. The following day, the sample was centrifuged at 4° C for 30 min at 14,000 rpm, followed by a 70% ethanol wash. The RNA pellet was resuspended in RNase- DNase-free water. The integrity of all RNA samples was analyzed on a Bioanalyser. To size-select footprints, RNA extracted from the 80 S peak was run on a 15% Urea-Polyacrylamide gel, and fragments of 25–35 nucleotides were purified from the gel. For this, the gel pieces containing the footprints were broken into small pieces with gel smasher tubes. 0.5 ml of 10 mM Tris pH 7 were added to the smashed gel pieces and the suspension was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min with shaking. The mix was briefly centrifuged and the supernatant was used for RNA precipitation by isopropanol. Purified footprints were phosphorylated by means of T4 PNK (NEB) for 1 hr at 37 °C in PNK buffer supplemented with 10 mM ATP. After this, the footprints were again precipitated and purified using isopropanol. To estimate the quality of footprints, RNA was run on an Agilent Bioanalyzer small RNA chip, followed by library preparation with the Next-Flex small RNA v.4 kit protocol (Perkin Elmer, NOVA-5132–06), in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Total RNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded library preparation kit. The quality of libraries were checked on a Bioanalyser with the use of a High sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent, 5067–4626). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Next-Seq 550 system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analyses of ribosome profiling</title><p>Reads were trimmed from adaptors and randomized nucleotides derived from use of the Nextflex kit with cutadapt software. By use of Bowtie2, the reads aligning to tRNA or rRNA were removed. All remaining reads were mapped to the human transcriptome (Ensemble transcript assembly 94) and genome (hg38) using BBMap software, with multiple mapping allowed. The reads mapping to the coding sequences were quantified with lab-based software written in C (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/aurelioteleman/Teleman-Lab">https://github.com/aurelioteleman/Teleman-Lab</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Teleman, 2025</xref>). For each transcript, the value of reads per kilobase of coding sequence was estimated and only transcripts with values more or equal to 2.5 were used for the subsequent analysis. Metagene profiles were built with the custom-made software written in C (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/aurelioteleman/Teleman-Lab">https://github.com/aurelioteleman/Teleman-Lab</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Teleman, 2025</xref>). For the metagene profile of uORF stop codons, only transcripts with a space of more than 50 nucleotides between uORF and main ORF were used. The DESeq2 software package was used to calculate log2 fold-changes and adjusted p-values for the difference in translation efficiency (defined as ribosome footprints/total RNA) in control versus eIF2A knockout cells. DESeq2 was run with the design = ~assay + condition + assay:condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>OPP incorporation assay</title><p>A total of 0.5 million control or eIF2A<sup>KO</sup> HeLa cells were seeded in six-well plates a day prior to treatment.

Following labeling, the cells were lysed, the concentration of samples was measured and equalized, and the incorporation of OPP was estimated via western blot using anti-puromycin antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Dual-luciferase translation reporter assay</title><p>Cells were seeded in 96-well plate format at a density of 8000 cells per well. The following day, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 with 100 ng of Renilla luciferase plasmid and 100 ng of Firefly luciferase plasmid per well. In case of tunicamycin (TM) treatment, 6 hr post-transfection, medium was exchanged with fresh medium supplemented either with DMSO or 1 µg/ml TM. After 16 hr, the luciferase assay was carried out using the Promega Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega, E1910) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescent detection of overexpressed Flag-eIF2A</title><p>15,000 control HeLa cells were seeded in a 12-well format on poly-lysine coated 12 mm coverslips. The following day, cells were transfected with a plasmid coding for eIF2A-Flag using Lipofectamine 2000 in a ratio of 1:2 DNA:reagent (Life Technologies, 11668500). One day later, cells were treated with or without sodium arsenite (100 µM, 1 hr) and then washed with PBS and fixed by incubation for 15 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized by incubation for 10 min in 0.2% Triton-X-100 in PBS and blocked for 1 hr in 0.25% BSA in PBS. Following blocking, cells were incubated overnight at 4 C in primary antibodies. On the following day, the cells were washed twice with blocking buffer and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr. Finally, cells were shortly stained with 5 µg DAPI (Applichem A1001) and mounted on glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Labs H-1000). The distribution of Flag-eIF2A was analyzed on a confocal microscope (Leika TCS SP8) using a 63 x objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cell proliferation assay</title><p>For cell proliferation assays, cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a density of 1000 cells per well in 100 µl of medium, eight wells per condition. A total of five plates were seeded for the sequential sample collection. The proliferation curve was built by harvesting one plate every 24 hr and performing the Cell Titer Glo (Promega, G7572) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Subcellular fractionation</title><p>On the day prior to the experiment, cells were seeded in 10 cm dish format, 1.5–2 million cells per dish. The next day, cells were treated for 2 hr either with 1 µg/ml Tunicamycin or DMSO, followed by a quick wash with PBS and harvesting by trypsinization. The collected cells were pelleted by gentle centrifugation at 4° C (3000 g 5 min). The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was quickly washed twice with PBS. Cells were resuspended with 200 µl of 1 x Hypotonic Buffer (20 mM Tric-HCl, pH 7.4; 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl) by gently pipetting up and down. The resuspended cells were incubated on ice for 15 min, followed by the addition of 1/20 of the suspension volume of 10% NP40. Cells with NP40 were vortexed for 10 s at the highest speed and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 C. The supernatant was moved into a new tube and marked as the cytosolic fraction, while the pellet was washed twice with PBS, moved into a new tube and resuspended in 200 μl of Cell Extraction Buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 100 mM NaCL, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM NaF, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20 mM Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>). The pellet was incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 g at 4 C for 30 min.

Two days prior to the experiment, cells were seeded in six-well format. The following day, cells were transfected with empty vector, or with plasmids encoding mNeonGreen-PEST carrying either an oORF-less 5’UTR, or a 5’UTR containing a uORF coding for ‘SIINFEKL’ with either AUG or near-cognate start codons. The AUG codon was placed in a Kozak context predicted to be either ‘medium’ or ‘strong.’ 24 hr post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS, collected by trypsinization, and resuspended and incubated for 10 min in blocking buffer (1% BSA in 1x PBS). After blocking, cells were washed once more with PBS and stained for 30 min in the dark at 4° C with 0.25 μg/ml monoclonal Antibody OVA257-264, which detects the SIINFEKL-peptide bound to H-2Kb (Life technologies 25-5743-82).

We will revise the manuscript according to the recommendations made in the detailed recommendations. Regarding the two points mentioned here:</p><p>(1) The reason eIF2alpha phosphorylation does not increase appreciably is because unfortunately the antibody is very poor. The fact that the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is induced by our treatment can be seen, for instance, by the fact that ATF4 protein levels increase strongly (in the very same samples where eIF2alpha phosphorylation does not increase much, in Suppl. Fig. 5E). We will strengthen the conclusion that the ISR is indeed activated with additional experiments/data as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>(2) We agree that our results are in line with results from the previous study mentioned by the reviewer, so we will revise the manuscript to mention this other study more extensively in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I suggest to state (already in the abstract, but perhaps also even in the title, definitely in the rest of the paper) that this analysis is limited to the HeLa cell line.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now specified in both the title and the abstract that the work is done in HeLa cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In my view, it is a pity that the authors - given the tools are available - did not check the impact of high eIF2A levels on expression of individual mRNAs under normal and stress conditions. I am not suggesting to repeat ribo-seq in this setup, it would be too much to ask for, but re-examining some of the many reporters the authors generated with eIF2A overexpressed may point to some function, e.g. increased number of non-canonical initiation events (non-AUG-initiated)? If anything, the use of HeLa and the primary focus on eIF2A KO neglecting the prospective impact of eIF2A overexpression should be mentioned as two main limitations of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the good suggestion to test our synthetic reporters with eIF2A overexpression. New Suppl. Fig. 4G now shows that overexpression of eIF2A does not affect translation of synthetic reporters carrying an ATG start codon in different initiation contexts, or carrying near-cognate start codons, in agreement with a lack of effect on translation which we previously observed with loss of eIF2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Ribo-seq with eIF2A. Did the authors focus on ORFs that are known, or whose isoforms are known, to be non-AUG initiated? Would the loss of eIF2A decrease FPs in their CDSes under at least some conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now assessed the read distribution on the eIF4G2 transcript in both the control and tunicamycin conditions (Author response image 1). In our hands, eIF4G2 is one of the best examples of non-AUG initiation in human cells, since the main coding sequence starts with GTG and the CDS is well translated. Nonetheless, we do not observe any significant changes in read distribution (panels A-B) or overall translation efficiency of eIF4G2 upon eIF2A loss (panels C-D).</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(A-B) Average reads occupancy on the eIF4G2 (ENST0000339995) transcript in DMSO treated (panel A, n=3) or tunicamycin treated samples (panel B, n=2) derived from either control (black) or eIF2A-KO (red) HeLa cells.

However, they have not exhausted all possible potential functions of eIF2A, see below, it is also possible that eIF2A may have a role not yet suggested by anyone and it may function in translation initiation in special circumstances that have not been tested yet. The authors indeed discuss such possibility in the Discussion section. Given that there is genetic evidence (that is unaffected by biochemical impurities) linking eIF2A to other initiation factors (5B and 4E), we are not yet convinced that eIF2A does not have any role in translation initiation and therefore we find the last sentence of the abstract premature. We suggest to soften this statement into something like this: whether eIF2A has any role in translation remains unknown, it may even have a role in a different aspect of RNA Biology.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We changed the last sentence of the abstract to read as follows:</p><p>“It is possible that eIF2A plays a role in translation regulation in specific conditions that we have not tested here, or that it plays a role in a different aspect of RNA biology.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Recently eIF2A has been implicated in ribosomal frameshifting, see Wei et al 2023 DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112987</p><p>Could authors look into PEG10 mRNA ribosome profile to see if there are detectable statistically significant changes in footprint density downstream of frameshift site between WT and eIF2A Kos? It is likely that the coverage will be insufficient to give a definitive answer, but it is worth checking, it would be a pity to miss it.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now looked at the distribution of ribosome footprints on the PEG10 transcript variant that is expressed in HeLa cells (ENST00000482108) and indeed observe coverage downstream of the annotated stop codon, consistent with a frameshifting event that results in an extended protein isoform being translated. Visual assessment of the read distribution between the main ORF and the &quot;ORF extension&quot; does not show a substantial difference between control and eIF2A knock-out cells (Author response image 2A-B). Additionally, we quantified the ratio of reads mapping to the PEG10 ORF upstream of the slippery site versus those mapping downstream, extending into the predicted longer protein.

Nonetheless, there are few points that need to be taken into account.</p><p>The authors state that eIF2A is capable to recruit initiator tRNA citing Zoll et al 2002. This activity was later shown to be a biochemical artefact (which was most likely reproduced by Kim et al 2018), eIF2A fraction was contaminated with eIF2D which does bind tRNAs in GTP-independent manner. eIF2A purified from RRL separates from initiator tRNA binding activity, see Dmitriev et al 2010 DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M110.119693. This point is also relevant to the second paragraph of Discussion, it should be acknowledged that it has been shown previously that eIF2A does not bind the initiator tRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the advice provided by the reviewer. We have modified both the introduction and the 2nd paragraph of the discussion to reflect that the tRNA-binding activity is due to contaminating eIF2D rather than eIF2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In many cases the authors describe certain claims as facts even though they refute them themselves. For example</p><p>&quot;Such eIF2A-driven non-AUG initiation events were shown to play a crucial role in different aspects of cell physiology and disease progression: cellular adaptation during the integrated stress response (Chen et al., 2019; Starck et al., 2016)&quot; While non-AUG initiation events do play crucial roles in different aspects of cell physiology (reviewed in Andreev et al 2023 doi: 10.1186/s13059-022-02674-2) eIF2A has nothing to do with it as the authors show themselves. Therefore different language should be used, e.g.. &quot;eIF2A has been suggested (or proposed or reported) to be responsible for non-AUG initiation events that were shown to play ...&quot;</p><p>The word &quot;shown&quot; is used in many other instances for the claims that the authors refute. &quot;Shown&quot; is only appropriate for strong evidence that leaves little doubt.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and made the suggested changes in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Supplementary Fig. 1.</p><p>Panel C is used to argue that eIF2A has a higher concentration than in the nucleus, perhaps it is worth explaining how this conclusion was drawn. If levels in cytoplasm are comparable to GAPDH and Tubulin but less than c-Myc in nucleus does it really mean that there is less eIF2A in the nucleus than in cytoplasm? This is not obvious to us. Also, presumably WCL stands for Whole Cell Lysate, it would be nice to introduce this abbreviation somewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>To compare levels of eIF2A in the nuclear and cytosolic fractions, we lysed the two fractions in equal volumes of buffer (i.e. the cytosolic fraction was extracted in 200 µl of hypotonic buffer, and the nuclear fraction was extracted in 200 µl of cell extraction buffer). This assures that per microliter of lysate we have the same number of &quot;cytosols&quot; or nuclei. Hence, equal intensity bands in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions would mean that half of the protein is in the nucleus and half is in the cytosol. We originally described this in the Methods section, but now also mention it in the Results and in the figure legend.</p><p>We replaced WCL with &quot;whole cell&quot; in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The differential translation analysis is described very briefly &quot;To obtain values of translation efficiency, log2 fold changes, and adjusted p values the DESeq2 software package was used&quot;. Was TE calculated based on ribosome footprint to RNA-seq ratios? How exactly DESeq2 was used here? TE measured in this way spuriously correlates with RNA-seq values, see Larsson et al 2010 DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1006821107, perhaps it would be worse assessing differential translation with anota2seq (Oertlin et al 2019 doi: 10.1093/nar/gkz223.)? Anota2seq avoids calculating the ratios and enables comprehensive analysis of differential translation including detection of buffered translation which might be the case here while avoiding artefacts that may arise from varying RNA levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We now specified in more detail in the Methods section how we analyzed the data. Indeed, the DeSeq2 was used on translation efficiency values, which we calculated as the ratio of ribosome footprints to RNA-seq.</p><p>As suggested, we have now also performed the analysis using anota2seq (Suppl. Fig. 3C) and this analysis identified zero transcripts that are translationally regulated, in agreement with our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Section &quot;eIF2a-inactivating stresses do not redirect tRNA delivery function to eIF2A.&quot;</p><p>The description of ISR mechanism is a bit inaccurate. Strictly speaking eIF2alpha phosphorylation does not inactivate it eIF2alpha. It results in formation of a very stable eIF2*GDP*eIF2B complex, thus severely depleting eIF2B which serves as a GEF for eIF2. This in turn reduces the ternary complex (eIF2*GTP*tRNAi) concentration since there is no free eIF2B to exchange GDP for GTP. Without getting into much detail, we think it would be more accurate to say that eIF2alpha phosphorylation leads to ternary complex depletion instead of saying that stress inactivates eIF2alpha.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer - we were trying to use simple, compact wording. We have now reworded the section title to &quot;No detectable role for eIF2A in translation when eIF2 is inhibited&quot; and rephrased the subsequent text to be correct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the subtitle uses eIF2a with small a that stands for alpha which potentially could lead to substantial confusion since in this case the difference between eIF2alpha and eIF2A is only in capitalisation of the last letter, many text-mining engines such as modern LLMs may not be able to pick the differences. Perhaps it would be better to refer to eIF2alpha by the HGNC approved name of its gene - eIF2S1 to avoid further confusions. For clarity it may be stated at the beginning that eIF2S1 is commonly known as eIF2alpha.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We have removed all instances of eIF2a (with lowercase a) from the manuscript to avoid this source of confusion. In the first instance of eIF2a we also added the official HGNC gene name. However, we prefer to use eIF2a instead of eIF2S1 because people outside the translation field tend to know the subunit as eIF2a, and we think it is important that also people outside the translation field read this manuscript, since some of the questionable papers on eIF2A come from labs working at the interface between translation and other fields.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>Introduction</p><p>(7) &quot;uses the CAT anticodon&quot; change CAT to CAU</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected CAT to CAU</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) &quot;In the canonical initiation pathway&quot;, change &quot;canonical&quot; to &quot;most common&quot;, canonical is somewhat a judgemental statement that originates in theology.

Because these are the conditions employed for ribosome profiling in stress conditions shown in Fig. 4B, it would be reassuring to document TM-induced translational efficiencies of ATF4 and the other known mRNAs resistant to eIF2 phosphorylation in the ribosome profiling data, including gene browser images of the replicate experiments. If the induction of TEs by TM for such mRNAs was not robust, it would be valuable to repeat the analysis using arsenite (SA) treatment, which produces a greater inhibition of bulk translation.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the eIF2alpha antibody is not very good and also detects the nonphosphorylated protein, causing high background and poor apparent induction in response to tunicamycin. The fact that the ISR was activated is visible from the induction of ATF that was assessed by western blot in the Suppl. Fig. 5E. To ensure that our ribosome profiling libraries also recorded the activation of ISR we built single gene plots for ATF4 both in control and HeLa eIF2A-KO cell. As shown in Author response image 3 A&amp;B in both cell lines tunicamycin treatment led to the induction of ATF4. This can also be seen by the 4-fold induction in ATF4 translation efficiency in response to tunicamycin in both WT and eIF2A-KO cells (Author response image 3C). Additionally, we checked that another marker induced by tunicamycin, HSPA5, is also translationally upregulated in both cell lines, as well as the downstream target of ATF4 – PPP1R15B.
