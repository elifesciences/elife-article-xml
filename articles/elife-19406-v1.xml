The prediction of this side effect is however challenging as it usually develops in some genetically predisposed individuals with normal cardiac repolarization at baseline. Here, we describe a platform based on a genetically diverse panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that reproduces susceptibility to develop a cardiotoxic drug response. We generated iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from patients presenting in vivo with extremely low or high changes in cardiac repolarization in response to a pharmacological challenge with sotalol. In vitro, the responses to sotalol were highly variable but strongly correlated to the inter-individual differences observed in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identified dysregulation of genes (<italic>DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF, HTR2C</italic>, <italic>CAMKV</italic>) involved in downstream regulation of cardiac repolarization machinery as underlying high sensitivity to sotalol. Our findings offer novel insights for the development of iPSC-based screening assays for testing individual drug reactions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19406.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19406.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19406.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Common medications can disturb the electrical signals that cause the heart to beat, potentially resulting in sudden death. Many of the drugs that have these “cardiotoxic” effects were not designed to affect the heart, and include anti-allergenics and anti-vomiting drugs. In general, only a small proportion of individuals treated with these drugs will be at risk of fatal side effects; this risk variation is thought to be due to genetic differences. If these people could be reliably identified, the drugs could be used to treat others who will not develop cardiotoxic reactions, but it is difficult to predict the effect a drug will have on the beating of the heart.</p><p>Stillitano, Hansen et al. have now investigated whether skin cells can be used to predict an individual’s likelihood of developing cardiotoxic side effects. Skin cells can be reprogrammed to form pluripotent stem cells, which have the ability to develop into any of the cell types in the adult body – including heart muscle cells. The effects of drugs could then be tested on these artificially created heart cells, yet it is not clear whether these effects would be the same as those seen in actual heart cells</p><p>Stillitano, Hansen et al. created heart cells from skin samples collected from many different people and treated the cells with a drug that affects the rhythm of the heart. Some of the cells came from people whose heart rhythm is strongly affected by the drug, and others came from people whose heart rhythm is barely altered. The response of the lab-grown cells was closely related to whether the cells came from a person who was susceptible to the effects of the drug. Further investigation revealed that the genes that are important for maintaining a regular heartbeat differ in people who experience strong cardiotoxic side effects from those that do not.</p><p>Overall, the results presented by Stillitano, Hansen et al. support the idea that induced pluripotent stem cells could be used to predict an individual’s risk of developing cardiotoxic reactions. Further work is now needed to develop this approach.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19406.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19406.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>induced pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>cardiotoxicity</kwd><kwd>arrhythmia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 GM071558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name><name><surname>Iyengar</surname><given-names>Ravi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM54508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name><name><surname>Iyengar</surname><given-names>Ravi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 HG008098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name><name><surname>Iyengar</surname><given-names>Ravi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cellectis Company</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research subvention</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hulot</surname><given-names>Jean-Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genetically diverse panel of subject-specific induced pluripotent stem cells models the in vitro susceptibility of cardiac cells to develop a cardiotoxic drug response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A large number of drugs have the undesirable side effect of prolonging cardiac repolarization which can trigger life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kannankeril et al., 2010</xref>). A typical cause is the inhibition of the inward rectifying potassium channel (hERG or <italic>human ether-a-go-go</italic> related gene encoded by <italic>KCNH2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kannankeril et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roden, 2008a</xref>), which results in the prolongation of the repolarization time and induces an increase of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. The early prediction of drug-induced long QT (diLQT) is a major requirement to avoid exposing patients to cardiac arrhythmias and ultimately sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarganas et al., 2014</xref>). Eventually, diLQT is a major cause of drug withdrawal or of premature termination during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fermini and Fossa, 2003</xref>). Regulatory agencies require that new drug candidates be systematically screened for hERG inhibition in animal models or in heterologous over-expression cellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sager et al., 2014</xref>). Because of species-dependent differences of cardiac electrophysiology and the failure of heterologous systems to express all cardiac proteins, hERG screening however remains suboptimal and has a poor positive predictive value for subsequent proarrhythmia risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gintant, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giorgi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sager et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The risk of developing diLQT varies markedly between subjects. Previous studies in the general population have shown that a small proportion (i.e., less than 10%) of patients exposed to QT-prolonging drugs actually develop diLQT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Behr and Roden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kannankeril et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soyka et al., 1990</xref>). Different observations support the existence of a genetic determinism to diLQT including the higher propensity to develop drug-induced repolarization abnormalities in first-degree relatives of patients with diLQT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kannankeril et al., 2005</xref>) and the similarity to the congenital form of the long QT syndrome (LQTS), a rare inherited cardiac disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moss and Robinson, 1992</xref>). Multiple rare mutations with marked effects in genes encoding ion channels have been reported to underlie LQTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cerrone and Priori, 2011</xref>). However, candidate gene screening studies in large cohorts of patients with diLQT have reported a small prevalence (from 10 to 15%) of these mutations in the known LQTS genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paulussen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). QT prolongation can be induced by mutations in many genes that occupy a substantial region of the human interactome and contain many drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 2010</xref>). The factors leading to diLQT in some individual subjects remain largely unclear but are probably driven by the additive effect of common genetic variants that reduce the cardiac repolarization reserve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Behr and Roden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kannankeril et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roden, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2008b</xref>). As a consequence, diLQT is difficult to predict as it usually develops in individuals with a predisposing genetic makeup which favors exaggerated response to a pharmacological challenge with QT-prolonging drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kannankeril et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roden, 2008b</xref>) but does not affect cardiac repolarization features at baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Behr and Roden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kannankeril et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarganas et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have recently been proposed to model monogenic disorders including congenital LQTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Itzhaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moretti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinnecker et al., 2013</xref>). Cardiomyocytes derived from congenital LQTS patient-specific iPSCs lines typically exhibit significant electrophysiological abnormalities due to the deficient function of some key cardiac ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Itzhaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moretti et al., 2010</xref>). These cells display increased arrhythmogenicity under native conditions and can be used as a test system for customization of anti-arrhythmic drugs in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Terrenoire et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, QT prolonging drugs can trigger changes in the electrical potential developed by iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navarrete et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nozaki et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To expand upon these observations, our goal was to determine whether iPSC-CMs from a group of subjects with quantitative measure of diLQT in vivo could recapitulate the phenotype in vitro thereby providing a model system for diLQT. In this study, we show that iPSC-CMs from subjects shown to be susceptible to diLQT in vivo but otherwise normal present no abnormalities in their basal characteristics but higher cardiotoxic responses to drug stimulation as compared to control iPSC-CMs. The contrasted responses to sotalol in iPSC-CMs were strongly correlated to the inter-individual differences in response to sotalol as recorded during clinical investigations. Our findings offer novel insights on the use of a genetically diverse panel of induced pluripotent stem cells to model complex pharmacogenetic traits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of subjects susceptible to develop drug-induced long QT</title><p>We first performed a clinical study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01338441) where we prospectively evaluated cardiac repolarization of healthy subjects in response to a pharmacological challenge with a single 80 mg oral dose of sotalol. Sotalol is a non-selective competitive β-adrenergic receptor blocker with additional Class III antiarrhythmic properties by its inhibition of potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zanetti, 1993</xref>). Sotalol is widely recognized as a classical QT-prolonging drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soyka et al., 1990</xref>). A total of ninety-two subjects were enrolled in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All subjects gave their written informed consent to participate the study. Included subjects were aged from 18 to 40 years (30.1 ± 6.2 years), had a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 29 kg/m² (23.9 ± 2.3 kg/m²), were from Caucasian origin and had no known significant disease or long-term treatment. Forty-four percent (n = 40) were male. Cardiac repolarization parameters were analyzed through standardized measurements of digital high-resolution ECG (sampling rate 1000 Hz). All subjects had a normal sinus rhythm and no significant conduction or repolarization abnormalities. Basal QT interval ranged from 340 to 458 ms (393.4 ± 26.3 ms), with a corresponding heart rate ranging from 47 to 88 bpm (63.3 ± 8.7 bpm). QT interval was corrected according to Fridericia's formula (QTcf=QT/[RR]<sup>1/3</sup>) providing corrected QTcf in the physiological range from 350 to 447 ms (399.0 ± 18.6 ms). Three hours after sotalol intake, QTcf had increased by 23.4 ± 2.4 ms. A large inter-individual variability was however noticed with a change in QTcf ranging from −9 ms to +81 ms and a resulting post-sotalol QTcf ranging from 351 to 489 ms (412.6 ± 43.0 ms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19406.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>QTcf changes following Sotalol administration in healthy volunteers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow chart of the clinical study.

The objective was to identify healthy subjects with extreme responses to Sotalol 80 mg. Skin punch biopsies were performed in a total of twenty subjects, 10 with low-sensitivity and 10 with high-sensitivity to Sotalol. The fresh skin biopsies were then transferred at the Ectycell company (Romainville, France) in close vicinity of the clinical investigation center. The objective was to culture and bank human dermal fibroblasts and to derive and characterize hiPSC. iPSC clones were then anonymized before any further cardiac experiments were performed. This procedure was agreed by all partners to avoid potential biases in interpreting the recording at the cellular level. iPSCs clones were successfully generated for 17 subjects using retroviral infection and were investigated in this study. For the remaining three subjects (Patients 4, 14 and 20), iPSCs clones were secondarily generated using episomal plasmids and were thus not investigated.

As early as seven days following initiation of cardiac differentiation, spontaneously beating embryoid bodies (EBs) appeared. To test for iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes quality and purity we first performed immunocytostaining studies showing positive staining for the sarcomeric proteins troponin T (cTnT), and alpha-actinin and for the gap-junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

cardiotoxic drug response</title><p>To evaluate the electrophysiological properties of iPSC-CMs, we used a microelectrode array (MEA) mapping system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). iPSC-CMs were seeded onto a 6-well MEA chamber in order to form a monolayer in contact with the electrodes. Few days after seeding iPSC-CMs regain spontaneous beating activity thus allowing recordings of field potential duration (FPD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). FPD is analogous to the QT interval in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and was previously shown to correlate with action potential duration (APD) and can be used to test drug effects on repolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navarrete et al., 2013</xref>). IPSC-CMs were first tested for their responses to E4031, a specific and potent experimental hERG blocker. E4031 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in FPD with typical flattening of the waveform in all but two cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>). There was moderate inter-line variability, except for line P11019 which demonstrated higher sensitivity to E-4031 and was found to belong to the high-S group after unblinding. There was however no significant differences in sensitivity to E4031 between groups as assessed by computations of half maximal effective concentration EC50 (2.4 ± 0.7 × 10<sup>−8</sup> vs 6.6 ± 3.0 × 10<sup>−8</sup> M in high-S and low-S groups respectively, p=0.59) or of maximal effect Emax (49 ± 20% vs 30 ± 2% in high-S and low-S groups respectively, p=0.76). Two lines displayed no responses to E4031 and were found as having the lowest expression of hERG (P11021 and P11023, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Because of the lack of response to a pure hERG blocker and of appropriate recordings to detect effects of QT prolonging drugs with the MEA system, sotalol response was not further tested on these two lines.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-19406-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19406.014</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous beating activity of monolayer iPSC-CMs seeded onto one well of a 6-well MEA chamber.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19406.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19406.014</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>The response to the clinically relevant drug sotalol was then tested in a blinded fashion in the remaining lines. For quality purposes, results from the iPSC line presenting a significant translocation were excluded from further analyses. However, the inclusion of the results obtained with this iPSC line did not change the statistical significance of the results. Final analyses were thus performed on a total of 14 lines (7 vs. 7 lines in low-S and high-S groups respectively).</p><p>After unblinding, we found that the different recordings showed a significantly higher response to sotalol in the CMs generated from iPSCs derived from high-S subjects as compared to low-S subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Increasing sotalol concentrations was associated with a significant prolongation in FPDs in all iPSC-CMs, an effect that was however significantly enhanced in lines from the high-S group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). There was a dose-dependent sotalol-induced FPD prolongation that typically appears for sotalol concentrations above 30 μmol/L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as seen in other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navarrete et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, the application of low sotalol concentration (10 μmol/L), a concentration this is closer to typical sotalol plasma levels, was already associated with a significant increase in FPD in lines from the high-S group as compared to low-S (p=0.03). The maximal FPD prolongation observed in response to sotalol was also significantly higher in the high-S as compared to low-S iPSC-CMs (52 ± 6% vs. 27 ± 6%, p=0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Sotalol is known to induce arrhythmic events including ectopic beats and short-long-short rhythm. We found that 5 of the seven lines derived from the high-S group displayed arrhythmias in response to sotalol stimulation as they showed development of irregular spontaneous beating rate. On the other hand, arrhythmias only occurred in one of the eight lines from the low-S group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We plotted the relative change in FPD in response to sotalol 30 μM against the observed change in QTcf in donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). With the exception of one cell line in each group, the remaining six low-S and six high-S cell lines were correctly discriminated according to the clinical phenotype. These data indicate that the contrasted responses to sotalol in iPSC-derived CMs are strongly related to the inter-individual differences in response to sotalol as recorded during clinical investigations.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19406.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Differences in iPSC-CMs responses to Sotalol stimulation according to clinical sensitivity to Sotalol.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adjusted FPD (aFPD) measured in iPSC-CMs derived from subjects with low-sensitivity (green) vs. high-sensitivity (red) in response to increasing concentrations of sotalol. aFPD are normalized to baseline values to account for inter-lines variability in aFPD values.

We looked for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups (all cell lines included) and used a prior knowledge based approach to identify potential risk markers that could be mechanistically connected to QT prolongation development. By analyzing the LQTS neighborhood in the human interactome we recently demonstrated that graph theoretical models allow the prediction of new gene variants and drug targets that are involved in disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 2010</xref>).

DEGs were identified between all possible combinations of one female versus one male group (16 × 6 = 96 sets of DEGs). We counted for each gene how many sets of DEGs identified the gene as significantly up-regulated or down-regulated. Down-regulated counts were subtracted from up-regulated counts and resulting netto counts were normalized to the number of total comparisons (i.e. divided by 96). Using this approach, a gene that is up-regulated in the high-S group because of gender specific expression, should be identified as significantly up-regulated in most of the female versus male groups sets of DEGs. The same accounts for down-regulated genes.

So far, iPSCs technology has been successful in recapitulating monogenic diseases with clear causative mutations including congenital long QT syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Itzhaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moretti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sinnecker et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, diLQT develop in clinically normal individuals who have a genetic predisposition requiring an additional stressor to become manifest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roden, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2008b</xref>). The exact nature of this predisposing genetic background remains uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petropoulou et al., 2014</xref>) but is likely made of an allelic series of common variants with modest independent effect on cardiac repolarization but potential for a stronger impact in a polygenic model, as exemplified by our genetic profiling.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that susceptibility to develop diLQT can be best reproduced in vitro using a targeted library of iPSCs derived from patients presenting with an extreme pharmacodynamic response to drug stimulation in vivo. Extreme phenotype selection is a well-defined methodology that helps enrich the frequency of alleles that contribute to a trait and this methodology has been successfully applied in genetic studies aimed at identifying variants associated with complex traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cirulli and Goldstein, 2010</xref>). The use of this methodology is particularly suitable when investigating variability in drug responses by segregating individuals with opposite predisposing genetic makeup, a characteristic that can be transmitted to iPSCs as shown by our data. Importantly, in order to avoid experimental biases, in vitro assessment of iPSC-CMs sensitivity to sotalol was performed blinded to the clinical phenotype. In addition, as we aimed at reproducing a more complex phenotype, we designed our study with a larger sample size than typical studies using iPSCs for disease modeling of monogenic disorders. As a consequence, we were only able to explore one iPSC clone per patient and we did not evaluate potential inter-line variability. The likelihood that inter-line variability would have systematically biased our results to reproduce the anticipated effect as seen in vivo and thus explain our results is however unlikely on a panel of 17 different cell lines as appreciated by low p-values for comparison between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Under our hypothesis, it is likely that the discrepant results obtained in two cell lines reflect that potential false results associated with inter-line variability from a same patient. However, external replication would further strengthen the potential of subject-specific iPSCs to model complex phenotypes as shown in our seminal study.</p><p>This library also represents a unique opportunity to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying pro-arrhythmic adverse drug reactions. The transcriptomic comparison of the generated iPSC-CMs from both groups combined with bioinformatics network analysis revealed significant changes in expression of genes related to the regulation of ion channels homeostasis (<italic>DLG2, KCNE4, CAMKV</italic> and <italic>PTRF</italic>). Of note, while none of these genes have been previously associated with the occurrence of diLQT, <italic>CAMKV</italic> is coding for a kinase-like protein that, in the presence of calcium, interacts with calmodulin (<italic>CALM1</italic>), a critical regulator of ion channels involved in congenital long QT syndrome 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crotti et al., 2013</xref>) and in loperamide-induced long QT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berger et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, mutations in <italic>PTRF</italic> (Polymerase I and transcript release factor, or cavin-1) cause a particular form of congenital generalized lipodystrophy (type 4, CGL4) that is associated with features of long QT syndrome and high rate of sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rajab et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>PTRF</italic> is involved in the formation of caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nabi, 2009</xref>), that are critical in cardiac ion channels trafficking to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maguy et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to the involvement of <italic>DLG2</italic> and <italic>KCNE4</italic> genes in the direct regulation of scaffolding, trafficking and gating kinetics of some cardiac potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leonoudakis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levy et al., 2010</xref>), our study suggest for the first time that diLQT might be related to changes in downstream regulation of the cardiac repolarization machinery. Further experiments will be required to understand the exact contribution of each of these candidates and whether they might act in combination to confer susceptibility to develop diLQT. Similarly, future studies using single-cell RNA sequencing on cardiomyocytes derived from our library of subject-specific iPSCs would be needed to better identify and characterize differentially expressed genes and pathways. Lastly, we identified an up-regulation in <italic>HTR2C</italic> (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C), a G-protein coupled receptor for serotonin that is expressed in the heart. Upon activation HTR2C activates down-stream signaling cascades to promote the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. Interestingly, serotonin receptor agonists have been associated with higher risk for diLQT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keller and Di Girolamo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarganas et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, we found non-significant trends for differences between groups in response to E-4031, a selective hERG channel blocker. Sotalol primarily prolongs cardiac repolarization through hERG inhibition but also have a non-selective competitive β-adrenergic receptor blocker activity and can thus affect other cardiac repolarization components that are associated with higher susceptibility to develop diLQT. Whether sotalol has a direct or indirect effect on the candidates identified in this study would deserve further investigations.</p><p>Many studies have reported a higher susceptibility to diLQT in premenopausal women as compared to men including in response to sotalol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darpo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makkar et al., 1993</xref>), an observation that is in line with the results of our prospective clinical investigation. It has been suggested that sex hormones can influence cardiac repolarization by modulating expression and function of cardiac ion channels but their effect is complex to appreciate as levels fluctuate with time and age and the different sex hormones can have counterbalancing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hulot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Odening and Koren, 2014</xref>). Here, we were able to reproduce susceptibility to develop diLQT in vitro in a hormone-free environment. We performed specific analyses that did not support an important role of gender to explain our results, including the lack of a gender-specific gene expression signature and the lack of significant sex hormone-related transcription factors. Importantly, our data suggest that the identified genes should work as predisposing genes in both genders thus arguing for the existence of an intrinsic predisposing background that is carried by iPS cells but do not depend on gender. Of note, it has recently been shown that women have in mean a greater intrinsic sensitivity to sotalol as compared to men, an effect that however remains widely variable at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darpo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The development of a new generation of human-based screening assays for testing individual drug reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inoue and Yamanaka, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mann, 2015</xref>) could help in better predicting adverse drug effect that usually develop in a relatively low proportion of susceptible individuals in the general patient population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Budnitz et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, we were able to detect significant differences in response to the lowest sotalol concentrations (i.e., 10 µM) in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from subjects clinically presenting with high sensitivity to sotalol. This suggests that the iPSC-derived platform could efficiently detect individual differences in the range of concentrations that is near the typical sotalol plasma levels. Finally, further developments in differentiation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burridge et al., 2014</xref>), in functional maturation of iPSC-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lundy et al., 2013</xref>) or in iPSC-based bioengineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schaaf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turnbull et al., 2014</xref>) might also improve the overall predictability of the method.</p><p>Our data illustrate the potential of iPSCs technology for the prediction of individual risk and for its use in precision medicine. We found a limited number of lines with discrepant results in vitro as compared to the clinical phenotype, suggesting a good accuracy of the approach. However, as we only investigated patients with extreme responses to sotalol, our study was not designed to accurately assess the predictive value of the test. This should be adequately addressed in larger prospective studies.</p><p>In conclusion, this study underscores the power of developing a panel of iPSCs to model complex traits such as susceptibility to develop cardiotoxic drug response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and clinical investigations</title><p>To participate to the study, male or female volunteers had to fulfill the following inclusion criteria: aged 18 to 40 years, body mass index from 19 to 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, no previous history of cardiac disease, no major disorders, no medications known to affect cardiac repolarization (as defined by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.crediblemeds.org/everyone/composite-list-all-qtdrugs">https://www.crediblemeds.org/everyone/composite-list-all-qtdrugs</ext-link>).

The quality of ECG recordings was assessed and baseline recordings were performed during the 5 min preceding sotalol oral administration (80 mg tablet). ECG recordings were then performed 3 hr after sotalol intake, i.e. around peak plasma concentration.

The same chest lead with the largest T-wave amplitude was selected for QT interval measurements in a given subject. QT interval was measured manually directly on the computer screen by changing position of cursors indicating the start and the end of the cardiac interval: RR (interval between two successive R waves) and QT (tangent method). Baseline QTc was assessed as the mean of three electrocardiographic recordings obtained within 5 min before drug administration. QT was corrected by the Fridericia cubic root formula (QTcf), which minimizes the errors due to the square root Bazett formula.

Such an experimental artifact might distort normalization including total reads as well as upper quartile normalization, the two normalization options that are offered by cufflinks. Both normalization approaches only change the number of reads that are associated with a gene, but not the number of identified genes. Consequently, the same number of normalized reads might be distributed over a different number of genes in two different samples, causing the detection of an equally expressed gene in both samples as differentially expressed. To prevent such an experimental artifact we randomly removed reads from the sequenced samples until every sample had the same number of read counts. Reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 with Tophat using the ensemble GTF file as a gene annotation reference and the option 'no-novel-juncs'.

Differentially expressed genes in the direct neighborhood of LQTS disease genes ('AKAP9', 'ANK2', 'CACNA1C', 'CALM1', 'CALM2', 'CAV3', 'KCNE1', 'KCNE2', 'KCNH2', 'KCNJ2', 'KCNJ5', 'KCNQ1', 'SCN4B', 'SCN5A', 'SNTA1') were identified (path length = 1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Prediction of upstream regulatory transcription factors</title><p>All differentially expressed genes were subjected to transcription factor target enrichment analysis using the Chea-background and Transfac database (downloaded from EnrichR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>]), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karakikes et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Extracellular field potential recordings (MEA assay)</title><p>For MEA recordings, we used 6well-MEA arrays, which contain six independent culture chambers, separated by a macrolon ring (60–6 well MEA 200/30 iR-Ti-rcr, Multichannel Systems, Germany). Inside each well, there is a field of nine electrodes with an internal reference electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The 6well-MEA arrays were prepared by pipetting 5 μl fibronectin solution (100 μg/mL, BD Biosciences) and incubated at 37°C for at least 1 hr. iPSC-CMs were dissociated using 0.025% trypsin for 5 min at 37°C and seeded onto prepared MEA plates using 5 μl of cell suspension in StemPro34 medium and then incubated at 37°C/5% CO2. The day after the cells were covered with 200 µL of StemPro34 media. MEA recordings were performed once the cells started to beat again (5–7 days). Field potentials of spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes were recorded using a high-resolution Micro Electrode Array (MEA) recording system (MEA60 system, Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.multichannelsystems.com">http://www.multichannelsystems.com</ext-link>) at 37°C. The baseline steady state was achieved following an equilibration period of about 15 min in vehicle medium (StemPro34 media). The tested drugs (E4031 and Sotalol, Sigma) were then added directly to each well. Dose-response experiments were performed with the following sequence: drugs were diluted in 200 μL of StemPro34 media; increasing concentrations of drug were added to a well of the MEA array in a cumulative manner; the FPD recordings were started 3 min after application of a given concentration of a drug, a timing that was found optimal to achieve steady-state changes; FPD recordings were then performed for two additional minutes. Each drug was tested in at least three different wells. Raw MEA data were acquired using QT-Screen Lite and MC-Rack softwares (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). The data were then exported on QT-Analyzer Software to analyze the field potential duration and the inter-beat interval (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). Parameters were averaged on the 2 min recordings. Inter-beat interval (in ms) was used to calculate the instantaneous beat rate. To account for the dependency between repolarization rate and the beating rate, FPD was firstly adjusted using the popular Bazett’s formula (adjustedFPD = rawFPD / RR1/2). We however found that, as expected, this formula was associated with an important over-correction thus supporting the need for an alternative adjustment formula according to Funck-Brentano et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Funck-Brentano and Jaillon, 1993</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, panel A). We thus plotted the FPD / inter-beat-interval pairs recorded at various beating rates under baseline conditions. The following equation with the same dimension as a Bazett’s formula: adjustedFPD = rawFPD / RRα, where alpha is a regression parameter, was applied to raw data in order to have a new estimate of the correction factor and results in appropriate corrections of FPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, panel B).</p><p>Cells were considered as developing arrhythmias in response to sotalol as they presented ectopic beats or spontaneous beating rates became irregular.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Patch clamp recordings</title><p>hiPSC-derived embryoid bodies were enzymatically dissociated into single cardiomyocytes and plated on matrigel-coated glass coverslips. The action potential of cardiomyocytes was assessed in the current-clamp mode using whole-cell patch-clamp technique with a HEKA EPC10 amplifier and Pulse/PulseFit software (HEKA, Germany). Pipette solution consisted of: 110 mM potassium aspartate, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ATP (disodium salt), 5 mM ATP (magnesium salt), 5 mM phosphocreatine (disodium salt) and 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.2). The external bath solution contained 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM D-glucose, 1 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). hiPSC-CMs were perfused with either control or sotalol-containing Tyrode's solution for 5 min. The whole-cell condition was then reached. A hyperpolarization current (−30 pA) was applied to silence the spontaneous automaticity. The AP recording was then performed with a train of current pulse injection (1000 pA, 5 ms) at 0.5 Hz steady pacing. The assay was performed at 37°C and finished within 30 min upon the drug perfusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Continuous data are presented as Mean ± SEM. A p-value≤0.05 was considered significant. Continuous variables were compared using non-parametric Mann-Whitney test and binary variables were tested using Chi-square or exact Fisher’s test as appropriate. For the in vivo investigations, we planned to identify 20 extreme responders to sotalol (i.e., 10 with high response defined by a deltaQTcf &gt;35 ms and 10 with low response defined by a deltaQTcf &lt;5 ms, therefore defining a minimal difference of 30 ms between groups). We then anticipated that this in vivo difference will be reproduced in vitro with a reduction by 33%. We thus determined that this sample size will give 80% power to demonstrate a difference of 20 ms between groups, with a standard error of 15 ms and an alpha-error risk of 0.05 (nQuery Advisor version 4.0).</p><p>Responses to drugs, as measured in vitro, were normalized to baseline values and expressed as changes to baseline to account for inter-line variability. All recorded data were analyzed. A two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was performed to analyze response to sotalol. Sotalol concentrations define the first factor and the sensitivity group the second factor. Individual comparisons were performed when the overall analysis was significant. Dose response curves were built to estimate EC50 using the Hill equation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Biotrial core lab.

This cardiotoxicity has led to multiple drug withdrawals as well as mandated safety testing for all new compounds seeking FDA approval. The authors have performed a clinical study in which they exposed volunteers to sotalol and measured changes in the electrocardiographic QT interval. They found that the patients exhibit a wide range of QTc responses. They then studied the extremes – high sensitivity and low sensitivity to sotalol. They generated patient specific iPS cell lines from the low and high sensitivity patients and differentiated them to cardiomyocytes, whose electrical properties were studied using a microelectrode array system. The authors found evidence that the adjusted field potential duration (aFDP), an in vitro surrogate for the QTc interval in the ECG segregated with the low and high sensitivity samples as assessed clinically. These findings support the hypothesis that iPSC-CMs can be used to report patient-specific responses to QT prolonging drugs. In addition, the authors did genomic analysis comparing high and low sensitivity samples finding some variability in SNPs. In addition, transcriptome analysis identified changes in expression levels of genes associated with cardiac repolarization comparing high and low sensitivity samples which is intriguing. The manuscript has several strengths. This is the first attempt to do such a prospective clinical trial rigorously testing iPSC-CM technology, and it addresses problem that is highly relevant for drug development, unanticipated drug-induced QT prolongation. The number of lines tested and characterized is substantial given the extent of analysis involved.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers were impressed with the number of volunteers analyzed and the depth of the analysis, they had several concerns that raised questions about the validity of the results. Most importantly, they were concerned that the measurements of QT intervals were not undertaken using the most accurate and commonly accepted methodology, based on the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. For the high sensitivity example, the before measurement excluded the U wave and the after measurement includes the U wave thus extending the measured QT interval inappropriately in the post-sotalol measurement. Although there is not uniform consensus on QT interval measurement approaches, choosing the precordial wave with the largest T wave amplitude and variably including U waves is a potential problem that shakes confidence in the subsequent study that is absolutely dependent on the accuracy of these measurements. These measurements need to be substantiated.</p><p>Secondly, there was some concern that variability in cardiac differentiation efficiency among iPS lines could have influenced results. What measurements of iPSC-CM quality and purity were made routinely given that differentiation of different iPSC lines can yield different purity of CMs? This is a critical question since techniques taking whole preparations such as gene expression studies could be substantially impacted by contaminating cell types, e.g. 10% CMs from one line vs. 90% CMs from another line would not be expected to allow easy comparison of CM gene expression. This question is particularly raised because of the remarkable variability in various cardiac ion channel genes seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, with some lines show 10-20 fold differences in expression.</p><p>Third, the authors have found no differential response in the cells to E4031 (pure hERG blocker). As the primary effect of sotalol is, as stated by the authors themselves, hERG inhibition, why did their correlation between QTc and drug effects not work for E4031 as well? This needs to be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19406.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>While the reviewers were impressed with the number of volunteers analyzed and the depth of the analysis, they had several concerns that raised questions about the validity of the results.

We apologize for this inattention. The revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> now shows typical ECG recordings in a high-sensitive and a low-sensitive subject. As detailed in the Methods section, we were indeed extremely careful in using highly accurate and standardized measurements of QT interval. A specific operating procedure was developed for ECG recordings, collections, transfer and analyses. The three consecutive complexes used for the measurements of the intervals were selected in periods with stable heart rate, stable baseline, absence of artifacts and U waves either absent or well differentiated from T-waves. Measurements were then performed using the tangent method by an investigator blindly of drug administration. Importantly, all ECG and measurements were reviewed by another cardiologist (still blinded of drug administration). As an extended example, we here provide the complete ECG recording and caliper positions (raw data, low resolution) for the high-s subject (baseline evaluation). All other ECG were recorded and measured in the same conditions (available on request).</p><p>The Methods section “ECG recording and analysis” has been updated accordingly.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19406.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19406.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19406.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19406-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>Secondly, there was some concern that variability in cardiac differentiation efficiency among iPS lines could have influenced results.

Therefore, we systematically performed cardiac troponin T (cTNT<sup>+</sup>) Flow Cytometry in all iPSC-CM lines at day 25 of differentiation. We found an average of 47.8±19.9% cTNT+ cells. Importantly, after unblinding, we did not observe any differences between iPSC lines from the high-S vs. low-S groups (49.2±24.4% vs. 46.7±17.3% respectively, p=0.42). This has been added to the Results section (subsection “Derivation and differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes”, last paragraph).</p><p>For measurements of iPSC-CMs quality, each line was tested for the presence of key CMs identity markers (sarcomeric proteins troponin T (cTnT), α-actinin and for the gap-junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43)) by immunostaining. A representative image is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The MEA recordings were performed on a layer of iPSC-CMs that had spontaneous beating activity and had measurable field potential duration (FPD) as they developed contact with the electrodes. It seems unlikely that contaminating cell types would have influenced these results. In addition, patch clamp experiments were performed at the cell level on two different couples of iPSC-CM lines from each group (low-S and high-S) and confirmed the MEA results (see previous and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, our gene expression studies were indeed performed on whole preparations because of challenges in enriching preparations in derived cardiomyocytes. For our transcriptomic study, we thus decided to use a prior knowledge based approach (on cardiac repolarization / LQTS neighborhood; based on a previously published methodology) to identify signals that are specifically coming from cardiomyocytes in these preparations. Indeed, a direct neighbor of a LQTS gene is anticipated to be cardiomyocyte specific. The expression of cardiac ion channel genes indeed appears variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) but was similar between both groups (Low-S and high-S), as also further confirmed in our transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and Results section, subsection “Dysregulation of downstream regulators of cardiac ion channels”). For all of these reasons, we think we have limited the influence of variability in cardiac differentiation efficiency among iPS lines on our results. Our multiple investigations did not indicate a systematic bias favoring one group as compared to the other.</p><p><italic>Third, the authors have found no differential response in the cells to E4031 (pure hERG blocker). As the primary effect of sotalol is, as stated by the authors themselves, hERG inhibition, why did their correlation between QTc and drug effects not work for E4031 as well? This needs to be discussed.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for this comment. As pointed out, E-4031 is an experimental drug that is a selective hERG channel blocker whereas sotalol is a clinically used drug that is a non-selective competitive β-adrenergic receptor blocker with additional Class III antiarrhythmic properties by its inhibition of potassium channels. We found that trends in response to E-4031 (both for EC50 and maximal effect) were in the same direction than with sotalol but these trends did not reach statistical significance. The two compounds differ in their pharmacological characteristics in terms of inhibition potency and target selectivity. First, as compared to sotalol, E-4031 is a more potent hERG blocker with an IC<sub>50</sub> value reported to be in the range of 10-100nM (vs. 10-50 µM for sotalol) and presents a very steep concentration-response effect (as observed in our lines, Figure 2—figure supplement 4C). It is thus possible that subtle differences in the susceptibility to develop prolonged cardiac repolarization in response to a given drug cannot be fully revealed when using a very potent inhibitor such as E-4031. Second, sotalol is thought to primarily prolong cardiac repolarization through hERG inhibition but sotalol can also affect other cardiac repolarization components. Our own transcriptomic results indicate that higher susceptibility to diLQT was associated with significant changes in expression of genes related to the regulation of ion channels homeostasis while the expression of cardiac ion channels (including hERG) was similar between both groups. A direct or indirect effect of sotalol on these components (in addition to its hERG effect) could explain the apparently discrepant results obtained with E-4031. This hypothesis would however deserve further investigations. The discussion has been corrected accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
