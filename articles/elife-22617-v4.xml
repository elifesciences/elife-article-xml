This is particularly true for candidate genes that have not previously been evaluated in an experimental model system for involvement in disease-relevant biological processes. Functional gene validation systems in model organisms are therefore essential. While a definitive assignment of disease association should be established through the analysis of mutant gene phenotypes in a mammalian model, this approach is not practical for rapid high-throughput initial screening of large numbers of candidate genes. <italic>Drosophila</italic>, by contrast, possesses the attributes of a simple animal model system that make it ideally suited for this role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chien et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model to elucidate molecular disease mechanisms is well established and amply documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cagan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Na et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diop and Bodmer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bier and Bodmer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Owusu-Ansah and Perrimon, 2014</xref>). It has been established that 75% of human disease associated genes are represented in the fly genome by functional homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reiter et al., 2001</xref>). Although it is difficult to directly link <italic>Drosophila</italic> developmental defects to patient symptoms, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system can serve as a testing platform for gene function in development, which can be used to test disease association for a large number of candidate genes identified from patient genomic sequencing.</p><p>Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects 0.8% of live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoffman, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reller et al., 2008</xref>). Genetic factors are strongly implicated in CHD pathogenesis, but the great majority of genes (accounting for an estimated 75% of cases) remain unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gelb et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> has served as a model to study genes related to CHD for over 20 years, based on the evolutionarily conserved genetic basis of heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bier and Bodmer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Olson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yi et al., 2006</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is a rhythmically beating linear tube composed of parallel rows of fused contractile cardiac cells, flanked by adherent pericardial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vogler and Bodmer, 2015</xref>). The heart functions to maintain circulation of hemolymph (insect ‘blood’) throughout the body cavity. In a typical beating cycle, hemolymph enters the posteriorly-located heart chamber in the abdomen and is pumped anteriorly through the aorta towards the head and brain. Although structurally of relatively low complexity, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human heart development are both largely directed by the same highly conserved regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vogler and Bodmer, 2015</xref>). To demonstrate that the fly is the ideal in vivo animal model for cost-effective, rapidly informative, and efficient screening of candidate disease genes, we have developed a <italic>Drosophila</italic> validation system to screen candidate genes identified in a large-scale genomic sequencing study of congenital heart disease patients.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22617.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> adult heart structure and tissue visualization, evaluation of 1X vs. 4X <italic>Hand</italic> enhancer constructs driving heart specific silencing of gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart structure and visualization. <bold>Left:</bold> the adult heart is depicted schematically in green.

Such studies will ultimately facilitate the development of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive approaches, and precision medicine interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashley, 2015</xref>) for CHD. The initial report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zaidi et al., 2013</xref>) of 249 protein-altering de novo mutations from 362 severe cases of CHD identified 223 candidate disease genes involved in diverse biochemical pathways, with 26 genes selected as particular genes-of-interest based upon bioinformatics criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zaidi et al., 2013</xref>). We used <italic>Drosophila</italic> developmental genetics to quantitatively evaluate the phenotypes associated with heart-specific RNAi mediated gene silencing of fly homologs of mutated candidate disease genes. 174 genes (78%) had clear fly homologs, consistent with the published estimate of 75% conservation of disease gene homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reiter et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, the ‘top 26’ genes identified by the PCGC study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zaidi et al., 2013</xref>) all have conserved <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs. Some of these genes were previously identified as having roles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart development, in the context of a global in vivo RNAi screen for candidate fly heart genes.

We employed a quantitative phenotypic screening protocol that evaluated developmental lethality (pre-adult mortality), heart structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; including morphology, cardiac myofibrillar density, cardiac collagen deposition, and cardioblast cell number) and adult longevity. We found that 52% of the tested fly homologs are required for cardiac development and function in flies. We also developed a gene replacement testing strategy involving simultaneous heart-specific silencing of an endogenous fly gene homolog and expression of either wild type or patient-derived mutant alleles of the candidate human disease gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To achieve a highly efficient heart-specific gene knock down, we generated a strong cardiac cell Gal4 driver featuring 4 tandem repeats of the <italic>Drosophila Hand</italic> gene cardiac enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han and Olson, 2005</xref>). We compared the levels of Gal4 RNA in heart tissues of transgenic flies carrying the new 4XHand-Gal4 driver construct versus flies carrying the original, established Hand-Gal4 driver (featuring a single <italic>Hand</italic> enhancer element). As anticipated, 4XHand promoted significantly higher heart cell expression of Gal4 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then compared the Hand-Gal4 and 4XHand-Gal4 drivers together with UAS-Gene-IR RNAi based silencing constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ni et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2011</xref>) for gene knock down efficiency when used to silence expression (i.e. lower heart cell RNA levels) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes <italic>CG8184</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and <italic>Lid</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with the higher Gal4 expression, 4XHand was significantly more effective at silencing target gene expression through RNAi. To further confirm the utility of 4XHand-Gal4 for screening purposes, we comparatively evaluated the Hand-Gal4 and 4XHand-Gal4 constructs driving heart-specific expression of UAS-RNAi transgenes targeting eight <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes for developmental lethal (death at pre-adult stage) effects. The <italic>Hand</italic> enhancer is active during development from embryonic stages, and we reasoned that <italic>Hand</italic> enhancer-driven silencing of genes known to be essential for heart development would cause developmental lethality. For this assay, male and female flies of the appropriate genotypes were crossed to produce progeny carrying the indicated UAS-gene silencing (i.e. RNAi) interfering RNA (IR) construct, the expression of which was driven by Hand-Gal4 or 4XHand-Gal4. Progeny embryos were collected and allowed to develop under standard conditions. The results were quantitatively expressed as a Mortality Index (MI), the percentage of flies that died before adult emergence from the pupa stage. We found that for all eight tested genes, significant developmental lethal effects of heart-specific gene silencing were only observed in flies carrying a 4XHand-Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We combined the new 4XHand-Gal4 driver with available fly lines carrying UAS-Gene-IR RNAi based silencing constructs to evaluate for heart specific essential function (i.e. MI) the homologs of all genes from the PCGC study for which multiple independent UAS-RNAi lines are available (134 total genes, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We extracted the data for the PCGC top 26 genes, identified as most-promising candidate disease genes on the basis of multiple bioinformatics-based criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We reasoned that if these criteria alone were truly informative, the majority of these genes would yield higher MI scores, overall, than observed among all 134 tested genes representing the PCGC total list. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> we observed MI values ranging across a spectrum spanning Normal (≤6%, equivalent to nonbiased control genes), Low (7–30%), Medium (31–60%), to High (61–100%). Importantly, we found that the distribution of MI values across all ranges was not significantly different for the top 26 genes compared to the entire cohort of 134 candidate genes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, selection of candidate CHD genes on the basis of bioinformatics criteria alone did not enrich for genes inducing more severe developmental mortality phenotypes (indicative of more genes with essential roles in either heart development, tissue maintenance, or function). This observation emphasizes the importance of screening and selecting most-promising candidate genes on the basis of functional assays. To determine if the set of 134 candidate genes in itself can be demonstrated to be enriched for heart-essential genes, we examined previously obtained data from a screen of approximately 800 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes silenced using the 4XHand-Gal4; UAS-RNAi system. These genes were randomly chosen to screen for effects on pericardial nephrocyte function (cardioblast lineage cells in which the <italic>Hand</italic> enhancer is active), so they are unbiased with respect to essential heart roles. We found that only 6% of these genes showed <italic>any level</italic> of developmental lethality when silenced (i.e. 94% normal). Thus, the PCGC genomic association study, though not gene selection based upon bioinformatics criteria, did enrich significantly for heart-essential genes as assayed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. That such a small number of unbiased genes conferred a phenotype of silencing-induced developmental lethality also suggests that overexpression of 4xHand-Gal4 itself did not sensitize flies to RNAi mediated knockdown effects.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22617.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Top 26 candidate CHD genes and developmental lethality induced by heart specific RNAi-based silencing of <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene homologs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 26 de novo mutated genes from CHD study participants selected as being of particular interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zaidi et al., 2013</xref>) based upon sequence quality, mutation type, the expression level of the mouse homolog during heart development on embryonic day 14.5, and previously reported involvement in CHD or heart development.

The high-throughput testing platform described here can extend gene association data to quantitative, in vivo morphological and functional criteria. On the basis of this screening, the most promising genes can justifiably be advanced to more costly, time consuming, and technically challenging validation platforms required to definitively identify and confirm disease-causing gene variants. Such advanced testing, we presume, will encompass gene function analysis in a mammalian model system.</p><p>The advantages of functional screening using RNAi-based silencing lines are to some extent offset by certain limitations. From the outset, of human disease genes, approximately 25% are not represented by <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs. False negatives may occur if RNAi expression does not sufficiently reduce mRNA levels. However, we tested a number of RNAi lines by qRT-PCR and found no examples of ineffective gene silencing. False negatives may also occur when missense mutations produce gain-of-function (GOF) alleles, and we cannot accurately predict the degree to which this could confound our analysis. This problem, we note, is mitigated to a degree by the fact that genes altered by GOF mutations would in many instances <italic>normally</italic> encode proteins with cardiac cell functions, and thus yield silencing induced phenotypes in our functional screening system. False positives can arise from so-called ‘off target’ effects of a given RNAi targeting construct. We controlled against misleading results from both RNAi silencing inefficiency and off target effects by employing the latest-generation available RNAi lines, and testing multiple such lines for each of the top 26 candidate genes. This precaution against false negative and false positive results further limited the total number of candidate genes we could screen to 134 (60% of the CHD candidate genes published by the PCGC). Nevertheless, our in vivo screening system rapidly and efficiently confirmed roles in heart development, tissue maintenance, or cardiac function for 72 candidate genes.</p><p>Phenotypic analysis based on gene silencing, while effective for high throughput screening, represents a first step in validation and characterization of candidate mutations. We also demonstrated an initial ‘gene replacement’ strategy that takes further advantage of the available resources and sophisticated genetics of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system to quantitatively characterize the phenotype induced by expression of a specific patient-derived mutant allele. This approach may prove highly valuable as a testing platform for precision medicine based therapeutic drugs.

Values are derived from three technical replicates of qRT-PCR experiments from pooled RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fly imaging</title><p>Fly preparation and imaging are described in more detail at Bio-protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Larvae and adult flies were dissected and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Alexa Fluor 555 Phalloidin was obtained from Thermo Fisher. Mouse anti-Pericardin antibody (EC11) was used at 1:500 dilutions, followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Lab). Confocal imaging was performed with a Zeiss ApoTome.2 microscope using a 20× Plan-Apochromat 0.8 N.A. air objective. For quantitative comparisons of intensities, common settings were chosen to avoid oversaturation. ImageJ Software Version 1.49 was used for image processing. For quantitative comparisons of cardiac myofibrillar density, cardioblast cell numbers, and Pericardin deposition we analyzed six to ten control flies and six to ten flies of each experimental genotype. These features were quantitatively assessed in the same area of the same segment in each fly. Cardiac myofiber levels of Z-stack projections were carefully selected for analysis, avoiding the ventral muscle layer underlying the heart tube. Sample size determinations were based upon extensive previous experience in analyzing fly heart morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Survival assay</title><p>Within 24 hr of egg laying <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae were transferred from 25°C to 29°C to boost UAS-transgene expression. Adult male flies were maintained at 29°C in groups of 15 or fewer; 50 flies in total were assayed per genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical tests were performed using PAST.exe software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/index.html">http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/index.html</ext-link>) unless otherwise noted. Sample errors are given as standard error of the mean (s.e.m). Data were first tested for normality by using the Shapiro-Wilk test (α = 0.05). Normally distributed data were analyzed either by Student's <italic>t</italic>-test (two groups) and Bonferroni comparison to adjust p value or by a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey-Kramer post-test for comparing multiple groups. Non-normal distributed data were analyzed by either a Mann-Whitney test (two groups) and Bonferroni comparison to adjust the p value or a Kruskal-Wallis H-test followed by a Dunn's test for comparisons between multiple groups. Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University and the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center for providing the fly stocks.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;High throughput in vivo functional validation of candidate congenital heart disease genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a significant paper which demonstrates the effectiveness of using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a rapid screening tool for assessing the possible functional significance of genes identified in genomic screens, e.g. screens for de novo variants associated with congenital heart disease as in Zaidi et al. 2013. Genome-wide RNAi screens have been used previously to identify pathways important for cardiovascular development and cardiac disease in humans (e.g. Kim et al., 2010; Neely et al., 2010; van der Harst et al. 2016), so the approach itself is not particularly novel. In the design used here two RNAis for candidate CHD genes are used to knock down the <italic>Dros</italic> homologues of disease genes in Hand-positive cardioblasts using for the first time a multimerized (4x) Hand enhancer driving Gal4, a design that likely leads to high efficiency knockdown compared to previous approaches. A number of cardiac-related phenotypes were scored, including mortality, adult longevity, muscle fibre density, cardioblast numbers, collagen deposition, and heart tube function. The authors perform screens of the top 26 genes identified by Zaidi et al. including the genes involved in chromatin modification, as well as the larger set of candidate genes for which there were <italic>Dros</italic> homologues. They found a high degree of mortality associated with both sets. Interestingly, knockdown of the top 26 did not lead to more severe mortality than the larger set, potentially highlighting the limitations of bioinformatics alone in identifying the most significant players in human disease and the need to combine with functional analysis. Knockdown of a number of chromatin modifying genes were characterised in more detail. The authors conclude from these results that histone methylation but not demethylation, is essential for heart development in flies. Rescue of the <italic>Dros</italic> knockdown of WDR5 with the human WT gene but not the same gene carrying the candidate disease variant was also presented in a proof-of-principal study.</p><p>The work is timely and elegant. Clearly knocking down of genes in fly development as a surrogate for testing the relevance of single amino acid variants present in patients with human disease has its limitations and some of these are discussed, but this is clearly a powerful system for focusing attention on variants with significant affects in this assay for follow up functional studies in mammalian cells or animal models.</p><p>A number of issues were identified by the reviewers and those requiring attention are listed below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Could over-expression of 4xHand-Gal4 sensitize flies to RNAi knockdown phenotypes? How would this be tested?</p><p>2) We disagree that gain of function variants will be rare. New insights into this for transcription factors has come to light – see for example Luna-Zurita et al. Cell 2016 and Bouveret et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2015 – even apparently null proteins can have gain of function effects. There are in fact a number of ways through which interruption of conserved domains in multidomain proteins may have gain of function effects. I think this should be considered more carefully in the Discussion in the context of limitations of the approach.</p><p>3) One issue that should be addressed is the rationale for the choice of genes for the various analyses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> tests the expression levels of six genes when knocked down, but the choice of these genes, and why all 26 were not tested, is not clear. In fact there are certain biases in this study in the sense that one might expect severe defects in any cell type expressing loss or gain of function alleles for chromatin modifying genes, given their global function in epigenetic regulation.

How would this be tested?</italic> </p><p>This is formally possible but we do not perceive an obvious mechanism for how or why this might occur, as we understand the question, across the fly genome. As a result we did not directly test this possibility. However, the fact that our unbiased screen (using 4xHand-Gal4) of approximately 800 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes yielded only 6% developmental lethals strongly suggests that 4xHand-Gal4 expression did not sensitize flies to knockdown phenotypes. Text addressing this point has now been added to Results section.</p><p><italic>2) We disagree that gain of function variants will be rare. New insights into this for transcription factors has come to light – see for example Luna-Zurita et al. Cell 2016 and Bouveret et al. eLife 2015 – even apparently null proteins can have gain of function effects. There are in fact a number of ways through which interruption of conserved domains in multidomain proteins may have gain of function effects. I think this should be considered more carefully in the Discussion in the context of limitations of the approach.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for raising this point and directing our attention to these insightful articles. In response, we have addressed this point more carefully in the Discussion in the context of limitations of our approach.</p><p><italic>3) One issue that should be addressed is the rationale for the choice of genes for the various analyses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> tests the expression levels of six genes when knocked down, but the choice of these genes, and why all 26 were not tested, is not clear. In fact there are certain biases in this study in the sense that one might expect severe defects in any cell type expressing loss or gain of function alleles for chromatin modifying genes, given their global function in epigenetic regulation. We accept that these examples serve to highlight the phenotyping pathway used and the range of defects that can be generated. However, the paper would be strengthened by including some examples of candidates for the Zaidi study where there is mortality or a strong heart phenotype when the gene is knocked down that reveals its totally unknown functions in heart development and cellular function.</italic> </p><p>We have now added text to the Results explaining our selection of the six genes tested in the experiments illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We did not test all 26 genes by quantitative PCR because we tested multiple RNAi lines for all of them, and in each case observed consistent phenotype outcomes. We have also added text to emphasize why we chose to focus more detailed analysis on the phenotypic consequences of knocking down genes involved in chromatin modification pathways. We agree with the reviewer that one might expect to see severe defects from loss of function of chromatin modifying genes in any cell type, but in fact we observed a normal heart phenotype upon silencing of Lid, one of the reasons for examining this gene by qRT-PCR analysis. To address the reviewer’s comment that the paper would be strengthened by revealing heretofore unknown functions of candidate genes, we respectfully submit that ours is a functional validation study, rather than a novel gene identification study (as clearly indicated by the title, &quot;High throughput in vivo functional validation of candidate congenital heart disease genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot;). Therefore, we argue that in this sense the reviewer’s suggestion is outside the scope of our current submission.</p><p><italic>4) Overall, the description of Methods is seriously lacking in detail.

The RNAi target sequence silencing the endogenous <italic>Drosophila</italic> WDS gene is not expected to silence WDR5, since there is over one third of the targeting sequence are mismatch when compared to the human WDR5 sequence. In addition, phenotypic rescue effects from human cDNA expression indicated that even if silencing of human genes did occur at very low level it did not prevent our analysis, since it will have same effects to both the wild type and the mutant allele of human WDR5. Insertional effects is no longer an issue since both the wild type and the mutant allele of human WDR5 were indeed inserted to the same chromosome location and should have the same level of expression.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;High throughput</italic> in vivo functional validation of candidate congenital heart disease genes in Drosophila&quot; for further consideration at eLife.
