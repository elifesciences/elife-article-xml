To better understand how cells respond to dynamically interacting factors, we quantified the effects of dual fluctuations of osmotic stress and glucose deprivation on yeast cells using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy. Strikingly, we observed that cell proliferation, survival, and signaling depend on the phasing of the two periodic stresses. Cells divided faster, survived longer, and showed decreased transcriptional response when fluctuations of hyperosmotic stress and glucose deprivation occurred in phase than when the two stresses occurred alternatively. Therefore, glucose availability regulates yeast responses to dynamic osmotic stress, showcasing the key role of metabolic fluctuations in cellular responses to dynamic stress. We also found that mutants with impaired osmotic stress response were better adapted to alternating stresses than wild-type cells, showing that genetic mechanisms of adaptation to a persistent stress factor can be detrimental under dynamically interacting conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HOG pathway</kwd><kwd>osmotic stress</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>microfluidics</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>724813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hersen</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE12-0025-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hersen</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hersen</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hersen</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microfluidic methods are used to quantitatively probe single yeast cells' response to either simultaneous or sequential stresses, revealing the dynamic interplay between two antagonistic inputs, osmotic stress and glucose starvation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells have evolved to survive in a broad range of environmental conditions with multiple factors (e.g. temperature, nutrients, light, humidity, pathogens, etc.) varying in space and time. They can monitor their environment and constantly adapt their physiology to stress caused by environmental fluctuations. Experiments in which cells are dynamically probed with time-varying stress signals are required to obtain a quantitative understanding of how signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks confer cellular adaptability to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paliwal et al., 2008</xref>). The development of microfluidics systems to study the frequency responses of cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett and Hasty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaiser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hersen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mettetal et al., 2008</xref>) (e.g. signaling pathways, gene regulatory networks) has been instrumental in the adoption of the concepts of dynamic systems and information processing in biology. More recent methodological developments in the field of control theory have enabled time-varying perturbations to be used to control cellular gene expression or signaling pathways via computer-based external feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrigan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Milias-Argeitis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lugagne et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uhlendorf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rullan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banderas et al., 2020</xref>). In short, methods are now mature to study cells as dynamical systems.</p><p>Most studies of cellular stress responses have focused on a single environmental stress in an otherwise maintained environment. However, how cells respond to stress often depends on the interaction between several environmental factors. For instance, changing the metabolic environment (e.g. carbon source type and concentration) can profoundly affect cell physiology (e.g. respiration and fermentation in yeast) and alter stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babazadeh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rodaki et al., 2009</xref>). More generally, resource allocation (i.e. how cellular resources are shared between several cellular functions) is an important fundamental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weiße et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Metzl-Raz et al., 2017</xref>) (e.g. understanding growth laws) and applied topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ceroni et al., 2018</xref>) (e.g. design of robust synthetic gene circuits and bioproduction). Specifically, cells face decision-making problems when exposed to stress and to variation in their metabolic environment. Routing resources toward stress response mechanisms may deprive other important processes (e.g. cellular maintenance, proliferation) and decrease competitive fitness in an environment periodically scarce of metabolic resources. Conversely, routing resources toward cell proliferation may reduce survival in stressful conditions and therefore also reduce fitness. The trade-off between proliferation and stress responses can be an important determinant of cell fitness in a dynamic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weiße et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Metzl-Raz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Granados et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reimers et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, the extent to which what is known in rich, constant metabolic conditions remains valid under low or fluctuating nutrient availability remains an open question. Here, we address this broad question by studying the synergistic and antagonistic effects of time-varying osmotic stress and glucose deprivation on the growth of budding yeast cells.</p><p>The adaptation to hyperosmotic stress in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> involves an adaptive pathway—the HOG pathway—that has been extensively described at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Nadal and Posas, 2022</xref>) as well as biophysical and integrative levels through mathematical and computational models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klipp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muzzey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petelenz-Kurdziel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharifian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krantz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaber et al., 2012</xref>). Quantitative descriptions of the dynamics of osmotic stress responses were achieved using microfluidics to generate time-varying perturbation of the osmolarity of the environment while observing signaling activity and the transcriptional responses of key players in the HOG pathway at the single-cell resolution via time-lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hersen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mettetal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitchell et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>When external osmolarity increases, accumulation of intracellular glycerol is required to restore the cellular osmotic balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hohmann, 2002</xref>). At the molecular level, osmotic stress signaling is orchestrated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which culminates in double phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of the MAPK protein Hog1p and differential regulation of hundreds of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saito and Posas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>). In particular, GPD1 (NAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), a key enzyme involved in the production of glycerol from glucose, is upregulated after hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Phosphorylated Hog1p also triggers several processes in the cytoplasm that are essential for osmoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muzzey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petelenz-Kurdziel et al., 2013</xref>), including cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Escoté et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clotet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duch et al., 2013</xref>). Dynamically, the HOG pathway behaves as a low-pass filter that drives (perfect) adaptation through at least two layers of feedback loops that allow for deactivation of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muzzey et al., 2009</xref>) (transcriptionally and within the cytoplasm). Notably, the HOG pathway can be hyper-activated when stimulated at high frequencies, which drastically slows down the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitchell et al., 2015</xref>). Although very informative—and an excellent example of how biological and physical concepts can be combined to obtain a comprehensive description of gene regulatory network dynamics—these studies were carried out in a glucose-rich environment, which insulates metabolic needs from osmotic stress adaptation requirements. Glucose is not only needed for growth, but also for production of glycerol and the transcriptional feedback loop that deactivates the HOG pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babazadeh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muzzey et al., 2009</xref>); thus, cells may employ a decision mechanism to share glucose internally between these processes, particularly when glucose is scarce, or its availability fluctuates. More generally, despite the known importance of the metabolic state in cellular adaptation to stress, the systemic interactions between cellular maintenance, growth, and stress responses remain unexplored.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Live imaging of yeast cells grown in periodically fluctuating environments.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview of the hyperosmotic stress response in yeast.

To determine how resource allocation impacted cell growth, we compared two regimes of dual fluctuations that differed in the phasing of hyperosmotic stress and glucose deprivation. We showed that cell division rates, death rates, and biological responses at the signaling and transcription levels are different when cells are exposed simultaneously (in-phase stresses [IPS]) or alternatively (alternating stresses [AS]) to glucose deprivation and hyperosmotic stress. Therefore, yeast responses to osmotic stress are regulated by the presence of external glucose, indicating that the metabolic environment is a key factor when quantitatively assessing stress response dynamics. More globally, our study suggests that applying dual periodic perturbations is a powerful method to probe cellular dynamics at the system level and, more specifically, to clarify the role of the metabolic environment in the dynamics of cellular decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A microfluidic system to study the interaction between two environmental dynamics</title><p>We used a custom microfluidic device to monitor the growth of yeast cells exposed to periodic environmental fluctuations for up to 24 hr.

To answer this question, we quantified the division rate of cells exposed to periodic transitions between a medium without carbon source and the same medium complemented with either 0.1% or 2% glucose at periods ranging from 12 to 480 min. In contrast to the negative effect of osmotic stress frequency, we observed a positive relationship between the frequency of glucose availability and division rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>): cells divided faster when glucose availability fluctuated rapidly (0.0051 division/min at a fluctuation period <italic>T</italic>=12 min, corresponding to a doubling time of 136 min) than slowly (0.0027 division/min at a fluctuation period <italic>T</italic>=192 min, corresponding to a doubling time of 257 min). However, this behavior was only observed in 2% glucose: the <italic>frequency</italic> of glucose availability did not significantly impact the division rate in 0.1% glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Under periodic fluctuations of 2% glucose, the division rate was lower during half-periods without glucose than during half-periods with glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), as expected. However, this difference depended on the frequency of glucose fluctuations: the average division rate during half-periods without glucose was higher at high frequency (small period) than at low frequency (large period) of fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, the effect of the <italic>frequency</italic> of glucose availability on the division rate in 2% glucose is likely due to a delay between glucose removal and growth arrest: cell proliferation never stops when the frequency of glucose depletion is too fast.</p><p>Overall, we observed two opposing patterns of cell proliferation when we varied the temporal dynamics of the metabolic environment and external osmolarity. The division rates were highest for low-frequency sorbitol fluctuations (0.0064 division/min at a fluctuation period <italic>T</italic>=384 min) and high-frequency 2% glucose fluctuations (0.0051 division/min at a fluctuation period <italic>T</italic>=12 min); both of these values are close to the division rate in constant 2% glucose (0.0066 division/min). Therefore, with respect to their division rate, cells behave as a low-pass filter for osmotic stress but as a high-pass filter for glucose fluctuations. Moreover, the division rate is similar when the frequencies of glucose availability and sorbitol exposure are both equal to 0.039 min<sup>–1</sup> (intersection of the two curves on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), corresponding to a period of 26 min and a division rate of 0.004 division/min. Since current models of the hyperosmotic stress response do not consider interactions with glucose metabolism, whether simultaneous fluctuations of glucose availability and osmotic stress affect cell growth additively or synergistically remains an open question. More generally, characterizing how cells respond to the dynamic phasing of two environmental components is fundamental for understanding how a living system can adapt to complex environmental changes. For these reasons, we next used our microfluidic system to quantify the division rate of cells exposed to <italic>dual</italic> periodic fluctuations of glucose availability and osmotic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Division rate depends on the phasing of the two stresses</title><p>To determine whether glucose availability during hyperosmotic stress impacted cell growth in dynamic conditions, we compared cell division rates under two regimes of dual periodic fluctuations that only differed in the phasing of glucose and sorbitol fluctuations. In the ‘IPS’ regime, glucose depletion and 1 M sorbitol stresses were applied simultaneously for half a period followed by the addition of 2% (or 0.1%) glucose and the removal of sorbitol for the other half of each period of fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In the ‘AS’ regime, glucose depletion and 1 M sorbitol were applied alternatively for half a period each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). We first subjected cells to dual fluctuations at a period of 24 min with 2% glucose, corresponding approximately to the period at which the division rate was the same when we only varied glucose availability <italic>or</italic> osmolarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Under both IPS and AS conditions, the division rate was more than twofold lower than under periodic fluctuations of only glucose or sorbitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), showing that dual environmental fluctuations have a non-additive, synergistic impact on cell growth. Strikingly, cells divided about twice as fast under IPS condition (1.67×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min, corresponding to an average doubling time of 415 min) than under AS condition (9.4×10<sup>–4</sup> division/min, corresponding to an average doubling time of 737 min) when the fluctuation period was 24 min (<italic>t</italic>-test, p=1.35 × 10<sup>–5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>) or 96 min (2.98×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min in IPS vs 1.83×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min in AS; p=4.10 × 10<sup>–5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). A similar pattern of faster growth was observed under IPS and AS conditions when we used 0.1% glucose instead of 2% glucose, for both a fluctuation period of 24 min (0.84×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min under IPS vs 0.54×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min under AS; <italic>t</italic>-test, p=8.03 × 10<sup>–5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and 96 min (2.24×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min under IPS vs 1.17×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min under AS; <italic>t</italic>-test, p=6.80 × 10<sup>–3</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Cells also displayed strikingly different temporal dynamics of division rates under IPS and AS conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). Under IPS condition, the division rate fluctuated largely over time: after the transition to 2% glucose, the division rate quickly increased to reach a plateau (4.86×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min on average during the half-period with 2% glucose); after the transition to 1 M sorbitol in the absence of glucose, cell division was greatly slowed down (1.34×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min during the half-period without glucose). In contrast, the division rate remained much more constant over time under AS condition: the average division rate was 1.69×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min during the half-period with 2% glucose and 1 M sorbitol and 1.89×10<sup>–3</sup> division/min during the half-period without glucose and sorbitol. Therefore, cells appear to use glucose more efficiently for growth under IPS than AS conditions. Collectively, these results further demonstrate that the timing of both glucose availability and osmotic stress matters: cells grow more slowly when facing periodic alternation of the two stresses (AS) than when facing periodic co-occurrence of these stresses (IPS).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cell division rate depends on the phasing of hyperosmotic stress and glucose availability.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Division rates measured in four fluctuating conditions with a period of 24 min and a glucose concentration of 2% (20 g/L).

Glucose starvation was previously shown to induce fast inhibition of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jona et al., 2000</xref>) and translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>), leading to cell growth reduction. This phenomenon may explain the slower division rate observed in AS condition than in IPS condition, because rapid arrest of the cell cycle after glucose starvation could have smaller impact on global division rate when occurring concurrently (IPS) rather than alternatively (AS) with hyperosmotic stress that also leads to fast growth reduction. We tested this hypothesis by growing wild-type cells under IPS and AS conditions with galactose instead of glucose as a carbon source, because transcriptional and translational inhibition was not observed after galactose starvation in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jona et al., 2000</xref>). We observed a significant reduction of division rate under AS condition relative to IPS condition when using galactose as a carbon source, similar to what we observed in glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, fast inhibition of transcription and translation occurring after glucose starvation but not after galactose starvation does not contribute significantly to the slower growth in AS condition.</p><p>Yeast cells accumulate carbohydrate reserves such as glycogen to cope with nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">François and Parrou, 2001</xref>), and this reserve of glycogen can be mobilized during hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonny et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parrou et al., 1997</xref>). Glycogen may accumulate less under AS condition because glucose is only available during hyperosmotic stress, leading to slower growth. To test the hypothesis that glycogen storage may contribute to the difference of division rates observed between AS and IPS conditions, we quantified the division rates of <italic>glc3Δ</italic> mutant cells with impaired glycogen synthesis in these two conditions. Once again, we observed a significantly lower division rate of <italic>glc3Δ</italic> cells in AS condition relative to IPS condition similar to what was observed in wild-type cells, suggesting that glycogen storage was not significantly contributing to this difference.</p><p>Third, we tested the impact of point mutations in the cyclin inhibitor Sic1p on division rates in AS and IPS conditions. In response to hyperosmotic shock, residue 173 of Sic1p is phosphorylated by Hog1p, resulting in Sic1p stabilization and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Escoté et al., 2004</xref>). Since hyperosmotic stress and glucose starvation both lead to cell growth arrest, cell division is expected to halt twice more frequently when hyperosmotic stress and glucose starvation are applied alternatively than when they are applied simultaneously, which could lead to the difference of division rates observed between AS and IPS conditions in a way that depends on Sic1p regulation. However, <italic>sic1(T173A</italic>) mutant cells (unphosphorylatable Sic1p) and <italic>sic1(T172E</italic>) mutant cells (constitutive Sic1p stabilization) showed a similar decrease of division rate in AS condition relative to IPS condition as observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The mechanism(s) responsible for the lower division rate in AS condition relative to IPS condition therefore remain(s) elusive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cell death depends on the dynamics of the two stresses</title><p>We noticed a high proportion of wild-type cells dying under AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>): some cells suddenly burst with their nucleus staying in the growth chamber, others became opaque and stopped growing with their nucleus remaining completely still (the nucleus of living cells wobbled over time). These death events mostly occurred within minutes of the transition from medium containing 2% glucose and 1 M sorbitol to medium without glucose and sorbitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>), suggesting cell lysis occurred due to hypo-osmotic shock following removal of 1 M sorbitol. Cell death was less frequent under IPS than AS conditions for the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>), even though the frequency of hypo-osmotic shock was the same in the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>). We reasoned this could be due to lower intracellular accumulation of glycerol under IPS, when hyperosmotic stress is applied in the absence of glucose. Under AS, the presence of glucose during hyperosmotic stress could lead to faster intracellular accumulation of glycerol, resulting in stronger hypo-osmotic shock and cell lysis when the sorbitol concentration suddenly drops. Several pieces of evidence support this hypothesis. First, the rate of cell death should be reduced in mutants with lower glycerol synthesis. Indeed, we observed significantly lower rates of cell death for all mutants tested (<italic>ste11Δ</italic>, <italic>hog1Δ</italic>, <italic>pbs2Δ</italic>, <italic>gpd1Δ</italic>, <italic>gpd2Δ</italic> and <italic>gpd1Δ; gpd2Δ</italic>) relative to the wild-type strain under AS, but not under IPS for which glycerol synthesis is frustrated even in wild-type cells due to the absence of glucose during hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). In particular, the death rate decreased from 2.4×10<sup>–3</sup> min<sup>–1</sup> for wild-type to 5.2×10<sup>–5</sup>, 3.4×10<sup>–4</sup>, and 3.5×10<sup>–4</sup> min<sup>–1</sup>, respectively, for the <italic>hog1Δ</italic>, <italic>pbs2Δ,</italic> and <italic>gpd1Δ; gpd2Δ</italic> mutants under AS when the fluctuation period was 24 min. A similar pattern was observed for the <italic>pbs2Δ</italic> mutant when the fluctuation period was 96 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), although the reduction in the death rate was less pronounced than for the period of 24 min. Conversely, we observed a higher death rate for the <italic>fps1Δ</italic> mutant (3.5×10<sup>–3</sup> min<sup>–1</sup>) under AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), which is consistent with higher intracellular accumulation of glycerol in this mutant lacking the Fps1 aquaglyceroporin channel involved in glycerol export. Over a 10 hr AS experiment with a fluctuation period of 24 min, the death rate was lowest at the beginning of the experiment and was maximal during the last 5 hr of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e</xref>). However, when the AS fluctuation period was 96 min, the maximum death rate occurred earlier (and stopped increasing after the second period) and the dynamics of cell death remained constant over multiple periods of osmotic fluctuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Again, these observations are consistent with cell death being due to glycerol accumulation, since it takes time for cells to accumulate an amount of glycerol sufficient to cause bursting after hypo-osmotic shock.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>HOG pathway mutants exhibit a lower death rate and an increased population growth rate under in-phase stresses (IPS).</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Images of wild-type (<bold>a</bold>) and <italic>pbs2Δ</italic> mutant (<bold>b</bold>) cells before (<italic>t</italic>=0 min) and after (<italic>t</italic>=600 min) growth in IPS (left) and alternating stress (AS) (right) conditions.

Since HOG pathway mutants exhibited different cell division and death rates compared to the wild-type genotype under AS, we calculated the population growth rate (division rate minus death rate) as a fitness estimate. Under IPS, the population growth rates of most mutant strains and of the wild-type strain were not significantly different; the only exception being the slightly lower growth rate of the <italic>ste11Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). However, under AS with a fluctuation period of 24 min, several mutants had higher population growth rates than the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). In fact, the population growth rate was negative for the wild-type strain (–1.4×10<sup>–3</sup> min<sup>–1</sup>) as cells died faster than they divided and positive for the <italic>hog1Δ</italic> mutant (1.0×10<sup>–3</sup> min<sup>–1</sup>) and <italic>pbs2Δ</italic> mutant (5.5×10<sup>–4</sup> min<sup>–1</sup>). These differences are clear in the microscopy images, as the population of wild-type cells visually shrank over time under AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), while the population of <italic>pbs2Δ</italic> cells clearly expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Thus, the <italic>hog1Δ</italic> and <italic>pbs2Δ</italic> genotypes are better adapted and would quickly outcompete wild-type cells under these dynamic conditions. However, this is only true when the frequency of environmental fluctuations is sufficiently high, since we did not observe significant differences in the population growth rate between the wild-type and <italic>pbs2Δ</italic> mutant under AS when the fluctuation period was 96 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). We conclude that mutants that were first characterized by an inability to adapt to prolonged hyperosmotic stress can be well adapted when hyperosmotic stress rapidly fluctuates in antiphase with glucose availability. Therefore, the genetic mechanisms that contribute to adaptation under steady-state conditions could be detrimental under dynamic conditions, highlighting the importance of investigating how organisms adapt to dynamically changing environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Osmoregulation is impaired under IPS but not under AS</title><p>The ability of cells to sense environmental fluctuations and to execute an adaptive response has been mainly studied using fluctuations of one stress cue at a time. How cells sense and respond to dual fluctuations of two interacting stresses remains a fundamental open question to understand how cells cope with complex environmental dynamics. Our findings suggest that the cell response to dual stress fluctuations can be very different depending on the phasing of the two stresses. Indeed, yeast cells appear to accumulate more glycerol under AS than under IPS. This could be either because of an impaired ability of cells to sense hyperosmotic shocks in absence of glucose or because of an impaired capacity to respond to hyperosmotic shocks in absence of glucose. Glycerol synthesis is regulated by the HOG pathway; thus, we investigated whether the activity of this pathway differed under IPS and AS conditions.</p><p>In the presence of glucose, activation of the HOG pathway in response to hyperosmotic shock triggers phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Hog1p, which regulates transcription of multiple genes. A negative feedback loop dephosphorylates Hog1p, which leaves the nucleus in less than 15 min even if hyperosmotic stress is maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hersen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muzzey et al., 2009</xref>). To track HOG pathway activity, we quantified the nuclear enrichment of Hog1p over time by monitoring the subcellular location of Hog1 protein fused to a fluorescent marker (Hog1-GFP) in cells that also expressed the nuclear marker Htb2-mCherry. We did not detect any enrichment of Hog1-GFP in nuclei when only glucose fluctuated over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>), suggesting cells did not perceive glucose fluctuations as a significant osmotic cue. Although previous studies observed small transient (&lt;2 min) peaks of Hog1-GFP nuclear localization after glucose was added back to the medium following glucose depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharifian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piao et al., 2012</xref>), the temporal resolution in our experiments (one image every 6 min) may have been too low to detect these peaks.</p><p>In contrast, enrichment of Hog1-GFP fluorescence in nuclei was observed within minutes after exposure to 1 M sorbitol under both AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) and IPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Therefore, cells can sense hyperosmotic shock, activate the HOG MAPK cascade, and phosphorylate Hog1 MAP kinase both in the presence (AS) and absence (IPS) of glucose. However, the adaptation dynamics of Hog1p (i.e. its exit from the nucleus) were remarkably different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–c</xref>): under AS, nuclear enrichment of Hog1-GFP peaked at 6 min following hyperosmotic shock and then quickly decayed and became undetectable after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and c</xref>)—essentially the same dynamics observed under periodic fluctuations of osmotic stress without glucose fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Nuclear enrichment of Hog1-GFP reached basal levels about 2 hr after the onset of hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The delayed exit of Hog1-GFP out of the nucleus under IPS suggests that the activity of the feedback loop regulating Hog1p dephosphorylation is impaired in the absence of glucose. We hypothesized that delayed nuclear export of Hog1-GFP under IPS could be due to impaired osmoregulation. In support of this hypothesis, we observed no recovery of cell size during hyperosmotic stress under IPS conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Cells only returned to their initial size when sorbitol was removed and glucose was added back to the medium, which also corresponded to the moment when Hog1-GFP returned to the cytosol. In contrast, under AS, both the recovery of cell size and nuclear export of Hog1-GFP occurred while cells were still exposed to hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), showing that osmoregulation was not impaired under these conditions. These results suggest glucose is necessary for the rapid osmoregulation that usually occurs in the first 20 min following hyperosmotic stress. This fast osmoregulation has been proposed to rely on the induction of glycerol synthesis via Hog1p-dependent post-translational mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schaber et al., 2012</xref>). Since glucose is a metabolic precursor of glycerol, the absence of glucose may prevent glycerol synthesis and thereby fast osmoregulation. Further work will be necessary to test this hypothesis and study how glucose stored in the cell is used (or not) for glycerol production.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Transcriptional response is impacted by the interaction between two environmental dynamics</title><p>Temporal fluctuations of two different stresses may have different or even opposite effects on gene expression, raising the question of how dual fluctuations of these two stresses would affect gene expression. Fast periodic fluctuation of osmotic stress was previously shown to cause hyper-activation of the <italic>STL1</italic> promoter (<italic>P<sub>STL1</sub></italic>) regulated by Hog1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitchell et al., 2015</xref>), while glucose depletion is known to inhibit transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jona et al., 2000</xref>) and translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janapala et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore asked whether dual fluctuations of glucose depletion and osmotic stress had additive effects on <italic>P<sub>STL1</sub></italic> expression or whether one of the dynamic cues had a dominant effect. To address this question, we quantified the expression dynamics of a <italic>P<sub>STL1</sub>-mCitrine</italic> fluorescent reporter gene under IPS and AS conditions. As expected, we observed transient expression of <italic>P<sub>STL1</sub>-mCitrine</italic> in response to both short (48 min) and long (10 hr) pulses of 1 M sorbitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>): the mean fluorescence level peaked at a 2.8-fold change 115 min after exposure to a short sorbitol pulse and 2.4-fold change 122 min after a long sorbitol pulse; then, fluorescence gradually returned to basal levels, even when osmotic stress was maintained. This expression pattern is consistent with previous quantifications of <italic>P<sub>STL1</sub></italic> transcriptional activity during hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wosika and Pelet, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben Meriem et al., 2019</xref>). When hyperosmotic shocks were periodically applied for 48 min every 96 min, <italic>P<sub>STL1</sub>-mCitrine</italic> expression constantly increased to reach 10.2-fold change after 11 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), suggesting a lack of adaptation to repeated osmotic shocks. Interestingly, hyper-activation of <italic>P<sub>STL1</sub>-mCitrine</italic> transcription was also observed under AS conditions where <italic>P<sub>STL1</sub>-mCitrine</italic> expression reached a maximum of 4.1-fold change after 413 min and remained as high as 3.1-fold change after 11 hr under the AS regime with a fluctuation period of 96 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A transcriptional target of the HOG pathway is under-expressed during in-phase stresses (IPS) and over-expressed during alternating stresses (AS).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Images of cells expressing a fluorescent reporter (mCitrine) under control of the <italic>STL1</italic> promoter known to be regulated by the HOG pathway.

This work demonstrates the value of applying artificial periodic fluctuations in several environmental parameters to understand how a biological system can process and integrate information from multiple cues in its environment. By using periodic inputs, we were able to investigate how changing the phasing of two stresses impacted fitness while keeping the duration of each stress constant. We found that dual fluctuations of glucose deprivation and osmotic stress had synergistic (non-additive) effects on cell proliferation that could not be easily predicted from the effects of fluctuating each stress separately. The phasing of the two stresses had a striking impact on several cell phenotypes, including division rate, death rate, osmoregulation, and transcriptional activation of a gene regulated by osmotic stress. The quantitative measurements of fitness that we collected for diverse genotypes under dynamic conditions with different glucose (main carbon source) concentrations can be used to further constrain mathematical models of yeast stress responses by adding two important features: resource allocation and regulation based on the presence of glucose. Moreover, our results indicate that the classic picture of yeast adaptation to osmotic stress cannot fully explain the behavior of yeast cells under fluctuating conditions. Indeed, by making glucose available for only short durations, we produced an environment in which the dynamics of the osmotic signaling pathway and its interaction with the glucose sensing pathway and glycolysis are critical. While the HOG signaling pathway was activated under all conditions, transcription of the target genes and inactivation of the HOG pathway were only detected when glucose and hyperosmotic stress were applied simultaneously, but not when hyperosmotic stress occurred in the absence of glucose. Therefore, if glucose is not available in the environment, cells are unable to commit to classical transcriptional/translational responses after osmotic stress. This finding may seem inconsistent with conclusions of a recent study showing that yeast cells displayed a stronger response to hyperosmotic stress at lower glucose concentration, including higher expression of several genes regulated by the HOG pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shen et al., 2023</xref>). However, key differences in experimental procedures may explain this apparent discrepancy: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shen et al., 2023</xref>, investigated the response to a single hyperosmotic shock at diverse constant glucose concentrations—not dynamic stresses as we did—and the lowest glucose concentration they considered was 0.02% allowing slow cell growth—not complete glucose depletion that stopped growth. This further suggests that subtle changes in the metabolic environment of cells may have profound impact on their stress-response capacity.</p><p>Our findings shed lights on the importance of including different types of metabolic environment fluctuations when describing stress responses and probing gene regulatory networks with time-varying signals to constrain both mathematical and biological models of stress responses. Interestingly, another recent study showed that the interplay between osmotic stress and glucose concentration could cause bimodal expression of a key determinant of cell survival after starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lukačišin et al., 2022</xref>). Since hyperosmotic stress was induced using high glucose concentration in this previous study, it would be particularly interesting to determine whether periodic fluctuations of hyperosmotic glucose concentration caused similar fitness defects as we observed when periodic fluctuations of glucose and sorbitol were applied in phase.</p><p>Importantly, in contrast to the well-known proliferative defects of osmo-sensitive mutants under constant hyperosmotic conditions, we show that periodically varying osmotic stress is not always detrimental to the growth of osmo-sensitive yeast cells. Indeed, HOG pathway mutants can grow and are even fitter than wild-type cells under fast alternating fluctuations of glucose deprivation and hyperosmotic stress. In this condition, osmo-sensitive mutant cells survive better than wild-type cells to repeated hypo-osmotic shocks, probably because they do not accumulate glycerol in response to hyperosmotic shocks and thus are less sensitive to fluctuations in the osmolarity of their environment. This also suggests that cells can be killed by exploiting their adaptive response. Forcing cells to repeatedly express their osmoadaptation program makes them very sensitive to osmotic rupture of the cell wall. Hence, periodically stressing cells (and their metabolic state) may be an efficient strategy to kill yeast cells. We further imagine that varying the timescale of fluctuations may even prevent cells from finding an evolutionary escape route.</p><p>Overall, we anticipate the importance of extending our study of the interaction of metabolic resources with other critical stresses, including antibiotic or mechanical stress, to higher eukaryotes. We propose that sending periodically a metabolic resource combined or alternating with a stressing agent allows to study the interplay between stress response and cell metabolism. We anticipate that such study could open novel research areas by revisiting the questions of stress response dynamics, within a system’s view of cells homeostasis, in which metabolic activity regulates or interferes with multiple important cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All materials produced in this study are available upon request.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>All <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are derived from BY4741 or BY4742 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brachmann et al., 1998</xref>) and are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>.

by directed mutagenesis of the yPH_132 strain (<italic>HTB2::HTB2-mCherry</italic>). Gene deletions were performed using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing according to the method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Laughery et al., 2015</xref>, that relies on the co-transformation of (i) a plasmid vector derived from pML104 (Addgene #67638) allowing expression of the Cas9 protein and a guide RNA specific to the target gene and (ii) a DNA repair fragment designed to delete the coding sequence of the target gene via homology-directed repair. For each gene deletion, a sequence containing the 20 nucleotides of the sgRNA recognition site in the coding sequence of the target gene was cloned between BclI and SwaI restriction sites in the pML104 plasmid by ligation of hybridized oligonucleotides. The DNA repair fragment was obtained by PCR amplification (Phusion Hot Start Flex 2X Master Mix, NEB M0536S) of two oligonucleotides with 20 bases of reverse complementarity to each other at the 3’ end and 70 bases homologous to the region either immediately upstream or downstream of the coding sequence of the target gene at the 5’ end. The repair fragment and the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid specific to each gene were transformed together in exponentially growing yPH_132 cells using a standard lithium acetate method. Transformants were isolated on CSM-ura (Formedium, DCS0271) agar plates and gene deletions were confirmed by PCR screening and by Sanger sequencing. Positive clones were grown on YPG plates (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 5% [vol/vol] glycerol, 20 g/L bacto agar) to counter-select petite cells (p-phenotype) and then transferred on Complete Supplement Mixture (CSM) agar plates containing 0.8 g/L 5-fluoroorotic acid (Thermo Scientific R0812) to counter-select the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid carrying the Ura3 gene. Two independent clones were stored at –80°C in 15% glycerol for each gene deletion (the clones used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Microfluidics and live-cell imaging</title><p>Yeast cells were cultivated and imaged in custom-made microfluidic devices for all time-lapse microscopy experiments described in this study. One day before each experiment a new microfluidic chip was made by casting a mixture of 10 g of polydimethylsiloxane (Sylgard 184 kit, Neyco) and 1 g of curing agent on a master wafer made by soft lithography. The chip was then degased, cured at 65°C for 4 hr, peeled off, punched with a 1.2-mm-diameter needle at all positions of inlets and outlets and then bonded onto a 24×60 mm<sup>2</sup> coverslip after plasma activation of the surfaces. The chip pattern is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>. In brief, it consists of five independent pairs of flow channels (800 µm wide×50 µm high) connected each to five growth chambers (400×400×3.8 µm<sup>3</sup>; L×W×H) where yeast cells are constrained to proliferate in monolayer.</p><p>Yeast strains were thawed from glycerol stocks kept at –80°C onto YPG agar plates (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 5% [vol/vol] glycerol, 20 g/L bacto agar) at least 3 days and no more than 2 weeks before each microscopy experiment. After 2 days of incubation at 30°C, YPG plates were kept at room temperature. The day before an experiment, a small amount of cells (~10<sup>5</sup> cells) was inoculated in 4 mL of CSM medium (6.7 g/L Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids [BD Difco], 2% glucose [Euromedex], 0.8 g/L CSM of amino acids [MP Biomedicals]) and incubated overnight at 30°C with 250 rpm orbital shaking. 100 µL of cell culture was then transferred to 5 mL of CSM medium and incubated for another 4 hr at 30°C to reach the exponential phase of growth. Cells were loaded in the microfluidic chip by injecting 50 µL of cell culture through each inlet of the chip using a small syringe.</p><p>Next, each pair of inlets was connected to a three-way solenoid valve (the Lee Company, LFAA1201418H) that was itself connected to two bottles of medium via tubings with 0.5 mm inner diameter and 1.5 mm outer diameter (Cole-Parmer Microbore Tubing). A custom-made valve controller piloted by a Node-RED application was used to dynamically control which medium was dispensed to the cells based on a predetermined schedule of valve state switching. Media were sterilized by filtration (0.22 µm) to remove large particles and their composition varied depending on the experiment. All media were based on 6.7 g/L Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (BD Difco) and 0.8 g/L CSM of amino acids (MP Biomedicals) in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. This base was complemented either with 2% glucose, 0.1% glucose, or no glucose and with 1 M sorbitol or no sorbitol. The outlets of the microfluidic chip were connected via tubings to a peristaltic pump (Ismatec IPC 12) and to an empty beaker to collect the flow-through.</p><p>The chip was then mounted on a motorized inverted microscope (Olympus IX83) equipped with LEDs for fluorescence excitation (CoolLED pE-300ultra), a Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera (Andor—Oxford Instruments) and an autofocus module (IX3-ZDC2, Olympus). The microscope, the microfluidic system, and culture media were all placed inside an incubation chamber maintained at 30°C. Immediately after mounting the chip, the pump was turned on with a flow rate set at 120 µL/min for each outlet tube, resulting in a flow rate of 240 µL/min in the growth chambers since they were each connected to two outlets. The medium dispensed to cells by default was CSM with either 2% glucose or 0.1% glucose. The microscope was controlled using iQ v3.6.3 software (Andor Technology) and all images were obtained using a 60× oil immersion objective (Olympus PlanApo N 60×/1.42) and a ×1.6 magnification changer. Using live bright-field imaging, we selected 25 positions (25 fields of view) of the motorized stage (Prior Scientific ProScan III) that captured 10–50 cells in each of the 25 growth chambers of the chip and were focused slightly below the median cell plane based on cell wall contrast. We used an iQ program that automatically scanned each position every 6 min for 12 or 24 hr and acquired bright-field and fluorescence images after autofocus adjustment. In parallel, we executed the program controlling the timing of valve state switches. This program always started with 1 hr of the default state corresponding to CSM+2% glucose or CSM+0.1% glucose so that cells could acclimate to the experimental settings and images recorded in the first hour were excluded from analyses. To detect YFP fluorescence, samples were exposed to blue LED illumination at an intensity of 10% using a 514/10 nm excitation filter and fluorescence was acquired with an exposure time of 250 ms using a 545/40 nm emission filter. To detect mCherry fluorescence, samples were exposed to green LED illumination at an intensity of 14% using a 560/40 nm excitation filter and fluorescence was acquired with an exposure time of 150 ms using a 630/75 nm emission filter. Microscopy images were saved in TIFF format and are available upon request.</p><p>Microscopy images were acquired following the same procedure for experiments aiming at quantifying division and death rates, for experiments aiming at quantifying the fluorescence of cells expressing <italic>P<sub>STL1</sub>-mCitrine</italic> and for experiments aiming at quantifying the nuclear enrichment of Hog1-GFP fusion protein. However, image analysis was performed differently for each type of experiment as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Quantification of cell division and death rates</title><p>We used <italic>ilastik</italic> v1.3 for the segmentation and tracking of cell nuclei expressing HTB2-mCherry on fluorescence images. Three time-lapse movies of 120 fluorescence images of yPH_132 cells grown in CSM+2% glucose medium were used to train the machine learning algorithms to recognize the nuclei of single cells and the nuclei of dividing cells at various numbers of cells per image. The segmentation and tracking procedure was then applied to frames from all experiments after manually removing out-of-focus images that occasionally occurred due to autofocus failure. The output for each experiment was a CSV file for each of the 25 field of views where rows corresponded to all objects (i.e. cell nuclei) detected on all images and columns corresponded to parameters such as image identity, cell nucleus identity, parental nucleus identity, size of the nucleus, and <italic>XY</italic> coordinates of nucleus centroid. For all experiments involving combined stresses and AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), we manually added to CSV files a parameter indicating when cell death was observed based on visual inspection of bright-field images. This manual step was necessary because the nucleus of a dead cell could remain fluorescent and could be tracked for several hours after cell death. This time-consuming step was not performed in the analyses of other experiments where death events remained very rare (results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Next, we computed cell division rate and death rate using homemade R scripts. We designed and implemented an Eulerian measure of division rate that was robust to rare tracking errors and to cell saturation in the field of view. In this approach, we first define a tracking window of 1928×1928 pixels centered on each image of 2048×2048 pixels.

First, a preprocessing step was necessary to eliminate out-of-focus images that occasionally occurred. This was done using a U-NET model trained to estimate the area of cells on each frame and to detect sudden changes of cell area between consecutive frames indicative of autofocus failure. Next, a proper cell segmentation was achieved via a machine learning algorithm based on the StarDist method (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/stardist/stardist">GitHub</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://stardist.net/">https://stardist.net/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">StarDist, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weigert et al., 2020</xref>) version 0.7.3 that uses star-convex shape prior. This method was well suited to the round shape of yeast cells and performed slightly better than the U-NET network allowing more reliable tracking of cells. Training of StarDist and U-NET algorithms was performed using a GPU NVIDIA RTX Quadro. For each cell in a frame <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, the tracking was performed by detecting which cell in the previous frame <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> was closest to the cell on frame <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> based on Euclidean distances between cell centroids. This simple method worked best for cells that did not move too much between consecutive frames: it could fail when the distance between two different cells in two consecutive frames was smaller than the distance between the same cell in the two frames. For this reason, we manually selected by visual inspection cells with correct tracking over at least 6 hr and excluded cells with wrong tracking in further analyses. We computed the mean fluorescence of each cell as the total fluorescence of the cell divided by the area of the cell. The area corresponded to the number of pixels classified as belonging to the cell in the segmented bright-field image. The total fluorescence of a cell was the sum of intensities of all pixels classified as belonging to the cell in the fluorescence image. Pixel classification of fluorescence images was performed using a <italic>numpy.array</italic> function in Python that applied the segmentation masks obtained from the analysis of bright-field images to the corresponding fluorescence images. R scripts were used to plot the mean fold change of fluorescence over time for all cells analyzed in images that were taken at the same time point in different growth chambers sharing the same regime of environmental fluctuations. Fold change was calculated for each cell as the difference of mean fluorescence observed for that cell in a given frame and the mean fluorescence observed among all cells in the first frame divided by the mean fluorescence among all cells in the first frame.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Hog1-GFP nuclear enrichment</title><p>The nuclear enrichment of Hog1-GFP was quantified in cells expressing both the Hog1-GFP reporter and the nuclear marker Htb2-mCherry. Cell segmentation and tracking was performed on bright-field images following the same procedure as described above for the quantification of <italic>P<sub>STL1</sub>-mCitrine</italic> expression. In addition, another segmentation was done for cell nuclei that were detected with the red fluorescence channel using a simple thresholding step. Each nucleus contour was then associated by contour overlapping comparison to its corresponding cell contour obtained by segmentation of bright-field images. We then computed the mean fluorescence in the green channel for each cell and for each nucleus. The mean fluorescence of a cell was calculated as the total intensity of all pixels classified as belonging to the cell (including the nucleus) divided by the number of these pixels. The mean fluorescence of a nucleus was calculated as the total intensity of all pixels classified as belonging to the nucleus divided by the number of these pixels. Finally, the nuclear enrichment of fluorescence was calculated for each cell as the mean fluorescence of the nucleus divided by the mean fluorescence of the cell. R scripts were used to plot the nuclear enrichment of Hog1-GFP fluorescence over time for all cells analyzed in images that were taken at the same time point in different growth chambers sharing the same regime of environmental fluctuations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescein assay</title><p>We used a fluorescein assay to characterize the temporal dynamics of medium fluctuations inside microfluidic chips. In this assay, we connected a microfluidic chip to CSM medium complemented with 50 nM fluorescein and to CSM medium without fluorescein. We programmed the valve to dispense CSM with fluorescein to the chip for 20 min followed by CSM without fluorescein for another 20 min and repeated this treatment twice. We tried different flow rates on the peristaltic pump but only showed results for the optimal flow rate of 120 µL/min. We used the same microscopy setup as described above to image the growth chamber at the center of the chip, except that a 20× objective (Olympus Plan Achromat) was used to be able to visualize both the flow channel and the growth chamber in the field of view. One bright-field image and one fluorescence image were taken every 12 s. The fluorescence channel consisted of blue LED illumination at an intensity of 10% with a 514/10 nm excitation filter and acquisition with an exposure time of 250 ms using a 545/40 nm emission filter. We used ImageJ to quantify the mean fluorescence in two circular regions with a diameter of 280 pixels. One region was in the center of the growth chamber and the other region in the flow channel. A script in R was used to plot the relative level of fluorescence over time in each region. The relative fluorescence at time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) was calculated as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the mean fluorescence at time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the mean fluorescence observed between 30 and 40 min and between 70 and 80 min when fluorescein was at its minimal concentration in the chip and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the mean fluorescence observed between 10 and 20 min and between 50 and 60 min when fluorescein was at its maximal concentration in the chip.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing -

To answer the reviewer’s last comment, our main objective was not to study conditions that are ecologically relevant, but rather to perturb the system in an original way to reveal new mechanisms and properties of the system. The main advantage of periodic inputs over more complex or unpredictible types of temporal fluctuations is that they can be defined with few parameters that are easy to interpret and to integrate in biophysical models. For instance, by using periodic inputs we were able to investigate how changing the phasing of two stresses impacted fitness while keeping other parameters constant (the duration of each stress was kept constant). We added two sentences at the beginning of the discussion to highlight the value of using periodic inputs.</p><p>We do not fully agree with the reviewer’s statement that periodic stimuli may reveal behaviours that are rarely relevant to selection. Indeed, many parameters of natural environments are known to vary periodically, such as light, temperature, predation, tides. Even if the periodic stimuli we use are artificial, they can still be a valuable tool to reveal new molecular processes. For instance, null mutants have been invaluable to understand biological systems despite being unlikely to reveal behaviours relevant to selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors' findings demonstrate the tight links that can exist between metabolism and the ability to respond to stress. Their study appears to have parted somewhat from their original aim because of the HOG pathway's reliance on glucose. It would be interesting to see if the cells behaviour is simpler in periodically varying sorbitol and a stress where there is little known connection to the HOG network, such as nitrogen stress.</p></disp-quote><p>The use of periodic nitrogen stress is a very interesting suggestion from both reviewers. However, we think it represents a large amount of work that deserves its own study. In particular, it would require first identifying a relevant period at which nitrogen fluctuations have an impact on division rate similar to what we observed for glucose fluctuations before performing experiments in AS and IPS conditions.</p><p>Nitrogen starvation is known to induce filamentous growth via activation of components of the HOG pathway (Cullen and Sprague, 2012), with potential cross-talk between filamentous growth and hyperosmotic stress response. Therefore, periodic osmotic stress and periodic nitrogen starvation may interact in a complex way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors have used microfluidic channels to study the response of budding yeast to variable environments.

We agree with the reviewer that the interaction between glucose availability and osmotic stress response has been investigated in previous studies. However, this interaction was investigated using experimental procedures that differed from our approach in critical ways, and therefore the behaviors observed were not the same. In Sharifian et al. (2015), the authors identified a new negative feedback loop regulating Hog1 basal activity and described underlying molecular mechanisms. This feedback loop is unlikely to explain differences of cell fitness we observed in IPS and AS conditions, because (1) differences of division rate was still observed in hog1 mutant cells and (2) differences of death rate involve glycerol synthesis, which is independent of the feedback loop described in Sharifian et al. (2015). In Shen et al. (2023), the authors observed a stronger expression of Hog-responsive genes at lower glucose concentrations, which seems contradictory with our observation of very low pSTL1-GFP expression in absence of glucose. However, they did not use fluctuating conditions and they did not report expression of stress-response genes when glucose was totally depleted (the lower glucose concentration they used was 0.02%) as we did, which may explain the different outcomes. We added three sentences in the discussion to compare our findings to those of Shen et al. (2023).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One clear evidence that is presented, however, is the link between glycerol accumulation during the sorbitol treatment and the cell death phenotype upon starvation in alternating stress condition. However, no explanations or hypothesis are formulated to explain the mechanism of resource allocation between glycolysis and HOG response that could explain the poor growth in alternating stresses or the lack of adaptation of Hog1 activity in absence of glucose.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we included a new result section and a supplementary figure (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2) where we tested three hypotheses to explain the lower division rate observed in AS condition relative to IPS condition. We found no evidence supporting these hypotheses, and the mechanisms responsible for the reduced growth in AS condition therefore remains elusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another key question is to what extent the findings presented here can be extended to other types of perturbations. Would the use of alternative C-source or nitrogen starvation change the observed behaviors in dynamic stresses? If other types of stresses are used, can we expect a similar growth pattern between alternating versus in-phase stresses?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above in our response to the other reviewer, these are very interesting questions that we think go beyond the scope of our study due to the amount of work involved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p><p>My comments are only minor.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>More paragraphs would improve legibility.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>To improve legibility, we split the longer section of the Results in three paragraphs page 12, section entitled “Osmoregulation is impaired under in-phase stresses but not under alternating stresses.” However, we kept it as one section with a single title for global coherency: each section of the results corresponds to one main figure and have one main conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>I found AS and IPS confusing because what becomes important is whether sorbitol appears with glucose or not.

Based on colleagues feedback, AS and IPS acronyms appeared as a good compromise between concision and clarity. To avoid confusion, the two acronyms are precisely defined when they are first used in the Results section. We think it is more important to emphasize the co-occurrence (or not) of the two stresses, rather than the co-occurrence of glucose and sorbitol. Indeed, standard yeast medium contains glucose but no sorbitol, and therefore we defined the two periodic conditions based on differences from standard medium. Even though we avoided using acronyms as much as possible in the manuscript, the use of these two acronyms to refer to the dual fluctuations of the environment seemed essential for concision. Indeed, IPS and AS acronyms are used many times in the results (16 occurrences on page 12 alone), figures and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>I would consider moving some of Fig S2 to the main text: it helps clarify where Fig 2 is coming from and is referenced multiple times.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer and we moved panels A-D from Figure S2 to the main Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>On page 10, &quot;constantly facing a single stress that changes over time&quot; is confusing.

We found few studies that investigated cell responses in the absence of glucose, and because of significant differences in the experimental approaches it remains difficult to explain our results from conclusions of these previous studies. For instance, Shen et al., 2023 described and modeled the hyperosmotic stress response at various glucose concentrations. They found that Hog1p relocation to the nucleus after hyperosmotic shock lasted longer at lower glucose concentration, which is consistent with our finding in absence of glucose. However, they did not include the absence of glucose in their experiments or periodic fluctuations of glucose concentration. In addition, their model ignores the impact of cell signaling processes involved in growth arrest in response to hyperosmotic stress or glucose depletion. It is therefore difficult to relate their conclusions to our results. We have developed the discussion of our study to include these hypotheses and to clarify what is explained or not in our IPS and AS results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is knowledge on activation of the hyperosmotic stress pathway in response to glucose fluctuations, but not about the response to hyperosmotic stress in absence of glucose.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>On page 11, Figure 5a should be Figure 4a.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Correct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>I would explain the components of the HOG pathway in the caption of Fig 1 or in the text when you cite Fig 1a.

We added a new supplementary figure (Figure 2 – figure supplement 2) showing the temporal dynamics of division rates at three different frequencies of osmostress and glucose depletion. We did not include high frequencies (periods below 48 minutes) because the temporal resolution of image acquisition in our experiments (1 image every 6 minutes) was too low. Very interestingly, this new analysis suggests that the positive relationship between the frequency of glucose depletion and division rate is explained by a delay between glucose removal and growth arrest rather than a delay between glucose addition and growth recovery. We therefore added the following conclusion:</p><p>“Under periodic fluctuations of 2% glucose, the division rate was lower during half-periods without glucose than during half-periods with glucose (Figure 2 – figure supplement 2d-f), as expected. However, this difference depended on the frequency of glucose fluctuations: the average division rate during half-periods without glucose was higher at high frequency (small period) than at low frequency (large period) of fluctuations (Figure 2 – figure supplement 2d-f). Therefore, the effect of the frequency of glucose availability on the division rate in 2% glucose is likely due to a delay between glucose removal and growth arrest: cell proliferation never stops when the frequency of glucose depletion is too fast.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>According to Sharifan et al. 2015, I would have expected that Hog1 would not relocate in the nucleus in 0% glucose. I wonder if this is due to the use of sorbitol as a stressor or the presence of low levels of glucose in the medium. I would suggest performing some control experiments with NaCl as hyperosmotic agent and test the addition of 2-deoxy-glucose to completely block glycolysis.</p></disp-quote><p>After careful reading of Sharifian et al. 2015, we fail to understand why the reviewer think Hog1 would be expected to not relocate to the nucleus after hyperosmotic stress in 0% glucose. In this previous study, the authors never combined glucose depletion with a strong hyperosmotic stress as we did in our study. They report the results of independent experiments where cells were exposed either to a single pulse of hyperosmotic stress (0.4 M NaCl) or to transient glucose starvation, but they did not combine these two stimuli. In this context, it is difficult to compare their results with ours. The fact that Sharifian et al. 2015 did not observe Hog1 nuclear relocation in 0% glucose (consistent with our result in Figure 6 – figure supplement 1a, yellow curve) is not inconsistent with our observation of Hog1 nuclear enrichment in 0% glucose + 1M sorbitol. One potential discrepancy between the two studies is the fact that they observed a small transient peak of Hog1 nuclear localization just after glucose is added back to the medium, while we failed to observe this peak in similar conditions (yellow curve in Figure 6 – figure supplement 1a). However, this could be simply explained by the temporal resolution of our experimental system: we image cells once every 6 minutes and the peak lasts less than 2 minutes in Sharifian et al. 2015. We added a sentence to discuss this minor point in the Results: “Although previous studies observed small transient (less than two minutes) peaks of Hog1-GFP nuclear localization after glucose was added back to the medium following glucose depletion (Sharifian et al., 2015, Piao et al., 2013), the temporal resolution in our experiments (one image every 6 minutes) may have been too low to detect these peaks.”.</p><p>While we agree many additional experiments would be interesting, such as testing the effects of different stress factors or the non-metabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose, we think this is beyond the scope of this study because such experiments are likely to open broad perspectives and to not be conclusive in a reasonable amount of time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When discussing Figure 7, the authors write that the HOG pathway is &quot;overactivated&quot; or &quot;hyperactivated&quot;. I would refrain from using these terms because as seen in Figure 6, the Hog1 activity pattern, if anything, decreases as the number of alternative pulses increases. The high level of pSTL1mCitrine measured is mostly due to the long half-life of the fluorescent protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the formulation “hyper-activation” of the HOG pathway because Mitchell et al. 2015 used it to refer to the same phenomenon in their seminal study. This &quot;hyper-activation&quot; refers to the fact that both the integral activation of Hog1p (sum of areas under Hog1 nuclear peaks) and the global activation of transcriptional targets is much higher during fast periodic hyperosmotic stress than during constant hyperosmotic stress. That being said, we understand the point made by the reviewer about the decreasing size of Hog1 peaks over time during repeated pulses of osmotic stress. Therefore, we slightly modified the text to refer to hyper-activation of pSTL1-mCitrine transcription or expression instead of hyper-activation of the HOG pathway. For coherency, we replaced all instances of “overactivation” by “hyper-activation”.</p><p>Last but not least, the high level of pSTL1-mCitrine is both due to the long half-life of the protein and to the fact that pSTL1 transcription is never turned off due to high Hog1p activity under fast periodic osmostress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>In the main text, I think it might be more intuitive to refer to doubling time in hours instead of division rates in 1/min which are harder to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>In an early draft of the manuscript, we made figures with either division rates or with doubling times (ln(2)/division rate) and we received mixed opinions from colleagues on what measure was more intuitive to interpret. Both measures are widely used in the literature, and we decided to use division rates in the final version of the figures because it was more directly related to population growth rate and to fitness. For instance, the population growth rate shown in Figure 5 is simply calculated by subtracting the death rate from the division rate. For coherency, we therefore reported division rates instead of doubling times in figures and results. However, to address the reviewer’s comment we included the doubling times (in addition to the division rates) when mentioning the most important results. For instance, page 12: “Strikingly, cells divided about twice as fast under IPS condition (1.67 x 10-3 division/min, corresponding to an average doubling time of 415 minutes) than under AS condition (9.4 x 10-4 division/min, corresponding to an average doubling time of 737 minutes)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found various capitalized version of &quot;HOG /Hog pathway&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected this incoherency and used “HOG pathway” everywhere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 11.

The explanation about the calculation of the division rate seems incomplete. For completeness, it would be good to mention the brand and model of valves used.

For more clarity, we modified the names of parameters in the equations to make them more explicit. We also added a reference to Supplementary File 1 that contains all R scripts used to calculate division rates and death rates. We included the brand and model of valves used, as requested. As for the number of cells tracked in the various experiments, we mentioned in the Methods: “we selected 25 positions (25 fields of view) of the motorized stage (Prior Scientific ProScan III) that captured 10 to 50 cells in each of the 25 growth chambers of the chip and were focused slightly below the median cell plane based on cell wall contrast.” To address the reviewer’s comment, we also included the range of number of tracked cells for each experiment in corresponding figure legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
