So far, most studies on dendritic integration have been performed in vitro, in the absence of physiological inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stuart and Häusser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). Equivalent in vivo studies, though technically challenging, are essential for exploring how dendritic integration works in living animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murayama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Conventional in vivo dendritic recording techniques have faced important challenges for studying dendritic integration. Notably, in vivo patch clamp recordings targeting the soma or smooth dendrites cannot directly measure signals in the most distal dendritic regions that receive the majority of synaptic input, called the ‘spiny’ dendrites. In vivo calcium imaging from spiny dendrites can partially circumvent this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). However, this approach measures dendritic calcium events only and omits the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing voltage signals evoked by synaptic input that do not trigger postsynaptic calcium signals. These synaptic potentials are expected to generate continuous but highly inhomogeneous spatiotemporal dendritic activity in awake animals. A glimpse of this was shown in the cerebellar Purkinje neuron (PN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>). As such, our understanding of the basic components of dendritic integration, the frequency, amplitude, and spatiotemporal distribution of synaptic inputs under physiological conditions, and how these inputs are integrated by dendrites in awake behaving animals, remains incomplete.</p><p>Coincidence detection is a basic form of dendritic integration. By detecting coincident synaptic input, it is thought that neurons distinguish important signals from ongoing synaptic activity by amplifying dendritic voltage signals as part of ongoing synaptic integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stuart and Häusser, 2001</xref>) and by modifying synaptic strength through synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 1990</xref>). PN dendrites are ideally suited to perform coincidence detection. They receive excitatory synaptic input from two distinct pathways: a single climbing fiber (CF) and numerous parallel fibers (PFs). CFs project from the inferior olive and evoke reliable dendritic calcium spikes. PFs relay mossy fiber (MF) activity originating from multiple brainstem nuclei, and together with synaptic input from inhibitory molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) elicit postsynaptic potentials in the PN dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Konnerth et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>). In cerebellar slices, paired stimulation of PF and CF input evoke ‘supralinear’ dendritic calcium signals in PNs, whereby the signal amplitude is larger than the sum of calcium signals triggered by PF and CF input alone. At PF–PN synapses these supralinear calcium signals lead to a form of synaptic plasticity, known as long-term depression (LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>This particular coincidence detection process is well studied in PN spines and dendrites in cerebellar slices, and supports early theoretical predictions for motor learning in the cerebellum whereby the CF input is thought to serve as an instructive ‘teaching’ signal that modifies PF synaptic input through induction of LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marr, 1969</xref>). However, this remains a controversial component in the theory of cerebellar function and motor learning, and a corresponding description of dendritic coincidence detection from awake animals is still missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mauk et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Najafi and Medina, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sakurai, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schonewille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). Specifically, previous in vitro studies identified two dendritic mechanisms by which coincidence detection may occur, which depend on the strength and timing of coincident PF and CF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). These mechanisms involved voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) and/or group one metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1). How these processes occur during behavior remains to be determined.</p><p>In vivo studies using calcium imaging found that CF-evoked calcium signals were enhanced during sensory stimulation (an air puff directed toward the eye) in mice. Notably, graded non-CF sensory-evoked calcium signals were detected and proposed to be driven by PF input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Najafi et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>). More recent studies, however, have failed to detect supralinear dendritic calcium signals triggered by coincident PF and CF input during sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaffield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaffield et al., 2018</xref>), challenging the role that PF input might play on the sensory-evoked dendritic calcium signals.</p><p>Coincidence detection of PF and CF input remains to be confirmed in vivo. Specifically, it is unclear if the coincidence detection mechanisms previously described in vitro also occur in vivo and if so, how they occur and under what behavioral conditions. Furthermore, because of technical limitations, a direct relationship between voltage and calcium signaling in spiny dendrites has not yet been explored in behaving animals.</p><p>Here by combining simultaneous voltage and calcium imaging from the PN spiny dendrites, we record dendritic calcium spikes and postsynaptic potentials to investigate sensory-evoked dendritic integration and coincidence detection in PN dendrites of awake mice. Specifically, we investigate the dendritic mechanisms that lead to the enhanced dendritic calcium signals in PNs during sensory stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study dendritic integration in vivo, we recently developed a fast (2 kHz) two-photon imaging technique to simultaneously record dendritic voltage and calcium signals from PN spiny dendrites in awake mice.

Simultaneously acquired voltage and calcium linescans were spatially averaged to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, at a temporal resolution of 0.5 ms/line. To maintain high temporal precision, voltage signals were not temporally filtered (unless stated otherwise), while all calcium signals (which are much slower) were temporally filtered (5 ms boxcar) to achieve an accurate measurement of the peak ΔF/F in single trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). As the voltage response of ANNINE-6plus is linear down to a nanosecond time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuhn and Roome, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roome and Kuhn, 2019</xref>), the averaged voltage imaging signal represents the average membrane potential of dendritic shafts and dendritic spines within the point spread function of excitation along the scan line. It is important to keep in mind that spatially averaged recordings show the average of voltage and calcium signals across many dendritic processes, which we have previously shown are variable across individual branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>), and so these signals should be viewed as an averaged dendritic signal across the width of the PN spiny dendrites. The relative fluorescence change of ANNINE-6plus can be used to estimate the average membrane voltage change in PNs with a conversion factor of 2.1 mV/% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuhn and Roome, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We previously described two types of dendritic spiking events in the PN dendrites of awake mice; dendritic complex spikes ‘DCSs’ triggered by CF input and single dendritic spikes ‘DSs’ that we proposed were triggered by strong PF input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g and h</xref>) (see Materials and methods for DCS and DS detection criteria). DCS comprises a burst of rapid and distinct spikelets (typically two to five spikelets, each 1–2 ms in duration), associated with a large dendritic calcium signal. DS on the other hand are characterized by a gradually ramping membrane potential, followed by a single spikelet and small associated calcium signal. At the PN soma DCS are always associated with a somatic complex spike, while DS have no correlated somatic signal (compare extracellular somatic recordings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). We also described non-spiking dendritic voltage signals. These were either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing and correlated with action potential firing at the PN soma. All signals were blocked by using the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX or sodium channel antagonist Lidocaine, confirming their synaptic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplements 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">8</xref>).</p><p>We first established the dendritic voltage signals associated with PF synaptic input.

To examine these signals in vivo we electrically stimulated GCs in the GC layer, whose axons form the PFs, and recorded evoked voltage and calcium signals in the PN dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i–k</xref>). Physiologically plausible electrical stimulation protocols, similar to those used previously in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2000</xref>) (10 negative current stimuli, 30 mA or 300 mA, 1 ms duration at 100 Hz), were delivered to evoke PF synaptic input onto PN dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i and j</xref>).</p><p>Weak electrical stimulation (30 mA) evoked a depolarizing dendritic voltage signal (average during stimulus; 1.8 ± 2.1% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, n = 26, 7 PNs), corresponding to a sustained depolarization in membrane potential of approximately 3.8 ± 4.2 mV, and a gradual increase in dendritic calcium (calcium peak; 18.3 ± 23.0% ΔF/F, time to peak; 92.3 ± 46.9 ms, mean ± SD, n = 26, 7 PNs), and relatively few DS events (3 ± 2 DS/100 ms, mean ± SD, n = 26, 7 PNs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). Strong electrical stimulation (300 mA) evoked a larger sustained depolarization (average during stimulus, 3.3 ± 2.0% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, n = 26, 7 PNs, unpaired t-test, p=0.0148), corresponding to a depolarization in membrane potential of approximately 6.9 ± 4.2 mV, and a larger supralinear dendritic calcium signal with a delayed time to peak (calcium peak; 75.2 ± 55.0% ΔF/F, unpaired t-test, p=1.1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, time to peak; 129.1 ± 26.1 ms, unpaired t-test, p=9.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, mean ± SD, n = 26, 7 PNs).

As a proof of principle for dendritic coincidence detection of PF and CF input, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref> shows an example of how PF input (here evoked by electrical stimulation) following a spontaneous CF event triggers additional DS events and results in a supralinear dendritic calcium signal.

In total 54 PNs in 23 mice were labeled and several PNs (up to 5) were labeled in the same mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Two photon linescan imaging (2 kHz) recorded dendritic voltage and calcium signals simultaneously from the spiny dendrites of labeled PNs. Throughout the experiment, fully awake mice (i.e., awake for at least 1 hr after isoflurane anesthesia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) were seated on a rotating treadmill and head-fixed under a two-photon microscope. Linescan recordings (10 s in length) included a 100 ms sensory stimulus (stim.) beginning 5 s after recording onset, delivering an air puff directed at the ipsilateral eye. High intensity air puffs (pressure: 30 psi) were delivered via a glass capillary positioned 2 cm from the eye to evoke a reliable eye blink reflex in the ipsilateral eye, which was monitored using a video camera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>).

Thus, we begin by describing the various dendritic voltage signals evoked by sensory stimulation. Simultaneous voltage and calcium dendritic recordings revealed DCSs, DSs and sustained depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signals during sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), similar to those observed following electrical stimulation of PFs. The dendritic signals we observed were not evoked during voluntary eye blinks or detected while the mouse was anesthetized (1% isoflurane) and presented with the same air puff stimuli, confirming their relationship to the sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>, respectively).</p><p>DCSs and DSs were often, but not always, detected during coincident depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signals. For example, two PNs, PN1 and PN2, labeled in the same mouse (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) had different responses to sensory stimulation; PN1 shows a depolarization (black overlay trace) with a DCS riding on top (red trace) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), while PN2 shows only a DCS, with no detectable underlying depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). The amplitude and direction (i.e., depolarizing or hyperpolarizing) of evoked voltage signals were variable between individual PNs and on a trial-by-trial basis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–h</xref> and figure supplements for more examples).</p><p>We measured the maximum change in dendritic voltage (excluding DCS and DS events) during the stimulus, as indicated by black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–h</xref> insets, for all recording trials (n = 696, 54 PNs). We did this by removing all DCSs and DSs and by applying temporal filtering (10 ms boxcar) (see Materials and methods for spikelet detection and removal). A histogram for maximum change in dendritic voltage (excluding spikes) for all trials is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>. Note that combining all trials within our sampling region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), the maximum change in dendritic voltage was positive (i.e., depolarizing) (2.91 ± 4.3% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, 54 PNs, t-test, p=7.25 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) which corresponds to an average deflection in membrane potential of approximately 6.1 ± 9.0 mV.</p><p>By applying a detection threshold of &gt;2 standard deviations above and &lt;2 standard deviations below the baseline voltage signal (baseline calculated in a 500 ms window before the stimulus), we sorted voltage recordings into four groups based on the amplitude and direction of the sensory-evoked voltage response; ‘depolarizing’, ‘no response’, ‘hyperpolarizing’, and ‘depolarizing + hyperpolarizing’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Approximately 53% of voltage recordings displayed a depolarizing signal during the stimulus (max Δ in dendritic voltage &gt; + threshold); 14% showed hyperpolarizing voltage signals (max Δ in dendritic voltage &lt; − threshold); 7% had a truncated signal that appeared to be a superposition of both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing signals (max Δ in dendritic voltage &gt; + threshold, and &lt; − threshold, at different time points during the stimulus); and 26% showed no response during the stimulus (did not reach threshold in either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing directions). The temporal profile of each voltage response was resolved by sorting and averaging voltage signals in each response group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>). Depolarizing signals increased gradually throughout the stimulus, beginning 9 ± 3 ms (mean ± SD, n = 307) after stimulus onset, and reaching a maximum after 101 ± 3 ms, which is essentially at the stimulus offset. Hyperpolarizing signals were sharper, and their onset occurred later, beginning 35 ± 2 ms (mean ± SD, n = 83) after stimulus onset, and reaching a maximum hyperpolarization 57 ± 2 ms (mean ± SD) after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The maximum change in dendritic voltage was similar between depolarizing (6.7 ± 4.7% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, n = 307), hyperpolarizing (6.1 ± 4.0 %ΔF/F, mean ± SD, n = 83), and depolarizing + hyperpolarizing groups (7.0 ± 4.2% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, n = 38) and significantly larger than the no response group (2.6 ± 1.0% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, n = 133), ANOVA, p&lt;1.2 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, n = 561, 49 PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Interestingly, we found this only to be true for PNs within the ‘depolarizing’ voltage response group (depolarizing spontaneous: 13 ± 10% ΔF/F; depolarizing evoked: 19 ± 14%ΔF/F, mean ± SD, ANOVA, p&lt;6 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, 36 PNs) and the ‘hyperpolarizing’ voltage response group (hyperpolarizing spontaneous: 9 ± 7%ΔF/F; hyperpolarizing evoked: 18 ± 12%ΔF/F, mean ± SD, ANOVA, p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>, 6 PNs), but evoked calcium signals from PNs within the ‘no response’ group were not enhanced compared to spontaneous calcium signals (no response spontaneous: 11 ± 8%ΔF/F; no response evoked: 13 ± 9% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, ANOVA, p=0.99, 11 PNs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We used pharmacology to confirm that the sensory stimulus-evoked dendritic signals were due to synaptic input.

The maximum change in dendritic voltage (measured within a 200 ms window after stimulus onset) was significantly reduced under CNQX conditions; control (8.0 ± 7.3% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, n = 45), CNQX (4.4 ± 3.4% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, n = 46), unpaired t-test, p=0.003, n = 91, 5 PNs.

Application of CNQX and Lidocaine also blocked DCSs and DSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplements 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">8</xref>).

On average these dendritic voltage signals have a relatively small amplitude (6.1 ± 9.0 mV), below threshold for triggering VGCCs, have a much slower time course compared to DCSs and DSs and are blocked by CNQX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). Since CF synaptic input reliably evokes rapid DCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>) and noting their similarity to the voltage signals evoked by PF stimulation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i–k</xref>, we conclude that these signals originate primarily from PF synaptic input. On average the sensory stimulus-evoked PF input gives rise to a depolarizing signal across the PN dendrites (global depolarization) that begins 9 ± 3 ms after stimulus onset, which is consistent with rapid and dense GC responses to sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giovannucci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2006</xref>).

To determine the mechanisms underlying the enhanced calcium signals we examined the individual DCS and DS events. DCSs, DSs and corresponding calcium signals detected during the stimulus (termed ‘evoked’ signals), were compared with equivalent signals detected prior to the stimulus (termed ‘non-evoked’ signals). We counted the total number of spikelets detected in a 100 ms window following each evoked or non-evoked DCS signal, including any additional DCS and DS signals within that time window, and measured the resulting calcium signal peak. Calcium peaks were on average larger following evoked DCS signals compared to the non-evoked DCS signals (non-evoked: 12.6 ± 9.3% ΔF/F, n = 1624, evoked: 20.8 ± 15.1% ΔF/F, n = 333, mean ± SD, unpaired t-test, p=1.6 × 10<sup>−37</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Accordingly, the corresponding dendritic voltage recordings showed an increase in the total number of dendritic spikelets following each evoked DCS signal compared to non-evoked DCS signals, evident through a positive shift in the spikelet count probability distribution (Kolmogorov–Smirnov, p=1.85 × 10<sup>−5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>).</p><p>We considered the possibility that the increase in dendritic calcium peak and the number of spikelets result from an increase in the number of CF inputs (i.e., multiple DCS signals) occurring within the 100 ms time window. Due to slow calcium indicator dynamics, high frequency CF inputs cannot always be resolved from the calcium signal alone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using the voltage recording we detected and excluded all signals in which multiple CF inputs were observed and repeated the analysis. Interestingly, when only single DCS signals were permitted, the peak calcium of evoked signals remained enhanced compared to non-evoked signals (non-evoked: 11.9 ± 8.1%ΔF/F, n = 1292, evoked: 19.7 ± 14.2%ΔF/F, n = 203, mean ± SD, unpaired t-test, p=3.8 × 10<sup>−28</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). The time to peak for evoked calcium signals was also delayed compared to non-evoked calcium signals (non-evoked: 37.7 ± 26.3 ms, n = 1292, evoked: 69.0 ± 44.9 ms, n = 203, mean ± SD, unpaired t-test, p=2.7 × 10<sup>−42</sup>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, for a comparison of all dendritic calcium signals described so far). However, the difference between pre-stimulus and stimulus probability distributions of spikelet numbers was no longer significant (Kolmogorov–Smirnov, p=0.075) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). These differences in the calcium signal time-course are indicative of an additional source of calcium following the evoked DCS, causing a delayed and enhanced calcium peak, while the similarity in spikelet numbers between evoked and non-evoked DCS suggests this additional calcium source is spike-independent. Thus, the enhanced calcium signal is not due to an increase in CF input frequency, or an increase in dendritic spiking, caused by stronger CF input, but through an additional mechanism that does not require DCSs or DSs, such as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, or potentially calcium released from internal stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Llano et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Llano et al., 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Since both DCS and DS frequency increased during the sensory stimulus, we next considered the possibility that enhanced evoked calcium signals result from paired DCS and DS signals that occur during the same stimulus. We investigated the relationship between the timing of paired DCS + DS signals and their corresponding dendritic calcium signal, by selecting all DCS + DS pairs (non-evoked and evoked) with &lt;400 ms temporal separation. We measured the calcium peak following each pair of DCS + DS signals, relative to the average calcium peak of a single DCS signal comprising the same number of spikelets. Relative calcium peaks were plotted in relation to the temporal separation of each DCS + DS pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Analysis revealed a clear asymmetric and supralinear relationship between the timing of DCS and DS signals and their corresponding calcium signals. The relative calcium peak was maximum when DS followed DCS events and was independent of the number of DCS spikelets (two spikelets: 1.8 ± 1.3 [n = 13]; three spikelets: 2.0 ± 1.2 [n = 15]; four spikelets: 1.7 ± 0.9 [n = 6]; five spikelets: 1.3 ± 0.3 [n = 3], mean ± SD, measured in the 80 ms time window following the DCS, ANOVA, p&gt;0.7763). By fitting a two-term Gaussian function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>) we estimate that the average relative calcium peak (2.0 ± 0.1) is maximum when DS follow DCS signals by 28.3 ± 5.4 ms (mean ± SD). This means that an additional DS (evoked by PF input) following a DCS (evoked by CF input) can enhance the dendritic calcium signal supralinearly (potentially by more than 100% relative to the DCS event alone) depending on the timing of the two events.</p><p>Thus, we conclude that paired DCS + DS signals evoked by coincident CF and PF input act to enhance the dendritic calcium signal supralinearly, and this enhancement is dependent on the timing of paired DCS + DS events. However, paired DCS + DS signals are relatively rare (detected in only 5.9 ± 0.9% of recordings), suggesting an additional coincidence detection mechanism at work. Taken together, our findings thus far reveal a predominantly depolarizing voltage signal and an increase in DCS and DS activity during sensory stimulation. Both these signals are blocked by CNQX and so originate primarily from coincident excitatory PF and CF synaptic input.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Supralinear dendritic signaling in PN dendrites during sensory-evoked stimulation is voltage and mGluR1 dependent</title><p>To investigate the mechanisms underlying the evoked supralinear calcium signals further, we selected individual evoked and non-evoked DCS signals only (now with no subsequent DCS or DS signals). We sorted DCS signals based on the number of spikelets generated. This created four DCS groups, ranging from 2 to 5 spikelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>). Averaging voltage traces within each evoked spikelet group revealed a prominent depolarization beginning before the evoked DCS event; this ‘pre-DCS’ signal was not detected before non-evoked DCS signals however (see black arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). This would be expected because, on average, sensory stimulation-evoked voltage signals are depolarizing, and their onset precedes DCS generation (as determined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).

Furthermore, the difference between evoked and non-evoked calcium peaks increased supralinearly with the number of DCS spikelets (non-evoked vs. evoked, two spikelets: 6.2 ± 3.2% ΔF/F vs. 10.1 ± 5.5% ΔF/F; three spikelets: 11.1 ± 5.7% ΔF/F vs. 17.0 ± 7.7% ΔF/F; four spikelets: 16.4 ± 8.6% ΔF/F vs. 25.1 ± 11.7% ΔF/F; five spikelets: 18.5 ± 10.2% ΔF/F vs. 39.3 ± 17.1% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, ANOVA, p&lt;0.002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>).

By application of AIDA (a potent and selective mGluR1 antagonist), we assessed the contribution of mGluR1 to sensory-evoked dendritic signals in the awake mouse. After application of AIDA, sensory-evoked calcium signals were significantly reduced (control: 24.4 ± 12.3% ΔF/F, AIDA: 17.9 ± 9.3% ΔF/F, mean ± SD, unpaired t-test, p=0.025) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>).

We used simultaneous voltage and calcium two-photon imaging of single PN dendrites at high temporal resolution (2 kHz) to explore PF and CF coincident input during sensory-evoked responses. Due to technical limitations, PF-evoked input to PN dendrites – that are predominantly voltage signals – have been thus far undetectable in vivo. As such, confirming physiological interaction between PF and CF input has not been possible, and previous in vivo studies have instead focused on coincident MLI and CF activity and dendritic calcium signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callaway et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaffield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitamura and Häusser, 2011</xref>). The ability to distinguish between depolarizing and hyperpolarizing dendritic voltage signals and DSs or DCSs evoked by either PF or CF input provides fresh insight into how dendritic calcium signals triggered by sensory stimulation are modulated, and how dendritic coincident detection of the PF and CF input pathways occur in vivo.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Dendritic coincidence detection mechanisms modulate sensory stimulation-evoked dendritic calcium signals in PN dendrites</title><p>Here we show that sensory stimulus-evoked instructive signals carried to the cerebellum via CFs and MFs converge onto the dendrites of single PNs, and thereby modulate the dendritic calcium response, in an individual PN selective manner (compare responses from nearby PNs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), supporting predictions for a high degree of spatial convergence for these input pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Bower, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garwicz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Odeh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pijpers et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>PF and CF synaptic input is integrated at the PN spiny dendrites during sensory-evoked stimulation in awake mice. To summarize, we identify three interplaying dendritic coincidence detection mechanisms that modulate calcium signals at the PN dendritic level.</p><p>PN dendrites integrate EPSPs from PF input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which can result in a graded (voltage-dependent) calcium signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In some trials we also detected a sensory stimulus-evoked hyperpolarizing dendritic voltage signal. We propose these are due to feed forward inhibition via the PF-MLI-PN pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mittmann et al., 2005</xref>). We expect that the voltage-dependent dendritic calcium signal is continually regulated by EPSP and IPSP and the first mechanism of dendritic coincidence detection occurs when this voltage-dependent calcium signal coincides with a CF-evoked calcium signal.</p><p>The second mechanism is through the PF-evoked DS events, whose frequency increases during the sensory stimulus, and when paired with DCS act to enhance the CF-evoked calcium signal in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We found the greatest enhancement in calcium signal occurred when the DS followed the DCS by ~28 ms, which appears to be in contrast to in vitro experiments, where the maximal enhancement in calcium signal was detected when PF stimulation preceded CF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). However, we note that the DS events are due to a culmination of integrated PF input, and so the timing of the DS event does not indicate the onset of PF input, but the moment that the threshold in membrane potential is reached to trigger the DS event, and so it is expected that PF input onset begins sooner. Indeed, we found that on average PF input onset precedes CF input during sensory stimulation by ~34 ms, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, and as indicated by the pre-DCS depolarization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>. While PF-evoked DS signals are relatively rare in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>), we found that their frequency increased 9.5 times during sensory stimulation, and their impact on the dendritic calcium signal was supralinear. Thus, we propose PF-evoked DS signals play a unique role in modulating dendritic calcium signals during sensory stimulation. In fact, the additional PF-evoked DS could be viewed as a correction to the CF-evoked DCS signal, supplementing an otherwise 'too weak’ DCS signal with extra DSs.</p><p>The third mechanism we describe is through mGluR1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which is known to trigger supralinear calcium signals when PF and CF inputs are conjunctively activated, and thereby modify PF–PN synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sarkisov and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). It was interesting to find that mGluR1 activity can directly influence DCS generation by the CF input and the time-course of the resulting dendritic calcium signal, specifically during evoked DCS events (c.f. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h and j</xref>). Such an interaction between mGluR1 activity and CF-evoked spikelet generation has previously been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batchelor and Garthwaite, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tempia et al., 2001</xref>) and is likely mediated through their interaction with T and P/Q-type VGCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hildebrand et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Otsu et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional implications: A solution to the ‘signal-to-noise’ problem</title><p>The CF input has historically been viewed as an ‘all-or-none’ type event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eccles et al., 1966</xref>), such that CF-evoked EPSPs are identical from one CF input to the next (provided the PN membrane potential is held constant). This description raised a critical problem, however, regarding the proposed role of CFs in providing PNs with instructive ‘teaching’ signals for motor learning. This problem, referred to as the ‘signal-to-noise’ problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llinás et al., 1997</xref>), asserts that if PN dendritic responses to CF were identical, ‘evoked’ and ‘spontaneous’ CF inputs would be indistinguishable at the level of the PN dendrite. Given that CF inputs are delivered continuously at a rate of ~1 Hz, the information encoded by ‘teaching’ signals should be lost among the noise of spontaneous CF input (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Najafi and Medina, 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zang and De Schutter, 2019</xref> for review).</p><p>A growing body of evidence, however, has proved that CFs are not such inefficient teachers, showing that CF-evoked dendritic calcium signals are in fact graded, and that ‘evoked’ calcium signals are enhanced compared to ‘spontaneous’ signals. There have been differing views regarding the underlying mechanisms, however, which could not be directly resolved since it was not possible to measure the PN membrane potential at the location of the calcium signals; the spiny dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaffield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaffield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Najafi et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Najafi et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roh et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to our findings, a recent study has proposed that calcium signals in PN dendrites evoked by sensory stimulation are graded entirely by the strength of CF input, essentially from outside of the cerebellum, without direct contribution from the MF pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaffield et al., 2019</xref>). We agree that the strength of CF input has a powerful influence on spikelet generation in PN dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davie et al., 2008</xref>) and consequently on dendritic calcium signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaffield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>), and it cannot be excluded that differences in recording location and/or sensory stimulation may favor differing mechanisms for modulating calcium signals in PN dendrites. However, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we find a clear nonlinear relationship between CF-evoked DCSs and the resulting dendritic calcium signal. Importantly, this nonlinear voltage–calcium relationship was specific to CF input evoked by sensory stimulation.</p><p>Here we show how coincident PF and CF input evokes supralinear dendritic calcium signals via mechanisms within the PN dendrite; through VGCCs (PF-evoked DS events), and activation of mGluR1s. Independent of the CF input, these coincidence detection mechanisms can modulate the downstream dendritic calcium signal and we propose this significantly enhances the information that can be transmitted by the evoked CF event. In the case where evoked calcium signals in PN dendrites are graded entirely by the strength of CF input, we would expect that their dynamic range would suffer from a similar ‘signal-to-noise’ problem, such that there remains a limited range in the information that can be transmitted or ‘taught’ to a single PN. The range of PN dendritic responses would remain limited by the strength of CF input, or more precisely by the number of dendritic calcium spikelets evoked by CF input (typically two to five spikelets). Furthermore, this would suggest that many PF–PN synapses receive the same teaching signal, independent of any instructive signals carried via the PFs, because the CF input propagates actively into the spiny dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>). Thus, the range of learning through synaptic plasticity at PF–PN synapses might also face similar limitations.</p><p>An important functional implication of the coincidence detection mechanisms described here is that evoked dendritic calcium signals can be adjusted at the PN dendritic level, within the cerebellar circuitry, in a way that accounts for instructive signals carried by MFs via PF input. In principle dendritic calcium signals can be fine-tuned with higher temporal and spatial precision, potentially at the level of single spines and branchlets throughout the entire dendritic tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denk et al., 1995</xref>), in far more detail than could be attained through enhanced CF input alone, as predicted by computational approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zang and De Schutter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zang et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, spontaneous CF events show a large degree of spatiotemporal variability across dendritic segments in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>) and we predict the spatiotemporal patterns of evoked DCS, modulated by PF input, to be particularly important in conveying information encoded by coincident PF and CF input events, during sensory stimulation. The combination of the various dendritic mechanisms we describe here may function to control the size and spread of the dendritic response to the coincidence detection event (the dendritic calcium signal in this case), thereby defining the ‘dendritic computational unit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zang et al., 2018</xref>) and potentially, the extent of synaptic plasticity at PF–PN synapses. This could be achieved through generation of PF-evoked DS events, for example, that actively propagate across multiple dendritic branchlets more effectively than passive PF-evoked EPSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Schutter and Bower, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>).</p><p>It is intriguing that the coincidence detection processes and supralinear dendritic calcium signals we describe here are triggered by sensory stimulation yet occur seemingly continuously; during sensory stimulation in awake naïve mice, and not only during motor learning of a specific task, such as eye blink conditioning. In vitro studies have shown how membrane potential and timing of coincident PF and CF synaptic inputs are critical for modulating calcium signaling and synaptic plasticity at PF–PN synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piochon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sarkisov and Wang, 2008</xref>). It remains to be seen if supralinear dendritic calcium signals evoked during unconditioned sensory stimulation result in lasting changes in PF–PN synaptic strength, but we might expect to see an equally fluid and variable range of synaptic plasticity at PF–PN synapses during behavior. PN dendrites and their spines are highly sensitive to calcium levels, which can in turn determine the direction of synaptic plasticity at PF–PN synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coesmans et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jörntell and Hansel, 2006</xref>).

Lidocaine (0.2%) (Sigma) and CNQX disodium salt (100 μM) (Tocris) were used to block Na<sup>+</sup> channels and AMPA receptors (excitatory synaptic input) respectively. AIDA (100 μM) (Tocris) was used to block mGluR1 activity. All drugs were dissolved in saline and applied by pressure injection (&lt;0.5 psi) for 10 min prior to imaging and reduced to &lt;0.1 psi while dendritic voltage and calcium recordings were repeated in the awake mice. Although it is not possible to confirm the exact concentration of drug applied in vivo, this procedure delivered a volume of solution in the nl range which spreads homogenously throughout the tissue and remained relatively localized (250–500 µm<sup>3</sup>) to the injection area. This was confirmed by using the same delivery procedure to inject 50 μM FITC dissolved in saline, while observing the injection under the two-photon microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the exact concentration of drug is unknown in vivo, the degree of effect will be variable depending on the drug (binding constant and concentration). Dendritic recordings were occasionally repeated ~24 hr after drug application (guaranteeing drug washout) to confirm that the labeled PN was not physically damaged by the drug application. An example of drug washout is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>.</p><p>For electrical stimulation of GCs, a micropipette of the same type and dimensions used for drug application was filled with saline and positioned in the GC layer, 50–100 μm below the PN layer and 50–100 μm lateral to the labeled PN. A Master nine pulse generator and ISO-flex (A.M.P.I) was used to deliver current pulses to the GCs and evoke PF synaptic input onto PN dendrites (10 negative current stimuli, either 30 mA or 300 mA in amplitude, 1 ms duration, and at 100 Hz). In one recording, CNQX (100 μM) was also added to the stimulation micropipette saline, which was applied with pressure injection to block the electrical stimulus-evoked synaptic input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Linescan TIFF images were initially cropped in width using ImageJ (US National Institute of Health) to contain only the dendrite from the labeled PN using the red channel as a guide, and to eliminate green signals originating from neighboring PNs. Full linescan traces were imported into Matlab and interpolated (from 2 to 10 kHz). All subsequent data analysis was performed using custom-written programs that we wrote previously with Matlab (MathWorks). Minor movement corrections were made to linescan images in the spatial dimension, to minimize movement artifacts that occur during the sensory stimulus. This was achieved by maximizing the cross correlation between the average pre-stimulus linescan spatial profile and the spatial profile of individual lines collected during the stimulus. It should be stated that because of the nature of linescan imaging, perfect movement correction cannot be achieved.</p><p>Single unit electrophysiological recordings were analyzed using Spike2 spike detection software (CED) to create a binary trace for simple spikes (SS) (and to eliminate spikes originating from neighboring PNs). All complex spikes (occurring at ~1 Hz) were easily identified by eye, which could be confirmed by comparing simultaneous electrophysiology, voltage, and calcium traces. Complex spike binary traces were created using the initial sodium spike of the somatic complex spike to mark its onset. All binary traces, raw images, and electrophysiology were then imported into Matlab for analysis.</p><p>To calculate ΔF/F of full linescans, the green channel image was first scaled (using Matlab ‘regress’ function) and fit to the red channel and then subtracted from the red channel. This removed crosstalk from the green channel. Average baseline red channel fluorescence was then subtracted from the time-varying red channel fluorescence and the result was divided by the average baseline of red channel fluorescence to give ΔF/F for the red channel. The ΔF/F calculation for the green channel was made in the same way as for the red channel, but it was not necessary to first subtract red channel fluorescence from the green channel as the voltage signal was neglectable compared to GCaMP6f. Relative fluorescence changes imaged with an excitation wavelength of 1020 nm were converted with a factor of 2.1 mV/% to estimate voltage changes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>DCS and DS spikelet detection in Matlab</title><p>DCS and single DS signals were detected using a custom-written program in Matlab. Spatially averaged voltage and calcium traces were first temporally filtered. Voltage traces were filtered using a 1 ms boxcar filter, while calcium traces were filtered using a 10 ms boxcar filter. All spikelets were then detected in the voltage traces using the ‘findpeaks’ function in Matlab, for which ‘MinPeakHeight’ was set at three standard deviations of the voltage recording, the ‘MinPeakDistance’ was set at 2.5 ms, and ‘MinPeakProminence’ was set at one standard deviation of the voltage recording. Spikelets were then sorted into DS or DCS signals based on the following criteria:</p><p>Spikelets were classed as DS signals if:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item> <p>No additional spikelets were detected in a window of ±10 ms prior to and following the spikelet (i.e., no burst of spikelets was detected).</p></list-item> <list-item> <p>The average corresponding calcium signal measured in a 20 ms window following the spikelet increased by &gt;1%, compared to the average calcium signal measured in a 20 ms window prior to the spikelet (i.e., corresponding calcium signal was detected).</p></list-item> <list-item> <p>The average voltage signal measured in a 10 ms window following the spikelet was less than one standard deviation of the voltage recording (i.e., the voltage recording returned immediately to baseline after a single spikelet).</p></list-item></list><p>Spikelets were classed as DCS signals if:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item> <p>Additional spikelets were detected in a window of ±10 ms prior to and following the spikelet (i.e., a burst of two or more spikelets was detected).</p></list-item> <list-item> <p>The average corresponding calcium signal measured in a 20 ms window following the spikelet increased by &gt;1% ΔF/F, compared to the average calcium signal measured in a 20 ms window prior to the spikelet (i.e., corresponding calcium signal was detected).</p></list-item></list><p>Classifications of DCS and DS signals were subsequently cross checked by visual inspection and through application of the classification algorithm, to paired dendritic and somatic recordings made on 7 PNs in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>), to confirm that DCS signals have a corresponding CF-evoked somatic complex spike, while DS signals had no corresponding somatic signal (i.e. purely dendritic signal) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Where necessary, dendritic spikelets were removed from the voltage recording, by replacing voltage data in a window ±5 ms centered on each spikelet with the average voltage measurement 5 ms prior to the spikelet window, and the voltage data were subsequently filtered using a 10 ms boxcar filter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Behavior analysis</title><p>Behavioral recordings were made while the mouse was awake and sitting on a treadmill. A behavior camera (sCMOS), capturing frames at 100 fps, was used to record sensory stimulus-evoked movements, synchronized with the imaging. Linescan recordings (10.5 s in length) included a 100 ms sensory stimulus beginning after 5 s of recording, giving an air puff directed at the ipsilateral eye of the mouse. Air puffs (pressure: 30 psi) were delivered via a (0.7 mm I.D) glass capillary positioned 2 cm from the eye to evoke a reliable eye blink reflex in the ipsilateral eye. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around the ipsilateral eye and the Δintensity/intensity was used to quantify eyelid position and closure during the stimulus, and traces were normalized such that 1 and 0 correspond to the maximum and minimum eyelid closure recorded for each mouse across all recordings, in order to monitor changes in the eye response over time. Note that in some recordings a brief widening of the eye occurs immediately as the air puff is delivered (seen as a sharp positive deflection in the eyelid response traces). This is caused by the air puff blowing on the eyelid and causing it to widen momentarily, prior to the eye blink response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data and software availability</title><p>Matlab codes are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cjroome/Roome_and_Kuhn_2020">https://github.com/cjroome/Roome_and_Kuhn_2020</ext-link>. Copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:42b8ab3d6a3f674968fca30d03548bcf4e44b7a7;origin=https://github.com/cjroome/Roome_and_Kuhn_2020;visit=swh:1:snp:e34cb88198bb757c7105cd083bd6a0045ea9bd55;anchor=swh:1:rev:25e88c9720e613065d56727e1225aa04fbf67e14/">swh:1:rev:25e88c9720e613065d56727e1225aa04fbf67e14</ext-link>.</p><p>Data is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6hdr7sqzt">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6hdr7sqzt</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the GENIE Program and the Janelia Research Campus for distributing GCaMP6f, and Lina Koronfel and Soumen Jana for helpful feedback on the manuscript.

However, due to technical limitations, this issue has mainly been investigated in brain slices.

Your article has been reviewed by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Samuel S-H Wang (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use high-speed voltage/calcium imaging paired with sensory stimulation to investigate dendritic integration in vivo in cerebellar Purknje cells. The reviewers were in agreement as to the high quality of the data presented from these technically challenging experiments, and agreed that the results, which provide confirmation of the in-vivo relevance of some well-known brain-slice results (Konnerth/Eilers/Augustine, Wang/Denk/Hausser,.…) were interesting and important.</p><p>However, the reviewers and editor all strongly agreed that the paper is not written clearly enough to convey either the essential findings, or to adequately place them within the context of previous work. Even for these expert reviewers, the paper was a challenging read. One reviewer spoke for us all in saying, &quot;I was never sure that I understood the motivation for experiments or the logic in interpreting results.&quot; A major rewrite and changes to figures is necessary to make this paper interpretable, let alone suitable for the broad <italic>eLife</italic> audience. Because of the extensive and detailed comments of all three reviewers, their full reviews are appended below, with some of the most substantial concerns, and additional points that were raised during consultation, highlighted here.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Presentation:</p><p>Although mainly highlighted by reviewer 2, all reviewers agreed that the data need to be much better contextualized within the scope of the existing literature. Even the significant technical innovations were obscured by the presentation. Better context needs to be provided in the Introduction and Discussion, including more specific and direct references to relevant existing studies. Moreover, please explicitly state the logic, motivation, and interpretation, for each experiment and Figure within the Results section. In particular, as raised by multiple reviewers, the current results stand in contrast to papers by Gaffield and Christie, and this discrepancy needs to be directly addressed. See the comments of reviewer 2 for further specific guidance on presentation.</p><p>Definition/ quantification of supra and subthreshold:</p><p>The &quot;coincidence/integration/threshold&quot; language used throughout seemed vague or overly lofty, and failed to anchor the reader in the questions being addressed. Tying the current results more concretely to existing papers, including work by Wang, Hausser, Medina, Christie, Hull, and others, may help with this problem.</p><p>The general definition of sub and suprathreshold signals was confusing. As pointed out in reviewer 2 point 3, the observation of suprathreshold signals without detectable subthreshold signals is non-intuitive and requires more explanation. The authors seem to presume that this indicates distinct / independent origins in the two cases, but as pointed out by this comment and reviewer 3 point 1, this assumption needs to be directly addressed.</p><p>Relatedly, the manuscript would be strengthened by increased presentation of raw traces and better descriptions of the methods used to determine subthreshold voltage changes. The suggestion of reviewer 1 point 4, to show a histogram of the amplitudes of all single-trial voltage responses, could also help.</p><p>The authors are encouraged to pay close attention to improving the definition, explanation, and interpretation of the subthreshold/ suprathreshold language and presentation throughout the manuscript and the Figures.</p><p>Pharmacology experiments:</p><p>All three reviewers raised questions about the pharmacology experiments. In particular the rationale for analyzing the role of GABA-B rather than GABA-A was not made explicit in the main text, but it needs to be. In addition to the comments on pharmacology in the full reviews below, during consultation reviewer 1 made the following specific suggestion:</p><p>Considering the major role of inhibition in shaping Purkinje cell dendritic excitability, the authors should make some report of this in the main text. In particular, report the rate of spontaneous complex-spike-like events under unperturbed conditions (mean +/- SD and range) and compare it to the frequency events that they observed in the presence of the GABA_A blocker SR95531. This may also help in comparisons with Gaffield et al.</p><p>Please also address the specific points of each reviewer, below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Dendritic coincidence detection in Purkinje neurons of awake mice</p><p>The authors use recently developed methods from their lab for voltage and calcium imaging to study the mechanisms of calcium signal amplification in Purkinje neuron dendrites. This work nicely builds on their impressive previous work, recently published. Now the authors aim to identify mechanisms underlining coincidence detection in vivo during sensory-evoked responses.</p><p>The main discovery, of interactions between subthreshold (parallel fiber) and suprathreshold (climbing fiber / complex spike) signals in Purkinje cell dendrites, is an important contribution to cerebellar physiology. It directly confirms the biological relevance of signals discovered several decades ago in brain slices. The experiments seem to be competently performed, and the manuscript is well written.</p><p>We have some concerns, which can mostly be handled by additional analysis.</p><p>1) The authors address motion artifact, but given that small fluorescence fluctuations are central to the manuscript's claims, extra precaution is warranted. Can the authors demonstrate that animal motion does not contaminate the fluorescence traces, particularly in those as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2?</p><p>2) The authors' finding of in vivo supralinearity in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals driven by coincidence of CF and PF inputs stands in marked contrast to the findings of Gaffield et al., 2018 and 2019 as cited by the authors. Please include in the discussion a section to explain how such discrepant findings are possible.</p><p>3) Figure 1G: are these averages done trial-by-trial (i.e. sorting all depolarizing responses and then averaging them across cells), or cell-by-cell (i.e. averaging all trials for a single cell, then defining it as depolarizing, etc.)? One reason for asking is that in Figure 1H seems to show response properties of individual neurons. It would be better to label the four graphs in Figure 1H according to what they are – maybe each joined line segment is one cell, defined by its average response?</p><p>4) For depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses, it would be helpful to show a histogram of the amplitudes of all single-trial voltage responses, to assess whether the responses are really categorical, as implied by the classification system – or whether the distribution is actually more continuous. This can be done for single cells or grouping all cells.</p><p>5) Subthreshold events are presumably driven by spatially clustered PF inputs. Is there evidence that the subthreshold calcium events are evoked across subcompartments of the imaged dendritic arbor? For example, through spatial scans from hotspots of response. It would be interesting to include a supplementary analysis addressing this issue.</p><p>6) Subsection “Sensory stimulation evokes sub- and suprathreshold signals in Purkinje neuron dendrites of awake mice”: calculate time to peak for these responses, and compare to the suprathreshold responses, as an additional test for a calcium release event. Also calculate t_1/2 of falling signal and compare.</p><p>7) Subsection “Sensory stimulation evokes sub- and suprathreshold signals in Purkinje neuron dendrites of awake mice”: for depolarizing signals, also give the time to maximum signal after stimulus **offset**. Inspection of the traces in Figure 1f suggests to me that the falling time courses of spontaneous and evoked signals have similar time courses when aligned to peak, which suggests the possibility that the evoked signals consist of the summed effect of continuous activation of a subthreshold signaling pathway (for example, perhaps having to do with motor output).</p><p>8) Figure 3E: I would have expected there to be some metabotropic signal (unless the voltage response is important for driving it). Please quantify the calcium signal at the time that the peak signal was observed in Figure 1I, and compare.</p><p>9) Subsection “Sensory stimulation evokes sub- and suprathreshold signals in Purkinje neuron dendrites of awake mice”: Explain why GABA_B mechanisms were tested but not GABA_A mechanisms. That would be an obvious source of hyperpolarizing effects. Even if you have only a few GABA_A experiments, it would be good to report them here.</p><p>10) As per <italic>eLife</italic> data-sharing policies, make simultaneous dendritic voltage and calcium imaging, paired extracellular somatic recordings available to catalyze the development of new algorithms for estimating spike rates from noisy calcium for Purkinje neurons.</p><p>11) It appears that animal subjects consistently widen their eye at onset of the puff stimulus. This is an unexpected result if the animals have no way to predict the stimulus. Can the authors explain this effect? Note that such widening does happen during eyeblink conditioning upon presentation of a novel conditional stimulus such as a tone or light flash. Perhaps there is some click or other salient cue that precedes the puff?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes voltage-imaging and Ca-imaging recordings from Purkinje cell dendrites in mice subjected to air puffs to the eye that trigger eyelid closure. Correlations between the voltage and Ca signals are examined, and the effects of pharmacological agents are assessed, including blockade of AMPA receptors, Na channels, GABA-B receptors, and mGluR1 receptors. The measurements appear sophisticated, but the manuscript is difficult to read. It is hard to know what question is actually under investigation or what will be learned from the measurements. The authors bring up dendritic integration and coincidence detection, which are clearly fundamental to neural coding, but these are such generic terms that in the absence of any context their meaning becomes unclear. It is evident that the authors are interested in the supralinearity associated with voltage-gated conductances, especially Ca conductances, presumably because of the possibility of combinations of stimuli bringing Ca above a threshold to trigger a specific process, but none of this is actually stated or discussed explicitly in the manuscript, nor is it clear how the results bear on this question. There are certainly ongoing discussions in the field about conditions under which climbing fiber stimuli elicit greater or lesser Ca changes in Purkinje dendrites, and some of these papers are cited obliquely but the text does not help the reader understand the controversy, its significance/importance, or how the present results address any aspects of it. Overall, the experiments lack both rationale and interpretation. As such, they come across as a string of observations rather than a coherent study.</p><p>1) The Introduction and Discussion do not provide a clear scientific context for the study. No real question is posed in the introduction, and no in-depth connection to other studies or ideas is offered in the discussion. Even the value of the technical innovations is not explained in a way that makes a reader appreciate their possible significance. As a consequence, the work reads like a report of a series of measurements, but it is hard to know what is learned, except that if there are multiple sources of depolarization, voltage-gated channels enter their typical positive feedback loops and increase the total Ca influx, which stands to reason.</p><p>2) One of the relatively novel aspects of the study is the voltage imaging in conjunction with Ca imaging (which is theoretically valuable), but the manuscript lacks description of what the voltage signals represent. It is stated that the imaging rate is 2 KHz, but it is not clear what the sensitivity, resolution, or calibration might be, in a way that lets the reader know how the deflections relate to action potentials or voltage responses of the cells. What is the smallest voltage change detectable? Is there filtering/distortion and how does it affect the results? Can one read the deflections like an electrophysiological recording? Some of this information might be implicit in Figure 1—figure Supplement 1B, but it is not a focus or even commented on in the main text, as far as I can tell.</p><p>3) Subsection “Sensory stimulation evokes sub- and suprathreshold signals in Purkinje neuron dendrites of awake mice” and beyond. The authors observe suprathreshold signals without detectable subthreshold signals. This idea is non-intuitive and requires some more explanation, or at least should be returned to later on, which as far as I can tell it is not. Presumably such an instance indicates that the supra and subthreshold signals can be completely distinct / independent in their origins, but if so, it raises the question of the conditions that separate and the conditions that link them. While the authors need not figure everything out, they should at least offer some commentary on this point. It also seems at odds with the voltage-calcium relationship that they present at the end of Figure 1.</p><p>4) In the pharmacology studies, it is not clear what kind of criteria the authors used to determine how much drug reached how large of an area. Was drug just applied until there was an effect? What was the point of the lidocaine experiments? It does not seem surprising that blocking either voltage-gated channels or AMPA receptors would largely suppress signals; were these meant as controls for comparing the CGP and AIDA experiments or was there some question as to whether certain effects might actually be insensitive to blockade of Na channel or fast glutamatergic transmission? Also, why were GABA-B receptors chosen (as opposed to GABA-A receptors, or as opposed to other metabotropic receptors)? The experiments require a better rationale.</p><p>5) I think the main discovery is intended to be Figure 6F in which the Ca signal is enhanced when dendritic spikes, presumably from PF activity, follow CF activity, and then Figure 7 makes the case that mGluR1 receptors contribute to the supralinearity. It might be useful to anticipate this link and/or bring up a little more about what is known about mGluR1 signaling in Purkinje cells in both intro and discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors use in vivo two-photon imaging to simultaneously monitor calcium and membrane potential in cerebellar PN dendrites. The sophisticated techniques have been carefully developed by the investigators. The resulting data is compelling, and could ultimately clarify how PN dendrites integrate inputs to modulate postsynaptic activity and synaptic plasticity. The central finding here is that sensory-evoked input drives sub- and supra-threshold signals in PN dendrites. Coincidence of these signals (which is interpreted as originating from PFs and CFs, respectively) produces supralinear calcium responses in PNs. Despite the beauty of the data, and the clear utility of these techniques to investigate the mechanisms of motor learning in the cerebellum, the interpretation of the synaptic source of dendritic signals (particularly PFs) goes beyond the data. However, this central findings are still of great interest to the field.</p><p>1) Based on their previous work the authors state definitively that DS signals are the result of PF input (Roome and Kuhn, 2018). However, they previously &quot;predicted&quot; that PFs drove DS signals. Subthreshold dendritic depolarizations are similarly inferred to originate from PF input without evidence (Subsection “Sensory stimulation evokes sub- and suprathreshold signals in Purkinje neuron dendrites of awake mice”). While DS and subthreshold signals are very likely to originate from PF input, language throughout the manuscript could easily be amended to reflect the fact that this is a conjecture. Alternatively, new experiments could be used to manipulate granule cell activity (optogenetics, DREADDs) or selectively inhibit transmission from PFs (for example, release from PFs, but not CFs, is blocked by the group III mGluR agonist L-AP; Hashimoto and Kano, 1998; Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001). Attributing DCS signals to CFs is more clearly justified.</p><p>2) While the mechanism of DS signals might be over-interpreted, the mechanisms that motivated pharmacological experiments are barely discussed, leaving the reviewer uncertain as to why these experiments are included. For example, GABAB receptors are noted as present at the PF-PN synapse but their localization and function are not discussed, no prediction is made about the effect of blockade, and these experiments are not discussed outside the Results section. In a manuscript full of excellent data, these experiments should be omitted or explained in greater detail.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dendritic coincidence detection in Purkinje neurons of awake mice&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Ronald Calabrese (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor, and two peer reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:<italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript is very improved since the previous submission. It is a thorough and well-done piece of work exploring phenomena that in years past were considered to be near-impossible to investigate, namely the local dendritic integration of coincident synaptic signals. Congratulations are due to the authors for carrying out this technically challenging and biologically convincing study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript from Roome and Kuhn addresses many of the concerns raised by reviewers. Most important, they substantially rewrote the introduction and Discussion sections to provide better motivation for this study, and comparison to past results. Pharmacology experiments that were not central to their findings and distracted from the main argument have been removed. They performed additional experiments using electrical stimulation evoke PF input to PNs, and the results lend credence to the idea that DS signals originate from PF activity, which is central to all of their interpretations. The conclusions they arrive at from these technically impressive experiments, and how these conclusions contrast with previous interpretations, are now more clearly stated in the text. The manuscript is now better-suited for publication in e<italic>Life</italic>.</p><p>1) Subsection “Dendritic spikes triggered by coincident CF and PF synaptic input evoke supralinear calcium signals during sensory stimulation”: Is the point here that under single-DCS conditions, the voltage traces do not show signs of voltage-based amplification, yet the calcium signals still show enhancement? And is the additional source of calcium potentially a source of calcium release or influx that is not voltage-dependent? If so, it would help the reader if you ended the paragraph with an explanatory statement.</p><p>2) Subsection “Dendritic spikes triggered by coincident CF and PF synaptic input evoke supralinear calcium signals during sensory stimulation”, supralinearity of calcium signals: Have you tried doing the same analysis but with the voltage signals?</p><p>3) Subsection “Dendritic spikes triggered by coincident CF and PF synaptic input evoke supralinear calcium signals during sensory stimulation”, Figure 4H/I: The timing-dependence curve here shows peak calcium signals at DCS preceding DS by 0-80 ms. If the DCS were a CF-evoked complex spike only, this would seem to be unexpected – it is opposite to timing-dependence measured in brain slices. Since the graph is made in the same style as a similar test in Wang/Denk/Hausser, the discrepancy comes to mind. It could be tied into the next paragraph, where you then explain that the DCS isn't just a complex spike, but has a pre-depolarization. (Can you report near here in the text the duration of the pre-DCS voltage response for comparison?) Also, the DS comes as the culmination of integration of PF input. Again, discussion of the duration of that signal would be helpful. Generally, a critical comparison with the Wang et al0., PF-before-CF timing-dependence finding would be useful. I think the two findings are consistent, but it needs explaining.</p><p>4) Figure 4H: In the 0-80 ms timing window, the relative calcium peak appears to be largest for 2 or 3 spikelets, and smaller for 4 or 5 spikelets. That is unexpected. Or maybe it is just hard to read the graph. Report statistics on that please.</p><p>5) To address the issue of motion artifacts (reviewer #1 comment 1) the authors suggest that A) the different time-course of voltage and calcium signals argues against motion artifacts underlying these signals, and B) the ability to block both signals with CNQX also suggests synaptic origin. They further state that some analysis techniques were employed to compensate for motion (Subsection “Data analysis”) and mention in the rebuttal that trials were omitted if the mouse made a large movement. Neither of these methods seems to conclusively rule out movement artifacts. This caveat should be mentioned more explicitly in the manuscript.</p><p>6) In general, the textual revisions have greatly improved the readability and logical flow of the manuscript. However, this sentence in the abstract is still confusing and should be rewritten to better align with their new presentation of the data: &quot;Sensory stimulation evokes post-synaptic potentials that coincide with climbing fiber evoked dendritic complex spikes and parallel fiber evoked dendritic spikes.&quot; Where do the spikes come from if not from post-synaptic potentials? Possible solutions would be to replace &quot;coincide with&quot; to &quot;drive&quot;, or something like &quot;Sensory stimulation increases the rate of postsynaptic potentials and dendritic calcium spikes evoked by both climbing fiber and parallel fibers.&quot; The rewritten statement should also be sure to clarify the &quot;these&quot; in the subsequent sentence.</p><p>7) Since the previous submission, another paper has come out that the authors should mention alongside their treatment of the Gaffield and Christie paper in the Discussion: Roh et al., 2020</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59619.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Presentation:</p><p>Although mainly highlighted by reviewer 2, all reviewers agreed that the data need to be much better contextualized within the scope of the existing literature.

This would not be the case for a movement artefact which would lead to similar transients in both channels.

Gaffield et al., do not directly record PF input or voltage in the PN dendrites and so can’t unequivocally make this claim.

Correlations between the voltage and Ca signals are examined, and the effects of pharmacological agents are assessed, including blockade of AMPA receptors, Na channels, GABA-B receptors, and mGluR1 receptors. The measurements appear sophisticated, but the manuscript is difficult to read. It is hard to know what question is actually under investigation or what will be learned from the measurements. The authors bring up dendritic integration and coincidence detection, which are clearly fundamental to neural coding, but these are such generic terms that in the absence of any context their meaning becomes unclear. It is evident that the authors are interested in the supralinearity associated with voltage-gated conductances, especially Ca conductances, presumably because of the possibility of combinations of stimuli bringing Ca above a threshold to trigger a specific process, but none of this is actually stated or discussed explicitly in the manuscript, nor is it clear how the results bear on this question. There are certainly ongoing discussions in the field about conditions under which climbing fiber stimuli elicit greater or lesser Ca changes in Purkinje dendrites, and some of these papers are cited obliquely but the text does not help the reader understand the controversy, its significance/importance, or how the present results address any aspects of it. Overall, the experiments lack both rationale and interpretation. As such, they come across as a string of observations rather than a coherent study.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your comments. We have made significant changes to the manuscript to address your concerns. We believe the manuscript is now much easier to read, both rationale and interpretation of results are clearly stated for a more coherent study. Below are examples of where your concerns have been addressed.</p><p>– In the Introduction we introduce the importance for studying dendritic integration in awake animals and note how useful recent in vivo studies are: “Dendritic integration is fundamental to signal processing in the brain. So far, most studies on dendritic integration were performed in vitro, in the absence of physiological inputs (Larkum et al., 2009; Markram et al., 1997; Stuart and Häusser, 2001; Wang et al., 2000). Equivalent in vivo studies, though technically challenging, are essential for exploring how dendritic integration works in living animals (Chen et al., 2013; Jia et al., 2010; Murayama et al., 2009; Palmer et al., 2014; Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015; Smith et al., 2013).” And we note: “As such, our understanding of the basic components of dendritic integration, the frequency, amplitude, and spatiotemporal distribution of synaptic inputs under physiological conditions, and how these inputs are integrated by dendrites in awake behaving animals, remains incomplete.”</p><p>– In the Introduction we explain why using voltage imaging in awake animals is useful for investigating how dendritic integration works in vivo, and we highlight the limitations that current techniques face in investigating dendritic integration: “Conventional in vivo dendritic recording techniques have faced important challenges for studying dendritic integration. Notably, in vivo patch clamp recordings targeting the soma or smooth dendrites cannot directly measure signals in the most distal dendritic regions that receive the majority of synaptic input, called the “spiny” dendrites. in vivo calcium imaging from spiny dendrites can partially circumvent this issue (Chen et al., 2012). However, this approach measures dendritic calcium events only, and omits the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing voltage signals evoked by synaptic input that do not trigger postsynaptic calcium signals. These synaptic potentials are expected to generate continuous but highly inhomogeneous spatiotemporal dendritic activity in awake animals.” And in the Introduction we explain that “a direct relationship between voltage and calcium signalling in spiny dendrites has not yet been explored in behaving animals”. This is a particularly important novel aspect of this study because we can make a direct correspondence between synaptic input evoked dendritic spikes (voltage) and their resulting calcium signals – and we use this to describe the non-linear dendritic mechanisms (dendritic coincidence detection) during sensory stimulation.”</p><p>– In the Introduction we introduce a form of dendritic integration called dendritic coincidence detection and explain its relevance to PF and CF input onto cerebellar PN dendrites: “Coincidence detection is a basic form of dendritic integration. By detecting coincident synaptic input, it is thought that neurons distinguish important signals from ongoing synaptic activity and modify synaptic strength through synaptic plasticity…”.</p><p>– In the Introduction we give an overview of the most relevant study of dendritic coincidence detection in vitro, and introduce mGluR1s and voltage-dependant dendritic mechanisms: “Specifically, previous in vitro studies identified two dendritic mechanisms by which coincidence detection may occur, that depend on the strength and timing of coincident PF and CF stimulation (Wang et al., 2000). These mechanisms involved voltage-gated calcium channels and/or group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1). How these processes occur during behavior remains to be determined.” Our study follows up directly on these observations made in vitro.</p><p>– In the Introduction we give an overview of most relevant studies in vivo, that (as pointed out by reviewer #1) make contradictory conclusions, and so we highlight the motivation for a more in-depth study into the dendritic coincidence detection process. “in vivo studies using calcium imaging found that climbing fiber evoked calcium signals were enhanced during sensory stimulation (an air puff directed towards the eye) in mice. Notably, graded non-climbing fiber sensory evoked calcium signals were detected and proposed to be driven by PF input (Najafi et al., 2014a; Najafi et al., 2014b). More recent studies however have failed to detect supralinear dendritic calcium signals triggered by coincident PF and CF input during sensory stimulation (Gaffield et al., 2019; Gaffield et al., 2018), challenging the role that PF input might play on the sensory evoked dendritic calcium signals.”</p><p>– In the Introduction we reiterate what is missing from the current literature and explain how our simultaneous voltage/calcium imaging technique allows us to address this: “Coincidence detection of PF and CF input remains to be confirmed in vivo. Specifically, it is unclear if the coincidence detection mechanisms previously described in vitro, also occur in vivo and if so, how they occur and under what behavioral conditions. Furthermore, because of technical limitations, a direct relationship between voltage and calcium signaling in spiny dendrites has not yet been explored in behaving animals.</p><p>Here by combining simultaneous voltage and calcium imaging from the PN spiny dendrites, we record dendritic calcium spikes and post-synaptic potentials to investigate sensory evoked dendritic integration and coincidence detection in PN dendrites of awake mice. Specifically, we investigate the dendritic mechanisms that lead to the enhanced dendritic calcium signals in PNs during sensory stimulation.”</p><p>– To help with interpretation of the results and introduce our approach more gradually we performed additional experiments (now Figure 1), whereby PFs were electrically stimulated and the corresponding dendritic voltage and calcium signals in PNs were described. This provides a more intuitive bridge between the in vitro experiments and ours. It also allows us to introduce the different voltage signals evoked by PF input (depolarizing/hyperpolarizing and DS) and supra-linear calcium signals more systematically. We end the figure with an example of the dendritic coincidence detection process, that we will be describing in the remaining figures (albeit non-physiological at this point).</p><p>– To aid in the interpretation of results and rationale for subsequent stages in the analysis we have now included results sub-headings and a short summary with relevant references for each figure, as follows:</p><p>Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 focus on PF input to PN dendrites primarily</p><p>Figure 1: “Electrical stimulation of PF input evokes graded dendritic voltage and calcium signals and dendritic spikes in Purkinje neuron dendrites.”</p><p>Subsection “Electrical stimulation of PF input evokes graded dendritic voltage and calcium signals and dendritic spikes in Purkinje neuron dendrites”: “Taken together this indicates that dendritic calcium signals evoked by PF synaptic input have multiple calcium sources, as described previously in vitro (Denk et al., 1995; Eilers et al., 1995; Llano et al., 1991a; Sugimori and Llinás, 1990; Wang et al., 2000). These are likely to include calcium influx through mGluR1s, which are expressed at PF-PN synapses (Tempia et al., 2001), voltage dependent dendritic spikes (Denk et al., 1995; Roome and Kuhn, 2018; Usowicz et al., 1992), and calcium released from internal stores (Llano et al., 1994; Llano et al., 1991a; Wang et al., 2000). Since PF and CF synaptic input constitute the only excitatory input to PN dendrites (Llano et al., 1991b), and DS events are blocked by CNQX (Figure 1J see also Figure 2 – figure supplement 7), have no corresponding somatic complex spike associated with CF input (Figure 1H), and are evoked by strong PF stimulation (Figure 1I-K), we conclude that the DS events are generated by strong PF input to the PN dendrites. As a proof of principle for dendritic coincidence detection of PF and CF input, Figure 1K shows an example of how PF input (here evoked by electrical stimulation) following a spontaneous CF event triggers additional DS events and results in a supralinear dendritic calcium signal. While electrical stimulation of GCs may be unphysiological here, this demonstrates how supralinear dendritic calcium signals can be generated by coincident PF and CF input to PN dendrites in vivo.”</p><p>Figure 2: “Sensory stimulation evokes graded depolarizing and hyperpolarizing signals and dendritic spikes in Purkinje neuron dendrites.”</p><p>Subsection “Sensory stimulation evokes graded depolarizing and hyperpolarizing signals and dendritic spikes in Purkinje neuron dendrites”: From the observations made thus far we conclude that sensory stimulation evokes graded depolarizing and hyperpolarizing voltage signals in PN spiny dendrites. On average these dendritic voltage signals have a relatively small amplitude (6.1 ± 9.0 mV), below threshold for triggering voltage gated calcium channels, have a much slower time course compared to dendritic spikes and are blocked by CNQX (Figure 2K and Figure 2—figure supplement 7). Since CF synaptic input reliably evokes rapid dendritic spikes (Roome and Kuhn, 2018) and noting their similarity to the voltage signals evoked by PF stimulation shown in Figure 1I-K, we conclude that these signals originate primarily from PF synaptic input. On average the sensory stimulus evoked PF input gives rise to a depolarizing signal across the PN dendrites (global depolarization) that begins 9 ± 3 ms after stimulus onset, which is consistent with rapid and dense GC responses to sensory stimulation (Giovannucci et al., 2017; Jorntell and Ekerot, 2006). The sensory stimulation evoked hyperpolarizing dendritic signals are also in agreement with an increase in MLI activity, and feed forward inhibition evoked by sensory stimulation (Chu et al., 2012; Gaffield et al., 2018). The trial by trial variability in PN dendritic voltage responses that we detect is likely to result from an interplay between these two synaptic inputs driven by the MF pathway.</p><p>Figure 3: “Sensory stimulation evokes graded voltage dependent dendritic calcium signals in absence of dendritic complex spikes.”</p><p>Subsection “Sensory stimulation evokes graded depolarizing and hyperpolarizing signals and dendritic spikes in Purkinje neuron dendrites”: “This confirms that PF evoked dendritic voltage signals (described in Figure 2) generate voltage dependent dendritic calcium signals in absence of CF input and dendritic spikes.”</p><p>Figure 4, Figure 5 focuses on the interaction of PF and CF input and in particular on evoked dendritic spikes and associated calcium signals.</p><p>Figure 4: “Dendritic spikes triggered by coincident CF and PF synaptic input evoke supralinear calcium signals during sensory stimulation.”</p><p>Subsection “Dendritic spikes triggered by coincident CF and PF synaptic input evoke supralinear calcium signals during sensory stimulation”: “Thus, we conclude that paired DCS + DS signals evoked by coincident CF and PF input act to enhance the dendritic calcium signal supralinearly, and this enhancement is dependent on the timing of paired DCS + DS events. However, paired DCS + DS signals are relatively rare (detected in only 5.9 ± 0.9 % of recordings), suggesting an additional coincidence detection mechanism at work. Taken together, our findings thus far reveal a predominantly depolarizing voltage signal and an increase in dendritic spike activity during sensory stimulation. Both these signals are blocked by CNQX and so originate primarily from coincident excitatory PF and CF synaptic input.”</p><p>Figure 5: “Supralinear dendritic signaling in PN dendrites during sensory evoked stimulation is voltage and mGluR1 dependent.”</p><p>Subsection “Supralinear dendritic signaling in PN dendrites during sensory evoked stimulation is voltage and mGluR1 dependent”: “indicating that the contribution of mGluR1 activity to the calcium signal is specific to sensory evoked calcium signals when CF and PF inputs coincide, and we propose that mGluR1s are activated at PF-PN synapses, where the PF and CF synaptic potentials converge.” And “This suggests that mGluR1 activity enhances spikelet generation during evoked DCS signals.”</p><p>– Similarly, we have now divided the Discussion into the following subheadings:</p><p>In subsection: “Dendritic coincidence detection mechanisms modulate sensory stimulation evoked dendritic calcium signals in Purkinje neuron dendrites”, we summarize the key findings and three forms of dendritic coincidence detection that we observe.</p><p>In subsection: “Functional implications: A solution to the “signal-to-noise” problem.” We discuss the broader functional implications of dendritic coincidence detection at PN dendrites in the cerebellum, and how it fits with the current literature. In particular we refer to two recent reviews (Najafi and Medina, 2013) and (Zang and De Schutter, 2019) that make predictions directly related to our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The Introduction and Discussion do not provide a clear scientific context for the study. No real question is posed in the introduction, and no in-depth connection to other studies or ideas is offered in the discussion. Even the value of the technical innovations is not explained in a way that makes a reader appreciate their possible significance. As a consequence, the work reads like a report of a series of measurements, but it is hard to know what is learned, except that if there are multiple sources of depolarization, voltage-gated channels enter their typical positive feedback loops and increase the total Ca influx, which stands to reason.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made major revisions to the manuscript. We hope and believe the manuscript now reads better and the aims are clearer and fit better with the existing work. We appreciate the reviewer’s advice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) One of the relatively novel aspects of the study is the voltage imaging in conjunction with Ca imaging (which is theoretically valuable), but the manuscript lacks description of what the voltage signals represent. It is stated that the imaging rate is 2 KHz, but it is not clear what the sensitivity, resolution, or calibration might be, in a way that lets the reader know how the deflections relate to action potentials or voltage responses of the cells. What is the smallest voltage change detectable? Is there filtering/distortion and how does it affect the results? Can one read the deflections like an electrophysiological recording? Some of this information might be implicit in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, but it is not a focus or even commented on in the main text, as far as I can tell.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following sentences to help explain.</p><p>Subsection “Electrical stimulation of PF input evokes graded dendritic voltage and calcium signals and dendritic spikes in Purkinje neuron dendrites” “Two photon linescan imaging (2 kHz) recorded dendritic voltage and calcium signals simultaneously from the spiny PN dendrites, predominantly comprising PF-PN synapses, at a depth of 30-70 mm below the dura (Figure 1F). […] The relative fluorescence change of ANNINE-6plus can be used to estimate the average membrane voltage change in PNs with a conversion factor of 2.1 mV/% (Kuhn et al., 2004; Roome and Kuhn, 2018).”</p><p>Regarding the question for the smallest voltage change that can be detected: The voltage sensitive dye reports voltage changes linearly. However, the voltage signal has to overcome the inherent noise of optical measurements. In other words, the more photons can be collected, the smaller voltage changes can be detected. For example, in our previous paper (Roome and Kuhn, 2018) we showed backpropagating action potentials in PN which are about 1mV at a signal-to-noise ratio of about 10:1, but only after extensive averaging. For a detailed description of the method, see Kuhn and Roome 2019. For detailed protocols, see Roome and Kuhn 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Subsection “Sensory stimulation evokes sub- and suprathreshold signals in Purkinje neuron dendrites of awake mice” and beyond. The authors observe suprathreshold signals without detectable subthreshold signals. This idea is non-intuitive and requires some more explanation, or at least should be returned to later on, which as far as I can tell it is not. Presumably such an instance indicates that the supra and subthreshold signals can be completely distinct / independent in their origins, but if so, it raises the question of the conditions that separate and the conditions that link them. While the authors need not figure everything out, they should at least offer some commentary on this point. It also seems at odds with the voltage-calcium relationship that they present at the end of Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>For clarity we no longer use “subthreshold” and “suprathreshold”. Instead, we use “dendritic spikes” and EPSPs and explicitly state if a dendritic spike was detected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the pharmacology studies, it is not clear what kind of criteria the authors used to determine how much drug reached how large of an area. Was drug just applied until there was an effect? What was the point of the lidocaine experiments? It does not seem surprising that blocking either voltage-gated channels or AMPA receptors would largely suppress signals; were these meant as controls for comparing the CGP and AIDA experiments or was there some question as to whether certain effects might actually be insensitive to blockade of Na channel or fast glutamatergic transmission? Also, why were GABA-B receptors chosen (as opposed to GABA-A receptors, or as opposed to other metabotropic receptors)? The experiments require a better rationale.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following paragraph to the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Although it is not possible to confirm the exact concentration of drug applied in vivo, this procedure delivered a volume of solution in the nl range which spreads homogenously throughout the tissue and remained relatively localized (250~500um3) to the injection area. […] An example of drug washout is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 7.”</p><p>We re-wrote the manuscript to make the rational clearer.</p><p>We removed the data involving inhibitory synaptic input because this distracted from the major focus (parallel fiber and climbing fiber input). We agree with the reviewer that this aspect requires further experiments since GABA_A, GABA_B and also calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels in PN dendrites potentially contribute to the hyperpolarizing signals that we see, and we do not yet know how they interact. We are currently exploring this in more detail and will address this in our next manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I think the main discovery is intended to be Figure 6F in which the Ca signal is enhanced when dendritic spikes, presumably from PF activity, follow CF activity, and then Figure 7 makes the case that mGluR1 receptors contribute to the supralinearity. It might be useful to anticipate this link and/or bring up a little more about what is known about mGluR1 signaling in Purkinje cells in both Introduction and Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. We added mGluR1 to the Introduction and Discussion.</p><p>Introduction: “These mechanisms involved voltage-gated calcium channels and/or group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1). How these processes occur during behavior remains to be determined.”</p><p>Subsection “Dendritic coincidence detection mechanisms modulate sensory stimulation-evoked dendritic calcium signals in Purkinje neuron dendrites”: “The third mechanism we describe is through mGluR1 activity (Figure 5), which is known to trigger supralinear calcium signals when PF and CF inputs are conjunctively activated, and thereby modify PF-PN synaptic strength (Sarkisov and Wang, 2008; Wang et al., 2000). It was interesting to find that mGluR1 activity can directly influence dendritic spike generation of the CF input and the time-course of the resulting dendritic calcium signal, specifically during evoked DCS events (c.f. Figure 5H and H). Such an interaction between mGluR1 activity and spikelet generation, has previously been postulated (Tempia et al., 2001) and is likely mediated through their interaction with T and P/Q-type VGCCs (Hildebrand et al., 2009; Otsu et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors use in vivo two-photon imaging to simultaneously monitor calcium and membrane potential in cerebellar PN dendrites. The sophisticated techniques have been carefully developed by the investigators. The resulting data is compelling, and could ultimately clarify how PN dendrites integrate inputs to modulate postsynaptic activity and synaptic plasticity. The central finding here is that sensory-evoked input drives sub- and supra-threshold signals in PN dendrites. Coincidence of these signals (which is interpreted as originating from PFs and CFs, respectively) produces supralinear calcium responses in PNs. Despite the beauty of the data, and the clear utility of these techniques to investigate the mechanisms of motor learning in the cerebellum, the interpretation of the synaptic source of dendritic signals (particularly PFs) goes beyond the data. However, this central findings are still of great interest to the field.</p><p>1) Based on their previous work the authors state definitively that DS signals are the result of PF input (Roome and Kuhn, 2018). However, they previously &quot;predicted&quot; that PFs drove DS signals. Subthreshold dendritic depolarizations are similarly inferred to originate from PF input without evidence (Subsection “Sensory stimulation evokes sub- and suprathreshold signals in Purkinje neuron dendrites of awake mice”). While DS and subthreshold signals are very likely to originate from PF input, language throughout the manuscript could easily be amended to reflect the fact that this is a conjecture. Alternatively, new experiments could be used to manipulate granule cell activity (optogenetics, DREADDs.) or selectively inhibit transmission from PFs (for example, release from PFs, but not CFs, is blocked by the group III mGluR agonist L-AP; Hashimoto and Kano, 1998; Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001). Attributing DCS signals to CFs is more clearly justified.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors want to thank reviewer #3 for her/his insightful comments.</p><p>To address the comments, we performed an additional set of experiments (Figure 1) whereby granule cells were electrically stimulated to evoke PF synaptic input onto PN dendrites (including DS events) and we recorded the resulting dendritic voltage and calcium signals in vivo (see also Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We also revisit the evidence for attributing DS events to PF input first given in (Roome and Kuhn, 2018), showing their blockade by CNQX, and use our DS, DCS sorting algorithm from this study on our paired dendritic/soma recordings to confirm that the DS events have no CF evoked complex spike signal at the soma, and so are evoked by an alternative excitatory synaptic input to the PN dendrites, which leaves only the PFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the mechanism of DS signals might be over-interpreted, the mechanisms that motivated pharmacological experiments are barely discussed, leaving the reviewer uncertain as to why these experiments are included. For example, GABAB receptors are noted as present at the PF-PN synapse but their localization and function are not discussed, no prediction is made about the effect of blockade, and these experiments are not discussed outside the Results section. In a manuscript full of excellent data, these experiments should be omitted or explained in greater detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer #3 and re-wrote the manuscript. We removed the data involving inhibitory synaptic input because this distracted from the major focus (parallel fiber and climbing fiber input). The aspect of inhibition requires further experiments since GABA_A, GABA_B and also calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels in PN dendrites potentially contribute to the hyperpolarizing signals that we see. We do not yet know how they interact – we are currently exploring this in detail.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>1) Subsection “Dendritic spikes triggered by coincident CF and PF synaptic input evoke supralinear calcium signals during sensory stimulation”: Is the point here that under single-DCS conditions, the voltage traces do not show signs of voltage-based amplification, yet the calcium signals still show enhancement? And is the additional source of calcium potentially a source of calcium release or influx that is not voltage-dependent? If so, it would help the reader if you ended the paragraph with an explanatory statement.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is correct – although rather than “not voltage-dependent”, we think “not spike-dependent” is more actuate to state at this point, since the enhancement could be through the voltage-dependent (but non-spiking) mechanism described in Figure 3.</p><p>We added this to the Results section:</p><p>“These differences in the calcium signal time-course are indicative of an additional source of calcium following the evoked DCS, causing a delayed and enhanced calcium peak, while the similarity in spikelet numbers between evoked and non-evoked DCS suggests this additional calcium source is spike-independent. Thus, the enhanced calcium signal is not due to an increase in CF input frequency, or an increase in dendritic spiking, caused by stronger CF input, but though an additional mechanism, that does not require dendritic spikes, such as described in Figure 3, or potentially calcium released from internal stores (Llano et al., 1994; Llano et al., 1991a; Wang et al., 2000).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Dendritic spikes triggered by coincident CF and PF synaptic input evoke supralinear calcium signals during sensory stimulation”, supralinearity of calcium signals: Have you tried doing the same analysis but with the voltage signals?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question and something that requires further experiments to explore in more detail. We hope to include this in the next paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Dendritic spikes triggered by coincident CF and PF synaptic input evoke supralinear calcium signals during sensory stimulation”, Figure 4H/I: The timing-dependence curve here shows peak calcium signals at DCS preceding DS by 0-80 ms. If the DCS were a CF-evoked complex spike only, this would seem to be unexpected – it is opposite to timing-dependence measured in brain slices. Since the graph is made in the same style as a similar test in Wang/Denk/Hausser, the discrepancy comes to mind. It could be tied into the next paragraph, where you then explain that the DCS isn't just a complex spike, but has a pre-depolarization. (Can you report near here in the text the duration of the pre-DCS voltage response for comparison?) Also, the DS comes as the culmination of integration of PF input. Again, discussion of the duration of that signal would be helpful. Generally, a critical comparison with the Wang et al. PF-before-CF timing-dependence finding would be useful. I think the two findings are consistent, but it needs explaining.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this to the Discussion:</p><p>“Here we found the greatest enhancement in calcium signal occurred when the DS followed the DCS by ~ 28 ms, which appears to be in contrast to in-vitro experiments, where the maximal enhancement in calcium signal was detected when PF stimulation preceded CF stimulation (Wang et al., 2000). However, the DS events are due to a culmination of integrated PF input, and so the timing of the DS event does not indicate the onset of PF input, but the moment that the threshold is reached to trigger the DS event. Indeed, we found that on average PF input onset precedes CF input during sensory stimulation by ~ 34 ms, as shown in Figure 2J and Figure 4B, and as indicated by the pre-DCS depolarization in Figure 5C.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4H: In the 0-80 ms timing window, the relative calcium peak appears to be largest for 2 or 3 spikelets, and smaller for 4 or 5 spikelets. That is unexpected. Or maybe it is just hard to read the graph. Report statistics on that please.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistics on this have now been added – the relative calcium peak appears to be independent of the number of DCS spikelets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To address the issue of motion artifacts (reviewer #1 comment 1) the authors suggest that A) the different time-course of voltage and calcium signals argues against motion artifacts underlying these signals, and B) the ability to block both signals with CNQX also suggests synaptic origin. They further state that some analysis techniques were employed to compensate for motion (Subsection “Data analysis”), and mention in the rebuttal that trials were omitted if the mouse made a large movement. Neither of these methods seems to conclusively rule out movement artifacts. This caveat should be mentioned more explicitly in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have now included this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In general, the textual revisions have greatly improved the readability and logical flow of the manuscript. However, this sentence in the abstract is still confusing and should be rewritten to better align with their new presentation of the data: &quot;Sensory stimulation evokes post-synaptic potentials that coincide with climbing fiber evoked dendritic complex spikes and parallel fiber evoked dendritic spikes.&quot; Where do the spikes come from if not from post-synaptic potentials? Possible solutions would be to replace &quot;coincide with&quot; to &quot;drive&quot;, or something like &quot;Sensory stimulation increases the rate of postsynaptic potentials and dendritic calcium spikes evoked by both climbing fiber and parallel fibers.&quot; The rewritten statement should also be sure to clarify the &quot;these&quot; in the subsequent sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed to this:</p><p>“Sensory stimulation increases the rate of post-synaptic potentials and dendritic calcium spikes evoked by climbing fiber and parallel fiber synaptic input.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Since the previous submission, another paper has come out that the authors should mention alongside their treatment of the Gaffield and Christie paper in the Discussion: Roh et al., 2020.</p></disp-quote><p>Done – it is an interesting study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
