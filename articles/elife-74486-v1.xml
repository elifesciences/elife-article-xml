Bacterial cells can adapt to diverse external stresses, such as antibiotic exposure, but can they also adapt to detrimental genetic modification? To address this issue, we visualized the response of individual <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells to deletion of the antibiotic resistance gene under chloramphenicol (Cp) exposure, combining the light-inducible genetic recombination and microfluidic long-term single-cell tracking. We found that a significant fraction (∼40%) of resistance-gene-deleted cells demonstrated a gradual restoration of growth and stably proliferated under continuous Cp exposure without the resistance gene. Such physiological adaptation to genetic modification was not observed when the deletion was introduced in 10 hr or more advance before Cp exposure. Resistance gene deletion under Cp exposure disrupted the stoichiometric balance of ribosomal large and small subunit proteins (RplS and RpsB). However, the balance was gradually recovered in the cell lineages with restored growth. These results demonstrate that bacterial cells can adapt even to lethal genetic modifications by plastically gaining physiological resistance. However, the access to the resistance states is limited by the environmental histories and the timings of genetic modification.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>single-cell analysis</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR1927</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakamoto</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR1653</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Moritoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJER1902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakamoto</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakamoto</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakamoto</surname><given-names>Yuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kanagawa Institute of Industrial Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Moritoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP19J22506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koganezawa</surname><given-names>Yuta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell time-lapse imaging and optogenetical gene recombination system uncovered that bacteria cells can overcome a deleterious genetic change of antibiotic resistance gene deletion depending on their environmental histories.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria in nature are constantly challenged by environmental and genetic perturbations and must be robust against them for survival. Bacterial cells possess programs to adapt or resist such perturbations. For example, under the conditions of nutrient deprivation, <italic>E. coli</italic> and related bacteria provoke RpoS-mediated general stress response and globally change the metabolic and gene expression profiles to protect themselves from the stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battesti et al., 2011</xref>). DNA damage also induces SOS response, which promotes both DNA repair and mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Walker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taddei et al., 1995</xref>). If the mutations in essential genetic elements remain unrepaired, their influence will be propagated to cellular phenotypes or even cause cell death. How rapidly new genetic changes alter cellular phenotypes and whether they always give rise to the same phenotypes in given environments are fundamental questions in genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ryan, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, such time-dependent and redundant genotype-phenotype correspondences are usually deemed negligible or insignificant in most genetics analyses.</p><p>However, the evidence suggests that biological systems can buffer or compensate for the impact of genetic changes at the cytoplasmic and physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Waddington, 1942</xref>). For example, specific molecular chaperons could hinder genetic variations from manifesting as morphological and growth phenotypes in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rutherford and Lindquist, 1998</xref>), plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Queitsch et al., 2002</xref>), and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fares et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, the loss of biological functions caused by genetic changes can be compensated for by modulating the RNA and protein levels of the mutated or other related genes in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>). In <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, the expression noise of mutant sporulation regulator results in the partial penetrance of its influence to spore-forming phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eldar et al., 2009</xref>). These observations across diverse organisms suggest that phenotypic consequences of genetic modifications can be modulated based on environmental and physiological contexts, which may promote the survival and evolution of the organisms.</p><p>Despite these experimental implications, it remains elusive whether bacterial cells can circumvent even lethal genetic modifications such as antibiotic resistance gene deletion under antibiotic exposure. Furthermore, how cells initially respond to the genetic changes and how their physiological and phenotypic states are modulated in longer timescales are poorly characterized. However, addressing these issues requires precisely defining the timings of genetic changes and tracking individual cells for a long period to unravel their phenotypic transitions and consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we resolve these technical issues by combining the photoactivatable Cre (PA-Cre) light-inducible genetic recombination technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawano et al., 2016</xref>) and microfluidic long-term single-cell tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). We induced a pre-designed deletion of chromosomally encoded and fluorescently tagged drug resistance gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> directly in the microfluidic device. The results show that all of the resistance-gene-deleted cells under continuous drug exposure showed a decline in growth in 5–7 generations, but a fraction of the resistance-gene-deleted cells gradually restored their growth without additional mutations. In contrast, no cells restored growth when the same deletion was introduced 10 hr or more in advance before drug exposure. Therefore, bacterial cells can physiologically adapt to lethal genetic modifications. However, its feasibility depends on environmental histories, the timings of genetic modifications, and the severity of the antibiotic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Resistance gene deletion in <italic>E. coli</italic> by blue-light illumination</title><p>To investigate the response of individual cells to antibiotic resistance gene deletion, we constructed an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) tagged with mCherry red fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). CAT confers resistance to chloramphenicol (Cp) by acetylating Cp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shaw, 1967</xref>). The <italic>mcherry-cat</italic> resistance gene was integrated on the chromosome along with the upstream and downstream <italic>loxP</italic> sequences so that the resistance gene could be excised by Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also introduced the PA-Cre recombination system, which consists of split Cre-recombinase fragments, called CreC and CreN, attached to p-Magnet (p-Mag) and n-Magnet (n-Mag) monomers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawano et al., 2015</xref>). p-Mag and n-Mag are heterodimers derived from the fungal photo-receptor, Vivid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawano et al., 2015</xref>), which heterodimerize upon blue-light illumination. In the PA-Cre system, blue-light illumination leads to heterodimerizations of p-Mag-CreC and n-Mag-CreN fragments and recovers Cre recombination activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawano et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, this system allows us to induce the resistance gene deletion at arbitrary timings by blue-light illumination. The original PA-Cre system was designed for use in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawano et al., 2016</xref>); we thus replaced the plasmid backbone and the promoter for use in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Live-cell monitoring of phenotypic transitions in response to gene deletion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic drawing of an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, YK0083.

To test this hypothesis, we illuminated batch cultures of YK0083 cells by blue light for 30 min under exposure to 15 µg/mL of Cp and plated them on agar plates. Colony PCR confirmed that all the cells that lost mCherry fluorescence were also <italic>cat</italic>-negative even when the deletion was introduced under Cp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This result strongly suggests that the growth-restored cells do not retain the <italic>cat</italic>-resistance gene as designed. The fraction of resistance-gene-deleted cells after 30-min blue-light illumination monotonically decreased in batch culture containing 15 µg/mL of Cp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that growth-restored resistance-gene-deleted cells grew more slowly than non-deleted cells.</p><p>In addition, we sampled the culture media flowing out from the microfluidic device and obtained cell populations derived from a single or few ancestral cells by limiting dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). PCR analysis confirmed the lack of <italic>cat</italic> gene in the non-fluorescent cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing of the cell populations obtained by limiting dilution showed no additional mutations in four out of five non-fluorescent cell populations tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). One point mutation was present in one cellular population, but this mutation did not affect the MIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). To calculate the probability that all of these five non-fluorescent cell populations had originated from resistance-gene-deleted growth-halted cells, we analyzed the regrowing dynamics of both growth-restored and growth-halted cell lineages after removing Cp in the microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). We found that 91.3% (73/80) of growth-restored cell lineages recovered fast growth after the exposure to 15 µg/mL of Cp for 72 hr. On the other hand, the proportion of cells that recovered growth was lower for the growth-halted cell lineages; only 69.3% (140/202) of growth-halted cell lineages could resume growth. The growth after first cell divisions were as fast as that for the non-deleted cells and was indistinguishable between the growth-restored and growth-halted cell lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Taking the fraction of growth-restored cells among the resistance-gene-deleted cells and the proportions of growth-recovered cells after Cp removal into account, we found that the probability that all the five cell populations were derived from growth-halted cell lineages was 5.5% (see Materials and methods).

Importantly, such adaptation was not observed when an identical genetic modification was introduced long before Cp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, whether cells could gain physiological resistance in the absence of a resistance gene depends on the timing of resistance gene deletion and environmental histories that the cells experienced.</p><p>The analyses revealed that the <italic>cat</italic> gene deletion under Cp exposure disrupted the stoichiometric balance of ribosomal proteins (RplS and RspB) and that the balance was gradually recovered alongside growth restoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

Furthermore, the balance was tightly regulated within a narrow range in the fast-growing non-deleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Therefore, the recovery of ribosomal stoichiometric balance might contribute to restoring growth against the deletion of the resistance gene.</p><p>It still remains elusive how individual cells recovered the ribosomal stoichiometric balance under continuous Cp exposure. A plausible scenario might be that the multi-layered and interlinked feedback regulations on ribosomal components entailed stoichiometry readjustments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yamagishi and Nomura, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nomura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lindahl and Zengel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keener and Nomura, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kaczanowska and Rydén-Aulin, 2007</xref>). Many ribosomal proteins bind to their own mRNAs, in addition to the target ribosomal RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nomura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lindahl and Zengel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keener and Nomura, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kaczanowska and Rydén-Aulin, 2007</xref>). These regulatory fractions of ribosomal proteins bind to their mRNAs and inhibit their own translation and that of other genes in the same operons. The competition among rRNA and mRNA for these regulatory ribosomal protein components is considered to regulate the stoichiometry of ribosomal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nomura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lindahl and Zengel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keener and Nomura, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kaczanowska and Rydén-Aulin, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that these innate homeostatic mechanisms of ribosomes might have been exploited by cells to restore growth. It is also important to note that the operons for ribosomal proteins comprise genes encoding RNA polymerase subunits, translation initiation/elongation factors, DNA primase and protein transmembrane transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lindahl and Zengel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keener and Nomura, 1996</xref>). Hence, the feedback regulations in ribosomes could mediate changes in the global expression profiles, which might have helped the cells find growth-permissive states in the presence of Cp.</p><p>The necessity for a small amount of residual resistant proteins at the onset of Cp exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) might suggest that experiencing such barely-tolerable intracellular states is crucial for gaining physiological resistance. The importance of near-critical states for survival might be related to the phenomenon that pre-treatment with a sublethal concentration of antibiotics increases the fraction of persister cells in response to the subsequent treatments with lethal antibiotic concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dörr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Johnson and Levin, 2013</xref>). We also remark that the physiological adaptation to the antibiotic stress caused by resistance gene deletion might be related to <italic>adaptive resistance</italic>. Adaptive resistance is a phenomenon in which bacterial populations progressively enhance their resistance levels (MICs) when subject to gradual increases of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">George and Levy, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sánchez-Romero and Casadesús, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Motta et al., 2015</xref>). Adaptive resistance is achieved physiologically rather than genetically since the enhanced resistance is lost when the antibiotic is removed. Therefore, it is plausible that growth-restoration against resistance gene deletion might be realized by some mechanisms common to adaptive resistance. The fact that no cells recovered growth when the resistance gene was deleted at a high Cp concentration (30 µg/mL) also suggests a link to adaptive resistance; the speed of antibiotic stress intensification must be sufficiently slow for the cells to gain resistance physiologically. However, we also remark that it is nontrivial whether bacterial cells respond to the intensification of antibiotic stress caused by internal resistance-gene deletion similarly to the stress caused by gradual increases of external antibiotic concentrations. Although our results might support the hypothesis that physiological adaptation to genetic perturbations that sensitize cells to some antibiotics is feasible when bacterial cells exhibit adaptive resistance to those drugs, more careful examinations under diverse experimental conditions should be needed to understand the identity of these internally and externally intensified antibiotic stress. Additionally, we note that adaptive resistance has been investigated at the population level, not at the single-cell level, in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">George and Levy, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sánchez-Romero and Casadesús, 2014</xref>). Consequently, it remains elusive whether only a small fraction of cell lineages in the populations acquire resistance and dominate the populations by selection, or most cells can progressively enhance resistance in adaptive resistance. In this study, using the mother machine microfluidic device, we were able to quantify the fractions of cell lineages that restore growth against resistance-gene deletion and the changes of the fractions depending on the historical conditions. Such single-cell-level quantitative information would be valuable for unraveling the windows of phenotypic space and the ranges of conditions permitting physiological adaptation to antibiotics.</p><p>Though experimental evidence of history-dependent physiological adaptation to lethal genetic perturbations is still limited, the experimental strategy combining optogenetic recombination and single-cell lineage tracking is applicable for the modification of other genes or other cell types, including mammalian cells. Such approaches might offer new insights into the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial and cancer cells. We remark that growth-restoration of resistance-gene-deleted cells must have been hardly recognized in batch-culture experiments because the fractions of these slow-growing cells decrease in time by selection within cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, our study also confirms the advantage of microfluidic time-lapse microscopy for unraveling long-term adaptation phenomena that occur in slow-growing cell lineages. Gaining a more comprehensive picture of resistance evolution might help us design new drug treatment strategies to counter or control the emergence and spread of resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The mCherry and mVenus fluorescence images were acquired every 10 min with the excitation of 100 ms in the experiments with ribosome reporter strains. IPTG was removed from the flowing media after blue-light illumination to avoid unintended gene deletion.</p><p>Blue-light illumination on the microscope for gene deletion experiments was regulated by an independent controller. We used a tape LED (7.2 mW, wave length:464∼474 nm, 60 LED/1 m, LED PARADISE) as the blue-light source and surrounded the mother machine device on the microscope stage with this tape LED. The LED light was switched on and off with a timer (REVEX).</p><p>Image analysis was performed using ImageJ Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/">http://fiji.sc/</ext-link>). Image registration was performed by HyperStackReg described in MoMA Macro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kaiser et al., 2018</xref>). Cell segmentation was semi-automated and retouched manually using iPad Pro Sidecar. Semi-automated segmentation and tracking Macro reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>) were used in this study. The data from image analysis were further analyzed using Python 3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</ext-link>) with some general packages, including NumPy, SciPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, FastDTW, and JupyterLab.</p><p>The transitions of mCherry-CAT fluorescence intensities and elongation rates in single-cell lineages were classified using hierarchical clustering in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. The full-length single-cell lineage data were used in this analysis. The similarity of each pair of time series was measured by dynamic time warping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salvador and Chan, 2007</xref>). Hierarchical clustering is agglomerative; the averaged dynamic time warping was used when similarity to another time series or cluster was evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell sampling from the mother machine and whole-genome sequencing</title><p>After time-lapse observations performed with the mother machine, we switched the flowing media to the M9 medium containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA and no Cp.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is already known that Chloramphenicol treatment leads to adaptive resistance (the MIC is higher when the cells are exposed to a gradually increasing concentration of the drug), so please articulate better the relevance of this work: what was a gap in previous studies? How does this study address it?</p><p>2) The analysis of cells recovered from the microfluidic devices allows to conclude that all mCherry negative cells have lost the cat resistance cassette (Figure S6), however only a small number (n=5) of cells were analysed to draw this conclusion. Please provide additional evidence to support the conclusion that all mCherry negative cells are also cat negative.</p><p>For example:</p><p>a. pcr-analysis of additional isolates to confirm that all mCherry negative cells are also cat negative (e.g., n=10 would reduce the chance of only having growth-halted populations to less than 1%), Or</p><p>b. Use imaging data to quantify the proportion of growth-halted cells that resume growth during the recovery phase. If this is sufficiently rare, the present genomic analysis would be sufficient.</p><p>3) Strengthen the characterization of growth restored cells: please homogenize the way growth is displayed (generation time in min, in hours, elongation rates) so as to clarify how much growth-restored cells grow. Do they return to normal growth after chloramphenicol is removed?</p><p>4) Test a broader range of chloramphenicol concentrations for Figure 2 to assess if the key effect is observed at higher doses.</p><p>5) The part of the manuscript on ribosomal stoichiometry is the most speculative part of the paper.

How does this study address it?</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out, adaptive resistance is a phenomenon in which bacterial populations progressively enhance their resistance levels (MICs) when subject to gradual increases of antibiotics (George and Levy, <italic>J. Bacteriol.</italic>, 1983; Adam <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>BMC Evol. Biol.</italic>, 2008; Sanchez-Romero and Casadesus, <italic>PNAS</italic>, 2014; Motta <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>PLoS ONE</italic>, 2015). Adaptive resistance is achieved physiologically rather than genetically since the enhanced resistance is lost when the antibiotic is removed. Therefore, adaptive resistance might be related to the phenomenon identified in this study; it is plausible that growth-restoration against resistance-gene deletion and increases of MICs in adaptive resistance might be realized by some common mechanisms.</p><p>However, it is nontrivial whether bacterial cells respond to the intensification of antibiotic stress caused by internal resistance-gene deletion similarly to the stress caused by gradual increases of external antibiotic concentrations. Therefore, rather than the recapitulation of the known phenomenon, our results should be considered the first support for the hypothesis that physiological adaptation to genetic perturbations that sensitize cells to some antibiotics is feasible when bacterial cells exhibit adaptive resistance to those drugs. However, we still believe that such a conclusion should be drawn after more careful examinations of shared changes in cellular states provoked by internally and externally intensified antibiotic stress under diverse experimental conditions, which remains to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Additionally, we remark that adaptive resistance has been mostly investigated at the population level, not at the single-cell level, in the previous studies. Consequently, it remains elusive whether only a small fraction of cell lineages in the populations acquire resistance and dominate the populations by selection or most cells can progressively enhance resistance in adaptive resistance. In this study, using the mother machine microfluidic device, we were able to quantify the fractions of cell lineages that restore growth against resistance-gene deletion and the changes of the fractions depending on the historical conditions. Such single-cell-level quantitative information would be valuable for unraveling the windows of phenotypic space and the ranges of conditions permitting physiological adaptation to antibiotics.</p><p>We now state the new insights that the results provide and their potential relevance to adaptive resistance in Discussion (L259-L281).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The analysis of cells recovered from the microfluidic devices allows to conclude that all mCherry negative cells have lost the cat resistance cassette (Figure S6), however only a small number (n=5) of cells were analysed to draw this conclusion. Please provide additional evidence to support the conclusion that all mCherry negative cells are also cat negative.</p><p>For example:</p><p>a. pcr-analysis of additional isolates to confirm that all mCherry negative cells are also cat negative (e.g., n=10 would reduce the chance of only having growth-halted populations to less than 1%), Or</p><p>b. Use imaging data to quantify the proportion of growth-halted cells that resume growth during the recovery phase. If this is sufficiently rare, the present genomic analysis would be sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing our attention to an important issue. As suggested, we confirmed that all mCherry negative cells were also <italic>cat</italic> negative by additional experiments and analyses.</p><p>a. In addition to the previous correspondence check shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2C (previously, Figure S2C), we conducted a batch culture experiment in which the YK0083 cells were illuminated by blue light for 30 minutes under Cp exposure and plated on agar plates without Cp. We checked the deletion of <italic>cat</italic> gene by PCR for 46 colonies, finding that 24 colonies were <italic>cat</italic> negative and that all of these colonies were mCherry negative (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). On the other hand, the other 22 <italic>cat</italic>-positive colonies were all mCherry positive (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). This result confirms that mCherry fluorescence correctly reports the presence/deletion of <italic>cat</italic> resistance gene. Considering the frequency of growth-restored cells among resistance-gene-deleted cells (~40%), this result constitutes the firm evidence that the growth-restored non-fluorescent cells did not possess the <italic>cat</italic> resistance gene. We now mention this result in Results (L84-L89).</p><p>b. We also visualized regrowing dynamics of both growth-restored and growth-halted cell lineages after removing Cp in the microfluidics device (Figure 3—figure supplement 4 and Video 3). We found that 91.3% (73/80) of growth-restored cell lineages recovered fast growth after the exposure to 15 µg/ml of Cp for 72 hours. On the other hand, the recovery frequency was lower for the growth-halted cell lineages; only 69.3% (140/202) of growth-halted cell lineages could resume growth. The growth after first cell divisions were as fast as that of the non-deleted cells and was indistinguishable between the growth-restored and growth-halted cell lineages (1.07 h mean generation time; see Figure 3—figure supplement 4D). Taking the fraction of growth-restored cells among the resistance-gene-deleted cells and the proportions of growth-recovered cells after Cp removal into account, we found that the probability that all of the five <italic>cat</italic>-negative cell populations analyzed by whole-genome sequencing had originated from the growth-halted cell lineages was as low as 5.5% (L99-L111).</p><p>We believe that the new evidence provided by these additional experiments and analyses would more strongly support the conclusion that growth restoration of the resistance-gene-deleted cells was achieved physiologically. We now explain these new results in the Results section along with new figures and video (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, Figure 3—figure supplement 4, and Video 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Strengthen the characterization of growth restored cells: please homogenize the way growth is displayed (generation time in min, in hours, elongation rates) so as to clarify how much growth-restored cells grow. Do they return to normal growth after chloramphenicol is removed?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mixed usage of the time units in the original manuscript; we now fix the time unit to hours.</p><p>As pointed out in the comment (2) of Reviewer #1, generation time and elongation rate represent different characteristics of cellular growth. We therefore believe that showing both data is more appropriate than homogenizing the way growth is displayed. However, we noted that the previous manuscript did not include the transitions of the elongation rate of YK0083 cells after resistance-gene-deletion with the horizontal axis representing absolute time (not scaled to generations). We now show this plot in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>Growth restoration is more evident when the growth parameters are grouped by generations after blue light illumination. However, such representation is not applicable to growth-halted cell lineages as they stopped cell divisions only in several generations after resistance gene deletion. Therefore, the comparison of growth between growth-restored and growth-halted cell lineages is possible only in the absolute time unit, and we decided to show the transitions in both generation and absolute time.</p><p>As we wrote in our reply to Essential Revision 2, 91.3% of the growth-restored deleted cells returned to normal growth after Cp removal (Figure 3—figure supplement 4 and Video 3). Growth-halted cells also returned to normal growth, though the regrowing cell frequency was lower (69.3%) than growth-restored cells. We now explain these growing dynamics of resistance-gene-deleted cells in Results (L99-L107).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Test a broader range of chloramphenicol concentrations for Figure 2 to assess if the key effect is observed at higher doses.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we deleted the <italic>mcherry-cat</italic> resistance gene of YK0083 under the exposure of a two-fold higher concentration of Cp (i.e., 30 µg/ml). 33.1% (361/1092) of the cells illuminated by blue light lost the resistance gene, and we found that none of them restored growth, unlike the previous observation under the exposure of 15 µg/ml. This result suggests that sufficiently high concentrations of Cp can prevent adaptation to resistance-gene deletion.</p><p>Related to the comment in Essential Revision (1), this result is again reminiscent of adaptive resistance, in which gradual increases of antibiotics concentration are required to gain resistance to higher concentrations. The similarity of these two adaptive phenomena might suggest that intensification of internal antibiotic stress must be sufficiently slow for the cells to enhance their resistance physiologically.</p><p>We now mention this new experimental result at a higher concentration of Cp in the Results section (L123-L127) and discuss the possible importance of slow intensification of antibiotic stress for physiological adaptation (L265-L268).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The part of the manuscript on ribosomal stoichiometry is the most speculative part of the paper. Reviewers would like the authors to tone down the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that recovery of ribosomal stoichiometry still remains as correlative observations with growth restoration after resistance-gene deletion. Corrections were made to the statements that could be misinterpreted as asserting a causal relationship. (L203-L204, L223-L225, and L241-L242).</p></body></sub-article></article>
