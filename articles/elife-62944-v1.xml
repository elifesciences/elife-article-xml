memory trace formation. The majority of large spines also contains synaptopodin (SP), an actin-modulating and plasticity-related protein. Since SP stabilizes F-actin, we speculated that the presence of SP within large spines could explain their long lifetime. Indeed, using 2-photon time-lapse imaging of SP-transgenic granule cells in mouse organotypic tissue cultures we found that spines containing SP survived considerably longer than spines of equal size without SP. Of note, SP-positive (SP+) spines that underwent pruning first lost SP before disappearing. Whereas the survival time courses of SP+ spines followed conditional two-stage decay functions, SP-negative (SP-) spines and all spines of SP-deficient animals showed single-phase exponential decays. This was also the case following afferent denervation. These results implicate SP as a major regulator of long-term spine stability: SP clusters stabilize spines, and the presence of SP indicates spines of high stability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>granule cell</kwd><kwd>spine apparatus</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>entorhinal denervation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 1080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deller</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE2741/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Del Turco</surname><given-names>Domenico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE 551/13-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deller</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Max Planck Research School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yap</surname><given-names>Kenrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Long-term imaging of dentate granule cells reveals that the presence of synaptopodin within large spines, rather than their size, conveys long-term stability to large spines.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dendritic spines are protrusions found on the majority of excitatory neurons in vertebrate brains. They form characteristic axo-spinous synapses and play an important role in integrating afferent synaptic activity with postsynaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yuste and Denk, 1995</xref>). The geometry of a spine, in particular, the length of the spine neck and the size of the spine head are considered structural correlates of synapse function: While the length of the spine neck has been linked to the biochemical and electrical isolation of the spine compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yuste et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yuste, 2013</xref>), the size of the spine head has been positively correlated with AMPA-receptor density, synaptic strength and spine stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McKinney, 2010</xref>). At the behavioral level, a critical role of spines in learning, memory formation and cognition has been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Segal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourne and Harris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McKinney, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>) and, indeed, a recent study has shown that spines are both necessary and sufficient for memory storage and memory trace formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The function of spines does not only depend on the shape and size of their outer membranes but also on the molecular machinery within the spine compartment. A cellular organelle unique to spines is the spine apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gray, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spacek, 1985</xref>), which consists of stacked endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and which modifies spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Korkotian and Segal, 2011</xref>) and second messenger dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cugno et al., 2018</xref>). Synaptopodin (SP; GenBank accession number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_001109975.1">NM_001109975.1</ext-link>) is an essential component of the spine apparatus and is required for its formation. It is an actin-modulating protein found in a 100 kDa isoform in telencephalic neurons and a 110 kDa isoform in kidney podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mundel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asanuma et al., 2005</xref>). SP is almost linear because of its high proline content and contains several phosphorylation sites and two PPXY motifs for protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mundel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asanuma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asanuma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faul et al., 2007</xref>). Expression of SP in mice starts postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mundel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Czarnecki et al., 2005</xref>), increases with maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Czarnecki et al., 2005</xref>) and declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sidhu et al., 2016</xref>). SP-deficient mice show deficits in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jedlicka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vlachos et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Korkotian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jedlicka and Deller, 2017</xref>) and adult SP-deficient mice show impaired spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deller et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The function of SP in spines is not limited to the formation of spine apparatus organelles. SP also affects the actin spinoskeleton either directly by stabilizing F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mundel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>) or indirectly via binding to alpha-actinin-2, Cdc42, RhoA, or myosin V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asanuma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kremerskothen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asanuma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faul et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yanagida-Asanuma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jedlicka and Deller, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Konietzny et al., 2019</xref>). It is likely that SP, via its connection to the actin cytoskeleton, is also connected to the post-synaptic density (PSD), which plays an important role in synaptic stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">El-Husseini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ehrlich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoshihara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, SP has been suggested to influence the geometry and stability of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deller et al., 2000a</xref>). Indeed, short-term imaging experiments performed in dissociated cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Konietzny et al., 2019</xref>) and acute slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) implicated SP in plasticity-induced spine head expansion. We have now expanded on these previous studies, which focused on the short-term effects of SP on spine geometry, and have used 2-photon time-lapse imaging of identified SP+ and SPâÂ granule cell spines to address the question of whether SP is important for long-term spine stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synaptopodin is present in large granule cell spines in vivo</title><p>Previous work reported a positive correlation between the plasticity-related protein SP and spine head size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Since SP-deficient mice show deficits in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jedlicka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grigoryan and Segal, 2016</xref>), we speculated that SP-deficient neurons might also have smaller spine head sizes, providing a structural explanation for the plasticity phenotype. Accordingly, we analyzed and compared spine head size in Alexa568-filled wildtype and mutant granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) but could neither detect differences in average spine head sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) nor in spine head size distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Next, we re-visited the relationship between SP and spine head size that had been suggested earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Using Alexa 568-injected granule cells from eGFP-SP-tg mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vlachos et al., 2013a</xref>), we first studied the fraction of SP-positive spines and found SP clusters inÂ ~14% of spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Spines containing SP (SP+) were significantly larger than spines without SP (SP-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and showed a right-shifted cumulative frequency distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In addition, SP cluster size was positively correlated with spine head size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), demonstrating that large SP clusters are typically found in large spines. We conclude from these observations, that SP is indeed tightly correlated with spine size. However, lack of SP did not affect average spine head size, suggesting that SP is either not a major regulator of spine head size or that its loss is compensated for in the SP-deficient mouse.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SP is associated with large granule cell spines in adult mouse dentate gyrus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Granule cell located in the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus of a SP-knock-out (SP-KO) mouse intracellularly filled with the fluorescent dye Alexa568 (magenta; fixed tissue).

Since SP is an actin-modulating plasticity-related protein, it has been speculated that SP could also regulate spine stability (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deller et al., 2000a</xref>). As previous reports have shown that large cortical spines are more stable than small spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kasai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bourne and Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McKinney, 2010</xref>), we speculated that the presence of SP in these spines could explain or at least contribute to their higher stability. To test this hypothesis, we used an organotypic tissue culture preparation, which allowed us to follow not only spine geometry â which can also be done in vivo â but also the dynamics of SP clusters within spines over time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Synaptopodin is present in large granule cell spines in organotypic tissue cultures</title><p>Organotypic tissue cultures of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus were generated from eGFP-SP-tg mice.

To visualize single granule cells and their spines, tissue cultures were virally transduced on 2â3 days in vitro (DIV) using an AAV2-tdTomato virus. After approximately three weeks in vitro, tdTomato expressing granule cells were imaged and spines with SP (SP+) and without SP (SP-) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). SP+ spines also contained SP-positive spine apparatus organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Based on these two functions the distributions of long-term survival times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>) of the SP- and SP+ spine populations were calculated (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Finally, a data-driven simulation of spine survival was performed to test whether the survival times of the two spine populations are different. This approach revealed â within the parameters used â that SP- and SP+ spines differ significantly in their survival times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>Since SP+ spines are larger than SP- spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2H</xref>), the observed effect on spine survival could simply be the result of differences in head size between the two groups. As large spines have been shown to be more stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kasai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bourne and Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McKinney, 2010</xref>), this would be a straightforward explanation. We controlled for this possibility by comparing the survival times of SP+ and SP- spines of equal head size (matched pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Even under these highly constrained conditions, the difference in spine survival between SP+ and SP- spines was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In line with this, the overall distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), the relative frequency distributions of spine survival times of the calculated total populations of spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), as well as simulations of spine survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) were comparable to those found for all spines, thatÂ is non-size-matched spines. Finally, we tested whether the time point at which SP had entered a spine plays a role. For this we compared âtimedâ SP+ spines, which had just become SP+ (between day â1 and 0) with SP- spines that had stayed SP- (between day â1 and 0). The survival curve of these âtimedâ SP+ spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) was again highly similar to the curve of the total population of SP+ spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Synaptopodin is correlated with the long-term survival of spines irrespective of spine head size</title><p>Since the stability of large spines is higher than the stability of small spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kasai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bourne and Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McKinney, 2010</xref>), we wondered whether this difference could be linked to the presence of SP within large spines. This appeared to be a possibility since SP is tightly associated with the population of large and stable spines and rare in the group of small and less stable spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Should the increased stability of large spines depend on SP we made two testable predictions: (1) If SP is present in small spines, it should increase survival of these spines irrespective of their size, and, (2) if SP is absent from large spines, these spines should be pruned faster in spite of their large size. To test these predictions, we subdivided SP+ and SP- spines into four size classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; very small, small, medium and large spines) and compared the survival times of SP- and SP+ spines belonging to each of these classes.

The size of the surviving SP+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and SP- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) spines did not change significantly during the two-week observation period, in line with our finding that spine head size per se is not the major determinant of spine stability. We then looked specifically at the spines that were lost, since our analysis had revealed a shift from SP+ spines to SP- spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This shift suggested that SP+ spines go through a SP- state before pruning. Since we followed the fate and the SP content of every spine over the two-week imaging time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>), we could test this hypothesis. First, we determined the SP content of the 16% of spines that were lost within one day, thatÂ is between days â1 and 0. All of these pruned spines were SP-, in line with our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Next, we predicted that SP+ spines should not be lost without going through a SP- state. For this analysis, we looked at all spines that were initially SP+, thatÂ is spines SP+ at day 0, and focused on those SP+ spines that were pruned sometime during the observation period. Of these spinesÂ ~Â 94% were SP- prior to their pruning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). In the rare cases (nÂ =Â 2;~6%), in which a SP+ spine seemingly disappeared without passing through a SP- state, the two observation time points were several days apart (e.g., between day 0â3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>), making it highly likely that we missed a transitory SP- state of these spines prior to their pruning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Loss of SP from spines does not cause pruning</title><p>After finding the above evidence that SP is removed from spines prior to their pruning, we wondered whether removal of SP from a spine is inexorably followed by the loss of this spine. If this were the case, all SP+ spines losing their SP cluster should disappear. This hypothesis could be falsified since we observed several SP+ spines (nÂ =Â 10) undulating between a SP+ and SP- state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Thus, SP can be removed from a spine and reintroduced into a spine without the spine being pruned. Of note, the changes in SP content were accompanied by bidirectional changes in head size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We also observed SP- spines, which became SP+, lost SP, and became SP+ again at a later stage (nÂ =Â 8; data not shown). Taken together, we conclude from these observations that loss of a SP cluster from a spine does not cause pruning of that spine.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>SP+ spines are more stable than SP- spines even after denervation</title><p>Finally, we tested whether the presence of SP within a spine is still correlated with higher spine stability after spines have lost their afferent innervation.

In this model, a radioisotope undergoes decay and forms an unstable intermediary. This intermediary decays again into a stable isotope. The two decay processes have different decay time constants.

The new SP- spine would then disappear with the time constant Ïspine, thatÂ is the same time constant determined for the SP- spines above:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mi>%</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>â¡</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>â¡</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>â¡</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In this equation, the variable Y denotes the percentage of SP+Â spines surviving up to day t starting with 100% of SP+ spines present at day zero.

A molecule potentially involved in these biological phenomena is the actin-modulating protein SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mundel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deller et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jedlicka and Deller, 2017</xref>). Using a combination of mouse genetics, viral transduction and 2-photon time-lapse imaging, the effects of SP on spine geometry and stability were analyzed for two weeks in an organotypic environment. Our major findings can be summarized as follows: (1) SP is primarily present in large spines. (2) SP+ spines of all sizes are more stable than SP- spines. (3) Spines of SP-deficient animals decay like SP- spines. In these mutants, a compensatory increase in spine turnover is observed. (4) SP+ spines that later underwent pruning passed through a SP- state. These spines followed a conditional two-stage decay kinetic. (5) SP+ spines are more stable than SP- spines following denervation. Together, our results implicate SP as a major regulator of spine stability. Since SP is present inÂ ~65% of large (&gt;0.8 Âµm<sup>2</sup>) spines, its presence in these spines could explain their higher stability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McKinney, 2010</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The presence of SP rather than spine head size is associated with spine stability</title><p>The biological functions of SP in spines have not been fully understood. After effects of SP on spine density and spine length were ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deller et al., 2003</xref>), roles in spine head expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) and in the maintenance of an expanded spine head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Konietzny et al., 2019</xref>) were suggested. In our study, we could confirm the association between SP and spine head size in an organotypic environment and asked how SP affects spines over longer time periods. Since SP is tightly associated with large spines and since these spines are believed to be more stable than small spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasai et al., 2010</xref>), we wondered whether SP could be the âmolecular longevity factorâ within this subgroup of stable spines. Our imaging data suggest that SP could indeed play such a role and that it is not the size of a spine per se that is important for stability but rather the presence of SP within a spine. This conclusion is supported by the following observations: (1) Small spines (0.3â0.55 Âµm<sup>2</sup> head area) containing SP have a long lifetime and a median survival of 12.8 days. Large spines (&gt;0.8 Âµm<sup>2</sup> head area) without SP have a median survival time of 7.7 days. Thus, small SP+ spines are more stable than large SP- spines. (2) Comparison of the median survival times of SP- spines revealed that their median survival time was similar among all size groups (i.e., very small, small, medium and large) and much shorter than the median survival time of SP+ spines of any size. Finally, (3) all spines, including the large spines, of SP-deficient animals decayed like SP- spines and had short median survival times. Although this does not fully exclude a small effect of spine size on spine survival, forÂ example large spines may need time to shrink prior to their removal (see next paragraph), our data show that the presence of SP within a spine is a much more reliable indicator of its stability than the size of its head.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>SP+ spines that are pruned pass through a SP- state and shrink in size</title><p>Two weeks of time-lapse imaging of identified SP+ spines made it possible to study their fate: Single SP+ spines surviving for the entire time period, SP+ spines losing and regaining SP, as well as SP+ spines that were pruned could be identified and analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>). From these multidimensional time-lapse data, we could draw additional conclusions: First, from the fact that some spines lose and regain SP with time, we concluded that loss of SP from a spine is not by itself sufficient to tag a spine for pruning. Rather, such spines seem to re-enter the large pool of SP- spines from which new SP+ spines can be recruited. Second, by following SP+ spines that were pruned during the observation period, we could show that in almost all cases, these spines went through a SP- state before they disappeared. Thus, our data suggest that removal of the spine stabilizing protein SP is a necessary step before the actinÂ cytoskeleton of a spine can be degraded and the spine can be pruned. Third, in line with the fact that SP is associated with large spines, we observed that spines losing SP also shrank in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>). In the case of spines changing their SP content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3</xref>) this also resulted in corresponding head size changes. In agreement with these observations, we found that SP+ spines designated to be pruned follow a conditional two-stage decay function, similar to the one described for radioactive isotopes in Physics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateman, 1910</xref>): The first stage is the slow âdecayâ of SP+ spines into a SP- state. The second stage is the pruning of these SP- spines, which goes as fast as for initially SP- spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>SP-deficient neurons homeostatically compensate for the loss of SP with increased spine formation</title><p>The role of SP in the regulation of spine stability is further supported by data from SP-deficient mice. Granule cells of these mice exhibited spines that decayed like SP- spines. In addition, SP-deficient granule cells compensated for the reduced stability of spines by increasing their spine formation and thereby their spine turnover ratio. This finding suggests that SP-deficient neurons homeostatically compensate for the loss of stability by upregulating their spine formation. This may explain why loss or overexpression of SP does not seem to affect spine densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>).

Extant data suggest that a stabilizing effect of SP on actin can be caused by several direct and indirect interactions: (i) SP directly binds to actin and can induce actin aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mundel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asanuma et al., 2005</xref>), (ii) SP interacts with alpha-actinin-2 and in the presence of both proteins long, unbranched and highly stable actin filaments are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asanuma et al., 2005</xref>), (iii) SP protects actin filaments from disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), potentially by blocking signals inducing actin fragmentation. For kidney podocytes, interactions of SP with Rho-GTPase family members have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asanuma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yanagida-Asanuma et al., 2007</xref>). In neurons, Rho-GTPases regulate the maintenance of spines and RhoA in particular promotes prolonged spine enlargement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tashiro and Yuste, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murakoshi et al., 2011</xref>). By protecting RhoA from proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asanuma et al., 2006</xref>), SP could increase spine stability. (iv) Finally, SP may stabilize spines indirectly via the spine apparatus organelle and its function as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Korkotian and Segal, 2011</xref>). Higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients could stabilize spines via the postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor caldendrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mikhaylova et al., 2018</xref>), or via activation of kinases, which, in turn, inactivate actin-depolymerizing proteins such as cofilin (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borovac et al., 2018</xref>, for review). Of note, cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borovac et al., 2018</xref>) and SP (this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bas Orth et al., 2005</xref>) are found in similar locations within the spine compartment, hinting at some kind of crosstalk between these proteins. In sum, SP could influence the stability of actin pools and/or actin treadmilling in spines via several mutually non-exclusive direct and indirect mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for synaptic plasticity and long-term memory</title><p>SP plays an important role in Hebbian- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamazaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holbro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jedlicka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jedlicka and Deller, 2017</xref>) and homeostatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vlachos et al., 2013b</xref>) forms of synaptic plasticity.

In the context of Hebbian plasticity, SP appears to be part of the downstream machinery executing functional and structural changes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jedlicka and Deller, 2017</xref>, for review). At the functional level, SP plays an important role as an essential molecule of the spine apparatus organelle, which acts as a local calcium source and sink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Korkotian and Segal, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Korkotian et al., 2014</xref>) and which regulates AMPA-R trafficking to excitatory postsynapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>).

Since SP+ spines are large and strong spines exhibiting a high density of AMPA-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>), loss of SP from only this fraction of spines suffices to impair Hebbian plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jedlicka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grigoryan and Segal, 2016</xref>), underlining its role in Hebbian forms of synaptic strengthening.</p><p>At the behavioral level, learning has been linked to spine stability: Prior to learning, spines are dynamic and rapidly turned over. After instructive experience, however, spines are more stable and their synapses have been strengthened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, at the network level, neuronal ensemble formation and long-term memory require strong and stable synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koleske, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rogerson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Segal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yokose et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, we have linked the stability of spines to the presence of the actin-modulating protein SP. This makes it attractive to speculate that synapses requiring a high degree of stability, forÂ example synapses after a learning experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>) or synapses binding excitatory neurons together into functional ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yokose et al., 2017</xref>), require SP as their stabilizer. Conversely, a reduction in spine stability has been reported in aged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Voglewede et al., 2019</xref>) and pathologically altered brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Halpain et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spires-Jones et al., 2007</xref>).

background) and Thy1-eGFP-SP x SP-KO mice eGFP-SP-tg, C57BL/6J background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vlachos et al., 2013b</xref>) were used for the ex vivo analysis of granule cell spines in fixed slices. eGFP-SP-tg and SP-KO mice were used for the preparation of organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures. eGFP-SP-tg mice were obtained by cross-breeding homozygote Thy1-eGFP-SP-transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vlachos et al., 2013a</xref>) with SP-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deller et al., 2000a</xref>). Thus, eGFP-SP-tg mice used for tissue culture preparation were monoallelic for eGFP-SP and devoid of endogenous SP. Adult mice used for fixed brain tissues were bred and housed at mfd Diagnostics GmbH, Wendelsheim, while mice used for organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures were bred and housed at the animal facility of Goethe University Hospital Frankfurt. Animals were maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the German animal welfare law and had been declared to the Animal Welfare Officer of the Medical Faculty (Wa-2014â35). Every effort was made to minimize the distress and pain of animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Intracellular injections of granule cells in fixed tissue</title><p>After delivery, animals were kept in an in-house scantainer for a minimum of 24 hr. Animals were killed with an overdose of intraperitoneal Pentobarbital and subsequently intracardially perfused (0.1 M Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)). Tail biopsies were obtained after death to re-confirm the genotype. Brains were taken out immediately after perfusion, post-fixed (18 hr, 4% PFA in 0.1 M PBS, 4Â° C), washed trice in ice-cold 0.1 M PBS, sectioned (250 Âµm) on a vibratome (Leica VT 1000 s) and stored at 4Â°C until use.</p><p>Intracellular injections of granule cells in fixed slices were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Germroth et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hick et al., 2015</xref>), with modifications. Hippocampal slices were placed in a custom-built, transparent, and grounded recording chamber filled with ice-cold 0.1 M PBS. The chamber was attached to an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51WI; 10x objective LMPlanFLN10x, NA 0.25, WD 21 mm) mounted on an x-y translation table (Science Products, VT-1 xy Microscope Translator). Sharp quartz-glass microelectrodes (Sutter Instruments, QF100-70-10, with filament) were pulled using a P-2000 laser puller (Sutter Instruments). Microelectrodes were tip-loaded with 0.75 mM Alexa568-Hydrazide (Invitrogen) in HPLC-grade water (VWR Chemicals, HiPerSolv CHROMANORM) and subsequently back-filled with 0.1 M LiCl in HPLC-grade water. Microelectrodes were attached to an electrophoretic setup via a silver wire and 500 Mâ¦ resistance. The tip of the microelectrode was navigated into the granule cell layer using a micromanipulator (MÃ¤rzhÃ¤user Wetzlar, Manipulator DC-3K). A square-wave voltage (1 mV, 1 Hz) was applied using a voltage generator (Gwinstek SFG-2102). Granule cells were filled under visual control for at least 10 min or until no further labeling was observed. Injected sections were fixed (4% PFA in PBS, overnight, 4Â°C, in darkness), washed in 0.1 M PBS and mounted on slides (Dako fluorescence mounting medium, Dako North America Inc). Only granule cells with dendrites reaching the hippocampal fissure were used for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Organotypic tissue cultures</title><p>Organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures (300 Âµm thick) were prepared from postnatal 4â5 days old eGFP-SP-tg mice of either sex as previously described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Del Turco and Deller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vlachos et al., 2012</xref>).

Sections (8â10 Î¼m) were cut on a cryostat (Leica CM 3050 s) and mounted on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foil metal frames (Leica Microsystems). Sections were fixed in acetone (â20Â°C, 30â45 s), stained with 0.1% toluidine blue (Merck) at room temperature for 20 s before rinsing in ultrapure water (DNase/RNase free, Invitrogen) and dehydrated in ethanol. PET foil metal frames were mounted on a Leica LMD 6000 B system (Leica Microsystems) and the granule cell layer was dissected using a pulsed UV laser beam. In a second experiment using virus-injected eGFP-SP-tg and wildtype cultures, only areas of the granule cell layer injected with the virus were harvested. The micro-dissected material was collected in microcentrifuge tube caps placed underneath the frame. Caps contained guanidine isothiocyanate-containing buffer (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) and 1% Î²-mercaptoethanol (AppliChem GmbH). Micro-dissected tissue samples were stored at â80Â°C until further processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA extraction, reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen) and subsequently reverse transcribed using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturerâs recommendations.

Local injections were performed on cultures using an injection pipette pulled from thin-walled borosilicate capillaries (Harvard Apparatus, 30â0066). The pipettes were held by a head stage with a HL-U holder (Axon Instruments) and positioned using a micro-manipulator (Luigs and Neumann). Approximately 0.05â0.1 Âµl of AAV2-hSyn-tdTomato was injected directly into the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus using a syringe. Tissue cultures were visualized with an upright microscope (Nikon FN1) equipped with a camera and software (TrueChrome Metrics) using a 10x water immersion objective lens (Nikon Plan Fluor, NA 0.30), which allowed precise injection of the AAV2 into the DG. Injections were performed 2â3 days after the tissue cultures were prepared.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fluorescence in-situ hybridization</title><p>Organotypic tissue cultures (OTC) were fixed at 26 days in vitro (DIV) in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at room temperature (RT) followed by an incubation in 30% sucrose overnight at 4Â°C. Slices of 30 Âµm were cut with a cryostat (CM3050S, Leica), collected in 2x SSC (LONZA AccuGEN) and subsequently incubated in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) for 20 min at 85Â°C, washed several times in 2x SSC, and prehybridized for 2 hr at 60Â°C with hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5x SSC, 5% dextran sulfate, 500 Î¼g/ml DNA MB grade from sperm [Roche], 250 Î¼g/ml t-RNA [SigmaâAldrich] and 1x Denhardtâs [SigmaâAldrich]). After heat treatment of Synaptopodin fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) probe for 5 min at 85Â°C, sections were incubated with Synaptopodin probe in hybridization buffer (1:500) overnight at 60Â°C. Several washing steps (2x SSC for 10 min at RT, 2x SSC/50% formamide [AppliChem] for 15 min at 60Â°C, 0.1x SSC/50% formamide for 15 min at 60Â°C, 0.1x SSC for 15 min at 60Â°C, and TN buffer [0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl; pH 7.4] for 5 min at RT) were performed before blocking solution (1% blocking reagent [Roche] in TN buffer) was added for 30 min at RT. After blocking, anti-Digoxigenin-POD (1:2000 in blocking solution; Roche) was added to sections for 2 hr at RT. Sections were washed several times with TNT (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100) and incubated in TSA-Plus Cyanine 3 System (Perkin Elmer) diluted in amplification solution (1:50) for 10 min in the dark at RT. After several washing steps with TNT, sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 to visualize nuclei and finally mounted in Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Dako, Agilent Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Tissue cultures were fixed for 2 hr in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (CB) containing 4% PFA, 4% sucrose, 15% picric acid and 0.5% glutaraldehyde. After four washes in CB, the fixed cultures were resliced to 40 Âµm. Following a wash with 0.1 M tris-buffered saline (TBS), free floating sections were treated with 0.1% NaBH<sub>4</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS for 10 min to remove unbound aldehydes. Sections were then blocked with 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in TBS for 1 hr at room temperature.</p><p>For detection of SP, sections were first incubated with rabbit anti-SP primary antibody (1:1000; Synaptic Systems) in 2% BSA and 0.1 M TBS for 18 hr at room temperature followed by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit Immunoglobin G secondary antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in 2% BSA and 0.1 M TBS for 75 min at room temperature. After three washes with TBS, sections were incubated in avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC-Elite, Vector Laboratories) for 90 min at room temperature and treated with diaminobenzidine solution (Vector Laboratories) for 2â15 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated for silver-intensification in 3% hexamethylenetetramine (Sigma-Aldrich), 5% silver nitrate (AppliChem) and 2.5% di-sodium tetraborate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 60Â°C, followed by 0.05% tetrachlorogold solution (AppliChem) for 3 min and 2.5% sodium thiosulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 min with three washes after each step using distilled water.</p><p>After immunostaining, sections were washed in 0.1 M CB, treated with 0.5% OsO<sub>4</sub> (Plano) in 0.1 M CB for 30 min, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and then 1% uranyl acetate (Serva) in 70% ethanol for 60 min, before being embedded in Durcupan (SigmaâAldrich) for ultrathin sectioning (60 nm thickness). Sections were collected on single slot Formvar-coated copper grids.</p><p>Images of the dentate molecular layer in tissue cultures prepared from eGFP-SP-tg mice (nÂ =Â 3) were captured with a Zeiss electron microscope (Zeiss EM 900) at 20,000x magnification. Spine head area and area of corresponding spine apparatus were manually outlined with the Polygon tool and quantified using ImageSP Viewer (Version 1.2.4.22, SysProg). Statistical analysis was done with GraphPad Prism six software. Using the same materials, images of the dentate molecular layer taken at 12,000x magnification were used to determine the percentage of spine apparatuses within spines. Only dendritic profiles that could be reliably identified as spines were counted (nÂ =Â 172). Spines were defined as dendritic profiles with synaptic specializations but without mitochondria. A spine apparatus was considered present, if one dense plate and two ER-cisterns were identified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Confocal microscopy of fixed hippocampal slices</title><p>Confocal imaging of fixed dendritic segments from identified, Alexa568-labeled dentate granule cells in the outer molecular layer (OML) of the suprapyramidal blade was done with an Olympus FV1000 microscope and a 60x oil-immersion objective (UPlanSApo, NA 1.35, Olympus) using FV10-ASW software with 5x scan zoom at a resolution of 1024 Ã 1024 pixels. To ensure localization in the OML, 3D image stacks of dendritic segments (0.25 Âµm z-axis step size) were taken at a distance of 10â50 Âµm from the hippocampal fissure. Crossing dendritic segments or branch points were avoided to facilitate spine attribution to a given segment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>2-Photon time-lapse imaging of tissue cultures</title><p>Live imaging of tdTomato-labeled granule cells with eGFP-tagged SP clusters was done using an upright 2-photon microscope (Scientifica MPSLSC-1000P, East Sussex, UK) equipped with a 40x water immersion objective (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat, NA 1.0) and a Ti-sapphire mode-locked laser (MaiTai, Spectra-Physics) tuned to a wavelength of 1000 nm to excite both eGFP and tdTomato. The membrane insert carrying the cultures was placed in a petri dish containing warm imaging buffer consisting of 129 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4.2 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES buffer solution, 0.1 mM Trolox, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin, and pH 7.4. 3D image stacks of dendritic segments (~50â80 Âµm in length) located in the middle to outer molecular layers (15â25 images per stack, 0.5 Âµm z-axis step size) were acquired using ScanImage 5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>) with 8x digital zoom at a resolution of 512 Ã 512 pixels, thatÂ is 0.07 Âµm x 0.07 Âµm in the focal plane. The same dendritic segments across imaging sessions were identified using nearby landmarks and neighboring dendrites. Imaging time was minimized (only one dendritic segment per culture was imaged) to minimize the risk of phototoxic damage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Image processing and data analysis</title><p>The confocal as well as 2-Photon images obtained were deconvolved with Huygens Professional Version 17.10 (Scientific Volume Imaging, The Netherlands, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://svi.nl">http://svi.nl</ext-link>).

Figures were prepared using commercial software. Image brightness and contrast were adjusted.</p><p>Dendritic spines of all shapes were assessed manually on z-stacks of dendritic segments in the middle to outer molecular layers. Only protrusions emanating laterally in the x-y directions, not above or below the dendrite, and exceeding the dendrite for at least five pixels (0.35 Âµm for 2-Photon; 0.2 Âµm for confocal) were included for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holtmaat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vlachos et al., 2012</xref>). We refrained from using shape-based categories in our quantitative analyses, forÂ example stubby, thin, mushroom spines, because spines are dynamic and exhibit a continuum of sizes and shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trommald and Hulleberg, 1997</xref>). We rather focused on the spine head, since spine head size is a critical functional parameter that can be reliably measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kasai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>), and SP has been shown to be associated with spine head size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) but not spine length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deller et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>For spine head size and SP cluster size measurements, the maximum cross-sectional area of the spine head or SP cluster in one of the x-y planes within the z-stack was measured. A spine was considered SP+ if the SP cluster overlapped with the spine head and/or neck in both the x-z and y-z directions when scrolling through the z-stacks. For spine stability analysis, we examinedÂ ~15 Âµm long subsegments exhibiting minimal dendritic distortion over the total observation period. Individual spines were re-identified at consecutive points in time based on their relative positions to nearby landmarks and neighboring spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holtmaat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vlachos et al., 2012</xref>). The presence or absence of a particular spine at a certain time point was verified by scrolling through the z-stacks to avoid misclassification due to rotation of the dendritic segment.</p><p>Spine turnover ratio representing the fraction of all observed spines that appear and/or disappear during the total imaging period was measured (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holtmaat et al., 2009</xref>). Spine turnover ratio = (Ngained + Nlost) / (2 x Ntotal), where Ngained is the number of spines gained between the initial observation time point at day â1 and the final observation time point at day 12, Nlost is the number of spines lost between day â1 and day 12, and Ntotal is the total number of spines that were observed at one or more points in time. Spine formation ratio = (Ntotal â Ninitial) / (Ntotal), where Ninitial is the number of spines observed at day â1. Spine loss ratio = (Ntotal â Nfinal) / (Ntotal), where Nfinal is the number of spines observed at day 12.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical tests and n-values are indicated in figure captions. Statistical tests were chosen based on the experimental conditions, thatÂ is (1) matched-pairs, (2) two independent groups, (3) multiple matched-pairs, or (4) multiple independent groups. Thus, statistical comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon signed rank test with Pratts modification accounting for ties and zero differences in case of comparing integer values (differences between matched pairs under the null hypothesis of no difference), MannâWhitney U-test (comparing two independent groups), Friedman test (for differences between matched pairs of multiple groups), and Kruskal-Wallis test (comparing multiple groups). Dunnâs multiple comparison test was applied following one of the two latter tests in case of significant p-values. All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 6. If p-values were less than 0.05 the null hypothesis was rejected. Statistical values were expressed as meanÂ Â±Â standard error of mean (SEM), unless otherwise stated. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Modeling of spine survival and loss</title><p>The fractions of surviving spines observed at distinct time points were fitted to different models of spine survival and loss, respectively (see results). Curve fitting was performed with the user-defined fitting function of GraphPad Prism 6. Decay functions were fitted to the data weighted by 1/Y<sup>2</sup> using least squares fit. The resulting spine loss curves correspond to the probability that single spines experience a particular survival time. Therefore, the loss curves represent the cumulative density function of spine survival times. We derived the distribution of spine survival times underlying the spine loss curves from the inverse loss curves. Since there is no analytical solution for the inverse of the conditional two-stage decay, the inverse loss functions (i.e. the inverse cumulative density functions of spine survival times) were obtained from the spine loss models numerically as follows: According to the diverse loss models, the fractional survival was calculated for 10<sup>7</sup> equally spaced time points ranging from zero to 30 times the longest time constant of the respective decay function. For each of 10<sup>5</sup> equally spaced bins of fractional survival, the mean of the corresponding times (X-axis) was defined as the survival time corresponding to one minus the center of the respective fractional survival interval. The distribution of survival times displayed in the figures was derived as the histogram of these values using a bin size of 100. The median as well as the 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of these distributions are also displayed in the figures. Statistical comparisons of median survival times between groups were based on the medians of 10 random samples of sizes equal to the number of observed spines per group using the MannâWhitney U-Test. Derivation of survival times was performed using LabView 2019 (National Instruments).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Charlotte Nolte-Uhl and Anke Biczysko for technical support and Dr. Stephan W Schwarzacher for critical discussion of our data.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although the reviewers agree that this study helps us further understand the function of Synaptopodin, they find that your study does not offer sufficient novel mechanistic insights and that there are a number substantial issues that need to be addressed. If, however, you fully address the review comments and add sufficient amounts of additional data or analysis to substantially improve the manuscript, we would be willing to re-assess the study, as a new submission with a new manuscript number and submission date, although it is your choice. We realize that many labs are closed for some period and that additional experiments could be delayed for months, thus we are willing to consider a (re)submission regardless of the date.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>The work by Yap et al. consists of a major effort by Deller and colleagues over the past two decades, to understand the role of synaptopodin (SP) in the formation and plasticity of dendritic spines in rodent dentate granular neurons. The factors involved in regulation of dendritic spines morphology and functions have been the focus of numerous studies in the past two decades, employing a variety of tools, from molecular to high power imaging methodologies, both in-vivo and in-vitro. Formation, density, size, shape and longevity of spines have been associated with functional plasticity of neurons and networks, learning and memory. Conflicting results in this field probably reflect differences in brain regions, preparation, age, optical resolution and past history of the neuron.</p><p>An enigmatic organelle, the spine apparatus, regained intensive interest, since it was associated with SP, which can be visualized in live tissue. The group of Deller made already significant contributions in the field to demonstrate that SP is related to spine plasticity. The present work, using normal and SP-KO mice, clarifies how SP may be related to the morphological properties of the spines. Time-lapse two photon microscopy of organotypic slices, Yap et al. were able to follow individually identified dendritic spines over two weeks in culture. Carefully analyzing changes in the morphology and SP in thousands of spines, they present some very appealing observations on the role of SP in the development, and more importantly, in pruning of spines of granular neurons. Briefly, they show that SP-containing spines (SP+) live longer that SP(-) spines, that they are more likely to reside in larger spines, consistent with the idea that large spines are loci of &quot;memory&quot;. They suggest that pruning of SP+ spines is a two stage process, involving first the disappearance of SP, followed by shrinkage of the spine. SP(-) spines shrink in a mono-exponential time constant. Thus, they propose that SP is a major regulator of spine longevity (=memory).</p><p>The study is extensive, carefully conducted and clearly presented, and should be accepted for publication; provide the authors address the following issues:</p><p>In earlier studies by Deller et al., no difference was found in distribution of spine size between SPâ and SP+ spines. Assuming that SP+ spines decay much slower than SPâ spines, one would expect an increase in spine size/density in SP+ cells, but they did not find this. Any explanation?</p><p>In earlier studies, SPâ slices produce or do not produce as large LTP as SP+ slices. This may be an age-dependent effect. In the present in-vivo study, they do not report any age factor. Did they look for this? In any case, they cannot say categorically that SPâ animals are less able to learn.</p><p>In the current study, they do not separate between mature spines, filopodia, stubby or short spines. Could they comment on the possible SP dependent conversion of stubby spines to mature spines?</p><p>Neither do they comment on spine density in the different conditions. Is it possible that dendritic spine density changes contribute to the different proportion of spine shape across age?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper by Yap et al. is generally well written. The message is clear and experiments are straightforward and well conducted. I do not have any major concern on the manuscript. One thing the author should add, in either Discussion or Introduction, is the description of protein domain structure and possible interaction partners, in the context of observed effect on spine turnover. I realize that it is not the specialty of the authors but still it is important to give some idea. Interestingly, synaptopodin accumulate at the bottom of spine head. In view of its function, possible mechanism to stabilize spine may be discussed. This reviewer knows of only one other example which shows such distribution â cofilin (Bosch, 2014). Another thing the authors can add to Discussion or Introduction is about regulation of synaptopodin by neuronal activity. Although it is beyond the current study, actin is dynamically regulated during synaptic plasticity. Therefore, it is important to understand how synaptopodin is regulated and what the mechanism might be.</p><p>Having said this, the Discussion is lengthy. The authors do not need to repeat the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript continues the studies of these authors on the actin-stabilizer synaptopodin (SP). This manuscript describes a role for SP in the stability of dendritic spines in the OML of dentate granule cells in organotypic slice cultures. SP+ spines were assessed in Thy1-EGFP-SP mice on a SP KO background The authors have previously showed that SP is a component of the spine apparatus and SP KO mice have deficits in synaptic plasticity. The main new finding in this manuscript is that larger spines contained SP and correlated with longer survival than SPâ spines as measured with two-photon microscopy. The experiments appear carefully executed and add to descriptions of synaptopodin in spines, but represent detailed, but modest, extension of prior data. The observations regarding loss of spines based on following spines over time is interesting, but does not provide particular mechanistic insight as the paper is entirely SP-centric without consideration for other molecular interactions in spines. There are also a few issues of interpretation as below.</p><p>1) SP was expressed in SP KO mice and labeled approximately 14% of the total spines in tissue sections, but without changing the average size, perhaps not totally surprising (although the authors state it is surprising), given that only a small fraction of the spines were labeled. Given the small fraction of SP-labeled spines, it seems the authors conclusion that SP is not &quot;â¦a major regulator of spine head sizeâ¦&quot; is not proven by this data. The same concern applies to the organotypic slice date where only 8% of spines were SP+.</p><p>2) The authors claim that SP was not overexpressed based on mRNA of the culture, but presumably only a fraction of cells were labeled. Thus measurements of virally-tranfected cells would be more convincing.</p><p>3) Portions of the Discussion reiterate the results and could be substantially shortened.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The actin-modulating protein Synaptopodin mediates long-term survival of dendritic spines&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. These include modifications in the text to address the concerns raised by reviewer 3 and to a lesser extent reviewer 2. These are important revisions to place your results in the context of the field. The editor will evaluate your response and your manuscript will not be sent back to the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors adequately revised the paper according to my suggestions. It should be ready for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall this is a well done revision that in my mind addresses all of the prior reviewer concerns. The finding that Synaptopodin influences spine stability is well supported by comparisons of SP+ versus SPâ spine lifetimes as well as comparisons between WT and KO mice. Overall these findings are of interest to the field, but it is slightly disappointing there is no mechanistic insight accompanying the observations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors expand on their previous studies of the protein synaptopodin (SP), an essential component of the spine apparatus, an organelle that modulates second messenger signaling in dendritic spines and implicated in F-actin. Following their findings on a short term role for SP in plasticity-induced spine head expansion, here the authors examine a long term role for in spine stability by time lapse imaging of individual spines on dentate granule cells in organotypic and acute mouse hippocampal slices.</p><p>Tracking a fluorescently-tagged SP fusion protein, they show that the small percent of spines that are SP positive (SP+) skew large, and are the most stable fraction of the spine population. The presence of SP in spines correlates well with prolonged survival, irrespective of spine size, and even after denervation. SP+ spines that underwent pruning first lost synaptopodin, following a two-stage exponential decay kinetics, vs SPâ spines that follow a single exponential decay. Based on a mathematical analysis, they present a model compatible with the pruning of SP+ spines via a two-stage process in which they first lose their synaptopodin, converting to SPâ spines that are then pruned with the same time constant as spines that start SP-. The data summarizing these findings is clearly presented, and represents meticulously done and well-controlled experiments.</p><p>There are only two points that diminish my enthusiasm.</p><p>1) First, aside from Figure 6, the findings presented are all correlative, and the model is based on this correlative data. Figure 6 presents a spine size/stability analysis in SP KO neurons, showing that spines in the KO essentially behave as SPâ spines in the WT. This figure is the only one that tests the requirement for SP for spine stability, and on its own is not definitive, especially given the homeostatic compensation that partially counteracts the constitutive SP loss. Considering this, some of the statements they make are a bit too strong. For example, the heading for Figure 5 &quot;Presence of SP in spines determines their long-term survival&quot;. The data shown in this figure is that presence of SP is correlated with long-term survival, there is no test of sufficiency that would justify use of the word determines. The heading is similarly misleading: âSynaptopodin increases survival of small, medium and large spinesâ. The authors should carefully peruse the manuscript and correct all such statements that claim more than a correlation unless it is explicitly tested (such as in Figure 6).</p><p>2) A second disappointment is that the entire paper is oddly removed from a deep literature related to other molecular determinants of spine stability. In particular, the relationship between PSD95 presence and spine size and stability has been comprehensively analyzed, and PSD95 presence is considered one of the best predictors of spine stability. While I would not ask for any mechanistic analysis connecting SP to other molecules previously shown to determine spine stability, I am surprised that neither the Introduction or Discussion even mention the molecular precedents for their finding.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62944.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Any explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer refers to our publication in 2003 (Deller et al., 2003). In this publication we used Golgi-staining to label single pyramidal cells in CA1, CA3, cortex and striatum in wildtype and SP-deficient mice. We tested for differences in spine density and spine length (investigator blind to genotype), which we did not observe. Later, three other labs also investigated spine densities under conditions of SP-overexpression (Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008; Inokuchi lab; Figure 4), SP-knock-down (Vlachos et al., 2009; Segal lab) and SPdepletion in spines using dominant-negative Myosin V mutations (Konietzny et al., 2019; Mikhaylova lab) and confirmed that SP does not affect spine densities.</p><p>The most likely explanation for the fact that no differences in spine densities are observed in mice with altered SP-levels appears to be a homeostatic mechanism that counteracts changes in SP-mediated spine stability: Decreases in spine stability are compensated for by an increase in spine formation and turnover rate (seen in Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). This explains why the loss of ~10% stable spines in SP-deficient mice does not cause a decrease in spine density (which was our initial prediction, too) or why an overexpression of SP does not cause an increase in average spine density (Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008; our study). This is now mentioned in the text.</p><p>Regarding spine head size, Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008, were the first to show a positive correlation between SP, F-actin content and spine volume (DsRed2-transduced cells). Shortly thereafter, Vlachos et al., 2009, reported a similar relationship between spine head size and SP. Both studies used primary neuronal cultures. Our study demonstrates the validity of these observations in an organotypic slice culture environment and links the presence of SP to spine stability. Thus, our present study adds considerably to our knowledge in this field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In earlier studies, SPâ slices produce or do not produce as large LTP as SP+ slices.

Age-dependence plays a role because SP is gradually expressed in the hippocampus during the postnatal period, starting around the first week postnatally (Czarnecki et al., 2005). It is strongly expressed during adult life (Czarnecki et al., 2005; Deller et al., 2000) and is downregulated with aging (Sidhu et al., 2016). We have now mentioned this age-dependence in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As far as LTP-impairment is concerned, an LTP-impairment has been shown in juvenile (15-21 day old; Zhang et al., 2013) as well as in adult (Deller et al., 2003; Jedlicka et al., 2009) mice. In our first study on the SP-KO mouse (Deller et al., 2003), we also investigated spatial learning and found that adult SP-KO mice perform less well in the radial arm maze compared to wildtype mice, suggesting that lack of SP results in a learning/memory phenotype. The reviewer is right, however, that these findings have not been confirmed at other ages and we have now toned down our statement and have made it clear in the revised manuscript that spatial learning deficits were reported previously in adult SP-KO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the current study, they do not separate between mature spines, filopodia, stubby or short spines. Could they comment on the possible SP dependent conversion of stubby spines to mature spines?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for allowing us to comment on this issue. We have not used the classical classification of spines in our work, i.e. the classification of spines into four categories: thin, stubby, mushroom and (sometimes) filopodia. This classification is based on fixed tissues (âsnapshots capturing states of spinesâ) and the definition of spine classes varies considerably between labs.</p><p>In fact, detailed analyses of a large number of spines revealed that spines come in a continuum of sizes and shapes (e.g. Trommald and Hulleberg, 1997; J Comp. Neurol., 377:15-28). The four classical categories lose their meaning in a dynamic environment, in which spines constantly remodel their geometry (e.g., Matus, 1999, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 9:561-5), and in which â as the reviewer points out â spines shift from one category into another. Indeed, as mentioned by the reviewer, stubby spines can transform into mushroom spines with the insertion of SP. This was shown by us in an earlier publication (Vlachos et al., 2009). In Figure 2D of this earlier publication (Vlachos et al., 2009), we show in a sequence of images the transformation of a SPâ stubby spine into a SP+ mushroom spine. We found similar examples in our material. In the revised manuscript we have now explained our reasoning for choosing spine head size rather than spine categories as readout parameter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Neither do they comment on spine density in the different conditions. Is it possible that dendritic spine density changes contribute to the different proportion of spine shape across age?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our response to the second point raised by the reviewer, we concur that aging and maturation play an important role and we have now mentioned this in our revised manuscript.</p><p>The suggestion of the reviewer is very interesting, since an age-associated reduction in spine stability could contribute to cognitive impairment or learning and memory deficits. Indeed, it has recently been shown that SP expression levels decrease with age (Sidhu et al., 2016) and that SP levels are strongly reduced under conditions of cognitive impairment or AlzheimerÂ´s disease (Reddy et al., 2005; Counts et al., 2014; Wingo et al., 2019). These changes in SP correlate with a reduced spine stability in aged animals (Voglewede et al., 2019) and in AD model mice (Spires-Jones et al., 2007), raising the possibility that these two phenomena are linked. We have now mentioned this intriguing possibility in the revised manuscript and thank the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The paper by Yap et al. is generally well written. The message is clear and experiments are straightforward and well conducted. I do not have any major concern on the manuscript. One thing the author should add, in either Discussion or Introduction, is the description of protein domain structure and possible interaction partners, in the context of observed effect on spine turnover.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have included pertinent information on the published sequence, the structure, organ-specific SP-isoforms and potential binding partners in the revised manuscript (Mundel et al., 1997; Asanuma et al., 2005; 2006; Faul et al., 2007). SP lacks a clear domain organization and contains several predicted disordered regions (Asanuma et al., 2005; Chalovich and Schroeter, 2010; Konietzny et al., 2019).</p><p>Several groups have identified potential interaction partners of SP using 2-hybrid screens (Kremerskothen et al., 2005; Asanuma et al., 2006) and mass spectrometric analysis of a pulldown fraction from hippocampus (Konietzny et al., 2019). Brain SP binds actin (Mundel et al., 1997; Asanuma et al., 2006; Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008) and Î± actinin2 (Asanuma et al., 2005; Kremerskothen et al., 2005) in all cellular compartments in which SP is found (Paul et al., 2020). Other potential interaction partners that could affect spine stability are Cdc42 and RhoA (Asanuma et al., 2005; Kremerskothen et al., 2005; Asanuma et al., 2006; Yanagida-Asanuma et al., 2007; Faul et al., 2007; Konietzny et al., 2019). Recently, myosin V has been identified as an interaction partner by Konietzny et al., 2019, together with one of us (Alexander Drakew). In this recent study several novel interaction partners were also identified using mass spectrometric analysis of a pulldown fraction from rat hippocampus and a network analysis was published (Figure 1B in Konietzny et al., 2019). We refer the reviewer to this figure for additional details on potential interaction partners of SP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I realize that it is not the specialty of the authors but still it is important to give some idea. Interestingly, synaptopodin accumulate at the bottom of spine head. In view of its function, possible mechanism to stabilize spine may be discussed. This reviewer knows of only one other example which shows such distribution â cofilin (Bosch, 2014).</p></disp-quote><p>We fully concur with the reviewer and have taken up this suggestion. We have now added a paragraph to the Discussion, in which we discuss possible mechanisms and interaction partners that could allow SP to stabilize spines. This paragraph now reads:</p><p>âHow could SP exert its stabilizing effects on spines? The preferential localization of SP clusters in the lower part of the spine head argues for an association of SP with the stable pool of actin, which forms the central and less dynamic core of spines (Bramham et al., 2008; Bosch et al., 2014; Colgan and Yasuda, 2014; Spence and Soderling, 2015). [â¦] In sum, SP could influence the stability of actin pools and/or actin treadmilling in spines via several mutually non-exclusive direct and indirect mechanism.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another thing the authors can add to Discussion or Introduction is about regulation of synaptopodin by neuronal activity. Although it is beyond the current study, actin is dynamically regulated during synaptic plasticity. Therefore, it is important to understand how synaptipodin is regulated and what the mechanism might be.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this point. Activity-dependent regulation of SP has been shown by others, in particular the group of Inokuchi. They showed that under conditions of synaptic strengthening SP is upregulated (Yamazaki et al., 2001) and is also sorted into the same layer of the hippocampus as actin (Fukazawa et al., 2003). In a slightly later paper, the same group showed that activation of NMDA-R results in SP recruitment into spines (Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008). Within spines SP stabilized enlarged spine heads. Finally, using a chemical LTP approach, the group of Menahem Segal in collaboration with our group (Vlachos et al., 2009) showed that SP is recruited into spines under these conditions. The number of SP-positive spines increased significantly.</p><p>In sum, these data show that SP is regulated by activity. It locally accumulates below activated synapses and is recruited into synapses upon activity-induced spine head expansion. We have now discussed this in the revised manuscript on Hebbian plasticity (activity regulation) and the revised paragraph now reads:</p><p>âSP plays an important role in Hebbian- (Yamazaki et al., 2001; Deller et al., 2003; Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008; Holbro et al., 2009; Jedlicka et al., 2009; Vlachos et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013; Jedlicka and Deller, 2017) and homeostatic (Vlachos et al., 2013) forms of synaptic plasticity. [â¦] Since SP+ spines are large and strong spines exhibiting a high density of AMPA-R (Vlachos et al., 2009), loss of SP from only this fraction of spines suffices to impair Hebbian plasticity (Deller et al., 2003; Jedlicka et al., 2009; Vlachos et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013; Grigoryan and Segal, 2015), underlining its role in Hebbian forms of synaptic strengthening.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Having said this, the Discussion is lengthy. The authors do not need to repeat the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the reviewerÂ´s recommendation and have included the above paragraphs and have removed others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript continues the studies of these authors on the actin-stabilizer synaptopodin (SP). This manuscript describes a role for SP in the stability of dendritic spines in the OML of dentate granule cells in organotypic slice cultures. SP+ spines were assessed in Thy1-EGFP-SP mice on a SP KO background The authors have previously showed that SP is a component of the spine apparatus and SP KO mice have deficits in synaptic plasticity. The main new finding in this manuscript is that larger spines contained SP and correlated with longer survival than SPâ spines as measured with two-photon microscopy. The experiments appear carefully executed and add to descriptions of synaptopodin in spines, but represent detailed, but modest, extension of prior data. The observations regarding loss of spines based on following spines over time is interesting, but does not provide particular mechanistic insight as the paper is entirely SP-centric without consideration for other molecular interactions in spines. There are also a few issues of interpretation as below.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this work is highly focused on SP. We do, in fact, regard this as a strong point of the paper, because we have finally uncovered what SP does with regard to spine dynamics. After the group of Inokuchi showed that SP does not cause spine head expansion but stabilizes expanded spine heads (Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008), a role for SP in the regulation of spine stability was one of the discussed functions.</p><p>To resolve this open question, we performed an in-depth analysis of the biological effects of SP on spines in an organotypic environment. Mechanistic interactions, e.g. interaction of SP with other actin-binding proteins can be much better investigated in more simple systems, e.g. dissociated cultures, which have their own limitations. In fact, some of us recently contributed to a report on molecular interaction partners of SP using such an approach (Konietzny et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) SP was expressed in SP KO mice and labeled approximately 14% of the total spines in tissue sections, but without changing the average size, perhaps not totally surprising (although the authors state it is surprising), given that only a small fraction of the spines were labeled. Given the small fraction of SP-labeled spines, it seems the authors conclusion that SP is not &quot;â¦a major regulator of spine head sizeâ¦&quot; is not proven by this data. The same concern applies to the organotypic slice date where only 8% of spines were SP+.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with the reviewer that non-significant results need to be carefully interpreted. However, in light of the fact that the biggest spines of a neuron are SP+ spines, it was unexpected for us that absence of SP from granule cells neither affected average spine head size nor cumulative spine distribution (Figure 1C, D). Even if only 13.5% of spines contain SP, we had anticipated that such an effect should be visible, because SP+ spines are three times the size of SPâ spines (Figure 1G; ~0.1 Mean spine head size of SPâ (~0.133 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>) and SP+ (~0.328 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>) spines. ***p &lt; 0.0001, MannâWhitney U-test. SP+ spines n = 200; SPâ spines n = 1497.).</p><p>Our data suggest that one reason for this negative finding, i.e. non-significant difference in average spine head size between KO and WT mice, is a compensation mechanism in the KO mouse that could only be detected using time-lapse imaging: SP-deficient granule cells show an increased spine turnover (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). Unstable spines disappear but are rapidly replaced by new spines, thus compensating not only for spine density but also for spine head size (see our response to reviewer 1). These read-out parameters may be homeostatically regulated, e.g. by the global firing rate of a neuron (Turrigiano et al., 2008; 2011).</p><p>Based on our observation, that the distribution between SP-KO mice and SP-WT mice is not significantly different, we do not have any data which allow us to state the opposite, i.e. that SP is a major regulator of spine head size. We, therefore, in line with our data carefully stated that SP is ânot a <italic>major</italic> regulator of spine head sizeâ, which is what our data shows. This statement does not exclude a regulatory role of SP for spine head size that remained undetected in this context.</p><p>To address the concerns of the reviewer, we have been even more conservative in our wording. We changed the text and toned down our statements. Specifically, the text passage at the end of the first Results paragraph now reads:</p><p>âWe conclude from these observations, that SP is indeed tightly correlated with spine size. However, lack of SP did not affect average spine head size, suggesting that SP is either not a major regulator of spine head size or that its loss is compensated for in the SP-deficient mouse.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that SP was not overexpressed based on mRNA of the culture, but presumably only a fraction of cells were labeled. Thus measurements of virally-tranfected cells would be more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have performed additional experiments to address these concerns. First, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for SP-mRNA. Since the cultures lack endogenous SP, this revealed all cells expressing the transgene. In the dentate gyrus granule cell layer, essentially every GC expressed the transgene. Cultures from litter mate controls lacking the transgene (which are, in essence, KO) did not show a SP signal. We have now mentioned this in the revised manuscript and have added Figure 2âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>Secondly, we micro-dissected areas of the granule cell layer injected with the tdTomato virus and compared the level of SP-mRNA in virus-injected tissues of eGFP-SP-tg and control tissues. Again, levels of SPmRNA were not significantly different, supporting our earlier findings and the results of the FISH. We have now mentioned this in the revised manuscript and have added the data to Figure 2âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>Finally, we would like to add that we investigated the stability of single SP+ spines, not cells. SP is transported to spines where the protein exerts its effects locally. Thus, even if there are differences in expression in SP-mRNA between single cells or even in SP protein between spines, this would not invalidate the major finding of our study, i.e. an effect of SP on long-term spine stability, which is seen in SP+ but not in SPâ spines or in spines from KO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Portions of the Discussion reiterate the results and could be substantially shortened.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shortened the Discussion and have focused on our main findings and the additional topics suggested by reviewer 2. See also our response to reviewer 2.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. These include modifications in the text to address the concerns raised by reviewer 3 and to a lesser extent reviewer 2. These are important revisions to place your results in the context of the field. The editor will evaluate your response and your manuscript will not be sent back to the reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦]</p><p>The data summarizing these findings is clearly presented, and represents meticulously done and well-controlled experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive feed-back and for the time spent reviewing our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are only two points that diminish my enthusiasm.</p><p>1) First, aside from Figure 6, the findings presented are all correlative, and the model is based on this correlative data. Figure 6 presents a spine size/stability analysis in SP KO neurons, showing that spines in the KO essentially behave as SPâ spines in the WT. This figure is the only one that tests the requirement for SP for spine stability, and on its own is not definitive, especially given the homeostatic compensation that partially counteracts the constitutive SP loss. Considering this, some of the statements they make are a bit too strong. For example, the heading for Figure 5 &quot;Presence of SP in spines determines their long-term survival&quot;. The data shown in this figure is that presence of SP is correlated with long-term survival, there is no test of sufficiency that would justify use of the word determines. The heading is similarly misleading: âSynaptopodin increases survival of small, medium and large spinesâ. The authors should carefully peruse the manuscript and correct all such statements that claim more than a correlation unless it is explicitly tested (such as in Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>We have gone through our manuscript and have performed the suggested changes. Tracking mode changes (or text passages highlighted in yellow) indicate where we have changed the wording. Specifically, the heading for Figure 5 now reads: &quot;Presence of Synaptopodin correlates with their long-term survival&quot;. The heading now reads: &quot;Synaptopodin is correlated with the long-term survival of spines irrespective of spine head size&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second disappointment is that the entire paper is oddly removed from a deep literature related to other molecular determinants of spine stability. In particular, the relationship between PSD95 presence and spine size and stability has been comprehensively analyzed, and PSD95 presence is considered one of the best predictors of spine stability. While I would not ask for any mechanistic analysis connecting SP to other molecules previously shown to determine spine stability, I am surprised that neither the Introduction or Discussion even mention the molecular precedents for their finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that PSD-95 is an important predictor of spine stability. However, PSD-95 is a postsynaptic density (PSD) protein, which Synaptopodin is not. In fact, Synaptopodin has even been used by others as a marker protein for molecules located <italic>outside</italic> the PSD but still within the spine compartment (Hafner et al., 2019; see Supplementary Figure 6A in Hafner et al., 2009).</p><p>A number of molecules located at the synapse, e.g. several PSD molecules but also cell adhesion and/or signaling molecules spanning the synaptic cleft have been shown to stabilize excitatory synapses and spines (e.g., El-Husseini et al., 2000; Ehrlich et al., 2007; De Roo et al., 2008; Yoshihara et al., 2009; Cane et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2014). It is highly likely that these molecules primarily act and interact at the synapse itself, whereas Synaptopodin appears to be more associated with the central and less dynamic actin core of spines (Bramham et al., 2008; Bosch et al., 2014; Colgan and Yasuda, 2014; Spence and Soderling, 2015). Indeed, our denervation experiment shows that the stabilizing effect of SP on spines is still seen even after the presynapse has been removed. Thus, Synaptopodin and PSD/synaptic molecules may differ in the mechanisms used for spine stabilization, which explains, why we have not focused in our discussion on these molecules.</p><p>However, we agree that from a systems perspective, molecules enriched in dendritic spines are likely to interact in some way and that PSD molecules could be linked to Synaptopodin, e.g. via the actin cytoskeleton. In turn, Synaptopodin could be part of their downstream machinery used for spine stabilization. To take these aspects and the suggestions of the reviewer into account, we have revised the text of our manuscript.</p><p>The text now reads:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>âThe function of SP in spines is not limited to the formation of spine apparatus organelles. SP also affects the actin spinoskeleton either directly by stabilizing F-actin (Mundel et al., 1997; Okubo-Suzuki et al., 2008) or indirectly via binding to Î±-actinin-2, Cdc42, RhoA, or myosin V (Asanuma et al., 2005; Kremerskothen et al., 2005; Asanuma et al., 2006; Faul et al., 2007; Yanagida-Asanuma et al., 2007; Jedlicka and Deller, 2017; Konietzny et al., 2019). It is likely that SP, via its connection to the actin cytoskeleton, is also connected to the post-synaptic density (PSD), which plays an important role in synaptic stabilization (El-Husseini et al., 2000; Ehrlich et al., 2007; Yoshihara et al., 2009; Meyer et al., 2014). Accordingly, SP has been suggested to influence the geometry and stability of spines (Deller et al., 2000).â</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>âHow could SP exert its stabilizing effects on spines? In comparison to other wellestablished stabilizers of spines, such as PSD-95 (El-Husseini et al., 2000; Cane et al., 2014), which primarily act at the synapse (Ehrlich et al., 2007; De Roo et al., 2008; Yoshihara et al., 2009; Meyer et al., 2014), the preferential localization of SP clusters in the lower part of the spine head argues for an association of SP with the stable pool of actin, which forms the central and less dynamic core of spines (Bramham et al., 2008; Bosch et al., 2014; Colgan and Yasuda, 2014; Spence and Soderling, 2015).â</p></body></sub-article></article>
