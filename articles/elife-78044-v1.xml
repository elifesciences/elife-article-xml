A novel strategy is needed to control <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections due to its adaptive evolution to antibiotics. Autophagy plays a key role in degrading bacteria for innate immune cells. In order to promote <italic>S. aureus</italic> clearance via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced autophagy pathway, the domain fusion TLR2-4 with the extracellular domain of TLR2, specific recognizing <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and transmembrane and intracellular domains of TLR4 is assembled, then the goat expressing <italic>TLR2-4</italic> is generated. TLR2-4 substantially augments the removal of <italic>S. aureus</italic> within macrophages by elevating autophagy level. Phosphorylated JNK and ERK1/2 promote LC3-puncta in TLR2-4 macrophages during <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy via MyD88 mediated the TAK1 signaling cascade. Meantime, the TRIF-dependent TBK1-TFEB-OPTN signaling is involved in TLR2-4-triggered autophagy after <italic>S. aureus</italic> challenge. Moreover, the transcript of <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>ATG12</italic> is significantly increased via cAMP-PKA-NF-κB signaling, which facilitates <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy in TLR2-4 macrophages. Overall, the novel receptor TLR2-4 enhances the autophagy-dependent clearance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in macrophages via TAK1/TBK1-JNK/ERK, TBK1-TFEB-OPTN, and cAMP-PKA-NF-κB-ATGs signaling pathways, which provide an alternative approach for resistant against <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Toll-like receptor 2-4</kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>goat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019046</institution-id><institution>National Transgenic Key Project of the Ministry of Agriculture of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016ZX08008-003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Hongbing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Toll-like receptor 2-4 genetic modification goat improves effectively resistance against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection by enhancing autophagy level, and it provides a novel strategy for challenge of <italic>S. aureus</italic>-caused infections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/staphylococcus-aureus">Staphylococcus aureus (S, aureus)</ext-link> is regarded as an important zoonotic pathogen that causes disease in both human and livestock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fluit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tong et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> usually gives rise to skin and soft <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/soft-tissue-infection">tissue infections</ext-link>, pneumonia, device-related infections, severe sepsis, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lowy, 1998</xref>). In addition, <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced mastitis is a major disease that poses a potential harm to animal welfare in global dairy industry. Moreover, the transmission of <italic>S. aureus</italic> from livestock to dairy products can lead to human food poisoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hennekinne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mechesso et al., 2021</xref>). However, <italic>S. aureus</italic> has developed antibiotic resistance mechanisms for most kinds of antibiotics due to the widespread use of antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pantosti et al., 2007</xref>). It is urgent to develop new approaches to overcome the <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p><p>The innate immune system is the first line for defense against invading pathogens. Toll-like receptor (TLR), one of pattern recognition receptor, can sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from various pathogens to trigger immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawai and Akira, 2007</xref>). It has been proved that TLR2 plays an essential role in mediating immune response to Gram-positive bacteria, including <italic>S. aureus</italic>, by forming a heterodimerize with TLR6 or TLR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takeuchi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takeuchi et al., 2002</xref>). The extracellular domain of TLR2 contains 18–20 leucine rich repeat (LRR) and LRR-like motifs, which is responsible for recognizing <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirschning and Schumann, 2002</xref>). The interaction between the intracellular domain of TLR2 and downstream signaling adaptor MyD88 induces phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and activation of NF-κB, resulting in production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and costimulatory molecule involved in acquired immune responses to eliminate <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bannerman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brenaut et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bulgari et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>TLR signal also enhances the killing of invading pathogens via activating autophagy pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanjuan et al., 2007</xref>). Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process by which cytosolic material is engulfed in a double-membrane vesicle termed autophagosome, followed by fusion with lysosomes to form autophagosomes for degradation and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levine and Kroemer, 2019</xref>). In addition to the conventional homeostatic function, autophagy also plays critical roles in immunity by regulating cytokine production, antigen presentation, removal of dangerous cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levine and Kroemer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levine and Kroemer, 2019</xref>). A publication has shown that autophagy plays a protective role against intracellular <italic>S. aureus</italic> at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) in murine fibroblasts, where <italic>S. aureus</italic> was rapidly ubiquitinated and restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neumann et al., 2016</xref>). Knockdown of autophagy receptor sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) significantly increased the cytosolic <italic>S. aureus</italic> burden within host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibson et al., 2020</xref>). Simultaneously, autophagic pathway induced by TLR4 facilitates clearance of internalized bacteria residing in the cytosol, including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pahari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). TLR4 recognizing lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria induces the cytosolic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains dimerization, then activates TIR-containing adaptor protein to initiate autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). The coordination of TLR2 and TLR4 signal triggers innate immune responses in the mammary epithelial cells to contribute to counteracting <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldammer T, Zerbe H, Molenaar A, Schuberth HJ, Brunner RM, Kata SR, and Seyfert HM, 2004</xref>). Further, TLR2/TLR4-dependent autophagy also enhances the phagocytosis and destruction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in mouse macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that <italic>S. aureus</italic> could be extremely eliminated in macrophages by regulating autophagy pathway with combined TLR2 recognizing <italic>S. aureus</italic> and TLR4 activating autophagy. Since activation of TLR2 signal needs to form a heterodimer with TLR1 or TLR6, only the overexpression of TLR2 can unlikely enhance <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy. However, TLR4, as a oneself homodimer, can induce autophagy pathways by the interaction of its intracellular domains and other adaptor molecule. So, we establish a recombined gene <italic>TLR2-4</italic> by fusing extracellular domain of TLR2 (specific recognizing <italic>S. aureus</italic>) with transmembrane and intracellular domains of TLR4 (initiating autophagy pathways). The goat expressing TLR2-4 was generated by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated system 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) mediated knock-in. The expression of LC3-II in macrophages from TLR2-4 goat was obviously increased, and bacterial burden was significantly reduced after <italic>S. aureus</italic> challenge. Moreover, the activation of autophagy pathway in TLR2-4 macrophages relied on JNK/ERK, cAMP-PKA, and TBK1-TFEB-OPTN signaling pathways. Taken together, we identified that domain fusion receptor TLR2-4 could recognize <italic>S. aureus</italic> and enhance autophagy-mediated clearance of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in macrophages. The present study is, to our knowledge, the first research describing the fusion gene <italic>TLR2-4</italic> in dairy ruminants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of the fibroblast cell line expressing TLR2-4</title><p>The fusion gene <italic>TLR2-4</italic> was assembled with the coding sequence (CDS) of goat <italic>TLR2</italic> extracellular domain including a signal peptide and ligand recognition domain and <italic>TLR4</italic> transmembrane and intracellular domain by overlap PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To easily detect the expression of <italic>TLR2-4</italic> in fibroblast cell, MyC-tag CDS was introduced between signal peptide and ligand recognition CDS of TLR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Eight CRISPR/Cas9 small guide RNA (sgRNA) targets were screened within the first intron of SET domain-containing 5 (<italic>SETD5</italic>) for achieving site-specific integration of <italic>TLR2-4</italic> by T7 endonuclease 1 (T7E1) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and sgRNA2 was selected according to the genome editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The <italic>TLR2-4</italic> expression vector (containing <italic>tdtomato</italic> and ~1 kb homologous arm) and the sgRNA2-Cas9 expression vector (PX458, containing <italic>GFP</italic>) were co-transfected into goat fibroblasts, which might complete site-specific insertion of <italic>TLR2-4</italic> by CRISPR/Cas9-induced homology-mediated end joining (HMEJ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The fibroblasts of site-specific integration of <italic>TLR2-4</italic> were identified by PCR, and the DNA fragment of 1420 bp was further purified to sequence by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The efficiency of targeted knock-in of <italic>TLR2-4</italic> was 19.05% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Further, the expression of TLR2-4 was detected by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and flow cytometry using anti-MyC tag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that the expression of TLR2-4 was located on cytomembrane and cytoplasm. To confirm whether TLR2-4 could execute its functions, the TLR2-4 fibroblast cells that endogenous <italic>TLR2</italic> was knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA, knockdown efficiency of <italic>TLR2</italic> is about 80%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) were stimulated by TLR2 agonist Pam2CSK4 (P2C), Pam3CSK4 (P3C), and heat-killed <italic>S. aureus</italic> (HK-SA), respectively.

The mRNA level of IL-6 in TLR2-4 fibroblast cells with siTLR2 was dramatically increased with P2C and P3C treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Moreover, the mRNA levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in TLR2-4 fibroblast cells with siRNA TLR2 were dramatically increased with HK-SA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

CQ impairs autophagosome-lysosome fusion and lysosomal degradative activity. <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced up-regulation of LC3-II was inhibited by autophagy inhibitor 3MA and was accumulated after CQ treatment, which proved that the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in macrophages is due to the enhancement of autophagy but not the impairment of lysosomal delivery of LC3-positive vacuoles. The autophagy receptor p62, an essential adaptor for target cargo, is degraded by proteolytic enzyme in the process of autophagy, thus the increase of p62 usually implicates an impairment of autophagy pathway. The down-regulation of p62 was restored by CQ treatment, suggesting the decrease of p62 in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-treated macrophages results from the activation of autophagy but not the impairment of delivery process of autophagosomes to lysosomes. All together, these results indicated that TLR2-4 increased the <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy activity in goat macrophages.

Modulation of host innate immunity may be a potential strategy to eliminate pathogens. TLR2 plays an essential role in recognizing <italic>S. aureus</italic> and activating autophagy pathway during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections. However, we cannot regulate autophagy by overexpressing TLR2, as it is required to form heterodimerizes with TLR6 or TLR1. TLR4 and myeloid differentiation factor 2 complex binds to lipopolysaccharide triggers formation of the activated homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2009</xref>). It is an essential component in host resistance via downstream signaling pathways initiating autophagy to degrade pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pahari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Meanwhile, TLR4 is involved in immune response during <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stenzel et al., 2008</xref>). The function of TLR2- and TLR4-dependent autophagy has been shown to be crucial in the bactericidal activity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in mouse macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shu et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, to achieve the enhanced host resistance against <italic>S. aureus</italic>, a recombinant receptor TLR2-4 with the extracellular domain of TLR2 (recognizing <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and the intracellular domain of TLR4 (initiating autophagy pathways) was assembled. The clone goats expressing domain fusion <italic>TLR2-4</italic> were generated via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HMEJ. We first showed that the recombinant receptor TLR2-4 could recognize TLR2 ligands or <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Further, we demonstrated that <italic>TLR2-4</italic> enhance the killing of <italic>S. aureus</italic> by promoting autophagy pathway. This work is meaningful for producing the <italic>S. aureus</italic>-resistant livestock germplasm, and help to deeply understand the mechanism on resistant to intracellular <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p><p>The changes of cytokines are a dynamic process during immune responses. It has been reported that overexpression of TLR4 only promoted the production of proinflammatory cytokines at the early stage of LPS stimulation. After LPS treatment for more than 4 hr, the TLR4-mediated TRIF-dependent pathway was activated, and the cytokines secreted by TLR4-overexpressing macrophages were reduced compared with WT macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wei et al., 2019</xref>). As previously reported, the mRNA level of IL-6 in TLR2-4 fibroblast cells with siRNA TLR2 was dramatically increased, while IL-8 and IL-1β were significantly decreased after stimulated by TLR2 ligands for 10 hr. Therefore, we hypothesized that the activation of IL-8 and IL-1β mediated by TLR2-4 may be inhibited through TRIF-induced internalization pathway. In addition, it has been reported that pretreatment of microglia with P3C induces the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine and attenuates inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kochan et al., 2012</xref>). These results demonstrated that TLR2-4 recognizes ligands by the extracellular domain of TLR2 and initiates downstream immune response by the intracellular domain of TLR4. P3C is a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide and a TLR2/TLR1 ligand. P2C is a synthetic diacylated lipopeptide and is recognized by the TLR2/TLR6 heterodimer. They mimic the acylated amino terminus of bacterial lipopeptides and are potent activator of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and AP-1. However, <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the whole cell pathogen with PAMPs on surface that include lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN) in addition to lipopeptides. LTA and PGN have been reported to induce the release of IL-8 through MyD88-dependent signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hattar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zenhom et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the mRNA levels of downstream cytokines were different after fibroblasts stimulated by TLR ligands or <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p><p>The autophagic response promotes <italic>S. aureus</italic> survival in zebrafish neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prajsnar et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, it is currently unknown whether autophagy pathway of goat macrophages is conductive to bacterial replication during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. In contrast to this publication, we observe that the autophagic response reinforced <italic>S. aureus</italic> clearance in goat <italic>TLR2-4</italic> macrophages. The elimination of <italic>S. aureus</italic> was significantly impaired by autophagy inhibitor 3-MA in <italic>TLR2-4</italic> macrophages. These data provide evidences that domain fusion <italic>TLR2-4</italic> maintained the ability of activating autophagy pathways to degraded pathogens and recognized <italic>S. aureus</italic> and its ligands.</p><p>We subsequently focused on the pathways of inducing autophagy in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected TLR2-4 macrophages. Previous work suggested that OPTN was phosphorylated by TBK1 and recruited to ubiquitinated cytosolic bacteria to enhance autophagic degradation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wild et al., 2011</xref>), and TFEB regulated OPTN-induced autophagy activation in host defense against <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Visvikis et al., 2014</xref>). We suspected that the same pathway might be involved in TLR2-4 signal. The effects of inhibited TBK1 on <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy in TLR2-4 macrophages were estimated. The data revealed that inhibition of TBK1 led to suppression of TFEB nuclear translocation and reduction of OPTN expression, and then diminished <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy. These data suggested that the TLR2-4 was involved in TBK1-TFEB-OPTN signaling pathway in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy in macrophages.</p><p>TAK1 can be activated through the TLR4-mediated MyD88-dependent pathway on cell surface. Activated TAK1 initiates MAPK signaling cascades. In the meantime, TLR4-induced TRIF-dependent pathway triggers TBK1 in the cytoplasm, then phosphorylates JNK or ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>). Our observation evidenced that TAK1 and TBK1 signal were initiated in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected macrophages expressing TLR2-4. Subsequently, the phosphorylated JNK and ERK suggested that TLR2-4 is similar to TLR4, can activate the TAK1/TBK1-JNK/ERK signaling pathways. We further show that the inhibition of JNK or ERK exactly abrogated the LC3-puncta and declined the clearance of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, indicating that TLR2-4-triggered JNK and ERK signal promote host resistant against <italic>S. aureus</italic> through autophagy pathway. These results are consistent with previous observations that JNK and ERK participate in mediating autophagy activation in pathogen-infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we observed that the expression of autophagy-related <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>ATG12</italic> were significantly augmented in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected TLR2-4 macrophages. However, inhibition of JNK or ERK significantly up-regulated the expression of ATG5 and ATG12 in TLR2-4 macrophages. These data suggest that JNK or ERK signaling enhances the expression of ATG8 family protein LC3II in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected goat macrophages, but not ATG5 and ATG12. Interestingly, the negative regulation of the JNK signaling pathway suppresses the ATG5 and ATG12 expression in hippocampus of epileptic rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and the ERK promotes the expression of ATG5 in the human colorectal cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Combining these evidences with our data indicates the MAPK modulating the expression of ATGs probably is different because of different species or cells during autophagy events. Therefore, we inferred that other signaling pathways were involved in increasing transcript of <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>ATG12</italic> during <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagic process in TLR2-4 macrophages. Previous studies showed the PI3K-AKT-FoxO1 pathway regulated the expression of ATGs in mouse ovarian granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the transcriptomic GO and KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated that PI3K-AKT pathway was implicated in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy. Thus, we detected the activation of AKT and FoxO1 by Western blot. The results showed that both AKT and FoxO1 were scarcely activated in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected macrophages, indicating the transcript of ATGs was not triggered by PI3K-AKT-FoxO1 signaling pathway.</p><p>Since the cAMP signal was enriched during <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy in TLR2-4 macrophages by RNA-seq, we focused on the effect of cAMP signal on the expression of <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>ATG12</italic>. The level of cAMP in TLR2-4 macrophages was significantly higher than that in WT macrophages after <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. Furthermore, increased cAMP activated the phosphorylation of PKA and inhibited NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation by disturbing the IκB-α phosphorylation. These data were similar to the previous evidences that cAMP-induced PKA down-regulated the expression of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zuo et al., 2016</xref>). NF-κB signal pathway could suppress autophagy by inhibiting the expression of <italic>ATGs</italic> (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). We next verified LC3-II activated by cAMP-PKA-NF-κB signaling and the expression of <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>ATG12</italic>s in TLR2-4 macrophages using exerting the cAMP activator (Forskolin) and the PKA inhibitor (H-89). The inhibitor H-89 not only augmented the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, but also suppressed the expression of <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>ATG12</italic> in TLR2-4 macrophages after <italic>S. aureus</italic> challenge, while the activator Forskolin facilitated substantially the mRNA levels of <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>ATG12</italic>. Meanwhile, the levels of LC3II were decreased in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected TLR2-4 macrophages by the inhibitor H-89. These data suggested that TLR2-4 triggered cAMP-PKA-NF-κB signaling to increase the expression of <italic>ATG5</italic> and <italic>ATG12</italic>, and then promoted autophagic process to complete the elimination of pathogens within autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mestre and Colombo, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we first assembled the domain fusion receptor TLR2-4 and generated the clone goat expressing TLR2-4. The functions of TLR2-4 for resistant against <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection were elucidated in macrophages. TLR2-4 enhanced the autophagy level to effectively eliminate <italic>S. aureus</italic> in macrophages via three signaling pathways including TAK1/TBK1-JNK/ERK, TBK1-TFEB-OPTN, and cAMP-PKA-NF-κB-ATGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which provided a new insight into <italic>S. aureus</italic> defense in dairy goat.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kui Li (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– In this manuscript, all the experiments to prove that TLR2-4 enhanced <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy and explore which signaling pathways played a role in this process were based on in vitro (fibroblasts and macrophages). Did the authors conduct in vivo experiments to verify the corresponding mechanism?</p><p>– L. 106-109. In Figure 1A, there was an unmentioned TLR2 signal domain flanking the MYC-Tag sequence. Please indicate the purpose of TLR2 signal domain construct.</p><p>– L. 109-113. The authors described that sgRNA2 was the most favorable target by comprehensive analysis of the genome editing efficiency. Why not use the most efficient sgRNA3 (28.45% indels in Figure S1A) for the further TLR2-4 knock-in, and instead use the sgRNA2 (16.69%) with relatively moderate efficiency?</p><p>– L. 119-120. In Figure S1C, there were weak and miscellaneous bands. How did the authors judge which cell colonies were TLR2-4 integrated?</p><p>– L. 131-133. According to Figure 1F-G, compared to WT fibroblast cells with siTLR2, the mRNA level of IL-8 in siTLR2-treated TLR2-4 fibroblasts was dramatically increased with heat-killed <italic>S. aureus</italic> treatment. However, the mRNA level of IL-8 in TLR2-4 fibroblasts with siTLR2 was significantly decreased with P2CSK4 and P3CSK4 treatment. Please check this and discuss.</p><p>– L. 170. In Figure 2F, please check whether the housekeeping gene used is GAPDH (legend) or β-actin (diagram)? Keep diagram and legend consistent.</p><p>– In this paper, why was heat-killed S. aureus used in some experiments (L. 125-133, L. 135-138, L. 144-148, etc.) and live <italic>S. aureus</italic> was used in others (L. 174-176, L. 180-183, L. 187-189, etc.)? Was there any difference between them? Please describe and discuss.</p><p>– L. 180-183. In Figure S3D, there was a huge difference in infection rates of <italic>S. aureus</italic> at MOI=10 between WT1 and WT2. Please explain and discuss.</p><p>– L. 199-201 and L. 205-207. In the absence of S. aureus treatment, why did WT macrophages show significantly higher LC3-I expression than TLR2-4 macrophages (Figure 3F and 3G)? But in L. 201-204, when <italic>S. aureus</italic> was not treated, why did TLR2-4 macrophages show significantly higher LC3-I expression than WT macrophages (Figure S3G)? Please describe and discuss.</p><p>– L. 220-222. The authors described that the lysosomal activity of WT macrophages was similar to that of the TLR2-4 transgenic macrophages treated with Bafilomycin A1. So, in Figure S3H, were &quot;TLR2-4 + S. aureus&quot; and &quot;TLR2-4 + Bafilomycin A1 + <italic>S. aureus</italic>&quot; marked incorrectly?</p><p>– These abbreviations should be spelled out at first use: &quot;TLR&quot; (L. 29), &quot;WT&quot; (L. 130), &quot;HK-SA&quot; (Figure 1I), &quot;WB&quot; (L. 398). It would be good to check the whole manuscript to make sure abbreviations are used correctly.</p><p>– The loading control, GAPDH, seems to change due to the treatment (as shown in Figures 5A, B and D). This raises the question of whether the quantitative data for the target protein is reliable. Do the authors have another loading control, or can they also use total protein?</p><p>– For some Figures (i.e. Figures 5A, B and D) the horizontally indicated group of WT contains some of the TLR2-3 experimental group. The full name and abbreviation in the legend are used at the same time and it would be recommended to be more uniform (Figure 5). DNA size of the ladder should also be marked in Figure 2F, etc.</p><p>– On Page 16, lines 329-331: the authors mentioned that: conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was increased in TLR2-4 macrophages with <italic>S. aureus</italic> treatment by activator Forskolin, while was decreased by inhibitor H-89. However, the LC3-I and LC3-II patterns didn't show an obvious difference between Forskolin and H-89-treated groups (Figure 6G), thus, the authors need to repeat this experiment and/or interpret the data accurately.</p><p>– The two RNA-seq results were not compared, resulting in a lack of overall understanding of the total number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In lines 136-138, 557 DEGs were detected between TLR2-4 and WT fibroblast cells. Similarly, in lines 235-237, 1310 DEGs were detected between TLR2-4 and WT macrophages. So what's the number of common and unique genes for these two experiments? What are the possible reasons for the difference between the two results?</p><p>– In line 291-292, the author mentioned that previous studies demonstrated the activation of <italic>JNK</italic> and ERK signaling promotes the expression of ATG5 and ATG12. This conclusion seems not to be supported by this research, as the author came to a conclusion that inhibition of <italic>JNK</italic> and ERK signaling increased the expression of the ATG5 and ATG12 (lines 292-296). For this divergence, the author has not made further elaboration and discussion, nor has it been reflected in the subsequent Figure 7. The authors should make sure their data is reproducible and comment on these divergent findings.</p><p>– Please emphasize the application and significance of this study in the Discussion section. As an opportunist pathogen, <italic>S. aureus</italic> causes a range of serious diseases.</p><p>– Line 161, what is STED5? Please clarify when it appears for the first time.</p><p>– Line 207-211, please describe the results of Figure 3G in detail to better connect the subsequent suggestion.</p><p>– The authors only mentioned MyD88 in the abstract, introduction and Figure 7, but did not mention or examine it in the main text. Please clarify.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of image acquisition and data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p><p>1) The description of the results is inaccurate and inconsistent with the Figures. For example, on page 7, lines 131-133, the authors described that the mRNA level of IL-6 and IL-8 in TLR2-4 fibroblast cells with siTLR2 was dramatically increased with P2CSK4, P3CSK4 and heat-killed S. aureus treatment, receptively (Figure 1F, G). However, as shown in Figures 1F and G, the mRNA level of IL-8 in TLR2-4 fibroblast cells with siTLR2 was dramatically decreased with P2CSK4, P3CSK4 treatment, while only increased with heat-killed <italic>S. aureus</italic> treatment. In addition, the mRNA level of IL1B was also inconsistent across treatment groups, which the authors did not explain in detail. The authors should factually describe the results and explain them reasonably.</p><p>2) The data on the activity of TLR2-4 presented in Figure 1I is not sufficiently convincing. For example, What's the meaning of &quot;HK-SA&quot; in Figure 1I? On page 7, lines 149-150, the authors described that the level of NF-κB subunit p65 translocation was almost suppressed completely in TLR2-4 fibroblasts independent of <italic>S. aureus</italic> treatment. The authors should provide data to support this conclusion. Numbering-Terms, symbols, and abbreviations are numbered and are not in accordance with a standard format. For example, WTsiTLR2+P2C, TLR2-4 siTLR2+P2C; WT siTLR2+P3C, TLR2-4 siTLR2+P3C, what are the meaning of P2C and P3C?</p><p>3) The method described is unclear, siRNA only knocks down endogenous TLR2, does it also affect TLR2-4 (Page 6, lines 126-127)?</p><p>4) The number of experimental animals is relatively small.

Did the authors conduct in vivo experiments to verify the corresponding mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>We would to thank the learned editor and reviewers for this valuable comment on our manuscript. We agree completely. Staphylococcus aureus (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) is the major contagious pathogen associated with goat mastitis. The severity of clinical <italic>S. aureus</italic> mastitis varies from mild, expressed only by changes in milk, to acute gangrenous mastitis causing necrosis of the affected udder quarter, severe systemic signs, and even death of goat. It leads to reduced milk production and huge economic losses. Due to the widespread use of antibiotic, <italic>S. aureus</italic> has developed antibiotic resistance mechanisms for most kinds of antibiotics. Therefore, a novel strategy is needed to control <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p><p>The TLR2-4 cloned goat we obtained was male, which needs to be bred with wild-type females for related studies on mastitis. However, the generation interval of goats was long, it will take about three years to obtain sexually mature female cloned goats expressing TLR2-4. So, it takes a long time to conduct vivo experiments to study the mechanism on resistance to <italic>S. aureus</italic> mastitis. Further, our main aim is to explore the domain fusion TLR2-4 receptor could enhance autophagy-mediated <italic>S. aureus</italic> clearance in macrophages. The autophagy events still need to be verified at the cellular level, even though vivo experiments were carried out. At present, conclusions we obtained through cell experiments are well supported by data. We are planning to carry out the next in vivo experiments, and continue to investigate the resistance of TLR2-4 transgenic goats to <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced mastitis in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– L. 106-109. In Figure 1A, there was an unmentioned TLR2 signal domain flanking the MYC-Tag sequence. Please indicate the purpose of TLR2 signal domain construct.</p></disp-quote><p>The recombinant receptor contained the exon sequence of TLR2 extracellular domain including its own signal peptide to direct target protein secretion and across membranes. We have mentioned TLR2 signal domain in the manuscript on page 6, line 111.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– L. 109-113. The authors described that sgRNA2 was the most favorable target by comprehensive analysis of the genome editing efficiency. Why not use the most efficient sgRNA3 (28.45% indels in Figure S1A) for the further TLR2-4 knock-in, and instead use the sgRNA2 (16.69%) with relatively moderate efficiency?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for carefully reading. According to the editing efficiency that evaluated by the T7E1 assay, we selected targets sgRNA2, sgRNA3 and sgRNA7 for subsequent clonal cells screening. During the screening process, the clonal cells targeted by sgRNA2 had stronger proliferative ability than cells with other targets. The ultimate goal is to screen out clonal cells that have inserted the <italic>TLR2-4</italic> gene. Therefore, we have selected the sgRNA2-targeted clonal cells with better growth status for further identification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– L. 119-120. In Figure S1C, there were weak and miscellaneous bands. How did the authors judge which cell colonies were TLR2-4 integrated?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We lysed half of the clonal cells in the 96-well plate as a template for PCR, and the other half were continued to culture. The TLR2-4-specific band (1420 bp) was obtained from PCR assay. We have marked the DNA size of the ladder in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C. According to the size of DNA ladder, we selected the clonal cells with the expected band. After expanding and culturing these clones, the genomic DNA was extracted as PCR templates, and the DNA fragment of 1420 bp was further purified to sequence by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). The clones with correct sequencing result were judged to integrate TLR2-4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– L. 131-133. According to Figure 1F-G, compared to WT fibroblast cells with siTLR2, the mRNA level of IL-8 in siTLR2-treated TLR2-4 fibroblasts was dramatically increased with heat-killed <italic>S. aureus</italic> treatment. However, the mRNA level of IL-8 in TLR2-4 fibroblasts with siTLR2 was significantly decreased with P2CSK4 and P3CSK4 treatment. Please check this and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion. It is a dynamic process that cells produce cytokines. It has been reported overexpression of TLR4 only promoted the production of proinflammatory cytokines at the early stage of LPS stimulation. After LPS treatment for more than 4 h, the TLR4-mediated TRIF-dependent pathway was activated, and the cytokines secreted by TLR4-overexpressing macrophages were reduced compared with WT macrophages (Wei et al., 2019). As previously reported, the mRNA level of IL-6 in TLR2-4 fibroblast cells with siTLR2 was dramatically increased, while IL-8 and IL-1β were significantly decreased after stimulated by TLR2 ligands for 10 h. Therefore, we hypothesized that the expression of IL-8 and IL-1β mediated by TLR2-4 may be inhibited through TRIF-induced internalization pathway. In addition, it has been reported pretreatment of microglia with P3C induces the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine and attenuates inflammatory response (Kochan et al., 2012). These results demonstrated TLR2-4 recognizes ligands by the extracellular domain of TLR2 and initiates downstream immune response by the intracellular domain of TLR4.</p><p>P3CSK4 (P3C) is a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide and a TLR2/TLR1 ligand. P2CSK4 (P2C) is a synthetic diacylated lipopeptide and is recognized by the TLR2/TLR6 heterodimer. They mimic the acylated amino terminus of bacterial lipopeptides and are potent activator of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and AP-1. However, <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the whole cell pathogen with PAMPs on surface that include lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN) in addition to lipopeptides. LTA and PGN have been reported to induce the release of IL-8 through MyD88-dependent signaling pathway (Hattar et al., 2017; Zenhom et al., 2012). Therefore, the mRNA levels of downstream cytokines were different between Figure 1F and Figure 1G. We have revised the Discussion section. Please see the text on pages 18-19, lines 369-389.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– L. 170. In Figure 2F, please check whether the housekeeping gene used is GAPDH (legend) or β-actin (diagram)? Keep diagram and legend consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this mistake. The housekeeping gene is β-actin. We have made corrections in figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In this paper, why was heat-killed S. aureus used in some experiments (L. 125-133, L. 135-138, L. 144-148, etc.) and live <italic>S. aureus</italic> was used in others (L. 174-176, L. 180-183, L. 187-189, etc.)? Was there any difference between them? Please describe and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. In our study, heat-killed <italic>S. aureus</italic> was used in the experiments in fibroblasts, and live <italic>S. aureus</italic> was used in experiments in macrophages. Since fibroblasts are non-immune cells, heat-killed <italic>S. aur</italic>eus was used to simulate the ligands that activate membrane receptors on non-phagocytotic cells to investigate the signal conduct pathways in immune responses. While macrophages are phagocytotic immune cells, the challenge of live <italic>S. aureus</italic> was used to explore the signaling pathways that are activated during phagocytosis and elimination of <italic>S. aureus</italic> by immune cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– L. 180-183. In Figure S3D, there was a huge difference in infection rates of <italic>S. aureus</italic> at MOI=10 between WT1 and WT2. Please explain and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely with the reviewer’s comment. We speculated that the difference in infection rate between WT1 and WT2 was caused by the difference in TLR2 expression level on the surface of WT macrophages. In order to make sure the reproducibility of the data, we have repeated this experiment. Please see the revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– L. 199-201 and L. 205-207. In the absence of S. aureus treatment, why did WT macrophages show significantly higher LC3-I expression than TLR2-4 macrophages (Figure 3F and 3G)? But in L. 201-204, when <italic>S. aureus</italic> was not treated, why did TLR2-4 macrophages show significantly higher LC3-I expression than WT macrophages (Figure S3G)? Please describe and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. It was found that the LC3I expression in untreated macrophages and fibroblasts were different, which suggested that TLR2-4 might affect the expression of LC3I in different cells. In addition, it has been shown that cells in the two experiments often resulted in the different levels of LC3I expression, even in cells of the same strain (Fei et al., 2020). In the Figure 3F and 3G, macrophages were infected by live <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while in Figure 2—figure supplement 1H, fibroblasts were stimulated by HK-SA, which could result in different expression levels of LC3I in the two experiments. We have made corrections in the revised manuscript. Please see the text on page 11, lines 209-211.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– L. 220-222. The authors described that the lysosomal activity of WT macrophages was similar to that of the TLR2-4 transgenic macrophages treated with Bafilomycin A1. So, in Figure S3H, were &quot;TLR2-4 + <italic>S. aureus</italic>&quot; and &quot;TLR2-4 + Bafilomycin A1 + <italic>S. aureus</italic>&quot; marked incorrectly?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this mistake. The legends in Figure S3H were mislabeled. We have made corrections in revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– These abbreviations should be spelled out at first use: &quot;TLR&quot; (L. 29), &quot;WT&quot; (L. 130), &quot;HK-SA&quot; (Figure 1I), &quot;WB&quot; (L. 398). It would be good to check the whole manuscript to make sure abbreviations are used correctly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We have carefully revised the abbreviations in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The loading control, GAPDH, seems to change due to the treatment (as shown in Figures 5A, B and D). This raises the question of whether the quantitative data for the target protein is reliable. Do the authors have another loading control, or can they also use total protein?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable suggestion. GAPDH, initially identified as a glycolytic enzyme and considered as a housekeeping gene, is widely used as internal controls for gene expression normalization for western blotting in macrophages (Fang et al., 2021; Laha et al., 2019). Therefore, we selected <italic>GAPDH</italic> as housekeeping gene. However, the bicinchoninic colorimetric (BCA) assay was sometimes insufficient for accurate total protein quantification resulting in changes in the reference protein. In order to clearly display the proportional change of the target genes, we have added the ratios of target genes to housekeeping genes in Figures. In addition, we found that <italic>GAPDH</italic> in the first panel of Figure 5A changed after treatment. <italic>Tubulin</italic> has replaced <italic>GAPDH</italic> as housekeeping gene now. Please see the revised Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For some Figures (i.e. Figures 5A, B and D) the horizontally indicated group of WT contains some of the TLR2-3 experimental group. The full name and abbreviation in the legend are used at the same time and it would be recommended to be more uniform (Figure 5). DNA size of the ladder should also be marked in Figure 2F, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for careful reading. Since the names of inhibitors are relatively long, we use abbreviations to make the legends clearer in Figure 5. Among them, endocytosis inhibitor Dynasore, <italic>TAK1</italic> inhibitor Takinib, and TBK1 inhibitor Amlexanox, are generally not represented by abbreviations in the articles (Mowers et al., 2013; Panipinto et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2019). Therefore, we have kept the full names for the convenience of readers to understand better. We have marked DNA size of the ladder in Figure 2F, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C. Please see the revised Figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– On Page 16, lines 329-331: the authors mentioned that: conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was increased in TLR2-4 macrophages with <italic>S. aureus</italic> treatment by activator Forskolin, while was decreased by inhibitor H-89. However, the LC3-I and LC3-II patterns didn't show an obvious difference between Forskolin and H-89-treated groups (Figure 6G), thus, the authors need to repeat this experiment and/or interpret the data accurately.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. LC3I to LC3II conversion on western blot analysis is now widely used to monitor autophagy. We have marked the ratios of LC3II to LC3I in Figure 6G. As shown in revised Figure 6G, cAMP upregulation by activator Forskolin resulted in enhancement of LC3-II to LC3-I ratio in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected TLR2-4 macrophages. Further, pretreated with the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 significantly reduced the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected TLR2-4 macrophages but not in the <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected wide type macrophages. These data indicated that TLR2-4 enhanced <italic>S. aureus</italic>-induced autophagy in macrophages via cAMP-PKA signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The two RNA-seq results were not compared, resulting in a lack of overall understanding of the total number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In lines 136-138, 557 DEGs were detected between TLR2-4 and WT fibroblast cells. Similarly, in lines 235-237, 1310 DEGs were detected between TLR2-4 and WT macrophages. So what's the number of common and unique genes for these two experiments? What are the possible reasons for the difference between the two results?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. In the two RNA sequencing experiments, cells were processed differently. In Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, both <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected TLR2-4 and WT fibroblasts were pretreated with siRNA targeting endogenous TLR2 to detect whether TLR2-4 we transfected could recognize <italic>S. aureus</italic>. In the second RNA-seq experiment, TLR2-4 and WT macrophages were directly treated with <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Therefore, the number of DEGs were different in the two experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In line 291-292, the author mentioned that previous studies demonstrated the activation of JNK and ERK signaling promotes the expression of ATG5 and ATG12. This conclusion seems not to be supported by this research, as the author came to a conclusion that inhibition of JNK and ERK signaling increased the expression of the ATG5 and ATG12 (lines 292-296). For this divergence, the author has not made further elaboration and discussion, nor has it been reflected in the subsequent Figure 7. The authors should make sure their data is reproducible and comment on these divergent findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. We have repeated this experiment to ensure the reproducibility of the data, and the results are shown in the following figure.

Since many researches have demonstrated that the adaptor MyD88 is required for TLR2 and TLR4 signal transduction (Akira and Takeda, 2004; Fitzgerald et al., 2001), we examined the activation of downstream MAPKs and NF-κB. To determine the accuracy of our data, we have monitored the expression of MyD88 in TLR2-4 and WT macrophages, as shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A. The results were consistent with previous studies, which found that the expression of MyD88 in TLR2-4 macrophages was significantly higher than that in WT macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some aspects of image acquisition and data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p><p>1) The description of the results is inaccurate and inconsistent with the Figures.

However, as shown in Figures 1F and G, the mRNA level of IL-8 in TLR2-4 fibroblast cells with siTLR2 was dramatically decreased with P2CSK4, P3CSK4 treatment, while only increased with heat-killed <italic>S. aureus</italic> treatment. In addition, the mRNA level of IL1B was also inconsistent across treatment groups, which the authors did not explain in detail.

The siRNA did not affect TLR2-4 because it targets the intracellular domain of endogenous TLR2.
