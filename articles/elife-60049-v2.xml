Here, we report a bacterial protein with BAR domain-like activity, BdpA, from <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR-1, known to produce redox-active membrane vesicles and micrometer-scale outer membrane extensions (OMEs). BdpA is required for uniform size distribution of membrane vesicles and influences scaffolding of OMEs into a consistent diameter and curvature. Cryo-TEM reveals that a strain lacking BdpA produces lobed, disordered OMEs rather than membrane tubules or narrow chains produced by the wild-type strain. Overexpression of BdpA promotes OME formation during planktonic growth of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> where they are not typically observed. Heterologous expression results in OME production in <italic>Marinobacter atlanticus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Based on the ability of BdpA to alter membrane architecture in vivo, we propose that BdpA and its homologs comprise a newly identified class of bacterial BAR domain-like proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BAR domain</kwd><kwd>extracellular electron transport</kwd><kwd>membrane shaping</kwd><kwd>outer membrane vesicles</kwd><kwd>outer membrane extensions</kwd><kwd><italic>Shewanella</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glaven</surname><given-names>Sarah M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-18-1-2632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>El-Naggar</surname><given-names>Mohamed Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1542527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>El-Naggar</surname><given-names>Mohamed Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-13ER16415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>El-Naggar</surname><given-names>Mohamed Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM122588</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Grant J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014819</institution-id><institution>U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PE 0601102A Project VR9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miklos</surname><given-names>Aleksandr E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Uniform diameter and curvature of the outer membrane extensions and vesicles of <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> are maintained by a bacterial Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain-like protein BdpA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial outer membrane vesicle (OMV) formation is ubiquitous and has many documented functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Toyofuku et al., 2018</xref>).

Researchers suspect that pathways for OMV and OME formation have some mechanistic overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2019</xref>). Bacterial cell membrane curvature is observed during the formation of OMVs and OMEs, and it is proposed that proteins are necessary to stabilize these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohuszewicz et al., 2016</xref>). Several bacterial proteins have demonstrated membrane tubule formation capabilities in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danne et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danne et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Danne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Low et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Low and Löwe, 2006</xref>), but despite the growing number of reports, proteins involved in shaping bacterial membranes into OMV/OMEs in living cells have yet to be identified.</p><p>In eukaryotes, Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain-containing proteins generate membrane curvature through electrostatic interactions between positively charged amino acids and negatively charged lipids scaffolding the membrane along the intrinsically curved surface of the antiparallel coiled-coil protein dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frost et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shimada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Weissenhorn, 2005</xref>). The extent of accumulation of BAR domain proteins at a specific site can influence the degree of the resultant membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Simunovic et al., 2015</xref>), and tubulation events arise as a consequence of BAR domain multimerization in conjunction with lipid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mim et al., 2012</xref>). Interactions between BAR domain proteins and membranes resolve membrane tension, promote membrane stability, and aid in localizing cellular processes, such as actin binding, signaling through small GTPases, membrane vesicle scission, and vesicular transport of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Habermann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carman and Dominguez, 2018</xref>). Some BAR domain-containing proteins, such as the N-BAR protein BIN1, contain an amphipathic alpha helical wedge that inserts into the outer membrane leaflet and can assist in BAR domain binding to the target membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drin and Antonny, 2010</xref>). Other BAR domains can be accompanied by a membrane targeting domain, such as PX for phosphoinositide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Seet and Hong, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itoh and De Camilli, 2006</xref>), in order to direct membrane curvature formation at specific sites, as is the case with sorting nexin BAR (SNX-BAR) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knævelsrud et al., 2013</xref>). These SNX-BAR domain proteins involved in endocytic and vesicle transport mechanisms can be effector targets during bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mirrashidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aeberhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Latomanski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liebl et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, F-BAR protein PACSIN2, known to remodel cell membranes and associate with the actin cytoskeleton, is specifically recruited during HIV-1 infection and aids in cell-to-cell spreading of viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Popov et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite our knowledge of numerous eukaryotic BAR domain-containing proteins spanning a variety of modes of curvature formation, membrane localizations, and subtypes, characterization of a functional bacterial BAR domain protein has yet to be reported. Previously described membrane curvature-promoting proteins in bacteria are unrelated to BAR domain proteins or contain features ancillary to eukaryotic BAR domain protein function, such as amphipathic alpha helices (SpoVM, PmtA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danne et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danne et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), GTPase-associated signaling (FtsZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Löwe and Amos, 1998</xref>), or positive curvature localization (SpoVM, MamY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Toro-Nahuelpan et al., 2019</xref>). However, actin-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van den Ent and Löwe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2005</xref>), dynamin-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Low and Löwe, 2006</xref>), and ESCRT-II-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Junglas, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu, 2020</xref>) proteins have been previously discovered in bacteria and archaea, suggesting that vesicle formation and tubule biogenesis can be achieved through evolutionarily conserved mechanisms.</p><p><italic>S. oneidensis</italic> is a model organism for extracellular electron transfer (EET), a mode of respiration whereby metabolic electrons reduce exogenous terminal electron acceptors such as metals and electrodes. In <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>, this requires electrons to traverse the inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane via multiheme cytochromes that subsequently pass electrons to soluble electron shuttles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nealson and Scott, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marsili et al., 2008</xref>) or directly to insoluble electron acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kotloski and Gralnick, 2013</xref>). The production of OMVs and OMEs in <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> is well documented, particularly upon surface attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pirbadian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gorby et al., 2008</xref>), and previous measurements showed that both are redox-active and can reduce extracellular iron, uranium, and technetium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gorby et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). OMEs transition between membrane blebs or OMVs into chains of vesicles and tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pirbadian et al., 2014</xref>); however, little is known about the mechanism controlling OME formation, shape, and curvature.</p><p>Here, we describe a component critical to the membrane morphology of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> OMVs and OMEs as a putative BAR domain-like protein, which we term BdpA (<underline>B</underline>AR <underline>d</underline>omain-like <underline>p</underline>rotein A). Through comparative proteomics, cryogenic electron microscopy, and molecular biology, we show that BdpA is enriched in OME/OMVs and influences both their diameter and shape. Likewise, expression of BdpA elicited changes to membrane morphology in other bacteria, showing mechanistic evidence of BAR domain protein-mediated activity in vivo. This study frames future characterization efforts on other bacterial proteins with BAR domain-like activity in the context of OME/OMVs, and putative BAR domain-containing BdpA homologs in other bacteria suggests such domains may be widespread.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Redox-active <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> OMVs are enriched with BdpA</title><p>OMVs were purified from <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> cells grown in batch cultures to characterize their redox features and unique proteome, as well as to identify putative membrane shaping proteins.

The C-terminal BAR domain of BdpA is predicted to span an alpha helical region from AA 276 to 451 (E-value = 2.96e-03); however, since the identification of the protein is based on homology to the eukaryotic BAR domain consensus sequence (cd07307), it is possible that the BAR domain region extends beyond these bounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Coiled-coil prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vincent et al., 2013</xref>) suggests that BdpA exists in an oligomeric state of antiparallel alpha-helical dimers, as is the case for all known BAR domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frost et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linkner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henne et al., 2007</xref>). BdpA has an N-terminal signal peptide with predicted cleavage sites between amino acids 22 and 23, suggesting non-cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A galactose-binding domain-like region positioned immediately downstream of the signal peptide supports lipid targeting activity seen in other BAR domain proteins, such as the eukaryotic sorting nexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van Weering and Cullen, 2014</xref>).

We observed a clear difference in the size distribution of OMVs between strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> left).

The average diameter of OMVs from the Δ<italic>bdpA+ bdpA</italic> strain was 136 nm (s.d. = ± 4 nm), which was significantly different than WT (p = &lt;0.001).

However, the F ratio to compare variances was a high 38.75, with a significant p-value of &lt;0.00001. Similarly, the variances in vesicle size required the use of the Welch’s post-correction to compare deletion strain and complement strain, which resulted in a significant difference between the two strains (p = 0.011). The variances were not significantly different between the WT and complement strain so the Welch’s post-correction was not necessary.

Therefore, we reanalyzed a subset of our data to quantify the proportion of cells that produced large vesicles where the outline of the stained lipid membrane (with a dark unstained interior) could clearly be distinguished within the limits of resolution of our measurements, typically those with an approximate diameter of 300 nm or greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

For these reasons, the effect of BdpA on membrane remodeling was tested by overexpression in the WT strain, as well as by orthogonal expression in two different host strains with no predicted BAR domain-containing proteins and no apparent OME production.</p><p><italic>S. oneidensis</italic> OMEs are more commonly observed in surface-attached cells than planktonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>).

A PSI-BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) search against the NCBI nr database was performed using the BAR domain amino acid sequence of BdpA as the initial query to identify BdpA homologs in other organisms. BdpA homologs were annotated as hypothetical proteins in all of the species identified. In the initial round, 24 proteins were found from other organisms identified as <italic>Shewanella</italic> with a high conservation among the proteins and another 28 proteins were found in more distant bacterial species that had an amino acid identity of 65–44%. A second iteration identified a few proteins from more distantly related bacterial species, followed by proteins from the eukaryotic phylum <italic>Arthropoda</italic> that were annotated as being centrosomal proteins. Only five of the proteins from the search returned hits to the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) of the BAR cd07307, but two did not have any unique residues within the BAR domain. Overall, BdpA barely met the criteria to be assigned as matching the BAR domain via PSSM models. The rest of the protein homologs identified had enough differences to fail to match the BAR model despite all having greater than 44% amino acid identity to the <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> BdpA sequence. An attempt was made to build a hidden Markov model (HMM) using hmmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finn et al., 2011</xref>) to use for searching for other proteins that might match, but as with the PSI-BLAST search, only the proteins that formed the model were returned as good matches. This indicates that while sequence homology between BdpA and the existing BAR domain consensus sequence predicted the BAR domain region in BdpA using hmmer or NCBI tools, the sequence conservation is at the cusp of a positive hit by the HMM since other closely related (&gt;90% homology) BdpA orthologs were not predicted to contain a BAR domain by this method. The eukaryotic protein that is most similar to BdpA (27% amino acid identity) is a putative centrosomal protein in the ant <italic>Vollenhovia emeryi</italic> (accession #: XP_011868153) that is predicted to contain an amino terminal C2 membrane-binding domain and a carboxy-terminal SMC domain within a coiled-coil region. Despite CDD search failing to predict the presence of a BAR domain in this protein, it does not preclude the presence of one, pending an updated BAR Pfam HMM. Alternatively, the homology could be due to convergent evolution because of the necessary spacing of polar amino acids to maintain the coiled-coil structure in both BdpA and XP_011868153.</p><p>Fifty-two BdpA homologs were identified by PSI-BLAST in most but not all species of <italic>Shewanella</italic>, as well as <italic>Alishewanella</italic>, <italic>Rheinheimera</italic>, and <italic>Cellvibrio</italic>. The current BAR domain Pfam HMM prediction analysis identified BAR domain features in only 5 of the 52 bacterial homologs despite greater than 90% homology to <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> BdpA.

This shows that the BdpA homologs identified by PSI-BLAST form a cohesive group with most sequences forming clades by genus. The four unique BAR domain sequences from the five BdpA homologs predicted to contain a BAR domain based on the current model were subsequently aligned with representative known BAR domain-containing proteins from the various BAR domain subtypes (N-BAR, F-BAR, and I-BAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Salzer et al., 2017</xref>), bacterial proteins with known membrane remodeling phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danne et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Löwe and Amos, 1998</xref>), along with the most diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lu et al., 2020</xref>) BAR domain CDD sequences from eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

It is possible that BdpA arose as a result of convergent evolution due to selection of positively charged amino acids at key locations along the helices. There is also a possibility that the predicted BAR domain-containing region arose as a result of horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryote due to the prevalence of eukaryotic coiled-coil proteins with predicted homology to BdpA after two iterations of PSI-BLAST. However, the branch lengths and low bootstrap values supporting the placement of many of the BAR domain subtypes prevent us from directly inferring the evolutionary history of BAR domains. Discovery of other putative bacterial BAR proteins would help to build this analysis, and if future comparative proteomics analysis of OME/OMVs demonstrates overlapping activity of BdpA with preferential cargo loading into OME/OMVs, it could hint at the evolutionary origins of vesicle-based protein trafficking. Conservation of BAR domain proteins supports the notion that three-dimensional organization of proteins in lipid structures is as important to bacteria as it is eukaryotes, and suggests that additional novel bacterial BAR domain-like proteins are waiting to be discovered.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>S. oneidensis</italic> expresses a functional membrane sculpting protein with BAR domain-like activity and homology, which is the first identified and characterized in bacteria. Enrichment of BdpA in the redox-active OMVs and BdpA-mediated sculpting of the OMVs into a uniform diameter suggests overlapping mechanistic functionality with eukaryotic BAR proteins in the context of vesicle constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daumke et al., 2014</xref>). This finding was further demonstrated through fluorescence microscopy during perfusion flow, where more cells produced large vesicles in the absence of BdpA. Membrane constriction activity of BdpA was confirmed through cryo-EM images that depicted disordered tubules in the absence of BdpA. Variation in OMEs with BdpA ranged from ordered, narrow vesicle chains of a consistent diameter to stable tubules. The closest phylogenetic eukaryotic BAR domain subtype to BdpA, F-BAR domains, exhibits similar variation in tubule morphology, depending upon the orientation of the tip-to-tip oligomerization around the tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frost et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shimada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). While the presence of the predicted galactose-binding domain-like region at the N-terminal end of the protein suggests possible localization to the outer membrane, we cannot rule out that membrane sculpting phenotypes observed with BdpA are an indirect consequence of binding to LPS or through association with periplasmic components, such as peptidoglycan, at this time. Subsequent studies will include vesicle constriction into tubules in vitro with purified protein to ascertain the extent of functional mechanistic similarity of BdpA to other F-BAR proteins. Ultimately, the discovery of BdpA and its homologs presents a critical step in understanding the impact of membrane sculpting proteins with BAR domain-like activity on extracellular membrane structures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The 20 cm × 50 μm ID column was heated to 60°C. The peptides were separated with a 120 min gradient at a flow rate of 220 nL/min. The gradient was as follows: 2–6% solvent B (7.5 min), 6–25% solvent B (82.5 min), and 25–40% solvent B (30 min) and to 100% solvent B (9 min). Solvent A consisted of 97.8% H<sub>2</sub>O, 2% acetonitrile, and 0.2% formic acid and solvent B consisted of 19.8% H<sub>2</sub>O, 80% ACN, and 0.2% formic acid. The QExactive HF Orbitrap was operated in data-dependent mode with the Tune (version 2.7 SP1build 2659) instrument control software. Spray voltage was set to 2.5 kV, S-lens RF level at 50, and heated capillary at 275°C. Full scan resolution was set to 60,000 at m/z 200. Full scan target was 3 × 106 with a maximum injection time of 15 ms. Mass range was set to 300–1650 m/z.

Measurements were recorded from three biological replicates (independent cultures) for each strain on separate days.</p><p>The perfusion chamber, microscope, and flow medium described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pirbadian et al., 2014</xref>) were used here. For each imaging experiment, the perfusion chamber was first filled with SDM flow medium, then &lt;1 mL of washed cells were slowly injected for a surface density of ~100–300 cells per 112 × 112 µm field of view on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope with the NIS-Elements AR software. Cells were allowed to attach for 5–15 min on the coverslip before perfusion flow was resumed at a volumetric flow rate of 6.25 ± 0.1 µL/s. Cells were visualized with the red membrane stain FM 4–64 FX which was added to the flow medium (0.25 µg/mL of flow medium). At least five random fields of view for each biological replicate were repeatedly imaged at 5 min intervals over the course of 5 hr, creating a time-lapse series similar to time-lapse microscopy previously performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pirbadian et al., 2014</xref>). A total of 2607 WT and 2943 Δ<italic>bdpA</italic> cells (from three independent biological replicate experiments per strain) were manually counted and inspected for OMVs and OMEs, as done previously for WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong et al., 2019</xref>). For each independent experiment, the proportion of cells producing either type of membrane feature over the course of the experiment was calculated by dividing the number of cells for which a membrane feature was observed by the number of total cells for each strain; the proportions from each independent experiment were averaged for each strain to obtain the mean proportions for each strain that were plotted in bar graphs. A random subset of time-lapse microscopy videos from each replicate (1273 WT cells and 1317 Δ<italic>bdpA</italic> cells) were reanalyzed to specifically identify cells that made large vesicles, whether individual vesicles (directly associated with the stained membrane of the cell body) or noted as part of a vesicle chain. Considering diffraction-limited resolution in widefield fluorescence microscopy, large vesicles were defined as those where an unstained interior could clearly be resolved and were typically found to be &gt;300 nm. Estimates of vesicle diameter were determined using the line measurement tool in ImageJ. For each independent experiment, the proportion of cells producing large vesicles was calculated by dividing the number of cells producing large vesicles by the total number of cells; the proportions from each independent experiment were averaged for each strain to obtain the mean proportions for each strain that were plotted in bar graphs. Statistical significance between strains was determined using the Pearson’s chi-squared test for comparing proportions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Imaging of static cultures</title><p><italic>S. oneidensis</italic> WT, Δ<italic>bdpA</italic>, and Δ<italic>bdpA+ bdpA</italic> strains were grown in LB medium (supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin for Δ<italic>bdpA+ bdpA</italic>) overnight, washed twice with SDM, and diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05 in 1 mL of SDM (supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin and 12.5 µM DAPG for Δ<italic>bdpA+ bdpA</italic>). Three independent biological replicates (cultures) were included for each strain. To visualize the cell membranes, 100 µL of diluted culture was labeled with 1 µL 1 M FM 4–64. After staining, 10 µL of the labeled cell suspension was gently pipetted onto Lab-Tek chambered #1 cover glass (Thermo Fischer Scientific). On average, uninduced membrane extension formation could be observed 45 min after deposition of the cell suspension onto the chambered cover glass surface. After 3 hr, images were collected at 0.27–0.63 s intervals over 20 s per field of view to capture the dynamics of the rapidly moving OMEs and ensure accurate counting of OMEs as they traverse focal planes. These single frame time series images were collected of either a 50.71 µm by 50.71 µm (2× zoom) or a 20.28 µm by 20.28 µm (5× zoom) field of view on a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion M27 objective. Widefield fluorescence images were taken using an LED-Module 511 nm light source at 74.2% intensity with 583–600 nm filters and a 91 He CFP/YFP/mCherry reflector. Excitation and emission peaks were 506 and 751 nm, respectively. Images were collected using a Hamamatsu camera with a 250 ms exposure time. Images were recorded using the Zeiss Zen software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Thornwood, NY). All cells were counted manually and categorized as either with extension or without extension (a total of 2444 cells from WT, 4378 cells from Δ<italic>bdpA</italic>, and 3354 cells from Δ<italic>bdpA+ bdpA</italic>). The proportion of cells with OMEs was calculated by dividing the number of cells with extensions by the total number of cells per strain. Statistical significance between the mean proportion of each strain was determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test.</p><p>To test for both planktonic production of OMEs in WT <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> (WT + <italic>bdpA</italic>) and expression of BdpA in <italic>M. atlanticus</italic> (CP1+ <italic>bdpA</italic>) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (BL21+ <italic>bdpA</italic>), overnight cultures for each strain were diluted in either SDM for <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>, BB for <italic>M. atlanticus</italic>, or LB for <italic>E. coli</italic> to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05 and induced with the indicated concentration of DAPG for 1 hr at 30°C (or 37°C for <italic>E. coli</italic>) with 200 rpm shaking agitation. Prior to pipetting, ~ 1 cm of the p200 pipette tip was trimmed to minimize shear forces during transfer. A 100 µL aliquot of each culture was labeled with 1 µL 1 M FM 4–64 as before, 10 µL deposited onto 22 mm × 22 mm No. 1 cover glass (VWR), and sealed onto glass slides with clear acrylic nail polish to restrict mobility in the Z direction and facilitate immediate imaging of OMEs produced during planktonic induction of BdpA. Each sample was imaged immediately after mounting onto the glass slides. Imaging experiments were performed on at least three individual biological replicate experiments per strain, and are representative images from 5 to 10 fields of view per replicate from 700 cells for <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> WT, 472 cells for <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> WT + <italic>bdpA</italic>, 4041 cells for <italic>M. atlanticus</italic> CP1 WT, 150 cells for <italic>M. atlanticus</italic> CP1+ <italic>bdpA</italic>, 2190 cells for <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 WT, and 2623 cells for <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21+ <italic>bdpA</italic>. As before, the proportion of cells producing either type of membrane feature was calculated by dividing the number of cells for which a membrane feature was observed by the number of total cells for each strain; the proportions from each independent experiment were averaged for each strain to obtain the mean proportions for each strain that were plotted in bar graphs. The proportion of cells associating with OMEs observed from each biological replicate culture was recorded, as well as if the associated OME resembled either a tubule-like or web-like structure. Tubule-like OMEs were defined as narrow, unbranching membrane extensions. Cells that were associated with a branching, reticular membrane were counted as producing a web-like OME. Statistical significance of the proportions of cells associated to each of the OME phenotypes between strains was determined by Welch’s t-test. Confocal images were taken by a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion M27 objective. FM 4–64 fluorescence was excited at 506 nm: 0.20% laser power. Fluorescence emission was detected from 592 to 700 nm using the LSM 800 GaAsP-Pmt2 detector. High-resolution confocal fluorescence images of CP1+ <italic>bdpA</italic> and BL21+ <italic>bdpA</italic> OMEs were collected using the Zeiss LSM 800 Airyscan detector module for the confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion M27 objective, 10× post-objective magnification, and Airyscan image processing. Images are Airyscan-processed maximum intensity projections of a z-stack image series over a 1.32–2.64 µm z-stack height at 0.18–20 µm intervals. Time course Airyscan images of BL21+ <italic>bdpA</italic> OME elongation were recorded of a single cell every 30 min for an hour. <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> OMEs could not be recorded by Airyscan due to rapid movement.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy</title><p><italic>Shewanella</italic> strains were streaked onto LB plates with or without kanamycin and allowed to incubate 3 days on a benchtop. The night before freezing, individual colonies were inoculated into 3 mL LB±kanamycin and incubated at 30°C overnight with 200 rpm shaking. The following morning optical densities of the cultures were measured at 600 nm and adjusted to a final OD<sub>600</sub> of 1. Cells were pelleted at 8000 rpm for 3 min for buffer exchange/washes. For the Δ<italic>bdpA + bdpA</italic> cells, 12.5 µM DAPG was added. A freshly glow discharged 200 mesh copper grid with R2/1 Quantifoil carbon film was placed into a concavity slide. Approximately 150 µL of a 1:10 dilution of the cell suspensions, with or without the inducer, was added to cover the grid. A glass coverslip was then lowered onto the concavity to exclude air bubbles. The edges of the coverslip were then sealed with nail polish to prevent media evaporation. The slide assembly was then incubated in a 30°C incubator for 90 min or 3 hr. Immediately prior to plunge freezing, the top coverslip was removed by scoring the nail polish with a razor blade. TEM grids with cells were gently retrieved with forceps and loaded into a Leica grid plunge for automated blotting and plunging into LN<sub>2</sub>-cooled liquid ethane. Vitrified grids were transferred to an LN<sub>2</sub> storage dewar. Imaging of frozen samples was performed on either a Titan (Thermo Fisher Scientific) microscope equipped with a Gatan Ultrascan camera and operating at 300 kV or a Talos (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Ceta camera and operating at 200 kV. Images were acquired at 10,000× to 20,000× magnification and were adjusted by bandpass filtering. Unfixed OMEs were sorted based on appearance into four categories as described in the main text, that is, tubules, narrow chains, irregular chains, or blebs/bulges. At the 90 min time point, phenotypes were documented from observations of 14 WT, 12 Δ<italic>bdpA</italic>, and 41 Δ<italic>bdpA + bdpA</italic> OMEs over three separate biological replicates, with two technical replicates of each strain per biological replicate. At the 3 hr time point, phenotypes were documented from observations of 31 WT, 13 Δ<italic>bdpA</italic>, and 3 Δ<italic>bdpA + bdpA</italic> OMEs over three separate biological replicates, with two technical replicates of each strain per biological replicate. For the 2 hr planktonic induction of BdpA in the WT + <italic>bdpA</italic> strain, nine total OMEs were observed across two separate biological replicates. The proportion of membrane phenotypes was calculated by summing the number of instances a phenotype was observed across all replicates for a given strain and dividing by the total number of OMEs observed for that strain. Representative images only are given for the 90 min time point and for the WT + p452 bdpA strain.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors propose the identification of a novel protein involved in outer membrane remodelling, named BdpA (BAR domain-like protein A). According to the proposed model BdpA has a conserved role in membrane curvature control during formation of outer membrane vesicle (OMV) and of outer membrane extension (OMEs) in Shewanella oneidensis. The authors also provide evidence that heterologous expression of BdpA promotes formation of OMEs in other bacteria (namely in <italic>E. coli</italic>), and that, BdpA is sufficient to induce OME-like structures when expressed in in conditions where OMEs are normally not formed. In eukaryotes proteins containing BAR domains are important for shaping membrane curvature. Given the homology of BdpA to eukaryotic BAR-domain proteins, the authors suggest that BdpA and its homologs define the first prokaryotic family of BAR proteins or pBARs, with eukaryotic-like roles in membrane curvature modulation.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers think that this is a very interesting study, and provided that further support is obtained to substantiate the proposed model the reviewers agree that the findings described here tackle a number of significant questions of broad interest. However, the reviewers also think that the evidence provided in this manuscript still does not fully support the conclusion that BdpA protein is involved in membrane curvature control as the eukaryotic proteins containing the BAR domains.</p><p>We have complied a list of comments that we hope will help the authors address the concerns of the reviewers to obtain stronger support for the function of BdpA.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The reviewers are concerned that some of the conclusions are based on qualitative observations of microscopy analysis of OMVs and OMEs, and quantitative analyses are lacking to validate qualitative observations. The reviewers propose that the data should be re-analyzed to obtain quantitative results. Specifically, a size distribution analyses could be applied to some microscopy data. Also note that the microcopy methods are poorly described, and as the calculation methods used not fully available it is difficult to understand if the appropriated methods were used. Please specify how many cells were examined microscopically and how many biological replicates (cultures) were used in each experiment.</p><p>2 Statistical analyses were not always the most accurate. In figure 2 unpaired t-test was used for samples that have high variance, this approach may inflate the statistical difference between the strains. For figure 2 a histogram of size distribution analyses could be shown for each strain.</p><p>3. The reviewers are concerned that the proteomic data is not clear enough to conclude that the BdpA protein is localized to or enriched in OMV/OME. Could the results be complemented with some other method to confirm BdpA localization? The reviewers are particularly concerned by the fact that a large number of proteins were identified in the OMV fraction. Could it be that some the OMV/OME fractions were contaminated? What controls were used to ensure that the purification procedure was working effectively? Could the data be strengthened by some quality control analyses to determine how many of those proteins are actually predicted to localize to the outer membrane and periplasm? From the methods it seems that the culture conditions used to prepare the OM versus OMV were different, is this so? If yes, why were the culture conditions different? This could affect protein expression? Please include the detailed growth conditions in the method section.</p><p>4. The conclusion that BdpA is a BAR-domain protein is largely based on homology. The supplementary information file includes homology models that show striking similarity with eukaryotic BAR proteins. However, as the authors state, BdpA barely meets the cutoff for a BAR-domain protein. The results with the phenotype of the BdpA mutant, complementations and sufficiency data provide good support to the functional role of BdpA in membrane remodelling. However, the effect of BdpA on membrane stability could be indirect or the result of binding to outer membrane features in a manner distinct from other BAR proteins. Could these results be strengthened with some biochemical corroboration of its activity on membranes or structural data to confirm its relationship to eukaryotic Bar domain proteins? Or structural data to confirm its relationship to eukaryotic BAR domain proteins?</p><p>5. The reviewers propose that the paper would be strengthened with the addition of topological studies in OMVs and OMEs. The reviewers had problems in reconciling the presence of a galactose-binding domain in BdpA and LPS sugar binding. The authors hypothesize that the putative Galactose-binding domain of BdpA mediates binding to LPS. However, it is also possible that it binds to peptidoglycan components. This would suggest that the proteins interact with the periplasmic side of the outer membrane rather than coat the OMV to promote OMV formation and release (which one could assume based on the role of some eukaryotic BARs). The addition of topological studies (or some biochemical approach) could make these models less speculative strengthening the conclusions.</p><p>6. Heterologous expression of BdpA in other bacteria provides important compelling arguments for its central role in producing OMEs. However, the imaging data provided do not provide the clearest evidence for induction of OMEs in M. atlanticus and <italic>E. coli</italic>. This is especially the case with the <italic>E. coli</italic> images. The extended web of staining in 4c does not resemble the tubules seen in S. oneidensis. It would be great to have some electron microscopy data and/or higher resolution fluorescence images of these bacteria as corroborating evidence. Additionally, only a few cells are shown and quantification of the proportion of cells with OMEs is needs. Thus, as already discussed in point 1, quantitative analyses could improve this important point.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the revised version of your article &quot;A Prokaryotic Membrane Sculpting BAR Domain Protein&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Nonetheless, based on the individual comments of the reviewers below and the discussion among them through the consultation section the reviewers thought that there are still some essential points that need to be modified before accepting the paper in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) An important point is related to how to classify the BdpA sculpting protein studied here. The reviewers think that this protein should be called a Bacterial Membrane Sculpting Protein as opposed to a &quot;prokorayotic&quot; because there is no solid support for the presence of such a protein in Archaea. Additionally, upon discussion there are still concerns that the homology data of BdpA with BAR domain proteins is not very strong, especially taking into account that mistakes have been previously made with other proteins (eg. MamY).</p><p>We would like to propose that the authors put emphasis on the fact that the paper shows that BdpA has an important role in Outer membrane Vesicle formation in bacteria. Additionally, as the paper shows strong experimental support that BdpA is working as a Bacterial Membrane Sculpting Protein with a BAR-like mechanism, we propose that more emphasis is put on that than on the homology. Therefore, we propose that the title is change to something like A Bacterial Membrane Sculpting Protein with a BAR-like mechanism, or simply A Bacterial Membrane Sculpting Protein.</p><p>The text should also be changed to give more emphasis that the classification of BdpA as sculpting protein with a BAR-like mechanism is based on the observed phenotypes, and on structural similarities to eukaryotic BAR proteins, more than only homology.</p><p>2) As it is possible that the BdpA effects observed are indirect (for example through indirect interactions with the peptidoglycan or LPS sugar components), it is important that the authors acknowledge in the paper that future required to address this possibility. Additionally, as FtsA is related to BdpA and eukaryotic BARs (FIGURE 5), we recommend that the authors discuss the possibility that FtsA and BdpA have redundant functions in cell division, namely by stabilizing FtsZ (see reviewer #3 comments).</p><p>3) Please revised the statistical analysis of Figure 3D. Reviewer #3 is suggesting that it might be better to use these results for depicting the variations in OME structure rather than definitive assessment of their phenotypes in various strains. (see specific comment 1 of Reviewer #3)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have provided extensive data and methodology that answer many of my original questions. I still have a few questions and concerns:</p><p>1. Some of the statistics are not convincing. If I am reading the legend correctly, Figure 3D numbers are based on a very small number of samples &quot;Frequency of OME phenotypes observed with Cryo-TEM relative to the total number of OMEs observed from each strain. Phenotypes were documented from observations of 14 WT (p = 0.009), 12 ΔbdpA (p = 0.0001), and 41 ΔbdpA + bdpA (p = 2.8x10<sup>-6</sup>) OMEs at the 90 minute time point, and 31 WT, 13 ΔbdpA (p = 6.3x10<sup>-9</sup>), and 3 ΔbdpA + bdpA (p &gt; 0.05)&quot;. At the extreme end, the 3 hour complemented bar graph is depicting 3 OMEs measured. I fully understand that it is difficult to obtain high number of images with cryoEM. Perhaps, this section is more useful for depicting the variations in OME structure rather than definitive assessment of their phenotypes in various strains. How much of the observed statistical differences are influenced by the low sampling numbers?</p><p>2. I still do not agree that &quot;prokaryotic&quot; is more appropriate than &quot;bacterial.&quot; One of the primary criteria used to classify BdpA as a BAR domain protein is based on bioinformatic classification. Are there any similar archaeal proteins? If not, given the number of available archaeal genomes, the eukaryotic/prokaryotic separation seems arbitrary.</p><p>3. My other major concern is whether or not this protein is a BAR-domain protein. That is the main thrust of the paper from the title through much of the text. The effects on membrane stability are interesting but could still be indirect through interactions with the peptidoglycan or LPS sugar components. The homology to eukaryotic BAR domains is borderline. To be clear, this is not a criticism of the authors. They have done a fantastic job given the difficulties of the system. However, I am not convinced that BdpA can be called a BAR domain protein and in several instances (the title, abstract, etc) this claim is centered.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This article identifies in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 the first prokaryotic BAR domain protein, BdpA, and links its expression to the production of redox-active membrane vesicles and micrometer scale outer membrane extensions (OMEs) in this bacterium.

The reviewers are concerned that some of the conclusions are based on qualitative observations of microscopy analysis of OMVs and OMEs, and quantitative analyses are lacking to validate qualitative observations. The reviewers propose that the data should be re-analyzed to obtain quantitative results. Specifically, a size distribution analyses could be applied to some microscopy data.</p></disp-quote><p>It is unclear which microscopy the reviewers are specifically referring to here. We interpret this comment to refer to the perfusion flow experiments in Figure 2, as well as fluorescence microscopy in Figures 3 and 4.</p><p>We have reorganized Figure 2 where Figure 2c is now Figure 2b. Figure 2b presents quantitative data on the proportion of live cells from each strain that display some membrane feature (OME and/or OMV) over the course of the experiment. This experiment was performed to complement DLS analysis of purified OMVs. The advantage of the perfusion flow experiment is that it allows us to visualize the proportion of live cells that display membrane features over time and to categorize these features. Cell membrane features are dynamic and must be manually categorized by monitoring any changes using time-lapse imaging. For this reason, we imaged and manually categorized a total of 2,607 WT and 2,943 Δ<italic>bdpA</italic> cells by visually inspecting and counting the dominant feature of each cell over 5 hours. As with the DLS size distribution analysis of OMVs, no difference in the total number of OMVs was observed between strains. We also quantified OMEs and again observed no difference in the total number between strains. We hypothesized that, as seen with DLS, it was the size of the OMVs, and possibly the shape of OMEs, that is different between strains. Unfortunately, fluorescence microscopy does not allow for the resolution required to visualize the size range of OMVs determined by DLS or differences in OME morphology, therefore, we re-analyzed a subset of our data to quantify the proportion of cells that produced membrane associated large vesicles that could be clearly distinguished within the limits of resolution of our measurements, those with an approximate diameter of 300 nm or more. This limitation still allowed us to confirm that even in live cells, the mutant strain produces a greater proportion of larger OMVs. Cryo-electron microscopy presented in Figure 3e and 3f validate that indeed the morphology of OMEs in the mutant strain was different than the WT strain. We have updated the text to clarify our rationale for quantifying the total proportion of membrane features and large OMVs vs. a size distribution. We have revised Figure 2b to show the proportion of both OMVs and OMEs per strain whereas they had previously been grouped together. We also added a representative time-lapse video of both strains to show examples of the features that were quantified (Videos 1 and 2), and a representative image of these features from the Δ<italic>bdpA</italic> strain in Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</p><p>Figure 3</p><p>This figure has been completely reorganized. The figure caption and methods section have been revised to include the number of biological replicates, number of cells that were visualized / categorized as having an OME (or not) for all strains. In order to clarify, we have moved previous Supplemental Figure 2 to the main figure to highlight the quantification. In addition, we have clarified the methods and figure caption for quantification of the proportion of various OME phenotypes at 90 minutes and 3 hours for all strains reported in Figure 3. We have also included details on the statistical comparison in the figure caption and main text used to conclude that cryo-TEM images show a difference in OME phenotypes between strains and times. We have also moved images of OMEs taken at 90 minutes for the same strains from Supplemental Figure 3 to the main Figure 3 and added quantification / statistical support for these as well.</p><p>Figure 4 is discussed below in response to Essential revision 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also note that the microscopy methods are poorly described, and as the calculation methods used not fully available it is difficult to understand if the appropriated methods were used.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that microscopy methods needed to be described in more detail. We have expanded our description of the perfusion flow experiment and fluorescence imaging of static cultures in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please specify how many cells were examined microscopically and how many biological replicates (cultures) were used in each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made significant changes to the methods section, figure captions and main text where appropriate to indicate the number of biological replicates, total number of fields imaged, and total number of cells imaged. To be clear, we consider a biological replicate to be an independent culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Statistical analyses were not always the most accurate. In figure 2 unpaired t-test was used for samples that have high variance, this approach may inflate the statistical difference between the strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the variance in the size distribution of vesicles between the wild type and Δ<italic>bdpA</italic> strains is unequal. To further emphasize this, we performed a F-test of equality of variance. The F ratio between the WT and mutant strains to compare variances was a high 38.75, with a significant P value of &lt;0.00001, indicating that the variance is not equal. Therefore, we applied the Welch’s t-test to compare unpaired samples with unequal variance. In this case, there was no statistically significant difference between the mean vesicle size of the wild-type strain compared to the Δ<italic>bdpA</italic> strain. We have indicated this in the text but prefer to keep the original figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For figure 2 a histogram of size distribution analyses could be shown for each strain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 2a to show individual, binned, size distribution plots for each strain. We assume this addresses the reviewer’s comment, since a histogram would have resulted in a dimensional reduction of the data. Indeed, the revised figure more clearly shows that the mutant strain has a greater variance in the vesicle size distribution, supporting our hypothesis that the <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> BdpA protein is involved in membrane architecture. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, which improved the clarity of the presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The reviewers are concerned that the proteomic data is not clear enough to conclude that the BdpA protein is localized to or enriched in OMV/OME. Could the results be complemented with some other method to confirm BdpA localization?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that other methods to determine the localization of BdpA on the membrane of live cells would be ideal. Many attempts were made to perform immunofluorescence labeling or fluorescently tagged versions of BdpA. In the immufluorescence labeling experiments, OMEs were sheared off of cells during numerous washes necessary to mitigate backround fluorescence, even after fixation. The fragile nature of OMEs was documented in Subramanian et al., 2018. We cannot provide this data at this time, but further attempts to label BdpA will be investigated in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers are particularly concerned by the fact that a large number of proteins were identified in the OMV fraction. Could it be that some the OMV/OME fractions were contaminated?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the quantity of proteins detected in the OMVs, the review by Lee <italic>et al.</italic> (2016) detailed extensively how OMVs are frequently packed with many proteins, and the quantity detected in our preparations is within an expected range. We have added this review and added a sentence about the proteomics to line 99. And a further sentence to methods, line 459, modified to clarify: “This more inclusive purification method was chosen to prevent biasing the results in favor of vesicles of specific sizes and increase the likelihood of isolating more structures, which might be a concern with density gradient centrifugation. As a result, co-purification of extracellular DNA, flagella, and pili was expected. This protocol was adapted from Perez-Cruz et al.” Good digestion and sensitive, optimally calibrated equipment can improve detection of proteins that exist at a very low abundance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What controls were used to ensure that the purification procedure was working effectively?</p></disp-quote><p>Three biological replicates were used to help detect contaminants. The methods section on line 490 was updated to reiterate this. Similarly, neither the DLS data nor the cryoelectron tomography of the vesicle preparations show either sizes or structures consistent with whole cell contamination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the data be strengthened by some quality control analyses to determine how many of those proteins are actually predicted to localize to the outer membrane and periplasm?</p></disp-quote><p>To strengthen support that the purification procedures worked effectively, we have included the volcano plot colored based on p-sortb protein localization predictions (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Through this analysis, more cytoplasmic proteins were detected in the OM fraction than in the vesicle samples. This plot was originally not included due to the large number of proteins with no known localization and discrepancies between psortb and other sorting programs. We also updated the methods to include the online repository location of the proteomics dataset for further clarity: &quot;The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [Perez-Riverol, 2019] partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD020577&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From the methods it seems that the culture conditions used to prepare the OM versus OMV were different, is this so? If yes, why were the culture conditions different? This could affect protein expression? Please include the detailed growth conditions in the method section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified the growth conditions in the vesicle / OM preparations. The growth conditions were the same with the exception of flask size due to considerably less biomass required for the outer membrane preparation, as whole cells are considerably larger than OMVs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The conclusion that BdpA is a BAR-domain protein is largely based on homology. The supplementary information file includes homology models that show striking similarity with eukaryotic BAR proteins. However, as the authors state, BdpA barely meets the cutoff for a BAR-domain protein. The results with the phenotype of the BdpA mutant, complementations and sufficiency data provide good support to the functional role of BdpA in membrane remodelling. However, the effect of BdpA on membrane stability could be indirect or the result of binding to outer membrane features in a manner distinct from other BAR proteins. Could these results be strengthened with some biochemical corroboration of its activity on membranes or structural data to confirm its relationship to eukaryotic Bar domain proteins? Or structural data to confirm its relationship to eukaryotic BAR domain proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it would certainly solidify BdpA’s relationship to the eukaryotic BAR domain proteins. Rather than using a homology-based model as before, new, ab initio predicted structures were generated with the latest trRosetta deep learning model, and dimerization states were predicted in a similar manner by docking2. In this way, the BdpA monomers are not aligned to a eukaryotic BAR domain dimer, biasing the results based once again on homology, but are instead iteratively tested for the lowest energy state. We believe that since this ab initio model resulted in a characteristic BAR domain protein-like structure, the models strengthen support for our hypothesis. The new models were added to the main Figure 1 to better highlight this, and predicted domains were illustrated by color coordination with Figure 1d to help orient the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The reviewers propose that the paper would be strengthened with the addition of topological studies in OMVs and OMEs. The reviewers had problems in reconciling the presence of a galactose-binding domain in BdpA and LPS sugar binding. The authors hypothesize that the putative Galactose-binding domain of BdpA mediates binding to LPS. However, it is also possible that it binds to peptidoglycan components. This would suggest that the proteins interact with the periplasmic side of the outer membrane rather than coat the OMV to promote OMV formation and release (which one could assume based on the role of some eukaryotic BARs). The addition of topological studies (or some biochemical approach) could make these models less speculative strengthening the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that topological studies to determine the location of BdpA on the membrane would be ideal but were outside of the scope of this study. We’ve revised the paper to be less speculative on the topology and make no claims as of yet as to the biophysical mechanisms mediating OME/V formation. We’ve also added text on line 286 stating that “Additional biochemical and biophysical assays beyond the scope of this initial manuscript are needed to further elucidate the effect of BdpA on membrane sculpting.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Heterologous expression of BdpA in other bacteria provides important compelling arguments for its central role in producing OMEs. However, the imaging data provided do not provide the clearest evidence for induction of OMEs in M. atlanticus and E. coli. This is especially the case with the <italic>E. coli</italic> images. The extended web of staining in 4c does not resemble the tubules seen in S. oneidensis. It would be great to have some electron microscopy data and/or higher resolution fluorescence images of these bacteria as corroborating evidence. Additionally, only a few cells are shown and quantification of the proportion of cells with OMEs is needs. Thus, as already discussed in point 1, quantitative analyses could improve this important point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and performed additional experiments aimed at broader quantification of these phenotypes. We quantified the proportion of cells of each strain displaying each phenotype and added to Figure 4. We have also clarified the text and updated the methods to reflect the additional quantification.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers and the Reviewing Editor have agreed that the authors have done a very good job in replying to their previous concerns and that the changes made by the authors have increased the quality of the paper very significantly.

It is possible that BdpA could have redundant activity with FtsA, another alpha-helical protein known to stabilize FtsZ during contractile ring formation and cell division (47). Crowding of BdpA at the membrane could potentially inhibit the ability of FtsA to interact with FtsZ. Further investigation into the structure and function of BdpA is needed to determine its role in cell division. Likewise, structural and in vitro biophysical data are required before confirming that this mechanistically similar protein represents a new class of bacterial BAR domain-containing proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please revised the statistical analysis of Figure 3D.
