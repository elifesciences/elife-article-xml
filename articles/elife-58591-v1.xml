containing diverse cell types to optimize function. This interactive assembly includes mostly axon-associated Schwann cells, but also endothelial cells of supporting blood vessels, immune system-associated cells, barrier-forming cells of the perineurium surrounding and protecting nerve fascicles, and connective tissue-resident cells within the intra-fascicular endoneurium and inter-fascicular epineurium. We have established transcriptional profiles of mouse sciatic nerve-inhabitant cells to foster the fundamental understanding of peripheral nerves. To achieve this goal, we have combined bulk RNA sequencing of developing sciatic nerves up to the adult with focused bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing of Schwann cells throughout postnatal development, extended by single-cell transcriptome analysis of the full sciatic nerve both perinatally and in the adult. The results were merged in the transcriptome resource Sciatic Nerve ATlas (SNAT: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.snat.ethz.ch">https://www.snat.ethz.ch</ext-link>).

In addition, other cell types contribute crucially to ensure optimized nerve structure, function, and support.

However, our knowledge in this context is fragmentary and often limited in cellular resolution. For example, several transcriptome analyses in mice and rats have been carried out that reflect peripheral nerves as an organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Antonio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Figlia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fledrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fröb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gökbuget et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Le et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nagarajan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Patzig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Quintes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ryu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Verheijen et al., 2003</xref>), complemented by some proteomics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Patzig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Siems et al., 2020</xref>). Albeit valuable, these studies cannot distinguish between particularities of the different cell populations of the different tissues involved. They are also prone to some misinterpretations due to the limitations of bulk analysis of cellularly heterogenous organs and tissues. Nevertheless, since SCs are the most numerous cell type present in nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stierli et al., 2018</xref>), such datasets can be and have been interpreted, at first approximation, as a surrogate for the analysis of SC gene expression. Even among SCs, however, this approach cannot resolve the differences between myelinating and non-myelinating (also known as Remak) SCs, which are expected to express different subsets of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harty and Monk, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Monk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Salzer, 2015</xref>). Studies aimed at analyzing SCs more specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clements et al., 2017</xref>), and also the transcriptomes of other cell types in the nerve with single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carr et al., 2019</xref>), have been largely restricted to either early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchstaller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furlan et al., 2017</xref>) or adult stages mainly in the context of tissue regeneration after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clements et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the rather fragmentary time points employed, together with some technical constrains, limit the universal use of the currently available data in a satisfactory manner. Thus, motivated by the demands of current research on peripheral nerve biology in health and disease, together with appreciating the highly informative nature of analogous work in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marques et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marques et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), we reasoned that a focused, easily accessible, and integrated transcriptome analysis for developing peripheral nerves and their constituent cell types would be valuable. Exemplary potential benefits include: (1) Straight-forward determination of transcript expression and changes during development and in the adult nerve, in bulk and down to the cellular level; (2) Potential use of gene expression in individual cells, or in group of cells, to expand and refine the current set of available markers that can be employed to define cells with particular structures and functions in the nerve tissue under different conditions in health and disease; (3) Identification of particularly regulated genes that may provide the basis for developing improved tools for cell-type specific labeling and genetic alteration studies; and (4) Refinement of the interpretation and integration of previous research results that were obtained with lower spatial and/or temporal cellular resolution, or with different experimental emphasis.</p><p>Thus, we performed a transcriptomic evaluation of mouse peripheral nerves using a layered approach. First, we analyzed the transcriptome of mouse peripheral nerves by bulk RNA sequencing, with a particular focus on the endoneurium compartment, covering a time-line that represents successive stages of nerve development. Second, we developed a strategy that allowed the distinction of two fractions of SCs from postnatal day 5 (P5) sciatic nerves by FACS, one enriched in myelinating SCs and the another enriched in not-myelinating SCs. Both fractions were subjected to bulk RNA sequencing. Third, we carried out single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of SCs specifically, collected by FACS at various stages of postnatal differentiation, following the Smart-Seq2 protocol. This approach enabled the recapitulation of the myelinating and non-myelinating differentiation trajectories from early development to adult stages at the molecular level. Finally, we used 10x Genomics to extend the single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to the different cell types residing in sciatic nerves, both in perinatal development and in the adult. To simplify comparative analyses, interpretations, and data mining, we merged our datasets in an openly accessible web-based resource called <italic>Sciatic Nerve ATlas (SNAT)</italic> at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.snat.ethz.ch/">https://www.snat.ethz.ch/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic transcriptional changes during maturation of sciatic nerves as determined by bulk RNA sequencing</title><p>We started by resolving the transcriptomes of peripheral nerves at various time points of nerve maturation and SC differentiation using bulk RNA sequencing technology. Our analysis was largely focused on the sciatic nerve due to its wide use in studies of peripheral nerves and in SC biology in health, disease, and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beirowski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fazal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Figlia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Florio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghidinelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grove et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Novak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petersen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Quintes et al., 2016</xref>). To account for biological diversity, we extracted nerves from different animals resulting in two independent samples derived from male mice and two independent samples from female mice per each time point. The stages analyzed included (a) embryonic day (E) 13.5, when nerves are mainly populated by SC precursors; (b) E17.5, P1 and P5, when immature SCs gradually sort out individual large caliber axons from axonal bundles and transiently generate pro-myelinating SCs (i.e. 1:1 relationship of large caliber axons with SCs; not myelinating), followed by the onset of myelination; (c) P14 and P24, when radial sorting is completed and the key events ongoing relate to myelin growth and maturation of non-myelinating (Remak) SCs; and (d) P60, a young adult stage in which developmental myelination is complete, and non-myelinating SCs together with small caliber axons have formed mature Remak bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feltri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harty and Monk, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>). Note that the temporal synchronization of these morphologically recognizable characteristics during peripheral nerve development is only partial, resulting in overlapping features, particularly in early postnatal development. On a relevant technical remark, we removed mechanically the epineurium and perineurium layers as much and as careful as possible on samples from E17.5 onwards to extract RNA enriched for the endoneurium compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stierli et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bulk RNA profiling of peripheral nerves at various stages of embryonic and postnatal development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of developmental stages used for analysis with key differentiation events of the Schwann cell (SC) lineage aligned to those stages. At embryonic day (<bold>E</bold>) 13.5, SC precursors can be found in peripheral nerves. At E17.5, sciatic nerves contain immature SCs which proliferate and perform radial sorting of axons. Radial sorting continues at P1 and P5. Sorted axons are engaged in a 1:1 relation by a pro-myelinating SC. These structures are frequent in sciatic nerves at P1 and P5, and to a much lesser extent at P14. Pro-myelinating SCs undergo transcriptional changes to promote the onset of myelination, followed by radial and axial growth of the myelin sheath which keeps pace with body growth at P14 and P24. Small-caliber axons not sorted for myelination remain engaged by SCs that are undergoing maturation toward a non-myelinating SC (also known as a Remak cell) at both P14 and P24. By P60, the developmental myelination program is largely completed, and sciatic nerves are widely populated by mature myelinating SCs and by mature non-myelinating (Remak) SCs. (<bold>B, C</bold>) Four independent samples were used for bulk RNA sequencing at every time point, two derived from male and two from female mice. Each independent sample was derived from one or two mice pooled together. At E13.5, various peripheral nerves distal to the DRG were taken from each embryo, and the nerves from two separate embryos of the same sex were pooled per sample. At E17.5, sciatic nerves were pooled from two embryos of the same sex per sample. At all postnatal time points (P1, P5, P14, P24, and P60), sciatic nerves from one mouse were used for each independent sample.

The four independent samples sequenced at each time point cluster closer to each other than the samples of adjacent time points. Clustering of the samples reconstruct the correct chronology of nerve maturation and SC differentiation. The heat map color gradient also shows a high degree of consistency between the individual independent samples sequenced at each time point.

The transcripts for <italic>Ngfr</italic>, <italic>Ncam1</italic>, and <italic>L1cam</italic> are enriched in immature Schwann cells and peak at E17.5. These transcripts are also expressed by non-myelinating (Remak) cells, and are therefore also detected (albeit at lower levels) later in development. <italic>Pou3f1</italic> transcripts are enriched in pro-myelinating Schwann cells, and peak at P1 and P5. Except for E13.5, <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> shows a similar transcription abundance dynamic as <italic>Pou3f1</italic>, consistent with expression by pro-myelinating Schwann cells.

Subsequent hierarchical clustering of the samples, based on the 2000 most variable genes, revealed that the four samples per time point cluster closely together and align to recapitulate the chronological sequence of nerve differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Heat map illustrations indicated a gradual transition in the abundance of numerous mRNAs during nerve development, with high consistency between samples, also apparent in the multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). RPKM values for each gene are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Given that the majority of nerve-resident cells are SCs, we decided to test the general robustness of our data sets by comparing the obtained expression levels with exemplary known expression patterns of markers that are commonly used in SC lineage analyses, in alignment to our timeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>First, we found as expected that the proliferation markers <italic>Mki67</italic> (encoding KI-67) and <italic>Top2a</italic> (encoding DNA Topoisomerase II Alpha) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xie et al., 2018</xref>) are highly expressed from E17.5 to P5. During this time window, radial sorting of axons by SCs destined to myelinate is ongoing and SC proliferation is intense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>). As maturation of the nerves proceeds, the expression of these proliferation markers decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stierli et al., 2018</xref>). Second, we assessed the expression of markers typical of immature SCs such as <italic>Ngfr</italic> (encoding the Low-Affinity Neurotrophin Receptor P75NTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jessen et al., 1990</xref>), <italic>Ncam1</italic> (encoding the Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule 1) and <italic>L1cam</italic> (encoding the L1 Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule). Peak expression was found at E17.5, consistent with the high number of immature SCs present in developing nerves at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>). Expression decreases thereafter, but remains substantial in agreement with the known expression of these markers also by non-myelinating SCs at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faissner et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martini and Schachner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martini and Schachner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nieke and Schachner, 1985</xref>).

Of technical note, it is an advantage of this approach that the SCs, as the major cell population in the nerve, together with the other parts of the endoneurium remain in their native context until immediately before RNA extraction. This feature minimizes potentially disturbing impacts of experimental procedures and optimizes that the obtained cellular RNA-seq signatures closely track genuine in vivo transcriptomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Schwann cells isolated from sciatic nerves of P5 mice can be gated by FACS to enrich for myelinating and not-myelinating cells, allowing targeted RNA sequencing</title><p>Next, we aimed at establishing the transcriptome of developing SCs specifically, without potentially confounding contributions by other nerve-inhabiting cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carr et al., 2019</xref>). To achieve this goal, Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) was exploited to obtain purified SCs, followed by bulk RNA sequencing. In particular, we made use of transgenic mice in which SCs were labeled with the eYFP reporter protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Srinivas et al., 2001</xref>) in a P0Cre-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feltri et al., 1999</xref>). For consistency with further experiments, the mice expressed also the dsRed reporter protein under the ubiquitously active chicken beta actin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vintersten et al., 2004</xref>). Within the nerves of these animals, SCs express both dsRed and eYFP, while other nerve-resident cells express dsRed only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Debris and ruptured cells had low signal levels of eYFP and dsRed and were discarded during the FACS procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Sciatic nerves were extracted from P5 mice and a cell suspension was generated by enzymatic digestion. Analysis by FACS revealed two semi-distinct scatter clouds of eYFP-positive SCs which can be distinguished by different degrees of granularity (SSC-A) values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We hypothesized that these two populations may represent myelinating and not-myelinating SCs, speculating that the more granular population might relate to myelinating SCs in the nerve, and the less granular population might be enriched in SCs that were not-myelinating at the time of extraction. To evaluate this reasoning, we sorted the cells with a three-gate strategy. The first gate included all eYFP-positive SCs (marked allSC), while the second gate selected for assumed not-myelinating SCs (low SSC-A; marked nmSC), and the third gate selected for assumed myelinating SCs (high SSC-A; marked mSC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Once collected, RNA was purified from each of the three sets of cells and bulk RNA-seq analysis was performed using the Smart-Seq2 protocol. Reads per sample are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. The resulting RPKM values for each gene are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. To account for biological variability, we included four independent samples per gating strategy, two samples derived from female mice and two from male mice. MDS plot is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>. Heat map and hierarchical clustering analysis revealed high consistency among the differentially regulated transcripts between samples and close clustering of individual replicates within each gating strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we aligned the expression levels of the exemplary genes already employed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which represent key stages of SC progression in development. The proliferation markers <italic>Mki67</italic> and <italic>Top2a</italic> are strongly elevated in the nmSC gate cells compared to the mSC gate population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with increased abundance of proliferating immature SCs in the nmSC gate population. Expression analysis of the immature SC markers <italic>Ngfr</italic>, <italic>Ncam1</italic>, and <italic>L1cam</italic> confirms the strong enrichment of immature SCs in the nmSC gate relative to the mSC gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Since the pro-myelinating SC stage represents a transient point in the SC lineage, it is difficult to predict in which gate these cells might be enriched. In this context, we found expression of <italic>Pou3f1</italic> to be elevated in cells of the nmSC gate, but still also to be rather substantial in cells of the mSC gate. Transcripts of <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> appear quite selectively enriched in cells of the nmSC gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, plotting mRNA levels of the myelin genes <italic>Mpz</italic>, <italic>Mbp</italic>, and <italic>Ncmap</italic> revealed the expected enrichment in cells of the mSC gate compared to the nmSC gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Bulk RNA profiling of sorted Schwann cells as a whole population or selectively enriched in myelinating and not-myelinating fractions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the general experimental setup used in the study, including the animal models expressing fluorescent reporter proteins. P0Cre:ReYFP<sup>Tg</sup> (schematically represented as green) labels Schwann cells (SCs) specifically with YFP, whereas the βAct-DsRed<sup>Tg</sup> (schematically represented as red) labels all cells with dsRed. In experimental mice, SCs in sciatic nerves express both dsRed and YFP (schematically colored in yellow), whereas other nerve cells express only dsRed (schematically colored in red). Sciatic nerves were extracted at various ages, and cell suspensions were prepared through mechanical and enzymatic dissociation. This suspension was loaded into a FACS machine, which sorted SCs based on fluorescence and granularity, depending on the experiment. Debris and ruptured cells had low levels of dsRed signal, and were therefore discarded. In the schematic, not-myelinating Schwann cells are represented in yellow, whereas myelinating Schwann cells are represented in yellow with granules. Granularity differences allowed enrichment of SC populations with lower or higher SSC-A values (see panel <bold>B</bold>). The bulk RNA sequencing shown in panels (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>) used this strategy to obtain fractions enriched in myelinated (mSC) and not-myelinated (nmSC) SCs, plus a third condition of all SCs (allSC) mixed from P5 sciatic nerves. The single-cell RNA sequencing experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, with respective supplements, carried out using Smart-Seq2 or 10x Genomics, included a mixture of myelinating and not-myelinating SCs.

(<bold>B</bold>) Scatter plot from FACS experiments depicting YFP fluorescence levels in the x-axis, and side/back scatter (SSC-A) in the y-axis. SCs are located in the plot region related to higher YFP levels. In this region, SCs extracted from P5 nerves form two semi-distinct clouds of dots. A system of three gates were used to collect SCs. (1) a gate for SCs with higher SSC-A levels, enriched in myelinating SCs (mSC, color-coded in black frame), (2) a gate for SCs with the lower SSC-A levels, enriched in not-myelinating SCs (nmSC, color-coded in gray frame), and (3) a gate including both clouds (allSC, color-coded in green frame). The color-code of these gates is recapitulated in the bulk-RNA-seq schematic shown in (panel A), and in the bar graphs in (<bold>C</bold>). (<bold>C</bold>) Plotting marker transcript levels (RPKM) of genes related to proliferation and SC maturation (same markers as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) in SCs collected with each of the three gating strategies. In each gate, four independent replicate samples were collected, two from female mice and two from male mice. Each independent replicate consists of at least 10,000 SCs. Transcripts from the proliferation-related genes <italic>Mki-67</italic> and <italic>Top2a</italic> are strongly enriched in the nmSC gate compared to the mSC gate. Transcripts of <italic>Ngfr</italic>, <italic>Ncam1</italic>, and <italic>L1cam</italic>, characteristic of immature Schwann cells, are also strongly elevated within the nmSC gate relative to the mSC gate. The transcript of <italic>Pou3f1</italic>, expressed by pro-myelinating SCs, appears slightly enriched in the nmSC gate, even though the levels between the mSC and allSC populations are similar. Furthermore, the levels of <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> are also consistently higher in the nmSC compared to the mSC gate. As the pro-myelinating stage represents a transition between not-myelinating and myelinating SCs, the fine expression pattern of this gene is likely to revolve around major morphological changes in SCs, which makes it difficult to enrich for pro-myelinating SCs in this experimental setting. Transcript levels of <italic>Mpz</italic>, <italic>Mbp</italic>, and <italic>Ncmap</italic>, typical markers of myelinating SCs, are enriched in the mSC gate compared to the nmSC gate. As expected, the levels of most transcripts on the allSC gate were intermediate between the levels detected in the mSCs and the nmSCs gates.

To this end, we generated cell suspensions from mouse sciatic nerves and used the ‘allSC’ FACS gate strategy depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Single eYFP-positive SCs were sorted into 384-well plates, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing with the Smart-Seq2 protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Biological and technical variability was accounted for by preparing two plates per age. Each plate contained sorted cells derived from different animals. The single-cell RNA sequencing data were projected as tSNE plots. Analysis of color-coded individual cells per plate of origin (designated plate 1 and plate 2, per time point) indicated homogeneous distribution of cells derived from both plates at P1, P5, and P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). At P60, a shift in cell distributions according to the origin of the plate was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To obtain a more integrated perspective of transcriptomic dynamics over postnatal SC differentiation, we combined all data obtained by single-cell SC sequencing in an integrated analysis. This strategy resulted in one tSNE plot of cells from all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Mapping the cellular transcript expression of selected differentiation marker genes within the combined-data plot revealed a close association of clusters with known key stages of SC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Proliferating SCs (marked prol. SC) form a cluster marked by expression of <italic>Mki67</italic> and <italic>Top2a</italic>.

As a group, these clusters and markers describe the known differentiation and maturation path of non-myelinating (Remak) SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A second group involves also proliferating SCs and the iSC cluster (which are common to both groups), the pmSC cluster enriched in <italic>Pou3f1</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> expression, and the SC clusters with strong enrichments in transcripts of <italic>Mpz</italic>, <italic>Mbp</italic>, and <italic>Ncmap</italic> (marked mSC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these clusters and markers describe the known differentiation and maturation path of myelinating SCs. Color-coding individual cells according to the age of origin generated a chronological gradient over the tSNE plot that agrees with the pattern of overlapped marker transcripts and the two differentiation paths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (compare also to the description of individual time points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). SCs derived from nerves of younger animals correspond to earlier stages of cell differentiation than those obtained from older mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). On a discussion note, the putative non-myelinating SC maturation path includes two informatic clusters, one enriched in P14 SCs (marked tSC) and the other in P60 SCs (marked nm(R)SC). These findings may reflect temporal snapshots of the maturation fate of non-myelinating (Remak) SCs. Likewise, the informatically predicted mSC clusters are differentially enriched in mSCs of progressing mouse ages, potentially reflecting the particular requirements of early and young adult phases of the myelination program. To aid visualizing the development of transcript levels along the two SC differentiation and maturation trajectories as suggested by the combined-data tSNE plot, we applied a supervised Slingshot trajectory and pseudotime inference approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Street et al., 2018</xref>). Proliferating SCs were defined as the starting cluster, and trajectories crossed the center of each cluster. As expected, the results of this approach indicated a bifurcated projection that splits in two major branches after the iSC cluster, one leading toward the myelinating fate and the other toward non-myelinating (Remak) SC specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) (Note that the analysis was not aimed at identifying novel cell differentiation states nor trajectories, but is limited to the visualization of results obtained by a supervised bioinformatic approach in conjunction with current knowledge in the research field). The pseudotime analysis allowed the (re-)creation of a virtual timeline by associating each cell with a temporal variable along each path of the transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). For example as expected, transcripts of <italic>Ncam1</italic> get strongly reduced with differentiation on the myelinating trajectory, but remain high along the non-myelinating trajectory. The transcripts <italic>Pou3f1</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> are prominently enriched along the myelinating trajectory in a transient manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Furthermore, transcripts for <italic>Mpz</italic> are accumulated along the myelinating trajectory, albeit also detected at lower levels in all other SC clusters. In comparison, transcripts for <italic>Ncmap</italic> are more restricted to late stages of the myelinating trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition to the already presented selected markers related to specific stages of SC differentiation, further information is provided by the enriched transcripts in each cluster of the tSNE plot in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.

The dataset as such, together with the application of the analytical tools presented, provides the fundamental groundwork to allow detailed comparative mapping of the expression of genes by SCs within the myelinating and non-myelinating trajectory throughout development, a prerequisite for the functional understanding of a given gene in SC differentiation and maturation.

However, our understanding of the individual roles of these different cell types in nerve development and homeostasis are limited. Comparatively more is known about the essential roles of some of those non-neural cells in nerve regeneration. This knowledge includes a crucial interplay between macrophages, endoneurial fibroblast-like cells, and SCs in fostering axonal regeneration between proximal and distal nerve stumps after nerve transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cattin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cattin and Lloyd, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, nerve-resident <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-expressing cells (which include cells of the endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium) have been shown to serve as a cellular reservoir during regeneration after toe tip amputation of adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carr et al., 2019</xref>). The same study reported also on data obtained by single-cell RNA sequencing of nerve cells from adult injured tissue and included the analysis of <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-expressing cells of adult uninjured nerves. We reasoned that extended and easy searchable datasets describing transcriptomic dynamics in the various resident cell types of the developing and adult sciatic nerve would provide a valuable resource, in particular if put in a consistent context with our other described sets of RNA-seq data in an integrated database. Thus, we decided to expand our single-cell RNA sequencing experiments to other sciatic nerve-inhabitant cells. To this end, we generated cell suspensions from all-inclusive sciatic nerves with the same protocol that we had used to extract SCs in the single-cell sequencing approach before. The presence of dsRed allowed the use of FACS to separate viable nerve cells, which were strongly positive for this cytoplasmic reporter, from debris and ruptured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our study includes the analysis of cells at early postnatal development, extracted from mice at P1, and cells at a young adult stage, extracted from mice at P60. The additional presence of the eYFP reporter, expressed in a P0Cre-dependent manner, allowed convenient monitoring of the SC fraction during FACS sorting. Thus, we could select negatively for SCs at P1 (reducing the SC number down to ~30% of the total cells analyzed at this age) to restrict the quantitative dominance of SCs that would have potentially hindered the analysis of other cell types in sufficient numbers for informatic cluster formation. We chose to use the 10x Genomics technology rather than Smart-seq2 for this part of our study, since higher cell throughput is required to characterize adequately the heterogeneous cell types expected in the sciatic nerve. Approximately 4000 sorted nerve cells were loaded into the Chromium controller for separation of single cells into droplets during each individual run, with cDNA and libraries prepared according to 10x Genomics recommendations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To account for biological variability and to control for technical bias, we included three independent samples for each time point, processed as three independent 10x Genomics runs (designated as Run 1, 2, and 3). Each sample consisted of a nerve cell suspension extracted from male and female mice in a 1:1 ratio. Color-coding of the cells in the tSNE plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) according to different runs revealed no major bias, as cells from all three runs are contributing to the formation of each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To identify the clusters represented in the tSNE plots, we pinpointed cells expressing transcripts from genes that specifically label the various cell types expected in the nerve. Since the available literature validating these markers is mainly derived from adult animals, we prioritized the identifications of each cluster in P60 samples. Analysis of the P60 single-cell RNA-seq data revealed nine clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>RNA single-cell profiling of sciatic nerve cells handled with 10x Genomics at P60.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) tSNE plot depicting the major clusters of nerve-resident cells based on RNA sequencing of single cells extracted from sciatic nerves at P60 and handled with 10x Genomics.

Peripheral nerves contain a complex set of blood vessels, including larger vessels located mainly in the epineurium, and microvessels within the endoneurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reinhold and Rittner, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ubogu, 2020</xref>).

Since we cannot exclude this possibility at this time, we did not remove the cluster from the dataset. However, we consider it more likely that this cluster derives from ‘cell doublets’ between endothelial cells and pericytes, and thus is a technical artefact potentially fostered by the close physical interactions between pericytes and endothelial cells on vessels, a connection that may not have been broken sufficiently by our nerve dissociation procedure.</p><p>The markers discussed above and plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are a targeted selection based on previous knowledge.

SC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The expression of these proliferation markers labels also other proliferating cells in P1 nerves, which we tentatively designated as a cluster of proliferating fibroblast-like cells (marked prol. Fb) due to the expression of <italic>Pdgfra</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). To relate other clusters to the identity of the major cell types expected in the nerve, we employed the markers used at P60 before and plotted them in the tSNE plot of P1 nerves, with the limitation of assuming that the same markers are useful identifiers of the same cell type clusters analogously to P60 also at P1. As mentioned before, a cluster of proliferating fibroblasts was labeled by <italic>Pdgfra</italic> expression, as were four additional clusters in the tSNE plot also labeled by this marker. We reasoned that these clusters are likely to relate to endoneurial fibroblast-like cells (marked EnC), perineurial cells (marked PnC), epineurial cells (marked EpC), leaving one other cluster which we called tentatively fibroblast-related cells (marked FbRel*). Assignments of these clusters were done as follows: Pronounced expression of <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Col2a1</italic> identified the putative EnC cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Next, expression of <italic>Ly6c1</italic> and <italic>Pcolce2</italic> allowed the localization of the putative EpC cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Afterwards, we hypothesized that one of the remaining <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-expressing clusters should comprise perineurial cells. Thus, we assigned a putative PnC cluster based on a modest enrichment of <italic>Slc2a1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In this context, we note again that these detailed assignments have to be considered tentative at this time, since the marker genes used for the assignments at P1 are likely expressed at different levels than at P60 due to the different cell differentiation states. The fibroblast-related cluster (FbRel*) includes cells in which, besides <italic>Pdgfra</italic>, a peculiar set of transcripts are quite prominent, including some cells expressing markers more enriched in other clusters, and even some cells expressing genes typical of the SC lineage, including <italic>Mbp</italic>, <italic>Mpz</italic>, and <italic>Sox10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). Determination of the origins and validation of this cluster requires further investigations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>RNA single-cell profiling of sciatic nerve cells handled with 10x Genomics at postnatal day 1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) tSNE plot depicting the major clusters of nerve resident cells at P1 and handled with 10x Genomics.

One notable exception are epineurial adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Montani et al., 2018</xref>), which we did not detect as a separate cluster. A few cells expressing adipocyte markers, including <italic>Car3</italic> (encoding Carbonic Anhydrase 3), <italic>Cdo1</italic> (encoding Cysteine Dioxygenase Type 1), <italic>Adipoq</italic> (encoding Adiponectin), and <italic>Plin1</italic> (encoding Perilipin 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2015</xref>), can be found within the P60 epineurial cells cluster (see SNAT), but it remains unclear at this time whether they represent bona fide epineurial adipocytes. Another peculiar example are cells that line potentially lymphatic vessels. A small group of cells with expression of markers of lymphatic endothelial cells including <italic>Prox1</italic> (encoding the transcription factor Prox-1), <italic>Flt4</italic> (encoding VEGF Receptor-3), and <italic>Lyve1</italic> (encoding Lymphatic Vessel Endothelial Hyaluronan Receptor 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wigle et al., 2002</xref>) can be found within one of the P60 endothelial cell cluster (endothelial cell cluster marked EC2; see SNAT), but they have not been allocated as separate cluster potentially due to their scarcity.</p><p>We note that the approach of using dissociation of cells from nerves followed by FACS has the limitation of some potential subsampling of a subset of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In particular, SCs isolated from extensively myelinated nerves might not reveal the full diversity spectrum. The observed low relative extraction efficiency in this context may reflect different sensitivities of distinct SC populations to the experimental procedures, associated with the potential of subsampling.</p><p>On an outlook note, our data can now be used for detailed comparative mapping of expression of particular genes, at the cellular nerve level, as the fundamental basis to understand peripheral nerve biology in health and disease. As some applied examples, we recommend to search SNAT for your favorite individual gene, or gene family, or genes that encode components of the various functional structures established by the different nerve-resident cell types, or ‘orphan’ genes with incompletely understood functions.</p><p>Taken together, the validated datasets presented in this study are intended to serve as a reference point of gene expression in peripheral nerves, obtained by various complementary forms of RNA sequencing techniques. Our multilayered approach allowed both the coverage and emphasis on SCs and other major populations of resident cells in sciatic nerves, mainly focused on postnatal development. We have integrated our data in a freely accessible and searchable web interface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.snat.ethz.ch">https://www.snat.ethz.ch</ext-link>) with the intention to make a contribution to the filling of a gap in current peripheral nerve research. Using this resource as baseline, together with recently published complementary extensions mainly focusing on immune cells in peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalinski et al.,

All mice used are on the C57bl/6J background. Mice were allocated to experiments based on their age and genotype, but otherwise in a random manner. Mice were housed in a maximum of 5 animals/cage, kept in a 12 hr dark-light cycle, and provided ad libitum access to standard chow and water. No computation methods were used to estimate sample size, and these were selected according to sample sizes generally employed in the research field. Genotypes were determined by genomic PCR using the following primer sets: Cre forward 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ATCGCCAGGCGTTTTCTGAGCATAC</named-content>-3’, reverse 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCCAGATTACGTATATCCTGGCAGC</named-content>-3’; Rosa26-loxPstoploxP-YFP forward 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">AAAGTCGCTCTGAGTTGTTAT</named-content>-3’, transgenic reverse 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCGAAGAGTTTGTCCTCAACC</named-content>-3’, wildtype reverse 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGAGCGGGAGAAATGGATATG</named-content>-3’; DsRed forward 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">CCCCGTAATGCAGAAGAAGA</named-content>-3’, reverse 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGTGATGTCCAGCTTGGAGT</named-content>-3’.

The protocol to extract cells from these nerves was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrne, 2016</xref>. Nerves were transferred onto a 6 cm cell-culture dish and minced using a scalpel. Minced nerves were transferred to a 15 ml centrifugation tube and were enzymatically dissociated on a thermoshaker (Eppendorf ThermoMixer C) at 37°C for 20 min with a solution containing 0.15% Trypsin (Sigma, #T9201), 0.3% collagenase Type 2 (Bioconcept, #LS004174), 0.04% hyaluronidase (Bioconcept, #LS005474) in HBSS. Ten minutes after the start of enzymatic digestion, the tissue was mechanically dissociated by pipetting using a 1 ml precision pipette. At the end of the 20 min digestion, the tissue was completely mechanically dissociated by pipetting 20 times with a 200 μl precision pipette, and the enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 10% FCS in PBS. The cell suspension was centrifuged (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810 R) at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in FACS buffer (0.5% BSA, 5 mM EGTA, in PBS). Before cell sorting, the mix was filtered through a 50 μm filter.</p><p>Cells were sorted using a SH800S Sony cell sorter. For P5 bulk RNA sequencing, SCs were sorted using eYFP intensity and SSC-A into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For single-cell sequencing of Schwann cells, eYFP-positive cells were sorted onto 384-well plates followed by the Smart-seq2 protocol. For single-cell sequencing of whole sciatic nerve lysates, DsRed-positive cells were sorted into 1.5 ml Eppendorf followed by the 10x genomics protocol. At P1, a negative selection of DsRed-eYFP-double-positive cells additionally was applied to restrict the SC abundance to approximately 30% of the sorted cells processed with the 10x genomics protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Bulk RNA sequencing of sciatic nerve lysates</title><p>Immediately after dissection, sciatic nerves were placed in ice-cold PBS, stripped from epineurium and perineurium, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.

Using RNA extracted from peripheral nerves, the libraries were prepared following the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA protocol. The quality of the RNA and final libraries was determined using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation System.

The downstream analysis was performed with R package Seurat (v2.3.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Satija et al., 2015</xref>) for each dataset in different parameters. Cells with fewer than 1500 detected genes were discarded. Library-size normalization was done for each cell by scaling by the total number of transcripts and multiplying by 100,000. The data was then natural-log transformed for all downstream analyses. The detection of highly variable genes was based on the average expression and dispersion for each gene using the default parameters (x.low.cutoff = 0.1, x.high.cutoff = 8, y.cutoff = 1) of the function FindVariableGenes() in Seurat. The dimensionality of the data set was reduced using principal component analysis (PCA), with 7 and 20 principal components selected for each time point and integrated dataset, respectively. Unsupervised clustering of the cells was performed with the shared nearest neighbor (SNN) clustering algorithm implemented in the FindClusters() function in Seurat with a resolution of 0.4 for P1 and P5, 0.3 for P14 and P60, 0.6 for the integrated dataset. tSNE plots were generated using the same PCs that were input to the clustering analysis and setting the perplexity parameter to 30. The two plates from P60 were batch corrected and integrated by Seurat’s Canonical Correlation Analysis implementation with 12 canonical vectors. A resolution of 0.5 was used in the clustering step. Differentially expressed genes (cluster markers) for each of the cell populations were determined using Wilcoxon rank sum test. We used the program Slingshot (v1.0.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Street et al., 2018</xref>) to infer cell lineages. As an input to Slingshot, we used a matrix representing the cells in a reduced-dimensional space and a vector of cluster labels, as inferred by the above analyses with Seurat. The starting cluster was set to ‘proliferating Schwann cells’. Slingshot identified two branching trajectories, one corresponding to myelinating Schwann cells, another corresponding to non-myelinating (Remak) Schwann cells. Then, pseudotimes on each lineage were estimated with the implementation of fastICA() in package fastICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hyvärinen and Oja, 2000</xref>) from single-cell gene expression data. To visualize the gene expression change over pseudotime, we fitted a generalized additive model (GAM) on the pseudotime with smoothing spline.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis of nerve cells handled with 10x Genomics</title><p>CellRanger (v2.0.2) from 10x Genomics was used to demultiplex, align the reads to Ensembl reference build GRCh38.p10 and collapse UMIs. Starting from the filtered gene-cell count matrix by CellRanger’s default cell calling algorithm, we applied the Seurat workflow, as described in Smart-Seq2 data analysis section. Cells from the three independent runs were pooled together. To exclude low-quality cells or possible doublets, we filtered out cells for which fewer than 500 genes or more than 5000 genes were detected, leaving 11339 cells at P1 and 12428 cells at P60 for further analyses. FindVariableGenes() function from Seurat identifies 2145 and 2240 highly variable genes at P1 and P60 respectively, with parameters (x.low.cutoff = 0.0125, x.high.cutoff = 3, y.cutoff = 0.5, dispersion.function = LogVMR). In the dimensionality reduction step, 10 principal components were selected. A resolution of 0.5 was chosen in the unsupervised clustering algorithm at P1, while 0.4 was used at P60.</p><p>The clusters identified with 10x Genomics at both P1 and P60 were refined by merge and division of some adjacent clusters, based on the overarching cell type they represent. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> we included the tSNE plots overlaid with the default clusters derived from the clustering analysis at both time points. At P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), clusters 4 and 10 were merged in a single cluster labeled (IC) because both clusters represent typical markers of immune cells. Furthermore, we merged clusters 2 and 9, since both represent markers typical of perineurial cells (PnC). Clusters 1, 0, and 12 were also merged, since these cells are enriched in markers characteristic of epineurial cells (EpC). Cluster 7 was originally composed of two islands which were separated. The reasoning is explained in the <italic>results and discussion</italic> section. Since the lower island of cluster seven expresses both <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> and <italic>Pecam1</italic>, we cannot confidently state these are bona fide pericytes. This island was therefore re-labeled as cluster (Per/EC*). The remaining island in cluster 7 is more enriched in <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> and likely represents pericytes, and cluster 8 is enriched in <italic>Acta2</italic> and likely represents vascular smooth muscle cells. The merged cluster adopts the name of both cell types, as pericyte and vascular smooth muscle cell cluster (Per/VSMC). At P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), we merged the cluster 5 and 11 into one cluster labeled (IC), since both original clusters represent typical markers of immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Preparation of figure panels</title><p>Figure panels were assembled with Adobe Illustrator (version CC).</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>RNA-sequencing data have been deposited in the GEO database under accession number GSE137870.

The authors begin with a well-designed bulk RNA-Seq study of the dissected mouse sciatic nerve across developmental and postnatal time points. This is followed by a bulk RNA-Seq study of sorted schwann cells (SC) in a select subset of time points to identify the transcriptional signatures of the enriched SC component(s) of the sciatic nerve, isolating both myelinating and unmyelinating subtypes. In total, this effort provides a more focused transcriptional survey of SC cell subtypes/states. Further analysis is done on the FACS sorted SC cells at single cell resolution and finally, the authors perform a comprehensive single cell analysis of the entire sciatic nerve, including non-SC cells. The authors do a commendable job at presenting the raw data and describing the specific quality controls required to assure the quality of the resource. However, there are a few analysis choices and mis-interpretations of differential gene expression that raise significant concern for acceptance of the paper in its current form. There is little to no novel biology uncovered or described in this resource paper, albeit that the intent behind this manuscript is to present the data, not necessarily 'discover' anything from it. Where the authors do attempt to describe potentially novel findings, these are not directly supported by the data alone and it should be noted that these conclusions are speculative requiring validation. Furthermore, while the comprehensiveness of this manuscript in terms of the data generated is impressive, the lack of integrative analysis across datasets, and the relative 'light-touch' analysis for each component of this dataset, is a significant shortfall, particularly as several similar datasets have recently been published.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors describe a publicly available searchable web interface (www.snat.ethz.ch). However, access to this resource is currently password-protected. This website needs to be made available to the reviewers in order to evaluate the utility and stability of this public resource.</p><p>2. Many of the axes are unlabeled (e.g. Figures 3 -6…). Please add labels to the figures directly.</p><p>3. The clusters presented in Figure 3 Panel G (P60) are learned on a reduced dimensional embedding that the authors understand to be biased with respect to batch. Indeed, this is a particular focus of Figure 3—figure supplement 1 panel D. It is commendable that the authors note this and correct with batch correction in the supplement, however the clusters used to annotate mSC2 and mSC3 are derived from the original, biased embedding. These clusters disproportionately contain cells from each batch and therefore the differential genes between mSC2 and mSC3 in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 panel A (P60) primarily represent genes that differ between batches. This should be addressed prior to acceptance.</p><p>Given the concerns about batch:cluster confounding above, the designation of mSC2 and mSC3 in the joint embedding remains concerning as well. Potentially confounding the interpretation of pseudotime in Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Many of the genes identified along pseudotime for mSC3 overlap with the mSC3-specific genes from Figure 3—figure supplement 1 panel A (P60).</p><p>4. Figure 4: All axes are unlabelled, including the 'pseudotime values' along X and the gene expression levels along Y for Panel D. It is unclear that the slingshot pseudotime trajectories are resolving the best-fit paths through the data instead of potentially being biased by arbitrary cluster assignments. For example, the designation of the tSC cluster as a discrete and/or transient state is not clear from the embedding. However, the designation of this as a cluster will force slingshot to produce a trajectory through the tSC cluster when this may not be borne out directly from the data. If the authors wish to support these trajectories as appropriate paths towards specification, it is highly recommended that they further perform an RNAVelocity analysis on the joint, embedded single cell analysis in Figure 4. This will provide an 'annotation-agnostic' representation of the change in predicted state over the chosen embedding. The hope is that the velocity field mirrors the paths identified by slingshot. This will provide compelling evidence that the trajectories presented are correct and not 'winding' unnecessarily.</p><p>There are some important details missing from the slingshot methods and analysis. The authors use a GAM model to identify genes with significant differential expression WRT pseudotime, but the details of the model are not presented, and the choice of significance thresholds is not described. Further, the authors do not present a list of genes identified by the GAM model, instead relying on Z-scores for previous cluster assignment specificity, (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 panel B) instead of the significance values from the pseudotime fitting. This does not use the pseudotime analysis appropriately but rather still relies on the 'aggregate' expression of genes across clusters.</p><p>In general, the application of pseudotime is not complete, and the authors do not use this analysis approach to appropriately resolve trajectories and gene expression differences along these trajectories. The analysis presented is still restricted to 'cluster-level' aggregate differences.</p><p>The authors interpret the &quot;appearance of multiple mSC clusters as a peculiar feature in the tSNE plots&quot;. This is true and due, in part, to both the nature of tSNE (which does not by default preserve global structure in embeddings) and the previously noted concerns about batch (in P60) that are not addressed in the joint embedding. The authors however, choose to interpret the different mSC clusters as biologically motivated. (lines 361-368). This statement should be re-evaluated and our couched.</p><p>A semantic point, the authors claim three 'biological' replicates for the 10x phase of their study per time point. Since each replicate consists of two nerves (one from male and one from female) these are not technically biological replicates but rather technical replicates.</p><p>5. Figure 5: It is concerning that for the 10x study, SCs account for only 3.3% of the identified cell types, and yet in the bulk analysis presented in the beginning, only the SC marker genes and how they change across time points are presented. Are the SC gene signatures truly dominating in the bulk samples presented, and as suggested by the authors for the motivation for this study? This is further evidenced by the diagram provided in Figure 5—figure supplement which suggests that the vast majority of cells in this dataset should be Schwann cells. It would be very useful to know, or at least retrospectively estimate, what proportion of the gene expression signatures in the bulk study is derived from SC cells or cells of other cell types. Learning this information from the single cell data and applying this type of analysis to their bulk data would further strengthen the application and utility of this resource and demonstrate a clear need to re-evaluate the use of bulk studies in the PNS.</p><p>6. Figure 6: The authors 'identify clusters of proliferating fibroblasts labelled by Pdgfra expression' and reason that these clusters represent biologically interesting/unique clusters of endoneurial fibroblast-lik cells, perineuial cells, or epineurial cells, and represent a 'mysterious cluster' It is highly probable that the expression of Pdgfra in these clusters is not biological, but rather a consequence of either A) incomplete dissociation from true Pdgfra-expressing cells, or B) background signal detected in otherwise low-quality cells, (both appropriately indicated by the authors). The former is supported by the higher-than average number of genes detected in these populations (consistent with potential doublets), despite the authors use of a 'doublet detection' algorithm. The latter is supported by the higher mitochondrial read ratios observed for these clusters as well. Without supporting in situ hybridizations to support the identification and co-expression of Pdgfra in these populations, this finding should be removed or addressed in significantly greater detail. The authors claim(s) that &quot;we cannot exclude that some cells in this cluster might also be in a hypothetical transitory stage of neural crest-derived cells, potentially expressing markers of multiple lineages on their route to differentiation&quot; is a purely artificial explanation that is not supported by the evidence provided. Suggestion of this as an alternative explanation does not satisfy an Occom's razor explanation and must be substantiated with further experimentation.</p><p>The authors state that &quot; Clusters representing the different cell types were overall in much closer proximity to each other on the tSNE plots at P1 and P60&quot; and use this to suggest that this may represent &quot;potential cell lineage transitions or cell plasticity at early stages…&quot;. This is not an appropriate or valid conclusion to be drawn from tSNE plots. The meaningful proximity of clusters in a tSNE embedding cannot be directly inferred and is a common mis-interpretation of the method used. Please see discussion here for cautions and guidelines for interpretation of tSNE embeddings (https://mlexplained.com/2018/09/14/paper-dissected-visualizing-data-using-t-sne-explained).</p><p>7. Given the potential utility of this dataset as a resource for the PNS community, it is strongly recommended that the authors make their analysis (scripts/code/etc) publicly available for review.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transcriptional Profiling of Mouse Peripheral Nerves to the Single-Cell Level to Build a Sciatic Nerve ATlas (SNAT)&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The manuscript is certainly improved and many of the incorrect or misleading statements have been addressed as requested. The figures, labels, and legends are significantly improved in clarity.</p><p>* The requested RNA Velocity analysis is not included in the revision. The authors claim to have performed it but it did not match expectations (ie &quot;The resulting projections do not generate evident trajectories along the dataset&quot;). This reviewer would have preferred to examine how RNA Velocity field estimates match the existing slingshot trajectories or at least compare the presented trajectories to those created from another tool to provide confirmatory support. The expectation that the RNAVelocity findings might disagree with the presented trajectories was the motivation behind requesting this analysis. It's lack of inclusion in the final manuscript somewhat reinforces my concern regarding the accuracy/validity of the original pseudotime trajectories.</p><p>* The authors have indeed couched their statements regarding the Pdgfra-expressing fibroblast cells relative to their original statements. I am aware that their arguments are in a 'Results and Discussion' section, however, I am still less than comfortable with their speculation w/o any validation of the Pdgfra+ fibroblast population. The details of why the doublet detection algorithm (and their source of confidence in these results) is less than compelling, and the suggestion that 'damaged and/or dying cells is a contributing factor to the formation of this cluster' is supported only by circumstantial evidence of 'low quality' cells (mito read ratio and total count can by proxies for low quality cell capture, but are not generally considered proxies for cell death), not necessarily 'dying' cells. I feel that this speculation is not warranted in a Resource paper and should either be experimentally validated or removed. The manuscript would remain just as strong by merely pointing out the existence of this cluster and suggesting that it's origins require follow up analyses. But the speculation is simply not warranted w/o further supporting validation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Gerber and colleagues conduct bulk and single cell RNA-Seq of mouse sciatic nerves and sorted Schwann cells to generate a developmental transcriptomic profile of Schwann cells. Overall, it is a very nicely done study and will likely serve as a good resource for the scientific community. Strengths of their approach include i) detailed developmental time course and use of 4 biological replicates for each time point, ii) combination approach of bulk sequencing from intact sciatic nerves and comparison to FAC sorted Schwann cells and addition of sc-RNA-Seq of sorted Schwann cells through the postnatal time points. The only weakness is related to the technical difficulty of obtaining higher number of Schwann cells for the scRNA-Seq component. In an intact nerve, Schwann cells account for over 70% all cells, but in the single cell sorted RNA-Seq, only 3.3% of cells were Schwann cells. This low number likely biased the results of gene expression and interpretation of the results because a &quot;hardy&quot; sub-population may survive the cell isolation process and not be a true representative of the whole Schwann cell population.</p><p>Authors have addressed all of my concerns.

Our manuscript includes a common section for Results and Discussion. In this context, some of the discussion remarks were perceived by the reviewers rather as conclusions during the consideration of our manuscript (this notion relates similarly to point 6, see answers below). To avoid such interpretations, we have made suitable ameliorations to exert caution, also regarding informatic clusters representing myelinating Schwann cells. We now refer to these clusters commonly as myelinating Schwann cells (mSC). Accordingly, we have adjusted the cluster labels shown on tSNE projections of Figure 4, and we have included new figures that depict the original output of the clustering analysis (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1) to complete the information. In this revised setting, potential batch influences on the delineation of mSC1, mSC2 or mSC3 are no longer relevant (and these designations have been removed from the manuscript), since all these cluster are considered as mSC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

They have been added as requested. We have also performed RNA velocity analysis as requested. The resulting projections do not generate evident trajectories along the dataset. One potential explanation for these findings is that RNA velocity predicts the future state of cells on a timescale of hours to days, based on the dynamics of mRNAs, and the time points in the dataset in Figure 4 might be too long apart to allow a robust analysis with this bioinformatic tool. In any case, our understanding of the tSC cluster was steered by previous knowledge of Schwann cell differentiation (Figure 1A). Chronologically, iSC progressively sort large-caliber axons from bundles and become pmSC. The ensuing activation of the myelination program leads to the formation of mSC along the myelinating Schwann cell fate. Small caliber axons do not become myelinated. Instead, they are engaged by Schwann cells of the non-myelinating lineage. Using morphological knowledge as a reference, non-myelinating Schwann cells at P60 (designated nm(R)SC in the revised version of this manuscript) encircle each small caliber axon within a Remak bundle with cytoplasm. At P14, this process is ongoing but not yet complete. Based on this knowledge, we tentatively labelled the non-myelinating Schwann cells at P14 as tSC. Considering the expression patterns of established marker genes of the nm(R)SC lineage (<italic>Ncam1</italic>, <italic>N1cam</italic> and <italic>Ngfr)</italic>, we interpret the tSC to be cells along the non-myelinating fate at P14, which temporally precede the cells of the same fate at P60 (see also revised Figure 4C). We do not intend to state that this cluster represents a novel cell type, but it may rather represent a temporal snapshot along the non-myelinating differentiation trajectory. Therefore, the pseudotime plot depicts the clusters enriched based on prior knowledge. We have ameliorated the manuscript to reflect these issues better. The text changes include also adjustments to acknowledge the remark by the reviewers that our application of pseudotime is not exhaustive. The intention with a supervised application of pseudotime was not to resolve potentially novel trajectories. We use it to help readers visualizing the transcript abundance dynamics along the expected myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cell lineages, crossing the center of each cluster (which show a progressive enrichment in cells of increasing mouse ages) along each respective trajectory.</p><p>The statements regarding mSC clusters have been couched as requested by the reviewers (see also answer to point 3).</p><p>We have removed the terminology of biological or technical replicates.

The low percentage of Schwann cells in the 10x study at P60 is likely mainly due to a low extraction efficiency of viable single Schwann cells from the enzymatic and mechanic dissociation of sciatic nerves and cannot be compared to their abundance in intact sciatic nerves (this notion is now included in the revised manuscript). In bulk sequencing of sciatic nerves, however, we mechanically removed the epineurium and perineurium layers (from E17.5 onwards) and sequenced the enriched endoneurium. In this experimental setting, RNA was extracted from the tissue directly and thus, the dominant cell type that contributed to the sequenced RNA are Schwann cells. Nonetheless, other cell types in the endoneurium also contribute to the RNA levels detected in the tissue, and on its own, this experimental set cannot resolve which cell types express a given gene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 6: The authors 'identify clusters of proliferating fibroblasts labelled by Pdgfra expression' and reason that these clusters represent biologically interesting/unique clusters of endoneurial fibroblast-lik cells, perineuial cells, or epineurial cells, and represent a 'mysterious cluster' It is highly probable that the expression of Pdgfra in these clusters is not biological, but rather a consequence of either A) incomplete dissociation from true Pdgfra-expressing cells, or B) background signal detected in otherwise low-quality cells, (both appropriately indicated by the authors). The former is supported by the higher-than average number of genes detected in these populations (consistent with potential doublets), despite the authors use of a 'doublet detection' algorithm. The latter is supported by the higher mitochondrial read ratios observed for these clusters as well. Without supporting in situ hybridizations to support the identification and co-expression of Pdgfra in these populations, this finding should be removed or addressed in significantly greater detail. The authors claim(s) that &quot;we cannot exclude that some cells in this cluster might also be in a hypothetical transitory stage of neural crest-derived cells, potentially expressing markers of multiple lineages on their route to differentiation&quot; is a purely artificial explanation that is not supported by the evidence provided. Suggestion of this as an alternative explanation does not satisfy an Occom's razor explanation and must be substantiated with further experimentation.</p><p>The authors state that &quot; Clusters representing the different cell types were overall in much closer proximity to each other on the tSNE plots at P1 and P60&quot; and use this to suggest that this may represent &quot;potential cell lineage transitions or cell plasticity at early stages…&quot;. This is not an appropriate or valid conclusion to be drawn from tSNE plots. The meaningful proximity of clusters in a tSNE embedding cannot be directly inferred and is a common mis-interpretation of the method used. Please see discussion here for cautions and guidelines for interpretation of tSNE embeddings (https://mlexplained.com/2018/09/14/paper-dissected-visualizing-data-using-t-sne-explained).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have ameliorated the text about Pdgfra-expressing cell clusters and have removed speculative discussion statements about the biology.</p><p>We agree that our original statement of “Clusters representing the different cell types were overall in much closer proximity to each other on the tSNE plots at P1 than at P60” could be interpreted as that we were inferring that the proximity between isolated clusters in tSNE projections has a meaning (which we were aware of that it does not; we were referring to clusters containing cells in direct contact with neighboring clusters). Since our statement could be misconceived, however, we have removed it from the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

In particular, SCs isolated from extensively myelinated nerves might not reveal the full diversity spectrum. The observed low relative extraction efficiency in this context may reflect different sensitivities of distinct SC populations to the experimental procedures, associated with the potential of subsampling”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The manuscript is certainly improved and many of the incorrect or misleading statements have been addressed as requested.

The authors claim to have performed it but it did not match expectations (ie &quot;The resulting projections do not generate evident trajectories along the dataset&quot;). This reviewer would have preferred to examine how RNA Velocity field estimates match the existing slingshot trajectories or at least compare the presented trajectories to those created from another tool to provide confirmatory support. The expectation that the RNAVelocity findings might disagree with the presented trajectories was the motivation behind requesting this analysis. It's lack of inclusion in the final manuscript somewhat reinforces my concern regarding the accuracy/validity of the original pseudotime trajectories.</p></disp-quote><p>We had uploaded the code for the RNA velocity analysis on which our statement was based on <italic>Github</italic> and we have now complemented this information further, including output data.

I am aware that their arguments are in a 'Results and Discussion' section, however, I am still less than comfortable with their speculation w/o any validation of the Pdgfra+ fibroblast population. The details of why the doublet detection algorithm (and their source of confidence in these results) is less than compelling, and the suggestion that 'damaged and/or dying cells is a contributing factor to the formation of this cluster' is supported only by circumstantial evidence of 'low quality' cells (mito read ratio and total count can by proxies for low quality cell capture, but are not generally considered proxies for cell death), not necessarily 'dying' cells. I feel that this speculation is not warranted in a Resource paper and should either be experimentally validated or removed. The manuscript would remain just as strong by merely pointing out the existence of this cluster and suggesting that it's origins require follow up analyses. But the speculation is simply not warranted w/o further supporting validation.</p></disp-quote><p>See point 3 of Essential revisions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
