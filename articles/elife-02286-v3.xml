One by-product of photosynthesis is a highly toxic molecule called singlet oxygen. Typically, organisms deal with stressful events such as the presence of toxic molecules by producing new proteins. However, protein production is generally initiated in the nucleus of the cell, and photosynthesis is carried out in structures called chloroplasts. Cells must therefore be able to alert the nucleus to the presence of toxic levels of singlet oxygen in the chloroplasts.</p><p>Like some plants that can withstand a gradual decrease in temperature, but not a sudden cold snap, the alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is capable of resisting high doses of singlet oxygen if it has previously been exposed to low doses of the molecule. Wakao et al. exploited this ability to hunt for algae that are unable to acclimate to singlet oxygen, and found that these cells are unable to produce a protein called SAK1.</p><p>Wakao et al. reveal that many factors involved in the algae's cellular response to singlet oxygen depend on the presence of SAK1. In addition, the response of the algae cells to singlet oxygen differs to the one seen in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, suggesting that the two organisms have found different ways to deal with the same problem.</p><p>The location of a protein in a cell can give clues to its function. SAK1 is present in the fluid surrounding cellular compartments—the cytosol—which is consistent with it acting as a signaling molecule between the chloroplast and the nucleus. Wakao et al. present further evidence for this hypothesis by demonstrating that the number of phosphate groups attached on SAK1 changes when exposed to singlet oxygen—a feature often seen in signaling proteins. In addition, part of SAK1 resembles proteins that can bind to DNA, which indicates that SAK1 may be directly involved in initiating protein production.</p><p>The discovery of SAK1 represents a starting point for understanding how the site of photosynthesis, the chloroplast, communicates with the nucleus. It also has implications for developing plants and algae that have a higher tolerance to environmental stress conditions for agriculture and biofuel production.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02286.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02286.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chlamydomonas</kwd><kwd>singlet oxygen</kwd><kwd>retrograde signaling</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>photo-oxidative stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niyogi</surname><given-names>Krishna K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF3070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niyogi</surname><given-names>Krishna K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24 GM092473</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pellegrini</surname><given-names>Matteo</given-names></name><name><surname>Merchant</surname><given-names>Sabeeha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM071908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niyogi</surname><given-names>Krishna K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SAK1, a novel cytoplasmic phosphoprotein, is a key intermediate component of the retrograde signaling pathway controlling nuclear gene expression during acclimation of Chlamydomonas cells to singlet oxygen stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Growth of photosynthetic organisms depends on light energy, which in turn can cause oxidative damage to the cell if not managed properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Light intensity is highly dynamic in terrestrial and aquatic environments, and the cell must constantly control the dissipation of light energy to avoid photo-oxidative stress while maximizing productivity. In addition to being the site of photosynthesis, the chloroplast houses many essential biochemical reactions such as fatty acid and amino acid biosynthesis, but most of its proteins are encoded in the nucleus and must be imported after translation. Therefore the nucleus must monitor the status of the chloroplast and coordinate gene expression and synthesis of proteins to maintain healthy chloroplast functions.</p><p>It is known that signals originating from a stressed or dysfunctional chloroplast modulate nuclear gene expression, a process that is called retrograde signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> the <italic>gun</italic> mutants have helped to define the field of chloroplast retrograde signaling, leading to the identification of GUN1, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein that is a regulator of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koussevitzky et al., 2007</xref>), and pointing to the involvement of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vinti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mochizuki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larkin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Woodson and Chory, 2008</xref>). A role for heme in retrograde signaling has been shown in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">von Gromoff et al., 2008</xref>). Many of the <italic>gun</italic> studies were conducted in context of a dysfunctional chloroplast treated with norflurazon, an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis. More recently a number of exciting advances have shed light on small molecules playing roles in retrograde stress signaling, including methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate, an intermediate of isoprenoid biosynthesis in the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>), 3-phosphoadenosine 5-phosphate (PAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Estavillo et al., 2011</xref>), as well as a chloroplast envelope transcription factor PTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Plastid gene expression involving sigma factors has been implicated in affecting nuclear gene expression, although the mechanism is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coll et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Woodson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Activation of gene expression by reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apel and Hirt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mittler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gadjev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Thus ROS have been proposed as a means for chloroplasts to signal stress to the nucleus and many examples of global gene expression changes in response to ROS have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desikan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vandenabeele et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vanderauwera et al., 2005</xref>). Singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) is a highly toxic form of ROS that can be formed in all aerobic organisms through photosensitization reactions in which excitation energy is transferred from a pigment molecule to O<sub>2</sub>. For example, porphyria in humans is caused by defects in tetrapyrrole metabolism that can lead to accumulation of photosensitizing intermediates, which generate <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in the light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Straka et al., 1990</xref>). In oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is mainly generated at the reaction center of photosystem II, when triplet excited chlorophyll transfers energy to O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krieger-Liszkay, 2005</xref>). <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is the predominant cause of lipid oxidation during photo-oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Triantaphylidès et al., 2008</xref>) and is associated with damage to the reaction center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trebst et al., 2002</xref>). Because of the abundance and proximity of the two elements of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation, the photosensitizer chlorophyll and O<sub>2</sub>, it was hypothesized that oxygenic photosynthetic organisms must have evolved robust means to cope with this ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knox and Dodge, 1985</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the EX1 and EX2 proteins in the chloroplast are required for the execution of a <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent response: growth arrest in plants and programmed cell death in seedlings, that is distinct from cell damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">op den Camp et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). Different players in <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> signaling have emerged recently, such as β-cyclocitral, an oxidation product of β-carotene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramel et al., 2012</xref>), a bZIP transcription factor (SOR1) responding to reactive electrophiles generated by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischer et al., 2012</xref>), and a cytosolic zinc finger protein conserved in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonas,</italic> MBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shao et al., 2013</xref>). In the anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterium <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>, a σ<sup>E</sup> factor is responsible for the elicitation of the gene expression response to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthony et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The unicellular green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is an excellent model organism for investigation of retrograde <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> signaling. <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> exhibits an acclimation response to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, in which exposure to a sublethal dose of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> leads to changes in nuclear gene expression that enable cells to resist a subsequent challenge with higher levels of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ledford et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesized that acclimation mutants should include regulatory mutants that are defective in sensing and responding to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Here we describe the isolation of such a mutant and identification of a cytosolic phosphoprotein SAK1 that is critical for the acclimation and transcriptome response to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation of a singlet oxygen-sensitive mutant that is defective in acclimation</title><p><italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> acclimates to singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) generated by the exogenous photosensitizing dye rose bengal (RB) in the light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ledford et al., 2007</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, wild-type (WT) cells that were pretreated with RB in the light were able to survive a challenge treatment with much higher concentrations of RB, unlike cells pretreated with RB in the dark. By screening an insertional mutant population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dent et al., 2005</xref>) for strains that were sensitive to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, we isolated a mutant called <italic><underline>s</underline>inglet oxygen <underline>a</underline>cclimation <underline>k</underline>nocked-out1</italic> (<italic>sak1</italic>) that is defective in acclimation to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We have previously shown that <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> WT cells can also acclimate to RB following pretreatment with high light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ledford et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that high light and RB induce overlapping responses to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. When subjected to the same conditions (high light pretreatment followed by challenge with RB), <italic>sak1</italic> demonstrated less robust cross-acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also tested conversely whether pretreatment with RB can acclimate the cells to growth in high light or in the presence of norflurazon. No increase in resistance to high light or norflurazon was induced by pretreatment with RB in either WT or <italic>sak1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The viability phenotypes after RB treatment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> were paralleled by changes in F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> values, a chlorophyll fluorescence parameter representing photosystem II efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In both WT and <italic>sak1,</italic> pretreatment did not cause an inhibition of photosystem II, as demonstrated by unchanged F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> values after 30 min. However, pretreatment increased resistance of photosystem II to the RB challenge only in WT and not in <italic>sak1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The pretreatment protected the cells only transiently, as by 90 min of challenge treatment both genotypes appeared to have experienced similar inhibition of photosystem II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>sak1</italic> is disrupted in early sensing and/or initiation of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> response rather than its direct detoxification.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02286.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The <italic>sak1</italic> mutant is defective in singlet oxygen acclimation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Acclimation phenotype of WT and <italic>sak1</italic>.

Basal expression of some of the genes was elevated in <italic>sak1</italic> compared to WT (Cre16.g683400 and <italic>GST1,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Comparisons of the fold change (FC) values obtained by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR for the genes tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The FC values are comparable between the two methods, although genes with FC greater than 20 (detected by RNA-seq) showed FC values (estimated by qRT-PCR) that were two to three times higher (Cre06.g281250.t1.1, Cre13.g566850.t1.1, Cre06.g263550.t1.1, Cre14.g623650.t1.2). Some of the genes were also induced by a transition from low light to high light, although not as strongly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> response elicited by addition of RB partly overlaps with that caused by increased light intensity. To examine whether the transcriptome changes were specific to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, we examined the expression of several previously identified H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Urzica et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Two of the seven genes, <italic>VTC2</italic> (3.4-fold) and <italic>DHAR1</italic> (twofold) were induced during <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> acclimation, whereas the other five genes were not differentially expressed (induced more than twofold) in our data. For these two genes, their magnitude of induction by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> was smaller than that of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells (both genes were ∼ninefold induced by 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment for 60 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Urzica et al., 2012</xref>). These differences suggest that our treatment with <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> did not lead to a large-scale induction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-responsive genes, and it is likely that the two above-mentioned genes involved in ascorbate metabolism respond to both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02286.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>qRT-PCR analysis of genes identified to be <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-responsive by RNA-seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The error bars indicate standard deviation of biological triplicates.

than 1% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, C1), and 33% of these could be categorized into functional classes based on MapMan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thimm et al., 2004</xref>) using the Algal Functional Annotation Tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lopez et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The enriched classes are marked with asterisks, and the genes within those classes are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. Genes involved in sterol/squalene/brassinosteroid metabolism (in the hormone and lipid metabolism functional classes) were notably enriched (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). A sterol methyltransferase was also detected to display differential expression in our previous microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ledford et al., 2007</xref>). Brassinosteroids are not known to exist in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, and in plants increasing evidence indicates sterols have a signaling role independent of brassinosteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39a">Lindsey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boutté and Grebe, 2009</xref>). Two cyclopropane fatty acid synthases (CFAs) were among the up-regulated lipid metabolism genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). Another function that was notable among up-regulated genes, although they were not grouped to a common functional class by MapMan, were two genes coding for SOUL heme-binding domain proteins that were <italic>SAK1</italic>-dependent (SOUL2 and Cre06.g299700.t1.1, formerly annotated as SOUL1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Genes annotated as involved in transport comprised one of the most enriched classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These included a number of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and pleiotropic drug-resistant (PDR) type transporters as well as other various transporters for ions, peptides, and lipids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The former types of transporters may reflect the cells' response to pump RB out. When the responses to the chemical RB and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> were uncoupled by comparing gene expression in cultures kept in the dark with and without RB, all of the tested <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-induced genes and ABC transporters identified from our RNA-seq remained unchanged by RB in the dark in both WT and <italic>sak1</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). This result indicates that the up-regulation of these genes when RB was added in the light was a response to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> rather than to RB itself. Up-regulation of stress genes included those coding for chaperones and some receptor-like proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that the cells do mount a stress response during acclimation though not visible by gross growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or decrease in F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A smaller number of 219 genes was down-regulated during acclimation in WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, C1), only 21% of which had functional annotation. The most enriched classes of down-regulated genes were nucleotide metabolism and transport, the latter including a distinct type of transporter for small metabolites and ions, different from those found among up-regulated genes that included many MDR- and PDR-type transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02286.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes from pair-wise comparisons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Venn diagram representing differentially expressed genes in WT and <italic>sak1.</italic> Mapman functional classes distribution of differentially expressed genes (passing criteria of fold change greater than 2<sup>1</sup> [up] or smaller than 2<sup>−1</sup> [down] with FDR &lt;1%) during acclimation in (<bold>B</bold>) WT and (<bold>C</bold>) <italic>sak1.</italic> (<bold>D</bold>) Differentially expressed genes when comparing WT and <italic>sak1</italic> in basal conditions (i.e., before exposure to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>).

have a functional annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), it is interesting that the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> response in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> involves genes and biological processes that appear to be distinct from those that respond specifically to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">op den Camp et al., 2003</xref>). A total of 70 <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-response genes have been defined using a microarray with the <italic>flu</italic> mutant in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">op den Camp et al., 2003</xref>). These genes include the following classes (number of genes): metabolism (11), transcription (5), protein fate (4), transport (2), cellular communication/signal transduction (17), cell rescue/defense in virulence (4), subcellular localization (2), binding function or cofactor requirement (1), transport facilitation (5) and others (19). From this list of 70 genes we found four similarly annotated genes within our 515 genes induced by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>: a Myb transcription factor, a mitochondrial carrier protein, an amino acid permease, and an ATPase/aminophospholipid translocase. None of these genes in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> was the closest ortholog of the corresponding <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene<italic>.</italic> Conversely, genes similar to those strongly up-regulated in a SAK1-dependent manner such as CFAs, SOUL proteins, GPX, and sterol biosynthetic enzymes were not found among the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-specific genes despite having clear counterparts in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Taken together, these results suggest that these two organisms may deploy distinct mechanisms in their responses to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The <italic>sak1</italic> mutant is defective in the global gene expression response during acclimation to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub></title><p>In the <italic>sak1</italic> mutant<italic>,</italic> 1020 genes were up-regulated, whereas 434 genes were down-regulated during acclimation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, C2). 350 of the 515 genes up-regulated in WT overlapped with the set of up-regulated genes in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Comparing the fold changes of genes in WT and <italic>sak1</italic> during acclimation, we defined 104 genes as SAK1-dependent genes that displayed moderate to strong attenuation in their response (fold change ratio &lt;0.5) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Some of the genes that belong to enriched biological classes found among WT up-regulated genes are indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. Interestingly, the most strongly induced genes in WT were found among this group; 37 out of 104 SAK1-dependent genes were among the top 10% most strongly induced genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). 33 out of these 37 most strongly induced SAK1-dependent genes displayed strong disruption in their up-regulation; reduced to 0.01–0.25 of magnitude of fold change in <italic>sak1</italic> as compared to WT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). These results indicate SAK1 is required for the induction of the most strongly induced genes during acclimation reflecting its critical role in regulating the cellular acclimation response to

<italic>sak1,</italic> including the primary and secondary effects of lacking SAK1, we also focused on changes in transcript levels at the basal level, that is, without <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. At basal level 699 genes were induced, and 737 genes were repressed in the mutant compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, C3), displaying the genome-wide response to the loss of <italic>SAK1</italic> function despite the mutant’s wild-type appearance under normal lab growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The enriched classes of genes that are differentially expressed are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Genes induced in the mutant at basal level were enriched for those annotated to be involved in nucleotide metabolism, DNA, and RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">Table 7</xref>). Interestingly genes involved in tetrapyrrole and photosynthesis were enriched both in elevated and repressed genes at the basal level in <italic>sak1</italic>. There was no overall trend of these two pathways being up- or down-regulated, since these genes were at different steps of the pathway or encoded a select isoform of an enzyme or a subunit of a

The <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cell contains a single large chloroplast that is physically connected to other organelles such as the ER, making it particularly challenging to fractionate. The patterns of markers specific for chloroplast, ER, cytosol, and mitochondria showed that each target fraction was enriched as expected, although with some cross contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The distribution of SAK1 in these fractions resembled most closely that of the cytosolic marker NAB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mussgnug et al., 2005</xref>), although the SAK1 signal was not as enriched as NAB1 in the cytosolic fraction, possibly due to partial degradation of SAK1 during the fractionation. The localization was the same in cells with and without RB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Because <italic>SAK1</italic> was required for the induction of many genes during acclimation to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and the list of proteins with similarity to SAK1 included those predicted to be bZIP transcription factors, we tested whether SAK1 protein was dually targeted to the nucleus and cytosol, which would account for the lack of enrichment of SAK1 in the cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> although a faint SAK1 signal was detected in nuclear fraction, there was no enrichment as seen for the nuclear marker histone H3 (H3). The distribution of the cytosolic marker NAB1 indicated the contamination of the nuclear fraction by cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Therefore we conclude that the low signal of SAK1 in the nuclear fraction is likely to be due to cytosolic contamination. Attempts to detect the protein by immunofluorescence using anti-SAK1 antibodies as well as anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies against tagged proteins in transgenic lines were unsuccessful due to a very low signal-to-noise ratio even in bleached cells.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02286.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>SAK1 is a phosphorylated protein that is in the cytosol.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) SAK1 is detected in the cytosol and not in other subcellular fractions.

Several previous genetic screens aimed at dissecting the mechanisms of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> signaling have concentrated on the nuclear gene expression response to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, often relying on the response of a single marker gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baruah et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brzezowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shao et al., 2013</xref>).

The <italic>sak1</italic> mutant completely lacks this ability to acclimate to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In particular, <italic>sak1</italic> is not more sensitive than WT to high light or norflurazon (an inhibitor of the biosynthesis of carotenoids, which function as quenchers of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>). We speculate that the lack of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive phenotype in these plate experiments is attributable to the time-scale of the treatments involved. <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generated by RB or during a transfer to higher light intensity is transient, whereas NF requires longer time to exert its effect because it needs to enter the cell, inhibit biosynthesis, and deplete cells of existing carotenoids. During this time, the cell is likely able to acclimate by detoxifying and reducing the generation of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> by various means such as changing the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus. We have previously shown that acclimation to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is transient and is dissipated by 24 hr post-treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ledford et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with this, pretreatment with RB does not acclimate the cells to stresses such as growth in high light or norflurazon that require a period of days to assess an effect on viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have also observed that under our experimental conditions, the induction of target gene expression upon exposure to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> lasts up to 90 min and then declines. We conclude that SAK1 functions mainly during transient perturbations that generate <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.

Cyclopropane fatty acids have been found in large amounts in the seeds of <italic>Sterculia foetida</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2002</xref>), although its biological function is unknown.

This was not surprising considering that <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> exists in aquatic and terrestrial environments, where it is generated by photosensitizing humic substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frimmel et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steinberg et al., 2008</xref>), which are known to affect microbial populations including phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glaeser et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2014</xref>). Assuming that some of these transporters function to export photosensitizing molecules from the cell, our results suggest that removal of photosensitizers is an integral part of the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> response in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, rather than simply a response to the presence of a xenobiotic compound such as RB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). It is likely that <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, a soil-dwelling microalga, needs to respond to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> that is generated not only in the chloroplast, but also in other compartments. In this context, it is noteworthy that a recent study has demonstrated light-independent <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation in multiple organelles other than the chloroplast under various biotic and abiotic stresses in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mor et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Two proteins with SOUL heme-binding domains were among SAK1-dependent up-regulated genes (SOUL2 and Cre06.g299700.t1.1, formerly annotated as SOUL1 in v4). Aside from their ability to bind various porphyrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackmon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato et al., 2004</xref>), SOUL heme-binding proteins have been described in diverse biological functions in mice, such as in apoptosis by interacting with a mitochondrial anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambrosi et al., 2011</xref>) or an isoform-specific role in retina and pineal gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zylka and Reppert, 1999</xref>). The latter form is suggested to play a role in transporting heme or by binding free heme to prevent oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sato et al., 2004</xref>).

The two SOUL protein genes induced by <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in our study do not seem to be targeted to the chloroplast, and they may function in the cytosol where SAK1 resides. It would be interesting to test whether these proteins bind porphyrins and are required for <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> acclimation.</p><p>A recent study reported the role of bilins in retrograde signaling in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> through characterization of heme oxygenase mutants disrupted in bilin biosynthesis and transcriptome analyses during dark to light transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duanmu et al., 2013</xref>). The transcriptome changes indicated that much of the cell’s response during a dark-to-light transition (DL) involves photo-oxidative stress. Interestingly, among the 515 genes up-regulated in WT during <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> acclimation, 144 genes overlapped with those that are induced during DL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl9">Table 9</xref>).

pathway from the chloroplast to the nucleus that leads to <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> acclimation. Previous genetic screens in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> have identified proteins in the chloroplast, such as EX1 and EX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), and in the nucleus, such as PLEIOTROPIC RESPONSE LOCUS 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baruah et al., 2009b</xref>) and topoisomerase VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simková et al., 2012</xref>), that are involved in <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> signaling. By screening for mutants that are unable to induce a <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>-responsive reporter gene (<italic>HPS70A</italic>) in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, a small zinc finger protein (Cre09.g416500.t1.2) called MBS was recently identified as having a role in ROS signaling in both <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shao et al., 2013</xref>). Like SAK1, MBS in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> is located in the cytosol, raising a question about the relationship of these two proteins in <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> signaling. As expected, we found <italic>HSP70A</italic> among the genes induced by RB treatment of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) however in <italic>sak1</italic> it was not significantly induced above the twofold threshold, suggesting that SAK1 might function in the same signaling pathway as MBS.

The sequence of this domain is not highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and is even less conserved among land plant proteins, although it is detectable by PSI-BLAST, indicating that it has diverged in sequence in plants and algae. We identified 37 proteins that have the SAK1 domain, 13 of which also contained a bZIP transcription factor domain, consistent with a function in regulating gene expression. Under our standard laboratory growth conditions, SAK1 appears to have a relatively low level of phosphorylation, but it becomes hyperphosphorylated during <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Phosphorylation prediction software NetPhos 2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/</ext-link>) predicted 24 serine, 9 threonine, and one tyrosine residue as possible sites throughout the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). One of these serine residues is within the conserved SAK1 domain and is relatively conserved for polar amino acids. At this position, 18 SAK1 family members had threonine, and three had serine residues including SAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We speculate that phosphorylation of SAK1 in the cytosol is a necessary intermediate step in <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> acclimation. Through further analysis of the transcriptome data, isolation of proteins that physically interact with SAK1, and characterization of additional, non-allelic <italic>sak</italic> mutants, we hope to identify the kinase that is responsible for the direct modification of SAK1 as well as other upstream and downstream components of this retrograde signaling pathway in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strains and culture conditions</title><p>The <italic>sak1</italic> mutant was generated by insertional mutagenesis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dent et al., 2005</xref>) from WT strain 4A+.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Detlef Weigel, and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Todd Mockler, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript from Wakao et al addresses SAK1, a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that is a component of the retrograde signaling pathway between the plastid and nucleus. SAK1 functions in regulation of nuclear gene expression during acclimation of Chlamydomonas cells to reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is an interesting and timely manuscript on an interesting topic. While ROS are implicated in pathologies including stresses, signal transduction, and developmental regulation in multiple systems, ROS signaling pathways remain to be elucidated in detail. Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a particularly toxic form of ROS that is generated during photosynthesis. Plants and algae have evolved retrograde signaling between the chloroplast and the nucleus through which singlet oxygen species modulate nuclear gene expression and acclimation to oxidative stress. Specifically relevant to this manuscript, few components of singlet oxygen signaling have been discovered in any system, and there remains a large gap between singlet oxygen generation in the chloroplast and mediation of gene expression regulation in the nucleus.</p><p>This work concerns the characterization of a <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> mutant called <italic>sak1</italic> that is unable to increase its tolerance to singlet oxygen. SAK1 is a novel cytosolic phosphoprotein containing a domain that is conserved among some bZIP transcription factors. SAK1 accumulation is itself induced and phosphorylated upon exposure to singlet oxygen, consistent with its function in the retrograde signal transduction pathway(s) leading to acclimation to singlet oxygen stress. Gene responses to RB are shown to be substantially affected in the <italic>sak1</italic> mutant. The protein encoded by SAK1 is shown to be located in the cytosol and phosphorylated upon exposure of the microalgal cells to RB. The experiments seem to have been done carefully and the manuscript is written in a clear and concise manner.</p><p>In summary, this is a well-written manuscript that presents a new protein, identified in a clever mutant screen that is implicated in both retrograde signaling and ROS response. This factor is of general interest due to its relevance to photosynthesis and primary metabolism, retrograde signaling, ROS, and abiotic stress responses.</p><p>Specific concerns to be addressed in the revised manuscript and response to the reviews are as follows:</p><p>1) Are the data presented here really representative of the response of photosynthetic organisms to natural conditions of 1O2 stress, e.g. excess light energy? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, it is shown that RB-pretreated WT cells become resistant to high concentrations of RB. However, it is not shown whether or not RB-treated cells are also resistant to high light or Norflurazon, two conditions known to produce 1O2 in the chloroplasts. These data should be shown in the manuscript to demonstrate that the acclimation mechanism described here can be extrapolated to natural 1O2 stress conditions.</p><p>2) Did the authors compare the RB-induced changes in gene expression with the gene expression profile in high light-exposed Chlamydomonas cells?</p><p>3) Intriguingly, the <italic>sak1</italic> mutant grows in high light similarly to the WT strain, and it is not more sensitive to Norflurazon compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests that the sak1 mutation does not affect the response to 1O2 when it is produced in the chloroplast. Is this absence of phenotype of the <italic>sak1</italic> mutant also observed when the HL and Norflurazon treatments were imposed after acclimation to RB?</p><p>4) During acclimation of WT to RB, genes involved in transport constitute one of the most enriched classes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The authors interpret this striking effect as a response of the cells to pump RB out, reinforcing the idea that at least part of the changes in gene expression is a response to RB itself rather than a response to singlet oxygen. In this context, it would be useful to compare the expression of the genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> when RB is imposed in the dark (no 1O2 produced) or in the light.</p><p>5) The authors should pay more attention to the physiological meaning of the treatments that they used to isolate and characterize their mutant.

In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref><italic>, it is shown that RB-pretreated WT cells become resistant to high concentrations of RB. However, it is not shown whether or not RB-treated cells are also resistant to high light or Norflurazon, two conditions known to produce 1O2 in the chloroplasts. These data should be shown in the manuscript to demonstrate that the acclimation mechanism described here can be extrapolated to natural 1O2 stress conditions</italic>.</p><p>We have published previously that WT Chlamydomonas can acclimate to RB following pretreatment with high light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ledford et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that 1O2 generation by excess light elicits a response overlapping with the response to RB. We have repeated this experiment including sak1, and the results in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> show that the mutant acclimates less effectively. The mutant does exhibit some acclimation, however, which we attribute to the fact that high light initiates several signaling pathways in addition to 1O2 (e.g. reduced PQ pool, H2O2, O2-), to which sak1 is still capable of responding, and we have previously shown that a more general oxidative stress response can induce resistance to RB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischer et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, pretreatment with RB did not increase resistance to HL or norflurazon in WT or sak1 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). Acclimation to 1O2 is transient, lasting less than 24 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ledford et al, 2007</xref>), and SAK1 appears to be involved in the early and transient response to 1O2 during perturbations rather than actively detoxifying during long-term, chronic stresses, as can be seen in the wild-type growth of sak1 on medium containing norflurazon or in HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We speculate that over the days required to see growth in HL or norflurazon, the cells are able to adjust their physiology in different ways to reduce 1O2 generation and/or toxicity.</p><p><italic>2) Did the authors compare the RB-induced changes in gene expression with the gene expression profile in high light-exposed</italic> Chlamydomonas <italic>cells?</italic></p><p>We have tested the expression of several of the 1O2-responsive genes (new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and the SAK1 transcript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) during a low to high light transition and found that they are moderately induced compared to induction by RB. This was expected because 1O2 is a part of the high light response, whereas RB treatment isolates and amplifies the 1O2-dependent part of this response.</p><p><italic>3) Intriguingly, the sak1 mutant grows in high light similarly to the WT strain, and it is not more sensitive to Norflurazon compared to WT (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>). This suggests that the</italic> sak1 <italic>mutation does not affect the response to 1O2 when it is produced in the chloroplast</italic>. <italic>Is this absence of phenotype of the sak1 mutant also observed when the HL and Norflurazon treatments were imposed after acclimation to RB?</italic></p><p>Please see our responses to points 1 and 2 above. High light is known to induce 1O2 production in the chloroplast, so our observation of impaired RB acclimation in sak1 after pretreatment with high light (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) suggests that sak1 does indeed affect the response to 1O2 produced in the chloroplast. As described above, the acclimation induced by RB pretreatment is transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ledford et al., 2007</xref>) and thus presumably is not maintained long enough to confer resistance to chronic high light or norflurazon stress.</p><p><italic>4) During acclimation of WT to RB, genes involved in transport constitute one of the most enriched classes (</italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3"><italic>Table 3</italic></xref><italic>). The authors interpret this striking effect as a response of the cells to pump RB out, reinforcing the idea that at least part of the changes in gene expression is a response to RB itself rather than a response to singlet oxygen. In this context, it would be useful to compare the expression of the genes shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>when RB is imposed in the dark (no 1O2 produced) or in the light</italic>.</p><p>We examined this issue by performing an additional experiment comparing gene expression in the dark with or without RB (new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>), and we found that the expression levels of the 1O2 target genes (including specific ABC transporter genes) remained unchanged when cells were exposed to RB in the dark. This result demonstrates that the induction of these genes is due to 1O2 rather than RB itself. The RB-dark vs. RB-light comparison strongly resembled that of mock-light vs. RB-light and did not directly address whether the some of the genes were responding to the chemical RB or 1O2. Besides being produced by excess light, 1O2 is known to be generated by naturally occurring photosensitizers (e.g. humic substances) in aquatic and terrestrial environments. Microbes and phytoplankton must respond to this stress, and our results are relevant to understanding how this occurs. We have added text and references to clarify and discuss these topics.</p><p><italic>5) The authors should pay more attention to the physiological meaning of the treatments that they used to isolate and characterize their mutant. A few additional experiments could be helpful to convince the readers that the gene responses described in this manuscript can be useful to understand the responses of photosynthetic organisms to 1O2 produced in vivo under excess light energy</italic>.</p><p>In addition to the cross-acclimation experiments (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>), we performed an experiment to measure Fv/Fm (maximum efficiency of photosystem II) during RB treatments (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The data show that 1O2 generated during RB treatment causes inhibition of photosystem II in the chloroplast and that pretreatment alleviates this inhibition, consistent with the growth phenotype seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) Are</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><italic>Table 1</italic></xref> <italic>redundant?
