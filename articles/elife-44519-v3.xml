effector cells. Data mining of our RNA-Seq analysis of CD14<sup>+</sup>monocytes showed enrichment for metabolic and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathways in sarcoidosis. Further investigation revealed that sarcoidosis macrophages and monocytes exhibit higher protein levels for HIF-α isoforms, HIF-1β, and their transcriptional co-activator p300 as well as glucose transporter 1 (Glut1). In situ hybridization of sarcoidosis granulomatous lung tissues showed abundance of HIF-1α in the center of granulomas. The abundance of HIF isoforms was mechanistically linked to elevated IL-1β and IL-17 since targeted down regulation of HIF-1α via short interfering RNA or a HIF-1α inhibitor decreased their production. Pharmacological intervention using chloroquine, a lysosomal inhibitor, decreased lysosomal associated protein 2 (LAMP2) and HIF-1α levels and modified cytokine production. These data suggest that increased activity of HIF-α isoforms regulate Th1/Th17 mediated inflammation in sarcoidosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44519.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sarcoidosis is a rare disease that is characterized by the formation of small lumps known as granulomas inside the body. These lumps are made up of clusters of immune cells, and are commonly found in the skin, lung or eye. Other organs of the body can also be affected, and symptoms will vary depending on where in the body lumps form. There is currently no specific treatment for sarcoidosis, as the direct cause of the disease is unknown. The disease is often treated with drugs that suppress the immune system. However, this type of treatment can lead to significant side effects and patients will respond to these drugs in different ways.</p><p>Patients with sarcoidosis have a heightened immune response to microbes that can cause infections, and rather than providing protection, this heightened response causes damage and inflammation to the body’s organs. Now, Talreja et al. have identified which genes and proteins control this inflammatory response in immune cells from the lungs and blood of sarcoidosis patients.</p><p>Immune cells in the lungs of sarcoidosis patients were found to have higher levels of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) – a gene-regulating protein that controls the uptake and metabolism of oxygen in mammals. In addition, lung tissue affected with granulomas also expressed increased levels of a specific version of HIF known as HIF-1. Talreja et al. showed that the increased expression of HIF in the immune cells of sarcoidosis patients was mechanistically linked to the production of several molecules that promote inflammation. Inhibiting HIF-1 led to a decrease in the production of these inflammatory molecules, indicating that increased activity of HIF-1 causes inflammation in sarcoidosis patients.</p><p>It remains unclear what causes this abundance of HIF-1α. It is possible that specific modifications of this factor prevent it from degrading, resulting in higher levels. By identifying a link between HIF-1 and inflammation, these findings open up potential new avenues of the treatment for sarcoidosis patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sarcoidosis</kwd><kwd>HIF-1α</kwd><kwd>monocytes</kwd><kwd>alveolar macrophages</kwd><kwd>IL-1β</kwd><kwd>IL-17</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-16-1-0516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grossman</surname><given-names>Lawrence I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006710</institution-id><institution>Wayne State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Henry L Brasza endowment</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grossman</surname><given-names>Lawrence I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL113508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samavati</surname><given-names>Lobelia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002590</institution-id><institution>American Lung Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samavati</surname><given-names>Lobelia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007284</institution-id><institution>School of Medicine, Wayne State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samavati</surname><given-names>Lobelia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sarcoidosis, a granulomatous disease characterized by macrophage and T-cell activation, is found to be associated with increased HIF-1α transcriptional activity, and modulation of HIF-1α regulates inflammatory immune responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by extensive local inflammation and granuloma formation in different organs with an increase in T-helper type 1 (Th1) mediated cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hunninghake et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iannuzzi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>). Pulmonary involvement in sarcoidosis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. In the lungs, the presence of activated macrophages and the expansion of oligoclonal T and B cells suggest <bold>s</bold>ustained activation of inflammatory pathways in this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fazel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iannuzzi et al., 2007</xref>). Activated macrophages, monocytes, and T cells in sarcoidosis produce a plethora of cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, interferon (IFN) gamma, IL-17, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Facco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Müller-Quernheim, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talreja et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we have shown that sarcoidosis bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and alveolar macrophages (AMs), unlike those from healthy controls, exhibit high constitutively active p38 and lack dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP1 or MKP-1). The sustained p38 activation directly controls expression of several cytokines in sarcoidosis AMs and monocytes and the modulation of p38 regulates T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talreja et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in sarcoidosis monocytes and identified altered gene expression profiles and cellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talreja et al., 2017</xref>). These were: metabolic including glycolysis and lipolysis, phagocytosis, inflammation, oxidative phosphorylation, and HIF signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talreja et al., 2017</xref>). Among differentially expressed genes in sarcoidosis monocytes, we found a large number of genes containing hypoxia response elements (HREs) in their regulatory regions and, by pathway analysis, enrichment of hypoxia inducible factor signaling pathways. Furthermore, in an independent study applying <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based analysis, we identified metabolic and mitochondrial alterations in sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geamanu et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that HIF-isoform expression plays an important role in the maintenance of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talreja et al., 2016</xref>), metabolic imbalance, and mitochondrial dysfunction in sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geamanu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The oxygen-sensitive transcription factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α are key transcriptional regulators of hypoxia-associated genes to adapt to decreased availability of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semenza, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Green, 2012</xref>). In the presence of O<sub>2</sub>, cytosolic HIF-α isoforms are hydroxylated by prolyl-hydroxylases (PHD) through an iron dependent mechanism, which prevents heterodimerization with HIF-1β (ARNT) and consequent nuclear translocation as an active transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palazon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Semenza, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semenza, 2011</xref>). HIF transcription factors alter the expression of various genes involved in metabolism, cell differentiation, proliferation, and angiogenesis in hypoxic tissues. Although the role of HIF-α isoforms in hypoxia and cancer is well studied, there is a knowledge gap regarding their role in regulating immune cells under normoxic conditions. The role of HIF-1α in sarcoidosis has not been studied. In the current study, we applied a combination of transcriptional and functional approaches to investigate the role of HIF-1α in mediating the inflammatory immune response in AMs, monocytes, and PBMCs of sarcoidosis patients as compared to healthy controls. Because sarcoidosis predominantly affects the lungs, we carried out the functional studies using AMs to determine the lung immune responses, while monocytes and PBMCs were used to assess peripheral immunity. Under normoxic conditions we found enhanced expression and activity of HIF-1α in sarcoidosis AMs and monocytes. Furthermore, HIF-1α expression was directly correlated with IL-1β production in AMs and PBMCs. Down regulation of HIF-1α expression via short interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased IL-1β in sarcoidosis AMs, while decreased HIF-1α expression in PBMCs decreased IL-1β and IL-17 in response to anti-CD3 challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA-seq data of sarcoidosis monocytes identifies enrichment of the HIF-1α signaling pathway</title><p>Patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and Materials and methods) were ambulatory outpatients who were not hypoxic. Differentially expressed (DE) genes between sarcoidosis monocytes and healthy monocytes previously determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talreja et al., 2017</xref>) were subjected to pathway analysis. The pathway analysis showed impaction of metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation, purine and pyruvate metabolism in sarcoidosis. Because most of genes in these pathways showed the presence of hypoxia response elements (HREs), we further focused on interrogation of the HIF-pathway. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the heat map of HIF signaling genes in monocytes. There are clear differences in the intensity and expression of genes related to the HIF pathway in monocytes of healthy controls and sarcoidosis subjects. Next, we compared the expression of selected genes related to HIF transcription factor activity. The transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT, also known as HIF-1β) heterodimerizes with HIF-1α to form a transcriptional active complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wolff et al., 2013</xref>). The gene count between sarcoidosis and healthy control subjects demonstrate significantly higher ARNT gene expression in sarcoidosis monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1), also known as HIF-2α, is a hypoxia inducible transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thompson et al., 2014</xref>). The EPAS1 gene count between sarcoidosis and healthy control subjects demonstrates significantly higher EPAS1 expression in sarcoidosis monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). EP300 is a co-activator important for transcriptional activity of HIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palazon et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, we found higher p300 gene expression in sarcoidosis monocytes as compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, there were no differences in HIF-1α gene transcripts between the two groups.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44519.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enrichment of HIF-1α signaling pathways and related genes in sarcoidosis.</title><p>Pathway analysis of DE genes between sarcoidosis versus healthy control monocytes was done using the iPathwayGuide tool.

AMs or monocytes were cultured ex vivo under normoxic conditions. Western analysis of cell lysates probed with antibody against HIF-1α showed increased HIF-1α protein expression in sarcoidosis AMs and monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Similar results were seen for HIF-2α protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Since HIFα heterodimerizes with ARNT (also known as HIF-1β), translocates to the nucleus, and recruits transcriptional coactivator p300 to transactivate target genes containing hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Semenza, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Talwar et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Talwar et al., 2017b</xref>), we also examined their protein expression. Sarcoidosis AMs also show a higher expression of ARNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>) and p300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>). Similarly, we evaluated the HIF-1α protein abundance in isolated monocytes from sarcoidosis subjects and healthy controls and found significantly higher HIF-1α expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). However, in contrast to increased HIF-2α gene transcripts, we did not detect HIF-2α in either sarcoidosis or control monocytes at the protein level. Because the lack of detection could have been due to low protein abundance in monocytes or lower sensitivity of antibody epitope, we compared the HIF-1α and −2α expression by flow cytometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> shows FSC-A/SSC-A gating. FACS analysis of PBMCs double stained for CD14 and HIF-1α or HIF-2α shows that in healthy controls 5–9% of PBMCs are CD14<sup>+</sup>HIF-1α<sup>+</sup>, whereas in sarcoidosis 20% to 35% of PBMCs are CD14<sup>+</sup> HIF-1α<sup>+</sup>. Analysis of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes based on the expression of HIF-1α shows 25–60% HIF-1α<sup>+</sup> CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes in controls, whereas in sarcoidosis HIF-1α<sup>+</sup> CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes are 64–96% (K). Interestingly, in healthy controls 0–0.1% of PBMCs are CD14<sup>+</sup> HIF-2α<sup>+</sup>, whereas in sarcoidosis 1–3% of PBMCs are CD14<sup>+</sup> HIF-2α<sup>+</sup>.

Therefore, we evaluated the expression of Glut1 and pro-IL-1β at baseline in AMs and monocytes from sarcoidosis and control subjects. Sarcoidosis AMs exhibited a variable amount of Glut1 and pro-IL-1β (18/18 patients) but only 1 out of 10 healthy controls showed expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

To determine whether increased pro-IL-1β expression in sarcoidosis leads to released IL-1β, we measured secreted IL-1β in the conditioned media of AMs and monocytes cultured in the absence or presence of LPS via ELISA.

These data suggest that increased expression of HIF-1α leads to increased IL-1β production in sarcoidosis patients. The interleukin one receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is mainly secreted by monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils.

How specific antigens lead to a sustained granulomatous inflammation in sarcoidosis is largely unknown. Our novel RNA-seq data showed aberrant metabolic pathways and enrichment of DE genes for HIF pathways in monocytes of sarcoidosis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talreja et al., 2017</xref>), confirming our previous metabolomics data showing aberrant metabolic pathways including increased glycolysis and malfunctional tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geamanu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Talreja et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, we investigated the role of HIF-isoforms in sarcoid alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes as well as PBMCs. Alveolar macrophages and monocytes have a central role in the maintenance of immunological homeostasis in response to pathogens providing an important host-defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberdein et al., 2013</xref>). In sarcoidosis, both cell types are in an activated state and produce spontaneous ex vivo cytokines and chemokines including, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-18, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gracie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Müller-Quernheim, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rolfe et al., 1993</xref>). Our current study confirms our previous findings that IL-1β plays an important role in sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talreja et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, we find increased IL-1Ra in sarcoidosis AMs and PBMCs, suggesting activation of the IL-1 pathway. IL-1Ra is a member of the IL-1 family, whose production is stimulated by many substances including cytokines and bacterial or viral components; it has been suggested to act as a decoy receptor and is a natural inhibitor for the biologically active IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lang et al., 1998</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arend, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Santarlasci et al., 2013</xref>). In several inflammatory diseases, including lupus and Crohn's disease (CD), elevated IL-1β production is associated with IL-1Ra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cominelli and Pizarro, 1996</xref>). Our data are in line with previous studies showing increased IL-1Ra in sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mikuniya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rolfe et al., 1993</xref>). Further studies need to delineate the clinical role of IL-1Ra in sarcoidosis.</p><p>Here, we show that sarcoidosis AMs and monocytes in normoxic ex vivo culture conditions and without any stimulation exhibit constitutively active HIF-1α and HIF-1β (ARNT) along with its coactivator, p300. Furthermore, in situ HIF-1α immune staining of sarcoidosis lung biopsies demonstrated HIF-1α abundance in the center of granulomatous tissue and in multinucleated giant cells. We found that a higher percentage of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes express HIF-1α and HIF-2α in sarcoidosis subjects as compared to controls. Our data show that the increased HIF-1α expression is coupled to increased Glut1 protein levels, and enhanced IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-17 production. Downregulation of HIF-1α via siRNA or chemical inhibitors in sarcoidosis PBMCs leads to a decrease in IL-6 and IL-17 production at baseline and in response to anti-CD3 stimulation. In sarcoid subjects HIF-2α was predominantly expressed in the lung macrophage population whereas sarcoidosis monocytes showed lower levels of HIF-2α. HIF-2α downregulation had no significant effect on IL-1β and IL-17 production in sarcoidosis (data not shown). We speculate that HIF-2α regulates other macrophage functions such as phagocytosis and cell metabolism. Classically, sarcoidosis granulomas feature activated antigen presenting cells initiating adaptive immune responses with an increase in activated CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cells and Th1 mediated cytokines. Recently, it has been shown that Th17<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells are increased in sarcoidosis granulomatous tissue and peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Facco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ostadkarampour et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramstein et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies indicated that IL-1β plays a critical role in regulation of Th1/Th17 cells in response to commensal microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duhen and Campbell, 2014</xref>). IL-1β promotes Th17 differentiation from naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by enhancing IL-1 receptor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, IL-1 synergizes with IL-6 to regulate Th17 differentiation and effector Th17 cell function through regulation of transcription factors, including IRF4 and RORγt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, in sarcoidosis increased IL-1β and IL-6 explains Th17 differentiation. Previously, our group and other showed increased IL-6 production in AMs and PBMCs of sarcoidosis subjects at baseline and in response to TLR or NLR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talreja et al., 2016</xref>). Levels of IL-6 may be important in progression of fibrotic lung changes in sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le et al., 2014</xref>). Our data indicate that downregulation of HIF-1α via siRNA or chemical inhibitor reduces IL-6 production by sarcoid PBMCs.</p><p>HIF-1α and HIF-2α are two critical transcription factors that regulate an array of genes involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial function, T-cell differentiation and Th17 development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cummins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nizet and Johnson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palazon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phan and Goldrath, 2015</xref>). Upregulation of HIF isoform plays a critical role in providing metabolic reprogramming in myeloid cells that is required to develop trained immunity for a robust immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). It has been shown that mice with a myeloid cell-specific defect in HIF-1α were unable to mount a trained immune response against bacterial sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Netea et al., 2016</xref>). Trained immunity is associated with profound metabolic reprogramming in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yao et al., 2018</xref>), dendritic cells, and natural killer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Netea et al., 2016</xref>). New mounting evidence indicates that metabolic reprogramming, including upregulation of glycolysis and depression of the TCA cycle, is a required metabolic switch for the development of innate memory, which in turn leads to upregulation of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-17. Similar to cancer metabolism, during inflammation aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) plays an important role in the maintenance of cellular energy supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koppenol et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Warburg, 1956</xref>). Sarcoidosis AMs and monocytes exhibit a phenotype resembling the Warburg effect or trained immunity exhibiting an abundance of HIF isoforms, higher expression for Glut1, and higher production of IL-1β and IL-17. Glut1 is regulated by HIF-1α transcriptional activity and its elaboration is an important step in the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2001</xref>). Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) scans are commonly used to identify metabolic activity in cancer and PET scans have been shown to be useful in active sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avril, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Haim and Ell, 2009</xref>). Increased Glut1 levels may explain the observed increased FDG uptake in PET/CT scans in active sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sobic-Saranovic et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the importance of HIF signaling, the role of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in lung diseases has not been established and only a few studies addressed the role of HIFs in primary human immune cells. One previous study reported increased HIF-1α mRNA in lymphocytes of peripheral blood but a decreased mRNA level in HIF-1α BAL cells. In contrast to our study one prior study reported decreased HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression in sarcoidosis tissue biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tzouvelekis et al., 2012</xref>), although the same study reported increased expression of VEGF, which is directly regulated by HIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tzouvelekis et al., 2012</xref>). The discrepancy of the results may be due to stages of the disease or evaluation of heterogeneous cell populations.</p><p>Several pathways including the PI3 kinase, mTOR, MEK/ERK, GSK3β, and p38 pathways have been proposed to regulate LPS mediated HIF-1α expression and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palazon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peyssonnaux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Talwar et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Talwar et al., 2019</xref>). Previously, we have shown that sustained p38 activation directly controls expression of several cytokines in sarcoid AMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>). The increased p38 phosphorylation in sarcoidosis was associated with lack of mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP)-1 expression in sarcoidosis AMs and monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, p38 MAPK regulates IL-17 production by Th17 cells through regulation of various transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noubade et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, our recent study showed that macrophages derived from MKP-1 deficient mice exhibited higher HIF-1α and IL-1β expression and higher ROS production in response to LPS; in addition, p38 inhibition decreased HIF-1α expression in MKP-1 deficient macrophages and modified cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Talwar et al., 2017a</xref>). In our current work, we found significantly higher HIF-1α expression in sarcoidosis AMs and PBMCs. This can be partly explained by a constitutively active p38 in macrophages of sarcoidosis subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talreja et al., 2016</xref>). We observed that a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) partly decreased the expression of HIF-1α (data not shown) and cytokine levels in sarcoidosis.</p><p>Activation of TLR4 and TLR2 by a variety of pathogen-derived molecules as well as environmental toxins has been shown to induce and stabilize HIF-1α expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frede et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palazon et al., 2014</xref>). Abundance of HIF-1α in sarcoidosis also implies aberrant degradation by proteasomal or/and lysosomal pathways. Autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are two major pathways involved in the degradation of proteins. It has been shown that there is a compensatory interaction between these two pathways and inhibition of one pathway leads to activation of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Our RNA sequencing data showed upregulation of lysosomal pathways, confirming previous findings by other investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talreja et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tomita et al., 1999</xref>). LAMP2, along with LAMP1, comprise about 50% of lysosomal proteins. In sarcoidosis we observed upregulation of LAMP2 both at the gene and protein level. CHQ is an ancient drug that in addition to its anti-malaria activity has been used for autoimmune diseases, including sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morse et al., 1961</xref>). Therefore, we determined the effect of CHQ on LAMP2 and HIF-α isoform expression. Surprisingly, we found that CHQ inhibits the increased levels of LAMP2, HIF-α isoforms, and cytokine production in sarcoidosis. We speculate that in sarcoidosis inhibition of lysosomal function by CHQ leads to increased proteasome degradation of HIF-α isoforms leading to subsequent inhibition of IL-1β and IL-17 cytokines production.</p><p>Environmental factors, altered metabolism, and inflammation can be linked to epigenetic changes such as methylation and acetylation that may contribute to HIF-1α expression and stability in sarcoidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Watson et al., 2010</xref>). How HIF signaling in the absence of a hypoxic trigger regulates metabolic reprogramming and influences inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases, especially respiratory diseases including sarcoidosis, has not been well illuminated. Our report identifies a role for HIF signaling in sarcoidosis granulomatous inflammation. The identification of the mechanisms underlying the aberrant regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α leading to persistent inflammation and Th1/Th17 pathology in sarcoidosis should open new avenues in rational drug discovery, not only for this disease but also for other inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent</td><td>Lipofectamine 2000</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #11668027</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample</td><td>Human AMs</td><td>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells</td><td/><td>Sarcoidosis Center, WSU, Detroit, <break/>USA</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample</td><td>Human PBMCs and monocytes</td><td>Heparinized blood</td><td/><td>Sarcoidosis Center, WSU, Detroit, <break/>USA</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>HIF-1α (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Bioss</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_">AB_</ext-link> <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_">10857933</ext-link>, <break/>Cat. #bs0737</td><td>WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>HIF-2α (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Bioss</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_">AB_</ext-link> <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_">10857576</ext-link>, Cat. #bs1477</td><td>WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>ARNT (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_">AB_</ext-link> <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_">2783880</ext-link>, <break/>Cat. #

Briefly, cells equivalent to 1 × 10<sup>4</sup>/well were seeded in 96-well culture plate and incubated for 24–48 hr with different treatments. After incubation, 20 µl of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent was added per well for 2 hr and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Enzyme- Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)</title><p>The levels of IL-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-17, IL-10, IL-6, and IFN-γ in the conditioned medium were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (ELISA DuoKits; R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Flow cytometry and cell surface immunostaining</title><p>PBMCs from subjects with sarcoidosis were isolated, cultured, and after appropriate treatment were stained for cell surface markers using fluorescent labelled antibodies for CD4-FITC (#340133, BD Biosciences), and CD25-PE (#341009, BD Biosciences). Intracellular staining of PBMCs was done for HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Briefly, PBMCs were first surface stained for CD14 using CD14-PerCPCy5.5 antibody and then fixed using 100 μl of 1% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then permeabilized with permeabilization buffer (0.5% saponin) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 100 μl of permeabilization buffer and stained with HIF-1α (bs0737, Bioss Inc) or HIF-2α (bs1477, Bioss Inc) antibody for 30 min. Cells were washed and stained with the Alexa 488 secondary antibody (#A11070, Molecular Probes). After 30 min cells were washed twice, resuspended in staining buffer, and analyzed for CD14<sup>+</sup>HIF-1α<sup>+</sup> and CD14+HIF-2α<sup>+</sup> monocytes by flow cytometry. PBMCs were not stained specifically to exclude DC contamination. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD LSR II SORP and data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talreja et al., 2016</xref>). Samples were gated on cells using FSC/SSC and doublet discrimination was performed to identify singlets using SSC-W vs. SSC-A. The flowcytometry work was done at the Microscopy, Imaging and Cytometry Resources (MICR) Core at the Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunofluorescent staining</title><p>Intracellular expression of HIF-1α in sarcoidosis AMs was visualized by immunofluorescence staining. AMs (1 × 10<sup>5</sup>) were allowed to adhere overnight on chamber slides. The cells were washed briefly with PBST and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked (10% FCS), and then incubated with anti-HIF-1α (bs0737,Bioss Inc) overnight at 4°C. The secondary antibody used was Alexa-fluor 488- conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. The next day cells were washed three times with PBS for 5 min, the slide was mounted with a drop of ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). The slide was examined using an Axiovert 40 CFL fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Protein extraction and immunoblotting</title><p>Total cellular proteins were extracted by addition of RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail and antiphosphatase I and II (Sigma Chemicals). Protein concentration was measured with the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, CA). Equal amounts of proteins (10–25 μg) were mixed 1/1 (v/v) with 2x sample buffer (20% glycerol, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% 2-βME, 0.05% bromophenol blue, and 1.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), and fractionated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) for 60 min at 18 V using a SemiDry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 hr, washed, and incubated with primary Abs (1/1000) overnight at 4°C. The blots were washed with TBST and then incubated for 1 hr with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary anti-IgG Ab using a dilution of 1/10,000 in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST. Membranes were washed four times in TBST. Immuno-reactive bands were visualized with a chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham GE, PA). Images were captured on Hyblot CL film (Denville; Scientific, Inc; Metuchen, NJ) using a JPI automatic X-ray film processor model JP-33. Optical density analysis of signals was performed using Image J software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastogi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talreja et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Tissue sections from the sarcoidosis transbronchial lung biopsy samples were selected for immunostaining after review of the glass slides that had been previously prepared using the routine hematoxylin-eosin protocol on paraffin-embedded sections. Additional fixed slides were cut, subjected to peroxide block protocol, pretreated, and then incubated first with primary antibody (anti-HIF-1α, bs0737, Bioss Inc ) and then with a secondary conjugated polymer; each incubation step was done for 30 min at room temperature. Negative staining was done by using an isotype control antibody. After another incubation step with the chromogen (5 min at room temperature), the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and dehydrated with ethanol and xylene prior to mounting.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;HIF-1α Regulates IL-1β and IL-17 in Sarcoidosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jos WM van der Meer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Siroon Bekkering (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-executed study showing a key role for unregulated HIF-1α in the pro-inflammatory cytokine response in sarcoidosis. Mechanistic studies in sarcoidosis are definitely needed, since the understanding of the pathogenesis is still rather limited. The clinical material used, the experiments both in alveolar macrophages and in peripheral monocytes are adequate and convincing, also because of the inhibition studies performed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors assert that, to the best of their knowledge, this is the first report to interrogate the role of HIF in sarcoidosis. Whilst this is the most comprehensive, and likely a more robust study to look at the function of HIF in the disease, there are two other reports detailing HIF expression in sarcoidosis (Tzouvelekis et al., 2012 and Piotrowski et al., 2015). One of these studies conflicts with the finding of HIF granuloma expression presented here in this report, therefore it would be of value to discuss these within this paper and provide possible reasons for the differences or similarities in findings.</p><p>2) Regarding flow cytometry, the authors show HIF-1α expression in CD14<sup>+</sup> cells. They should FSC and SSC gating and acknowledge DC contamination, if that has not been dealt with.</p><p>3) The conclusion drawn from flow cytometry data for PBMCs makes reference to increased CD14<sup>+</sup>HIF-1α<sup>+</sup>monocytes in the patient samples, stating that this is 5-9% in controls and 20-35% in sarcoidosis patient samples. This is misleading, as monocytes make up a higher percentage of PBMCs in sarcoidosis. It is suggested that this be reworded to represent HIF<sup>+</sup> percentage of monocytes, and that quantitative figures provided for all donors along with degree of expression (MFI or equivalent).</p><p>4) For Figure 3, a negative antibody control staining is necessary to support the conclusion, as macrophages and giant cells display high non-specific staining. This is important for validation in light of point 1.</p><p>5) The authors show single cell examples of confocal microscopic studies. The question is are all cells showing this upregulated pattern? A remark on this would be helpful.</p><p>6) The authors say that they have observed similar results on liver and skin samples (subsection “Confocal microscopy of sarcoidosis AMs and immunohistochemistry of sarcoidosis tissues confirmed increased HIF-1α expression and its nuclear accumulation”). This is a bit too loose. How many samples? What does 'similar' exactly mean?</p><p>7) In Figure 4, why were the cells not stimulated by LPS and why was only baseline expression measured? In Figure 5, the expression is measured after stimulation and it might be interesting to look at secreted IL-1β after stimulation in Figure 4 as well. Furthermore, in Figure 5C, the expression of pro-IL-1β (unstimulated pro-IL-1β) should be similar to the expression in Figure 4 (as it is the same measurement) but suddenly looks much lower. Why is this?</p><p>8) Was the viability of the cells checked after siRNA treatment? Primary cells usually don't like siRNA treatment and die. Please add proof of viability.</p><p>9) In Figure 6B, the expression of IL-10 looks decreased. There is no statistical significance (as is hard to obtain with n=4 generally), but the same trend is seen in Figure 6A. What would happen if one would increase it to n=6, would that become statistically significant? Will that change the conclusions?</p><p>10) In discussing the specificity of HIF for IL-17 and IL-1β, the data shows an impact on IL-6 also. Additionally, in discussions, the lack of significant impact on IFN-γ is noted but not considered of importance. IL-6 and IFN-γ are notably important cytokines in sarcoidosis, both being overexpressed in granulomatous tissue, so addressing these findings would be useful for wider context.</p><p>11) In the text explaining Figure 7A, it is mentioned that patients’ PBMCs have a higher expression of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells. But higher than what? There are no control PBMCs included in this analysis, is that correct? Why not? What is the baseline expression in control PBMCs?</p><p>12) The findings of sustained enhanced (spontaneous) IL-1 production and upregulated HIF-1α are reminiscent of the trained immunity state of mononuclear phagocytes, in which the metabolic shift (Warburg effect) and epigenetic reprogramming are tightly connected (see Cheng et al., 2014). This should be discussed.</p><p>13) When IL-1β production is enhanced, the net biological effect is often dependent on the production level of IL-1Ra. If the investigators still have supernatants, it would be of interest to see whether IL-1Ra is also unregulated.</p><p>14) A main criticism is the Discussion. This section could be much better structured and written, as the reviewers lost track of the authors' findings in their reasoning. Please start with a few sentences telling the key findings of this work, and put that into the perspective of what is known about this in sarcoidosis and in general. Thereafter, please go into the minor findings, to end with future perspectives (and speculate about the clinical implications of these very interesting findings).</p><p>15) In the Discussion, two interesting results of inhibitors used are mentioned with 'data not shown'. Why are these data not included in the manuscript? This would add some interesting pathway information to the story. It is preferable not to mention unpublished data, if at all possible.</p><p>References:</p><p>Piotrowski WJ, Kiszałkiewicz J, Pastuszak-Lewandoska D, Górski P, Antczak A, Migdalska-Sęk M, Górski W, Czarnecka KH, Domańska D, Nawrot E, Brzeziańska-Lasota E.

Both studies evaluated predominantly HIF-1α mRNA levels using PCR. Tzouvelekis et al. reported decreased expression of HIF-1α mRNA and protein in tissue biopsies. The tissue presented in that manuscript appears to show advanced fibrotic changes with complete destruction of lung structures. Furthermore, they show upregulation of VEGF expression. Increased VEGF expression indicates increased HIF-1α activity as VEGF is highly regulated by HIF-1α. The discrepancy between our results and their findings could be due to sampling of biopsy at different stages of the disease or treatment effect. Note that in our study, most of the patients were recruited before starting any drug treatment. Furthermore, similar to their results our RNA-Seq data didn’t show any differential expression of HIF-1α between healthy controls and sarcoid patients. We mentioned that pathway analysis indicated upregulation of metabolic pathways that are regulated by HIF pathways. The study done by Piotrowski et al. was concluded that the upregulation of HIF-1α and VEGF in PBMCs of sarcoid patients was associated with poor lung function. We were unable to access the complete paper of Piotrowski. Reading the Abstract, it is not clear to us what cell type they analyzed (blood lymphocytes versus BAL?). Hence, we are unsure how those results compare to our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Regarding flow cytometry, the authors show HIF-1α expression in CD14<sup>+</sup> cells. They should FSC and SSC gating and acknowledge DC contamination, if that has not been dealt with.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have shown the FSC and SSC gating in Figure 2J. We acknowledge that we did not do any staining to exclude DCs. For flowcytometry, PBMCs were double stained with CD14 and HIF-1α antibodies. The upper right quadrant shows CD14<sup>+</sup>HIF-1α<sup>+</sup> cells that are CD14<sup>+</sup>monocytes expressing HIF-1α. We added a sentence indicating that we did not specifically assess for DCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusion drawn from flow cytometry data for PBMCs makes reference to increased CD14<sup>+</sup>HIF-1α<sup>+</sup>monocytes in the patient samples, stating that this is 5-9% in controls and 20-35% in sarcoidosis patient samples.

We have reworded in the Results and legend sections to accommodate your suggestion, however we also think it important to mention double positivity of CD14 and HIF-1α.</p><p>The percentage of CD14<sup>+</sup>HIF-1α<sup>+</sup>monocytes obtained from the donors used for the study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44519.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44519-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For Figure 3, a negative antibody control staining is necessary to support the conclusion, as macrophages and giant cells display high non-specific staining.

However, we added the negative (isotype control) staining as suggested in Figure 3K.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors show single cell examples of confocal microscopic studies. The question is are all cells showing this upregulated pattern? A remark on this would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. The purpose of performing confocal microscopy of single cells was to identify whether HIF-1α is present in the nuclei, suggesting transcriptional activity of HIF-1α. Furthermore, due to the fact that we worked with precious human samples, and we could not perform fractionation of nuclear proteins (due to limited number of cells), we performed confocal microscopy instead. Based on the reviewer’s suggestion we performed regular immunofluorescent microscopy and quantitated the percentage of cells showing HIF-1α expression. It shows that about 60-90% of AMs show HIF-1α expression. We added a representative section of DAPI and HIF-1α in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors say that they have observed similar results on liver and skin samples (subsection “Confocal microscopy of sarcoidosis AMs and immunohistochemistry of sarcoidosis tissues confirmed increased HIF-1α expression and its nuclear accumulation”). This is a bit too loose. How many samples? What does 'similar' exactly mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We assessed HIF-1α expression in two skin and two liver biopsies. In one liver biopsy, we noticed high HIF-1 a staining in granulomatous tissue and surrounding hepatocytes. This patient is a young woman (28 year old), who at 21 years of age developed sarcoidosis. She has severe multiorgan involvement, including lungs, eyes and heart’ as well as liver. Due to sarcoidosis uveitis she is now legally blind. She had very abnormal liver function tests. The purpose of performing a liver biopsy was to assess for her abnormal liver function tests. H&amp;E staining showed severe granulomatous inflammation. There were extensive increased HIF-1α expression throughout the liver. While negative staining did not show non-specific staining. Therefore, we believe that increased HIF-1α staining in the hepatocytes may represent a true increased of HIF-1α associated with the severity of disease in this patient. We have now added Figure 3—figure supplement 1 in the final version to show there are multiple granulomas in the liver with increased mononuclear cell infiltrates. Yet, no significant fibrosis is seen in the H&amp;E staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 4, why were the cells not stimulated by LPS and why was only baseline expression measured?

Therefore, we selected the unstimulated samples of patients and controls. As suggested by the reviewers we have added the data for secreted IL-1β with LPS stimulation in revised Figure 4F and 4G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, in Figure 5C, the expression of pro-IL-1β (unstimulated pro-IL-1β) should be similar to the expression in Figure 4 (as it is the same measurement) but suddenly looks much lower.

Similarly, in Figure 5 the treatment of AMs with HIF-1α siRNA didn’t show a statistically significant decrease in IL-10. We agree that both Interferon and IL-10 show a trend to lower levels, which can be due to paracrine IL-1β function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In discussing the specificity of HIF for IL-17 and IL-1β, the data shows an impact on IL-6 also.

Thereafter, please go into the minor findings, to end with future perspectives (and speculate about the clinical implications of these very interesting findings).</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful to reviewers for their valuable suggestions. We have revised the Discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) In the Discussion, two interesting results of inhibitors used are mentioned with 'data not shown'. Why are these data not included in the manuscript? This would add some interesting pathway information to the story. It is preferable not to mention unpublished data, if at all possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We eliminated the statement regarding dual IRAK1/4 and RIP2 inhibitor. We previously reported the importance of p38 activation in sarcoidosis. Similarly, we and other groups have shown that p38 inhibitor decreases the level of HIF-1α. We felt we should connect this result with our previous finding, but we did not see any novelty to provide the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The rebuttal to our major criticism 1 deserves a little more discussion. The rebuttal is quite OK but too little of it reached the revised manuscript. So please also incorporate the discrepancies with the Piotrowski paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the discussion about these two manuscripts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The figure presented in the rebuttal to our criticism #6 merits to be added as a supplementary figure with a short(er) description of the case in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the liver biopsy result in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, with description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The rebuttal under criticism #9 should also be reflected in the revision.</p></disp-quote><p>This is added in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Give the full reference for the Avril paper.</p></disp-quote><p>It is now provided.</p></body></sub-article></article>
