However, molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying female sexual behavior is not well understood. Here, we identify the Cholecystokinin-like peptide Drosulfakinin (DSK) to promote female sexual behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Loss of DSK function reduces female receptivity while overexpressing DSK enhances female receptivity. We identify two pairs of <italic>Dsk</italic>-expressing neurons in the central brain to promote female receptivity. We find that the DSK peptide acts through one of its receptors, CCKLR-17D3, to modulate female receptivity. Manipulation of CCKLR-17D3 and its expressing neurons alters female receptivity. We further reveal that the two pairs of <italic>Dsk</italic>-expressing neurons receive input signal from pC1 neurons that integrate sex-related cues and mating status. These results demonstrate how a neuropeptide pathway interacts with a central neural node in the female sex circuitry to modulate sexual receptivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sexual behavior</kwd><kwd>Drosulfakinin</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Y711241133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Chuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Y929731103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Chuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (DSK) functions in a subset of DSK neurons to interact with neural nodes in the sex circuit and acts through its receptor CCKLR-17D3 to control female sexual behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Upon encountering a suitable courtship object, <italic>Drosophila</italic> males display a series of stereotypic courtship rituals, such as following the target, tapping, producing courtship song by extending a wing and vibrating it, licking, and attempting copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>). Yet, it is the female who decides whether to accept or reject the male based on her assessment of male courtship quality and her own readiness to mate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickson, 2008</xref>). Once the female is willing to accept a courting male, she would slow down and open her vaginal plate to allow copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferveur, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenspan and Ferveur, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall, 1994</xref>). Conversely, the female rejects the male by extruding her ovipositor or flying away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook and Connolly, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickson, 2008</xref>). Males and females play different roles in the sex life and take on different contribution in reproductive success. It is essential to understand and identify genetic and neural circuits that modulate innate sexual behavior. For male courtship, a number of genes controlling male courtship have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billeter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emmons and Lipton, 2003</xref>) and corresponding neural circuits have been dissected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broughton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demir and Dickson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pan and Baker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ryner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), whereas molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying female sexual behavior are less clear.</p><p>In recent years, genetic studies have shown that several genes play critical roles in regulating female sexual behavior. For example, mutant females of <italic>icebox</italic> and <italic>chaste</italic> show lower mating success rates while mutant females of <italic>pain</italic> show higher mating success rates than wild-type females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carhan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juni and Yamamoto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sakai et al., 2009</xref>), and mutant females of <italic>spinster</italic> show enhanced rejection behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, specific subsets of neurons in the brain and ventral nerve cord are found to be involved in female sexual behavior. A significant decline of female sexual receptivity is observed when silencing specific neuron clusters in the central brain, such as two subsets of <italic>doublesex</italic>-expressing neurons (pCd and pC1) and two interneuron clusters (Spin-A and Spin-D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakurai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Female-specific vpoDNs in the brain integrate mating status and courtship song to control vaginal plate opening and female receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Silencing either Abd-B neurons or SAG neurons located in the abdominal ganglion reduces female sexual receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bussell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, female sexual behavior is also modulated by monoamines. In particular, dopamine not only plays a key role in regulating female sexual receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neckameyer, 1998</xref>), but also controls behavioral switching from rejection to acceptance in virgin females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishimoto and Kamikouchi, 2020</xref>); and octopamine is pivotal to female sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rezával et al., 2014</xref>). Neuropeptides including SIFamide and Mip are involved in female sexual receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Terhzaz et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, we know very little on how neuropeptides and peptidergic neurons control female sexual receptivity.</p><p>Drosulfakinin (DSK) is a neuropeptide, which is ortholog of Cholecystokinin (CCK) in mammals, and its two receptors (CCKLR-17D1 and CCKLR-17D3) have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Ganetzky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubiak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nichols et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Staljanssens et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies have revealed that DSK peptide is involved in multifarious regulatory functions including satiety/food ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nässel and Williams, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Söderberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams et al., 2014b</xref>), male courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Williams et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether DSK peptide and DSK neurons are crucial for female sexual behavior is not clear.</p><p>In this study, we find that DSK mutant females show reduced receptivity, and overexpression of DSK enhances female receptivity. We further show that DSK is crucial in two pairs of DSK neurons that function downstream of core sex-promoting neurons and upstream of CCKLR-17D3 neurons to modulate female sexual behavior. Our results reveal how the neuropeptide DSK functions in a subset of DSK neurons to interact with neural nodes in the sex circuity and acts through its receptor CCKLR-17D3 to control female sexual behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neuropeptide DSK is crucial for virgin female receptivity</title><p>We previously found that neuropeptide DSK regulates intermale aggression in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). To investigate the potential function of DSK in modulating female behaviors, we first monitored the change of virgin female receptivity in <italic>Dsk</italic> mutant (∆<italic>Dsk</italic>), which was generated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, the 5’-UTR and coding region were deleted by the CRISPR-Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which was validated by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). No anti-DSK signal was detected in ∆<italic>Dsk</italic> female brains, whereas four pairs of neurons were detected in wide-type and ∆<italic>Dsk/+</italic> female brains by immunostaining with anti-DSK antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which does not label the full set of DSK neurons as previously found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nichols and Lim, 1996</xref>).

Thus, the decreased receptivity in ∆<italic>Dsk</italic> females is not due to any change in male courtship efficiency, but rather a decline of willingness for copulation in these females.</p><p>As recently mated females may reduce receptivity and increase egg laying, we asked whether the decreased receptivity could be a post-mating response and correlate with elevated egg laying. To address this, we examined the number of eggs laid by virgin females with <italic>Dsk</italic> mutant or knockdown, and found that manipulation of <italic>Dsk</italic> did not enhance egg laying in these virgin females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>). To investigate whether DSK neurons respond to mating status, we measured the activity of these neurons using the transcriptional reporter of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (TRIC) in virgin and mated females. TRIC is designed to quantitatively monitor the change of neural activity by the reconstitution of a functional transcription factor in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2015</xref>).

At the molecular level, we revealed that DSK neuropeptide and its receptor CCKLR-17D3 are crucial for modulating female sexual receptivity. At the neuronal circuit level, we identified that DSK neurons are the immediate downstream targets of sex-promoting pC1 neurons in controlling female sexual receptivity. Moreover, we employed intersectional tools to subdivide DSK neurons into medial DSK neurons (DSK-MP1) and lateral DSK neurons (DSK-MP3) and uncovered that DSK-MP1 neurons rather than DSK-MP3 neurons play essential roles in modulating female receptivity. Collectively, our findings illuminate a pC1-DSK-MP1-CCKLR-17D3 pathway that modulates female sexual behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The female sexual behavior is a complex innate behavior. The decision for the female to accept a courting male or not depends on not only sensory stimulation but also internal states. If the female is willing to mate, she slows down, pauses, and opens her vaginal plates to accept a courting male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bussell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laturney and Billeter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), if not, she extrudes her ovipositor to deter a courting male or flies away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook and Connolly, 1973</xref>). Our results show that DSK signaling is crucial for virgin female receptivity but has no effect on ovipositor extrusion behavior. How exactly does the DSK signaling regulate virgin female receptivity is still not clear. One possibility is that DSK signaling regulates pausing behavior in response to male courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bussell et al., 2014</xref>), as DSK receptor CCKLR-17D3 expresses in the central complex that has been found to be crucial for locomotor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strauss, 2002</xref>). However, we did not observe any change in locomotor activity in DSK or CCKLR-17D3 mutant females. Note that we only assayed locomotor behavior in single females but not in females paired with courting males due to technical limit for analysis, and it is possible that the DSK signaling does not affect general locomotor behavior but regulates courtship-stimulated pausing behavior.</p><p>The four pairs of DSK neurons are classified into two types (DSK-MP1 and DSK-MP3) based on the location of the cell bodies, and DSK-MP1 neurons extend descending fibers to ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we also found that activating DSK-MP1 neurons enhance female receptivity whereas inactivating DSK-MP1 neurons reduce female receptivity. Silencing adult Abd-B neurons and SAG neurons located in the abdominal ganglion inhibits female sexual receptivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bussell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). It has been found that Abd-B neurons control female pausing behavior, and it would be interesting to further investigate whether DSK-MP1 neurons relay information from Abd-B neurons to regulate pausing and receptivity in females. We also note that DSK-MP1 neurons extend projections to suboesophageal ganglion (SOG), and the SOG is the terminus of ascending projections from a subset of female reproductive tract sensory neurons labeled by <italic>pickpocket (ppk), fruitless (fru),</italic> and <italic>doublesex (dsx</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Häsemeyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rezával et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). It is also possible that DSK-MP1 neurons may integrate information directly from these sensory neurons to regulate female receptivity. Another study further classified the DSK-MP1 neurons into two types (MP1a and MP1b) based on the morphology of their neuritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies would further build genetic tools to uncover the function of each subset of DSK neurons in regulating distinct innate behaviors, such as male courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), and female sexual behavior.</p><p>Previous studies have revealed that pC1 neurons extend projections to lateral protocerebral complex (LPC) and this neural cluster responds to courtship song and cVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, recent works have shown that DSK-MP1 neurons project to the region of LPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). We used GRASP, trans-Tango, and patch-clamp techniques and revealed that DSK-MP1 neurons are direct downstream target of <italic>R71G01-GAL4</italic> neurons that include pC1. EM reconstruction revealed that pC1 neurons have intense synaptic input on MP1b but not MP1a neurons, suggesting a crucial role of the single pair of MP1b neurons in female receptivity. Based on these findings, we propose that: (1) pC1 neurons act as a central node for female sexual receptivity by integrating sex-related sensory cues (courtship song and cVA) and mating status; and (2) DSK-MP1 neurons may integrate internal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2019</xref>) and pC1-encoded information to modulate female sexual behavior. Thus, it is of prime importance to further investigate how a neuropeptide pathway modulate a core neural node in the sex circuitry to fine-tune the female’s willingness for sexual behavior in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse anti- a-bruchpilot monoclonal (nc82)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# nc82, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2314866">AB_2314866</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:50)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rat monoclonal anti-HA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 11867431001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_390919">AB_390919</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP-20</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# G6539, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_259941">AB_259941</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chicken polyclonal anti-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# A10262, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2534023">AB_2534023</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Goat anti-chicken polyclonal, Alexa Fluor 488</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# A-11039;

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sonia Sen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Related to the writing:</p><p>- Introduction: We would like the authors to cover the appropriate literature (and references) related to (1) Dsk, (2) courtship ritual and its relevance to mate selection, and (3) female receptivity and a description of behaviours that constitute it.</p><p>- Results: We're recommending that the authors motivate each result section with (1) a rationale for the experiments done in that section, (2) a description of the experimental set-up, and (3) elaborate on the description and interpretation of the results for that section.</p><p>2. Statistics: We're concerned about the statistics used. For example, a non-parametric test (Χ2) has been used to analyze latency to copulation (measured in minutes). We're requesting that the authors elaborate on the statistics used in each of the results, and mention them in the legends. Specific points related to the statistics are in the detailed reviews below, but are also listed here:</p><p>- Copulation rate and latency to copulation should be presented as different data sets and statistically analyzed independently.</p><p>- The y scale of the same type of graphs should be the same across figures. The scale is truncated in many graphs showing latency to copulation. This should be fixed.</p><p>- The authors should state which experimental groups are compared in each figure. When more than two genotypes are plotted, multiple comparison tests should be applied (e.g., see Figure 2D, latency to copulation; Figure 5D 5F, latency to copulation; Figure 6E, latency to copulation). All comparisons should be reported, either in each graph or in a supp. table.</p><p>- In some figure legends the authors state 'Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests or post-hoc Student's T-test'. For example, in Figure 1-suppl 3. The authors should clearly indicate which test is used to analyze each data set.</p><p>- What's the rationale for using a post-hoc Student's T-test in Figure 1-suppl 2? A Conover post hoc test might be more appropriate.</p><p>3. Related to the Dsk and receptor tools used.</p><p>- We would like the authors to show the expression pattern of the Dsk lines used:</p><p>- Expression pattern of the whole Gal4 in the VNC and to comment on its expression in non-neuronal tissues.</p><p>- Expression pattern of the split lines for the Dsk-m and Dsk-l clusters.</p><p>- Verify the RNAi lines used.</p><p>- Expression pattern of the receptor-line used (CCKLR-17D3GAL4).</p><p>4. In some places, it's ambiguous what tools were generated in this study vs their older paper. Can the authors please state this unambiguously for all tools and reagents used in this manuscript?</p><p>5. We're recommending that the authors comment on what aspects of the female sexual behaviour is altered in these manipulations? We presume they have videos that they can examine for this.</p><p>6. Could the authors clarify which tracking tools were used for locomotor assessment?

If they have, it would be nice to include it here.

Could the authors please revisit this section and elaborate (to the extent relevant to this manuscript) on the Dsk literature, male courtship and sexual receptivity in females?</p><p>- Writing in the Results section:</p><p>- As the authors present their data, it is sometimes unclear what the motivation behind the experiment was. For example, why did they look at egg-laying behaviour (line 96), or TRIC (line 97) (do please also elaborate on what TRIC is). Could the authors please pay attention to this?</p><p>- I'd urge the authors to briefly explain the set up of each experiment where the relevant data is being presented. This helps the reader tune into the experiment and its interpretation without having to go to the methods section.</p><p>- The circuit related experiments: The authors show evidence for 71G01-neurons &gt; Dsk-m-neurons &gt; CCKLR-17D3 receptor expressing neurons (not identified). I would have liked to have seen a more refined analysis of circuity within these domains. So, I had a few comments/questions regarding this section:</p><p>- 71G01-neurons: This line has been used extensively in literature – including by the authors – to access the P1 neurons in males. I believe it also labels the pC1 neurons in females. Are the authors suggesting that the pC1 neurons are the upstream neurons to Dsk-m? This would be interesting.</p><p>- The CCKLR-17D3-neurons: I believe the authors have a knock-in Gal4 of this receptor that is not too busy. I would be keen to know if any one of these neurons are downstream of the Dsk neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Experimental procedures should include details about the methods and genetic tools used in the manuscript e.g., origin of Dsk-GAL4 and Dsk antibodies.</p><p>Please provide the expression pattern on the Dsk-Gal4 used in CNS. Does it cover the π region? If not, the experiments involving dissection of Dsk function should be repeated using an additional Dsk-GAL4 driver that includes the Dsk neurons from IPC (Figure 1, &amp; 2), this would be required to strengthen the manuscript about involvement of Dsk neurons (not a subset) in female receptivity.</p><p>Please mention in the main text that Dsk antibodies used in Figure 1D do not label the full set of Dsk neurons. Please also cite earlier literature that shows these neurons are covered by Dsk antibodies.</p><p>What are various UAS-Dsk and Dsk deletion lines mentioned in Figure 1 E-J?</p><p>For experiments involving dTRPA1, higher temperature might affect female behavior. Authors may consider using various optogenetic tools to dissect these behaviors in future. A detailed video analysis of various genotypes should be done to show that locomotion is normal, and describe other sexual behaviors beside copulation rate and latency, please also include this source data.</p><p>Genetic background has a significant impact on behavior and it's not clear if outcrossing was performed in the same genetic background for various fly stocks used in the manuscript? If not, outcrossing should be performed for at least 5-7 generations for behavioral experiments in Figure 1-2, to rule out effects of genotype.</p><p>Figure 1 Supplement 1, provide details for the Dsk-RNAi used and what is the effect without using dicer 2 as it can lead to off targets? What is the phenotype when the RNAi is driven by an appropriate Dsk-GAL4?</p><p>Was the locomotion analysis done in the presence of males (Figure 1, Supplement 2 &amp; Figure 6, Supplement 3)? While the discussion mentions use of Ctrax for locomotion tracking, it is not mentioned anywhere in the main text of experimental procedures. Also, Ctrax lacks the ability to faithfully maintain the identity of two or more flies in an arena. It would be better to use another tracking tool for two fly assays and <italic>Drosophila</italic> activity monitors for single fly locomotion assays.</p><p>Figure 1, Supplement 4, please include source data for TRIC experiments.</p><p>GRASP data (Figure3, Supplement 2) is weak and does not show much overlap between Dsk and R70G01GAL4 when compared to trans Tango experiments. These experiments should be either repeated or the caveat should be mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p>Figure 5E- the curve is really skewed towards the bottom as compared to other genotypes, are these controls healthy? It might be better to repeat this experiment/ provide video analysis.</p><p>There are several grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions throughout the manuscript, please correct this. Some examples are below-</p><p>Introduction section needs substantial re-writing and the study needs to be properly placed in the broader context of the field, see my comments above for appropriate citations, below are a few suggestions but this is not an exhaustive list.</p><p>Line 48-50, Spinster mutants actively reject males, and it is not a case of 'lower mating success rate' as females are rejecting males.</p><p>Line 71-72, [missing citation] including satiety/food ingestion- cite Soderberg et al., 2012.</p><p>Line 72-73, [missing citation] aggression- cite Williams et al., Genetics 2014 and Agrawal et al., JEB 2020.</p><p>Wu et al., Nature Communications 2019 have extensively characterized role of Dsk in male courtship and sexual drive and this work is not cited properly.</p><p>Line 104, correct Figure 2I to Figure 1I and line 108, instead of Figure 2J correct to 1J.</p><p>Line 132 introduces R71G01-GAL4 neurons awkwardly and it seems to come out of nowhere.

This is redundant and should be shown only once and referred to throughout the manuscript as required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I believe the science and its presentation could be strengthened by addressing the points below:</p><p>Science.</p><p>1. It is not clear whether the authors have used proper statistical tests. The same flies are monitored over time for copulation rate, which should be considered in the statistical analysis.</p><p>2. Why have the authors applied a non-parametric test (Χ2) for analyzing latency to copulation (measured in minutes)?</p><p>3. Copulation rate and latency to copulation should be presented as different data sets and statistically analyzed independently.</p><p>4. The y scale of the same type of graphs should be the same across figures.</p><p>5. The scale is truncated in many graphs showing latency to copulation. This should be fixed.</p><p>6. The authors should state which experimental groups are compared in each figure. When more than two genotypes are plotted, multiple comparison tests should be applied (e.g., see Figure 2D, latency to copulation; Figure 5D 5F, latency to copulation; Figure 6E, latency to copulation). All comparisons should be reported, either in each graph or in a supp. table.</p><p>7. In some figure legends the authors state 'Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests or post-hoc Student's T-test'. For example, in Figure 1-suppl 3. The authors should clearly indicate which test is used to analyze each data set.</p><p>8. What's the rationale for using a post-hoc Student's T-test in Figure 1-suppl 2? A Conover post hoc test might be more appropriate.</p><p>9. The data strongly support a role for DSK and DSK neurons control female sexual receptivity. However, it is unclear whether DSK neurons in the VNC contribute to the observed phenotypes. An experiment addressing this point would further support the findings of the study.</p><p>10. Figure 1 A—figure supplement 4. None of the control virgin females have laid any unfertilized eggs across 3 days, which is unexpected.</p><p>11. Figure 1B-suppl 4. More details should be added in the graph and legend to understand the TRIC data.</p><p>12. Do the authors have data showing which aspects of female sexual behavior are regulated by the DSK signaling? For example, does activation of DSK neurons induce any female acceptance behaviors (e.g., partial ovipositor extrusion)? Perhaps DSK neurons trigger motor outputs associated with sexual receptivity? If DSK neurons acted downstream of pC1 neurons, we would expect them to induce vaginal plate opening. These possibilities should be experimentally addressed or discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>13. I believe more information about the expression pattern of Dsk in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues would help better understand the findings. Details of the number of DSK neurons, different brain clusters, as well as projection patterns, would help the authors to put their findings in context. The authors should add confocal images showing the expression pattern of Dsk neurons in VNC.</p><p>A better description of the expression pattern of Dsk would improve the narrative and help the authors better explain (1) the anatomical and functional experiments linking DSK neurons with 71G01-Gal4 neurons (2) the identification of subsets of DSK clusters key for sexual receptivity (3) the importance of manipulating DSK and Dsk-expressing cells solely in the nervous system.</p><p>14. <italic>Dsx</italic>-expressing neurons have a prominent role in controlling female sexual receptivity. Is there any indication that DSK neurons and <italic>Dsx</italic> neurons fully/partially overlap?</p><p>15. I believe Table 1 is missing in the manuscript.</p><p>16. Some genetic controls are missing in several figures. For instance, in Figure 2, elav-GAL4/+ is missing.</p><p>17. The authors should clarify that the GRASP experiments don't provide information about the direction of connectivity.</p><p>18. The authors should add images showing the pattern of DSK neurons targeted with genetic intersections using GluRIA-Gal4 and TbH-Gal4 with DSK-FLP in the VNC.</p><p>Presentation:</p><p>I believe a substantial improvement in the writing style would help readers fully judge and appreciate the findings of this interesting study.</p><p>1. In my opinion, the opening paragraph of Introduction is not engaging. Overall, I think the authors could strengthen the Introduction by adding information about the courtship ritual in flies and explaining its relevance for mate selection. Moreover, they could describe how female flies signal sexual receptivity and accept a male for copulation. This would help them highlight the importance of their work and make it more attractive for non-specialist readers.</p><p>2. My impression is that the Results section reads like a long list of results, which are not connected to tell an interesting story. The rationale of many of the experiments are either presented in the Discussion section or not discussed at all. The authors could speculate how DSK neurons/ DSK might work to regulate sexual receptivity to introduce subsequent experiments in the main text. A better description of the results and their potential implications would help the narrative of the study (more details below).</p><p>3. One of the strengths of this study is the arsenal of modern tools used to support the findings. However, many of the methods are not described in the main text. More information would help readers to fully grasp the approaches and findings of this study.</p><p>4. The Discussion section superficially discusses the findings of the study. It rather reads like a recapitulation of the results. The authors could enrich the discussion by speculating how DSK neurons might control female sexual receptivity. Could pC1 neurons (targeted by 71G01-Gal4?) act as a central node for female sexual receptivity, conveying female mating decisions to Dsk neurons? Alternatively, could DSK neurons also integrate sensory information relevant to sexual behavior? Are there any sensory pathways relevant to female sexual receptivity feeding into DSK neurons? What are the potential downstream targets of DSK? What aspects of female sexual behavior are regulated by the DSK pathway? Do females show increased vaginal plate/ partial ovipositor extrusion? How do DSK neurons differ between males and females, and how do these differences may result in different sex-specific behaviors?</p><p>5. The schematic in Figure 4 A is not clear.</p><p>6. Figure 4. A bigger schematic of the brain depicting the different DSK clusters would help understand which neurons are assessed.</p><p>7. The authors should make the figures accessible to readers with color-blindness.</p><p>8. I suggest the authors proofread the manuscript, as there are typos, grammatical mistakes and unclear sentences throughout the manuscript. Some examples:</p><p>Line 46 – 'is' should be changed to 'are'.</p><p>Line 87 – This sentence contains grammatical mistakes.</p><p>Line 93 – RNAi-mediated females: this should be better defined.</p><p>Line 109 – 'Indicated' should be changed to 'indicate'.</p><p>Line 104 – Figure is wrongly cited. It should be Figure 1I.</p><p>Line 112 – 'were' should be changed to 'are'.</p><p>Line 132 – 'expressed' should be changed to 'are present'.</p><p>Line 134 -Fix this sentence 'Given that, we hypothesized whether DSK'.</p><p>Line 139 – Change 'recombinant' to 'reconstituted'.</p><p>Line 157 -The sentence does not make sense.</p><p>Line 169 – Unclear sentence.</p><p>Line 188 – It should be-'wanted' not 'want'.</p><p>Line 270 – The sentence should be rewritten: In this study, DSK neurons also modulate female sexual behavior.</p><p>Line 488 – Fix this sentence 'RCR analysis from genomic DNA samples'</p><p>Line 502 – Fix this sentence: 'And there are same numbers in two parameters'.</p><p>'Latency' should be described as' latency to copulation'.</p><p>Figure 1.Suppl 5 – fix the typo in the title.</p><p>The authors should better articulate the rationale of the experiments and explain the techniques so readers can better appreciate the findings. For example:</p><p>Line 86 – 'behavior, we first constructed knock out line for Dsk'. Describe how the knock out line for DsK was made.</p><p>Line 94 – Explain the rationale for looking at male courtship behavior.</p><p>Line 96 – Explain the rationale for looking at egg laying.</p><p>Line 97 – Explain the rationale of looking at TRIC signal changes. The authors should also explain how this technique works and provide more details on the findings.</p><p>The authors should clearly define if any of the tools used in this study were previously generated.</p><p>Line 102 – Define the DsK Gal4 used in Figure 1I. Is it the same line used in subsequent Figures?</p><p>Line 109 – The conclusion should also state that the evidence points to a role of DSK neurons in female sexual receptivity.</p><p>Line 119 – Explain what's the rationale for looking at very young females. State their age and differences with previous virgin females tested in other experiments.</p><p>Line 133 – More information about 71G01-Gal4, and the fact that it might intersect pC1 neurons, would help explain the rationale behind testing these neurons.</p><p>Line 157 – Here it is important to explain how many DSK neurons are present in the brain, and how they are distributed in different clusters (by including images of the nervous system).</p><p>Line 175 – The authors identify two Gal4 lines (GluRIAGAL4 and TβHGAL4) that help them intersect different DSK neurons but these lines are not described. The authors should explain what neurons are targeted by these drivers (e.g., glutamatergic, octopaminergic, etc). This information could be useful to interpret and discuss their findings (e.g., relevant DSK neurons might be excitatory).</p><p>Line 164 – Explain how the P2X2 optogenetic approach works.</p><p>Line 191 – 'We constructed knock out lines for these two receptors (Figure 6A-C) (Wu et al., 2020)'. Clearly state if these are novel tools created for this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76025.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, we found that manipulating <italic>Dsk</italic> gene did not affect ovipositor extrusion (please see Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Similarly, we also analyzed whether activating DSK neurons would affect ovipositor extrusion in females with courting males. We found that manipulation of DSK neurons did not affect ovipositor extrusion (please see Figure 2—figure supplement 1).

Although we could not obtain another Dsk-Gal4 that may target the IPCs, we used the Dilp2-GAL4 that specifically labels at least some Dsk-expressing IPCs. We found that restricting the expression of DskRNAi in IPC neurons using the Dilp2-GAL4 does not affect female sexual behavior (please see Figure 1—figure supplement 3G). These results indicate that Dsk peptide released from IPCs is not involved in regulating female sexual behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, if the authors have already investigated the requirement of the CCKLR-17D3GAL4 neurons in sexual receptivity behaviour it would be nice to include in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion.

Could the authors please revisit this section and elaborate (to the extent relevant to this manuscript) on the Dsk literature, male courtship and sexual receptivity in females?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In this new version, we carefully rewrote the introduction by adding relevant information to make it more concisely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Writing in the Results section:</p><p>- As the authors present their data, it is sometimes unclear what the motivation behind the experiment was. For example, why did they look at egg-laying behaviour (line 96), or TRIC (line 97) (do please also elaborate on what TRIC is). Could the authors please pay attention to this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. We have carefully fixed the description by adding the motivation behind every experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I'd urge the authors to briefly explain the set up of each experiment where the relevant data is being presented. This helps the reader tune into the experiment and its interpretation without having to go to the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have briefly explained the set-up of each experiment in the figure legends. For example, for the set-up in Figure 6A: “(A) Left: ATP stimulation and recording arrangement. The chemical stimulation is implemented using a three-barrel tube (with the tip positioned ~50μm away from the brain), controlled by a stepper for rapid solution change. Right: schematic illustrating the activation of <italic>R71G01GAL4</italic> neurons by ATP and patch-camp recording of DSK neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The circuit related experiments: The authors show evidence for 71G01-neurons &gt; Dsk-m-neurons &gt; CCKLR-17D3 receptor expressing neurons (not identified). I would have liked to have seen a more refined analysis of circuity within these domains. So, I had a few comments/questions regarding this section:</p><p>- 71G01-neurons: This line has been used extensively in literature – including by the authors – to access the P1 neurons in males. I believe it also labels the pC1 neurons in females. Are the authors suggesting that the pC1 neurons are the upstream neurons to Dsk-m? This would be interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have revised the text more clearly. In the revised manuscript, we stated that R71G01-GAL4 labels the pC1 neurons as well as many other neurons in females, and speculate that there is a functional connection between pC1 neurons and DSK-MP1 neurons. In order to further confirm this speculation, we now requested two splitGAL4 driver lines that specifically label pC1 neurons, pC1-ss1 and pC1-ss2 (Wang et al., 2021, Nature) from Dr. Kaiyu Wang who recently set up a lab in Shanghai. Indeed, we found that pC1 neuron axons overlapped with DSK neuron dendrites by anatomical registration (please see Figure 5—figure supplement 4). Furthermore, we utilized the recently generated full adult female brain (FAFB) electron microscopic (EM) image set and found that pC1 neurons have intense synaptic input on DSK-MP1 neurons, especially the single pair of DSK-MP1b neurons (Table S2). We revised our text accordingly and further discussed this possibility in the discussion session of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The CCKLR-17D3-neurons: I believe the authors have a knock-in Gal4 of this receptor that is not too busy. I would be keen to know if any one of these neurons are downstream of the Dsk neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have a knock-in GAL4 of CCKLR-17D3 and we also showed the expression pattern (please see Figure4—figure supplement4A). It is well known that <italic>dsx</italic> broadly expresses in female brain and plays a key role in regulating female sexual behavior. Thus, we asked whether <italic>CCKLR-17D3<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> drives expression in <italic>dsx</italic> neurons to regulate female receptivity. However, intersection between <italic>CCKLR-17D3<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> and <italic>dsx<sup>LexA</sup></italic> only labeled projections from peripheral sensory neurons that innervate the SOG region (please see Figure 4—figure supplement 4B). Furthermore, either overexpressing or knocking down CCKLR-17D3 in all <italic>dsx</italic> neurons did not alter virgin female receptivity (please see Figure 4—figure supplement 4C-D). These results indicate that CCKLR-17D3 did not function in <italic>dsx</italic> neurons to regulate female sexual behavior. In the future, we need to generate <italic>CCKLR-17D3-Flp</italic> line to further subdivide CCKLR-17D3 neurons using intersectional technology and investigate which neuron clusters are responsible for female sexual behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Experimental procedures should include details about the methods and genetic tools used in the manuscript e.g., origin of Dsk-GAL4 and Dsk antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, most lines used in this study were the same with those used in our previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper (Wu et al., 2020).

It rather reads like a recapitulation of the results. The authors could enrich the discussion by speculating how DSK neurons might control female sexual receptivity. Could pC1 neurons (targeted by 71G01-Gal4?) act as a central node for female sexual receptivity, conveying female mating decisions to Dsk neurons? Alternatively, could DSK neurons also integrate sensory information relevant to sexual behavior? Are there any sensory pathways relevant to female sexual receptivity feeding into DSK neurons? What are the potential downstream targets of DSK? What aspects of female sexual behavior are regulated by the DSK pathway? Do females show increased vaginal plate/ partial ovipositor extrusion? How do DSK neurons differ between males and females, and how do these differences may result in different sex-specific behaviors?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these valuable suggestions.

In brief, the 5’-UTR and coding region were deleted by the CRISPR-Cas9 system”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 94 – Explain the rationale for looking at male courtship behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this part as following: “To investigate whether reduced copulation rate in ∆<italic>Dsk</italic> females is due to potential abatement of female sexual appeal, we examined courtship levels in wild-type males paired with ∆<italic>Dsk</italic> or control females and observed similarly high levels of courtship in all cases …”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 96 – Explain the rationale for looking at egg laying.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this part as following: “As recently mated females may reduce receptivity and increase egg-laying, we asked whether the decreased receptivity could be a post-mating response and correlate with elevated egg-laying. To address this, we examined the number of eggs laid by virgin females with <italic>Dsk</italic> mutant or knockdown….”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 97 – Explain the rationale of looking at TRIC signal changes. The authors should also explain how this technique works and provide more details on the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this part as following: “To investigate whether DSK neurons respond to mating status, we measured the activity of these neurons using the transcriptional reporter of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (TRIC) in virgin and mated females. TRIC is designed to quantitatively monitor the change of neural activity by the reconstituted of a functional transcription factor in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Gao et al., 2015). As above mentioned, four pairs of neurons were labeled by <italic>Dsk<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> driving the expression of <italic>UAS-mCD8::GFP</italic> (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</italic>). However, we only observed TRIC signals in four neurons in the middle area of female brains (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 6B,C</italic>). Quantification of these TRIC signals showed no significant difference in virgin and mated females (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 6D</italic>). These results further indicate that DSK neurons do not respond to mating status.”. we also provided more details in the corresponding figures and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should clearly define if any of the tools used in this study were previously generated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Indeed, a few reagents were generated in our previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper (Wu et al., 2020). In the revised manuscript, we clearly indicated whether the genetic reagent was generated in this study or a previous study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 102 – Define the DsK Gal4 used in Figure 1I. Is it the same line used in subsequent Figures?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the Dsk-GAL4 line used in Figure 1I is the same as the line used in the subsequent Figures. And we changed the text in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 109 – The conclusion should also state that the evidence points to a role of DSK neurons in female sexual receptivity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have rewritten the sentence “Taken together, these results indicated the function of <italic>Dsk</italic> is crucial for female sexual receptivity, which also suggested DSK neurons play a role in female sexual receptivity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 119 – Explain what's the rationale for looking at very young females. State their age and differences with previous virgin females tested in other experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this part as following: “Female receptivity depends on the female’s sexual maturity and mating status. Very young virgins display low receptivity level to courting males and mated females become temporarily unreceptive to courting males (Dickson, 2008; Rezaval et al., 2012). We tested whether activation of DSK neurons could also promote female sexual receptivity in very young virgins or mated females…”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 133 – More information about 71G01-Gal4, and the fact that it might intersect pC1 neurons, would help explain the rationale behind testing these neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have re-stated this part as suggested. “In males, <italic>R71G01-GAL4</italic> drives the expression of P1 neurons that interact with DSK neurons to regulate male courtship (Wu et al., 2019) and aggression (Wu et al., 2020). Previous studies employed the intersection of <italic>R71G01-LexA</italic> with <italic>dsx<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> to specifically label and manipulate pC1 neurons, which integrate male courtship and pheromone cues to promote virgin female receptivity (Zhou et al., 2014). We found that activation of <italic>R71G01-GAL4</italic> neurons consisting of pC1 and a few other neurons promoted female receptivity (<italic>Figure 5—figure supplement 1</italic>), similarly as previously activating pC1 neurons using the intersectional strategy (Zhou et al., 2014)…”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 157 – Here it is important to explain how many DSK neurons are present in the brain, and how they are distributed in different clusters (by including images of the nervous system).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and we have added this information as suggested in the revised manuscript as following: “Analyses of the expression pattern of <italic>Dsk<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> revealed that four pairs of neurons were specifically labeled in the brain, which were classified into two types (two pairs of MP1 and two pairs of MP3) based on the location of cell bodies (Nichols and Lim, 1996) (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</italic>), and the two pairs of MP1 neurons were further classified into MP1a and MP1b based on the single cell morphology of these neurons (Wu et al., 2019)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 175 – The authors identify two Gal4 lines (GluRIAGAL4 and TβHGAL4) that help them intersect different DSK neurons but these lines are not described. The authors should explain what neurons are targeted by these drivers (e.g., glutamatergic, octopaminergic, etc). This information could be useful to interpret and discuss their findings (e.g., relevant DSK neurons might be excitatory).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have made textual changes as following: “Interestingly, we found that intersection of GluRIA<sup>GAL4</sup>, which targets Glutamate receptor IA (GluRIA) cells, with DskFlp specifically labeled DSK-MP1 neurons (Figure 3A), while intersection of TβH<sup>GAL4</sup>, which targets octopaminergic neurons, with DskFlp specifically labeled DSK-MP3 neurons (Figure 3B)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 164 – Explain how the P2X2 optogenetic approach works.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that this is a misunderstanding for our electrophysiological recording experiments and may be due to unclear schematics. Indeed, we activated R71G01-GAL4 neurons through ATP activation of ATP-gated P2X<sub>2</sub> channel and recorded the electrical responses in DSK-MP1 neurons and DSK-MP3 neurons. In addition, we have re-organized our schematics and added explanation in the figure legend in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 191 – 'We constructed knock out lines for these two receptors (Figure 6A-C) (Wu et al., 2020)'.
