<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3) plays an important role in various physiological and pathological bioprocesses. However, the role of m<sup>6</sup>A in heart regeneration remains largely unclear. To study m<sup>6</sup>A function in heart regeneration, we modulated Mettl3 expression in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of <italic>Mettl3</italic> significantly increased the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and accelerated heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice. However, <italic>Mettl3</italic> overexpression decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and suppressed heart regeneration in postnatal mice. Conjoint analysis of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA-seq identified <italic>Fgf16</italic> as a downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification during postnatal heart regeneration. RIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays revealed that Mettl3 negatively regulates <italic>Fgf16</italic> mRNA expression in an m<sup>6</sup>A-Ythdf2-dependent manner. The silencing of <italic>Fgf16</italic> suppressed the proliferation of cardiomyocytes. However, the overexpression of ΔFgf16, in which the m<sup>6</sup>A consensus sequence was mutated, significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice compared with wild-type Fgf16. Our data demonstrate that Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces <italic>Fgf16</italic> mRNA levels through an m<sup>6</sup>A-Ythdf2-dependen pathway, thereby controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases are one of the world’s biggest killers. Even for patients who survive a heart attack, recovery can be difficult. This is because – unlike some amphibians and fish – humans lack the ability to produce enough new heart muscle cells to replace damaged tissue after a heart injury. In other words, the human heart cannot repair itself.</p><p>Molecules known as messenger RNA (mRNA) carry the ‘instructions’ from the DNA inside the cell nucleus to its protein-making machinery in the cytoplasm of the cell. These messenger molecules can also be altered by different enzymes that attach or remove chemical groups. These modifications can change the stability of the mRNA, or even ‘silence’ it altogether by stopping it from interacting with the protein-making machinery, thus halting production of the protein it encodes.</p><p>For example, a protein called Mettl3 can attach a methyl group to a specific part of the mRNA, causing a reversible mRNA modification known as m<sup>6</sup>A. This type of alteration has been shown to play a role in many conditions, including heart disease, but it has been unclear whether m<sup>6</sup>A could also be important for the regeneration of heart tissue.</p><p>To find out more, Jiang, Liu, Chen et al. studied heart injury in mice of various ages. Newborn mice can regenerate their heart muscle for a short time, but adult mice lack this ability, which makes them a useful model to study heart disease.</p><p>Analyses of the proteins and mRNAs in mouse heart cells confirmed that both Mettl3 and m<sup>6</sup>A-modified mRNAs were present. The amount of each also increased with age. Next, experiments in genetically manipulated mice revealed that removing Mettl3 greatly improved tissue repair after heart injury in both newborn and adult mice. In contrast, mouse hearts that produced abnormally high quantities of Mettl3 were unable to regenerate – even if the mice were young. Moreover, a detailed analysis of gene activity revealed that Mettl3 was suppressing heart regeneration by decreasing the production of a growth-promoting protein called FGF16.</p><p>These results reveal a key biological mechanism controlling the heart’s ability to repair itself after injury. In the future, Jiang et al. hope that Mettl3 can be harnessed for new, effective therapies to promote heart regeneration in patients suffering from heart disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, due to the inability to regenerate the injured heart after myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narula et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bui et al., 2011</xref>). Although various strategies including cell-based and cell free therapies are being explored to promote heart regeneration in animal models and human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin and Pu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sahara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biressi et al., 2020</xref>), the efficacy of cardiac therapy and its clinical implications remain uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong et al., 2014</xref>). It has been demonstrated that complete cardiac regeneration occurs in neonatal mouse heart after ventricular resection at postnatal day 1 (p1), but this capacity is lost at p7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>). It has been believed that cardiac regeneration in neonatal mice is primarily mediated by cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Porrello et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahmoud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Porrello et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to explore the related signaling networks and underlying molecular mechanisms that are responsible for postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. Previously, many studies have focused on the signaling pathways contributing to the activation of proliferative factors that regulate gene expression in hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahmoud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Porrello et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). However, the potential roles of the post-transcriptional regulation of cardiac mRNAs in cardiac physiology and pathology are largely unknown. Previous studies have reported that mRNA abundance does not correlate with protein expression in failing hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brundel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Su et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, nuclear and cytosolic mRNA levels are not correlated in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Preissl et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, these reports suggest that epitranscriptomic regulation plays an important role in healthy and pathological hearts.</p><p>Although more than 150 distinct chemical marks have been identified on cellular RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boccaletto et al., 2018</xref>), the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3) has been the most prevalent and best-characterized mRNA modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that m<sup>6</sup>A plays an important role in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>), animal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frye et al., 2018</xref>), and human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paris et al., 2019</xref>). A number of studies have demonstrated that effectors of m<sup>6</sup>A pathways consist of ‘writers’, ‘erasers’, and ‘readers’ that respectively install, remove, and recognize methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). Growing evidence has revealed that m<sup>6</sup>A effectors in different biological systems are multifaced and tunable because their expression and cellular localization are cell type- and environmental stimuli-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the mechanisms by which m<sup>6</sup>A regulate gene expression are complex and context-dependent.</p><p>Despite m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA methylation has been recognized as a posttranscriptional modification in multiple organisms including plants, yeast, flies, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wei et al., 2018</xref>), the roles of this posttranscriptional process and functions of m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA methylation in cardiomyocyte proliferation and animal models of heart regeneration remain unknown. Here, we elucidate the landscape of m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA methylation during heart regeneration in neonatal mice and show that inhibition of the methylase Mettl3 promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration. We further demonstrate that posttranscriptional downregulation of Fgf16 by Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification via a YT521-B homology (YTH) domain family 2 (Ythdf2)-dependent pathway, inhibits heart regeneration in neonatal mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mettl3 expression and the m<sup>6</sup>A levels in mRNA are increased upon neonatal heart injury</title><p>It has been demonstrated that Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A is enhanced in response to hypertrophic stimulation and is necessary for a normal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorn et al., 2019</xref>), indicating the pivotal functions of Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A in cardiac homeostasis. These further prompt us to ask whether m<sup>6</sup>A modification influences heart regeneration in neonatal mice. To determine the expression patterns of m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases (Mettl3 and Mettl14) and demethylase (Alkbh5 and Fto), myocardium isolated from neonatal hearts at a series of time points was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. Among these four genes, Mettl3 expression significantly increased from postnatal day 3 (p3) to p14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In agreement with qPCR result, increased expression of Mettl3 in postnatal heart at p14 was also detected in protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To determine the cardiac mRNAs modified by m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in neonatal mice, m<sup>6</sup>A levels were measured by an ELISA-based quantification assay at p3, p7, and p14. Increased levels of m<sup>6</sup>A modification were detected at p14 compared with p3 and p7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting the lower levels of m<sup>6</sup>A modification within postnatal 7 days (the regenerative window). These results indicate the potential functional importance of the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of cardiac mRNAs for heart regeneration. To further determine the m<sup>6</sup>A modification in injured hearts, apical resection was performed at p3, followed by m<sup>6</sup>A level examination in sham and resected hearts at 5 days post-resection (dpr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, apex resection injury increased the level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification by 65% at 5 dpr compared with sham hearts. Moreover, the expression of <italic>Mettl3</italic> was approximately increased up to 2-fold at 5 dpr compared with sham hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Western blotting revealed that the expression of Mettl3 rather than Mettl14 was greatly increased at 5 dpr compared with sham hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>). In consistent with apical areas, our data showed that Mettl3 expression and m<sup>6</sup>A levels were also increased in remote areas at 5 dpr compared with control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further determine the m<sup>6</sup>A levels in different cardiac cell types, primary cardiomyocytes (CMs) and non-cardiomyocytes (nCMs) were isolated from neonatal heart at p1 according to the method previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), followed by RNA extraction and m<sup>6</sup>A level determination using colorimetric ELISA assay. Our data showed that the m<sup>6</sup>A level in CMs is higher than that in nCMs, indicating the functional importance of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To determine the response of Mettl3 expression in CMs and nCMs to injury, primary CMs and nCMs were isolated from sham and injured neonatal hearts at 5 dpr. Our data showed that Mettl3 expression was significantly increased in CMs rather than nCMs upon injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

To knock down the expression of Mettl3 in the heart of adult mice, 8-week-old mice were injected with AAV9-sh<italic>Mettl3</italic> and control viruses, respectively. Mice were then subjected to MI surgery 4 weeks after virus injection, followed by histological analysis and cardiac function analysis at 14 and 28 dpM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The persistent expression of AAV9-sh<italic>Mettl3</italic> in adult heart after virus injection for 4 weeks (equal to 0 dpM) was validated by the immunofluorescent staining for EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). At 14 dpM, HW/BW ratio and scar size were decreased by Mettl3 deficiency compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). In line with these results, the decreased HW/BW ratio and scar size were also observed in the Mettl3-deficient hearts compared with controls at 28 dpM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–H</xref>). These results suggest that Mettl3 deficiency might attenuate the cardiac remodeling during myocardium infarction. To further evaluate the effects of Mettl3 deficiency on cardiac function, mice were subjected to echocardiography analysis at 0 and 28 dpM, respectively. Our data showed that Mettl3 deficiency leads to a little increase in LVEF and LVFS levels at 0 dpM (prior to MI). However, increased levels of LVEF and LVFS were detected in Mettl3-deficient hearts at 28 dpM compared with control hearts, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–K</xref>).

Ki67 staining results showed that Mettl3 deficiency greatly increased the proliferation of cardiomyocytes in the border zone of infarction, as indicated by the increased percentage of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cTnT<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L and M</xref>).

MeRIP-seq revealed that the GGACU motif is highly enriched in m<sup>6</sup>A sites in both sham and apex-resected hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, m<sup>6</sup>A peaks are particularly abundant in the vicinity of stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, the m<sup>6</sup>A peak distribution decreased in 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) in apex-resected hearts, whereas there was an increase in coding regions (CDS) and stop codon regions compared with sham operated hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We further investigated the m<sup>6</sup>A distribution patterns in total and unique peaks. In contrast to total peaks which had an identical distribution, unique injury-dependent peaks demonstrated a distinct pattern in which a great increase in m<sup>6</sup>A deposits appeared in the CDS together with a relative decrease in both 5’UTRs and non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As expected, an increase in total m<sup>6</sup>A peaks and m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged mRNAs was detected in injured hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In a comparison of the sham-operated and apex-resected hearts, a total of 750 genes (635 upregulated and 115 downregulated) were identified with a 2-fold m<sup>6</sup>A change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these 635 upregulated genes indicated that a handful of the genes were associated with cardiac formation and assembly, hippo signaling, and establishment of spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>In addition, both m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged transcripts overlapped between two different repeats and total MeRIP-seq reads were increased in the resected hearts compared with sham (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), indicating an increase in m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged transcripts in injured hearts.

However, the RNA-seq reads were only increased by 2 folds in the Fgf16 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>, lower panel). These disproportionate increases indicate that the MeRIP-seq reads are true reads mapping to m<sup>6</sup>A modification and not reads captured due to increased abundance for Fgf16 mRNA. Therefore, these data suggest the involvement of the m<sup>6</sup>A modification on <italic>Fgf16</italic> mRNA during heart regeneration. To further determine whether and how m<sup>6</sup>A modification regulates <italic>Fgf16</italic> mRNA levels, we performed m<sup>6</sup>A-RIP-qPCR and found that m<sup>6</sup>A enrichment in <italic>Fgf16</italic> was remarkably upregulated by <italic>Mettl3</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>) but suppressed by <italic>Mettl3</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>) in the regenerating heart at 5 dpr.

To further explore the effects of Mettl3 on Fgf16 expression in neonatal heart, western blotting was used to check the protein levels of Fgf16.

Therefore, these findings suggest that Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A negatively regulates the post-transcriptional levels of <italic>Fgf16</italic> during heart injury.</p><p>To further determine the cell types primarily expressed and secreted FGF16 in the heart, we examined the expression pattern of Fgf16 inCMs and nCMs during heart regeneration. After injection of AAV9 viruses at p1, CMs and nCMs were isolated from hearts in neonatal mouse at 5 dpr. Isolated CMs and nCMs were directly subjected to protein extraction and western blotting assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>, Fgf16 expressions in CMs were greatly increased by Mettl3 deficiency compared with control hearts during regeneration. However, the expression of Fgf16 in nCMs was decreased in the Mettl3-deficient hearts compared with controls.

The relative luciferase activity and mRNA level of the wild-type and mutant Fgf16-fused reporter genes were compared in H9c2 cells.

These in vitro data suggest that suppressing Fgf16 expression in Mettl3-deficient CMs can greatly block its proliferation.

To overexpress wild-type and mutant Fgf16 in cardiomyocytes, AAV9-Fgf16 and AAV9-ΔFgf16 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) were injected into neonatal mice at p1, followed by apex resection at p3 and sample collection at the indicated time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

However, AAV9-ΔFgf16 remarkably increased the expression of Fgf16 protein compared with AAV9-Fgf16 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). To determine whether ΔFgf16 influences cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration, immunofluorescent staining was performed in cardiac tissues at 5 dpr using different proliferating markers including Ki67, pH3, and Aurora B. Ki67 staining showed that there was no significant difference in the proliferation of cardiomyocytes in cardiac apex in AAV9-Fgf16 group in comparison to AAV9-NC group. However, AAV9-ΔFgf16 significantly increased the percentage of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cTnT<sup>+</sup> cells compared with AAV9-Fgf16 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D and E</xref>).

Indeed, several studies have recognized the importance of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in tissue and/or cell regeneration. The sciatic nerve injury elevates the levels of m<sup>6</sup>A-tagged transcripts encoding many regenerative genes and protein translation machinery components in adult mouse dorsal root ganglion, indicating a critical epitranscriptomic mechanism for promoting injury-induced axon regeneration in the adult mammalian nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weng et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, expression of <italic>Ythdf2</italic> in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) facilitates the decay of the m<sup>6</sup>A-modified Wnt target gene mRNAs, thereby suppressing the Wnt signaling pathway. However, deletion of <italic>Ythdf2</italic> expands the number of HSCs and increased the regenerative capacity of HSCs under stress conditions, suggesting that Ythdf2-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent mRNA clearance facilitates hematopoietic stem cell regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). A recent study revealed that Fto, an m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase, plays a critical role in cardiac contractile function during homeostasis, remodeling, and regeneration in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mathiyalagan et al., 2019</xref>). These findings are consistent with our data and reveal that m<sup>6</sup>A modification is vital for the regulation of tissue regeneration.</p><p>m<sup>6</sup>A is added to mRNAs by a methyltransferase complex including Mettl3, Mettl14, and Wilm’s tumor 1-associating protein (Wtap), and among these proteins, Mettl3 was identified to function as a catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bokar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). In mammals, Mettl3 affects cell division, differentiation, reprogramming, and embryonic development. Knockout of <italic>Mettl3</italic> in mouse embryonic stem cells impairs differentiation and <italic>Mettl3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geula et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with these data, previous studies have demonstrated that Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification is critical for cerebellar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>), HSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vu et al., 2017</xref>), and acute myeloid leukemia maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbieri et al., 2017</xref>). These previous studies suggest an important role of Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA methylation in physiology and pathology. In this study, <italic>Mettl3</italic> knockdown promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner, whereas overexpression of <italic>Mettl3</italic> was sufficient to suppress cardiomyocyte proliferation, heart regeneration and cardiac function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Our data suggest that Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A negatively regulates heart regeneration in neonatal mice. Consistent with our data in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), previous study reported that <italic>Mettl3</italic> overexpression promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in adult mice, but deficiency in <italic>Mettl3</italic> abolishes the ability of cardiomyocytes to undergo hypertrophy in response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorn et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, controversial functions of m<sup>6</sup>A modification were also detected in the differentiation and reprogramming of stem cells. For instance, <italic>Mettl3</italic> knockdown reduced self-renewal abilities in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>). However, a later study revealed a crucial role for <italic>Mettl3</italic> in embryonic priming from naïve pluripotency toward a more differentiated lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geula et al., 2015</xref>). A reasonable explanation for the different functions of Mettl3 might be attributed to its multifaceted cellular localization, stability, and translational modification under different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast with injured animal model, our data showed that Mettl3 gain and loss of function does not significantly influence cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac function in the homeostatic postnatal mice without injury stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). The different effects of Mettl3 between homeostatic and injured hearts might result from the robust changes in m<sup>6</sup>A modification during heart injury and regeneration. In agreement with this hypothesis, great increases in the levels of m<sup>6</sup>A modification and Mettl3 expression were indeed observed in the regenerating neonatal hearts at 5 dpr compared with sham hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Using RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq, we identified Fgf16 as one of downstream targets of Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification.

Consistently, Fgf16 has been demonstrated to be required for embryonic heart development and cardiomyocyte replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, a recent study has shown that cardiac-specific overexpression of Fgf16 via AAV9 in <italic>Gata4</italic>-deficient hearts rescued cryoinjury-induced cardiac hypertrophy, promoted cardiomyocyte replication and improved heart function after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). In line with these previous studies, our results show that <italic>Fgf16</italic> knockdown leads to a significant decrease in the proliferation levels of primary cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition, the overexpression of mutant Fgf16 (mutation of m<sup>6</sup>A consensus sequence) can significantly accelerate postnatal heart regeneration by promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation compared with wild-type Fgf16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Given that there is a higher level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification during heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), it is reasonable that wild-type <italic>Fgf16</italic> mRNA maintains a relative lower level compared with mutant <italic>Fgf16</italic>, due to the m<sup>6</sup>A/Ythdf2-induced mRNA decay.</p><p>In the present study, increased levels of Mettl3, m<sup>6</sup>A, and Fgf16 were observed in the injured neonatal heart at 5 dpr. It seems that there is a positive correlation between Mettl3 expression, m<sup>6</sup>A levels, and Fgf16 expression. However, our data demonstrated that Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A negatively regulates the Fgf16 expression during heart injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–M</xref>). Moreover, Mettl3 deficiency-increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration could be significantly blocked by Fgf16 silencing during heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6</xref>), indicating the important role of Fgf16 in Mettl3-mediated regulation of heart regeneration. Given that the cardiac regenerative capacity of neonatal mouse only appears within one week after birth, we speculate that Fgf16 expression in neonatal heart is increased upon injury, thereby promoting heart regeneration. Meanwhile, the increased Mettl3 expression and m<sup>6</sup>A modification in the injured neonatal heart may be responsible for preventing excessive expression of Fgf16 through Ythdf2-mediated RNA decay, thereby balancing cardiac regenerative capacity.</p><p>It is well known that heart is a heterogeneous organ and consists of several different cardiac cell types including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and others. Among them, cardiomyocyte is the largest cell type in whole heart and has the highest percentage in all heart cells. Particularly, ventricular regions contain 49.2% cardiomyocytes, 21.2% mural cells, 15.5% fibroblasts, 7.8% endothelial cells and 5.3% immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Litviňuková et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, ventricular regions rather than entire hearts were used for RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq analysis. Therefore, it is reasonable that the greatly changed genes identified by RNA-seq and changed m<sup>6</sup>A modification identified by MeRIP-seq during heart regeneration are likely to mainly result from cardiomyocytes. In line with this idea, the expression of Fgf16, the downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification identified by the conjoint analysis of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq, was dominantly expressed in CMs rather than nCMs regardless of injury stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>).</p><p>Although the m<sup>6</sup>A modification is a part of the larger field of RNA epigenetics, yet its function during heart regeneration remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces <italic>Fgf16</italic> mRNA levels through an m<sup>6</sup>A-Ythdf2-dependen pathway, thereby restricting cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration in mice. Our data exemplify the pivotal role of m<sup>6</sup>A epitranscriptomic changes in heart regeneration. Targeting the Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification of Fgf16 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for promoting the proliferation of cardiomyocytes in mammals. Our data on m<sup>6</sup>A-modification in hearts further our understanding of the mechanism of heart regeneration and provide innovative therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><p>H9c2 cells (rat cardiomyocyte cell line) were purchased from FuDan IBS Cell Center (FDCC, Shanghai, China) and were identified through STR profiling.

Overall, the data and results support the major claims of the paper, particularly in neonatal models. However, some of the claims appear overstated with additional evidence needed to support the authors' claims.</p><p>1. In neonatal models, Mettl3 expression was markedly increased following heart injury. It is not clear whether Mettl3 expression was altered in postnatal and, particularly, in adult mouse heart injury models. While down-regulation of Mettl3 expression in postnatal heart injury models also increased myocardial proliferation as assessed by Ki67+ or pH3+ CMs, the overall Ki67+ or pH3+ CMs were almost 10 fold lower than in the neonatal heart injury models (Figure 3I and 3N vs Figure 6E, 6G), yet the CM cell size changes were as prevalent and dramatic as in the neonatal models. It is not clear how to explain these discrepancies and raises the question as to whether the improved tissue repair and cardiac function are primarily dependent on increased cardiomyocyte proliferation in this setting. A similar relatively low Ki67+ CMs were also shown in adult MI mouse models.</p><p>2. Fgf16 mRNA levels were increased by 2-fold when Mettl3 expression was down-regulated in the neonatal heart injury model (Figure 8I). While the authors claimed &quot;mRNA level of Fgf16 in the neonatal heart was slightly elevated by AAV9-Fgf16 virus&quot;, the actual figure showed a dramatic 5-fold increase (Figure 9C). Yet, this dramatic 5-fold increase in Fgf16 mRNA did not significantly increase cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration or improve cardiac function. Increased CM proliferation and improved cardiac function were detected only with 10 fold increase in Fgf16 mRNA levels in mutant Fgf16 virus models. Together, it indicates that the impact of Mettl3 downregulation on CM proliferation, heart regeneration, and improved cardiac function cannot be explained by the 2-fold increase in Fgf16 mRNA levels.</p><p>3. The authors need to provide additional evidence to support the role of Fgf16 in Mettl3-mediated regulation of CM proliferation and heart regeneration. For instance, the authors may assess the impact of the sham control, Mettl3 shRNA, mutant Fgf16, and Mettl3 shRNA/mutant Fgf16. If the impact of Mettl3 down-regulation was mediated by up-regulation of Fgf16, no additive impact on CM proliferation, heart regeneration, and improved cardiac function would be expected when Mettl3 shRNA and mutant Fgf16 are co-expressed.</p><p>4. The manuscript reports 333 genes that show overlap between MeRIP-seq (i.e. increased m6A modification) and RNA-seq (i.e. upregulated for expression) at 5 dpr. On the other hand, at 5 dpr, the authors also show increased Mettl3 and m6A levels in the heart. How do the authors explain the contradiction that there seems to be a positive correlation between Mettl3 expression, m6A levels, and Fgf16 expression, while the proposed mechanism involves Mettl3-dependent degradation of Fgf16 mRNA as a potential mediator for decreased cardiac regeneration in these hearts? Should not be there a negative correlation between m6A-modified mRNAs and their expression? A detailed discussion on providing the rationale would improve readership.</p><p>5. Since Fgf16 mRNA expression is induced during heart regeneration, how specific are the reads that are mapped to FgF16 using MeRIP-seq are true reads mapping to m6A modification and not reads captured due to increased abundance for Fgf16 mRNA. This could be clarified by providing both RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq reads together in an IGV plot across Fgf16 gene (between sham and apr) to show specificity and distinction for Fgf16 peaks between the two enrichment methods.</p><p>6. Since the Mettl3-deficiency leads to increased cardiomyocyte proliferation in both apical and remote areas within the heart, would it be assumed that Mettl3-mediated m6A modifications on mRNAs are also dynamically regulated in remote areas within the heart in response to injury? Having Mettl3 and m6A levels quantified in remote areas would provide deeper insights into pathways regulated between the apical and remote areas of the heart post-injury.</p><p>7. Having the level of m6A determined in the CM and nCM cell types of the heart, would also add significant context to Mettl3-specific roles in CM than in nCMs.</p><p>8. In the MeRIP-seq method, mentioning the amount of Total RNA and Poly(A)+ RNA that was used for MeRIP-seq would provide some context on using this method for neonatal mouse hearts, as the RNA required for MeRIP-seq are usually in large amounts than for other methods.</p><p>9. How would the authors rationalize or discuss that the observed changes to m6A-dependent effects on mRNAs such as for Fgf16 are indeed Mettl3-dependent. Would overexpression or knockdown of another m6A regulatory protein (such as Mettl14 or FTO) have a similar impact on these mRNAs and therefore on cardiac regeneration?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77014.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study has uncovered a novel mechanism in the regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration following heart injury via the regulation of RNA methylation.

Myocardial infarction (MI) injury was performed in postnatal (p7) and adult (3-month-old) mice, respectively. Heart tissues were then isolated at 5 day post injuries for Western blotting assay. In contrast with the data from neonatal mice model, our data showed that heart injury has no significant effects on the expression of Mettl3 in postnatal (p7) and adult mice (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). These findings suggest that Mettl3 has different responses to heart injuries in the regenerative stage compared with non-regenerative stage in mice. These different responses of Mettl3 to heart injury in regenerative and non-regenerative stages might results from the diverse microenvironments in neonatal and adult heats.</p><p>Regarding the effects of Mettl3 on cardiomyocyte proliferation, our immunofluorescent staining results showed that Mettl3 knockdown significantly promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation in neonatal and postnatal as well as adult mice compared with controls. Indeed, we found that cardiomyocyte proliferation levels in neonatal are higher than that in postnatal and adult mice regardless of Mettl3 knockdown. It is well known that neonatal mice have the capacity to regenerate the injured heart mainly through cardiomyocyte proliferation, but the regenerative capacity of heart is lost at postnatal day 7 with a dramatic decrease in the ability of cardiomyocyte proliferation (Porrello et al., Science, 2011, 331: 1078-1080; Porrello et al., PNAS, 2013, 110:187-192; Mahmoud et al., Nature, 2013, 497:249-253). These previous studies indicate that heart regenerative potential and cardiomyocyte proliferative ability are gradually lost during mouse heart development and maturation, especially in postnatal stage. In other words, the basic ability of cardiomyocyte proliferation is indeed lower in postnatal mice compared with neonatal mice. These previously demonstrated phenomena are consistent with the observation in our study showing a lower proliferation of cardiomyocytes in postnatal heart injury model compared with neonatal model, regardless of Mettl3 knockdown. Although the lower proliferation of cardiomyocytes in postnatal heart injury models, Mettl3 knockdown-induced increase ratio of cardiomyocyte proliferation compared with control is comparable between neonatal (Figure 3O) and postnatal (Figure 6E) heart injury models (both about 2~3 folds).</p><p>In addition, WGA staining revealed that cardiomyocyte size is smaller in Mettl3-silencing neonatal heart during regeneration compared control, implying the increased numbers of cardiomyocytes in Mettl3-deficient neonatal hearts (smaller cardiomyocyte size with no change in heart to body weight ratio as shown in Figure 3F). As expected, increased cardiomyocyte proliferation levels were indeed detected by immunofluorescent staining using antibodies of proliferating markers in Mettl3-deficient neonatal injury heart. Consistent with neonatal heart injury model, Mettl3 knockdown-induced smaller cardiomyocyte size was also observed in postnatal and adult heart injury models. These findings indicate that Mettl3 knockdown might prevent the potential cardiac hypertrophy during heart injury and regeneration or repair, in addition to promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation. In fact, it is known that heart injury such as myocardium infarction indeed results in cardiac hypertrophy especially in adult mice.</p><p>Taken these findings together, we suppose that Mettl3 knockdown improves heart repair and cardiac function upon injury, at least in part, through increasing cardiomyocyte proliferation and controlling cardiac hypertrophy. Of course, we can not exclude other potential influence which may contribute to Mettl3 knockdown-induced improvement of heart regeneration and cardiac repair.</p><p>We hope that these additional experiments and response to the comments will make our revised manuscript to be more suitable for publication in this journal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Fgf16 mRNA levels were increased by 2-fold when Mettl3 expression was down-regulated in the neonatal heart injury model (Figure 8I). While the authors claimed &quot;mRNA level of Fgf16 in the neonatal heart was slightly elevated by AAV9-Fgf16 virus&quot;, the actual figure showed a dramatic 5-fold increase (Figure 9C). Yet, this dramatic 5-fold increase in Fgf16 mRNA did not significantly increase cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration or improve cardiac function. Increased CM proliferation and improved cardiac function were detected only with 10 fold increase in Fgf16 mRNA levels in mutant Fgf16 virus models. Together, it indicates that the impact of Mettl3 downregulation on CM proliferation, heart regeneration, and improved cardiac function cannot be explained by the 2-fold increase in Fgf16 mRNA levels.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by reviewers, our original data revealed that Fgf16 mRNA levels were increased by about 2-fold when Mettl3 expression was down-regulated in neonatal heart injury model (Figure 8I). However, the protein levels of Fgf16 were increased by about 8-fold when Mettl3 expression was down-regulated in the neonatal heart injury model (Figure 8K). It is well known that the biological function of Fgf16 mainly depends on its levels of protein rather than mRNA. Therefore, it is reasonable that the higher increase in Fgf16 protein levels induced by Mettl3 downregulation can promote cardiomyocyte proliferation, heart regeneration, and cardiac function in the neonatal heart injury model. We speculate that the different levels between Fgf16 mRNA and its protein maybe due to the dynamic process of protein translation. In the neonatal heart injury model, it is possible that Mettl3 downregulation reduces the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the endogenous Fgf16 mRNAs and blocks Ythdf2-mediated mRNA decay, which in turn promotes the translation of Fgf16 proteins. That is why Fgf16 protein levels are higher than its mRNA levels when Mettl3 was down-regulated under our experimental conditions.</p><p>Regarding the overexpression of exogenous Fgf16, our original data showed that AAV9-Fgf16 injection increased Fgf16 mRNA by about 5-fold. However, this 5-fold increase in wild-type Fgf16 mRNA did not significantly increase cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration. As mentioned above, the biological function of Fgf16 mainly depends on its protein levels instead of mRNA levels. To further determine this possible, western blotting was further performed to detect Fgf16 protein levels in this revised manuscript. Our data revealed that AAV9-Fgf16 injection only slightly increased Fgf16 protein levels by about 2-fold. However, AAV9-ΔFgf16 injection greatly increased Fgf16 protein levels by about 9-fold. These findings are consistent with our data showing that overexpression of ΔFgf16, rather than wild-type Fgf16, significantly promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration under our experimental conditions. We think that the different increase levels of wild-type Fgf16 mRNA and proteins maybe due to the dynamic process of mRNA decay and protein translation. AAV9-Fgf16 injection indeed dramatically increase the mRNA levels of wild-type Fgf16 (about 5-fold as qPCR validation). Heart injury significantly promoted Mettl3 expression and m<sup>6</sup>A modification (Figure 1F-I), which might accelerate the decay of exogenous Fgf16 mRNA overexpressed by AAV9-Fgf16 through Ythdf2. Consistent with this hypothesis, the mRNA levels of Fgf16 in AAV9-ΔFgf16 group was significantly higher than that in AAV9-Fgf16 group (about 10-fold versus 5-fold). Under our experimental conditions, AAV9-Fgf16 injection greatly increased Fgf16 mRNA levels (about 5-fold) but slightly elevated Fgf16 protein levels (about 2-fold), which suggest that higher m<sup>6</sup>A modification in the wild-type Fgf16 mRNA might restrict its translation into proteins in addition to accelerating its mRNA decay. Consistent with our findings, previous study has reported that increased m<sup>6</sup>A modification can indeed suppress the local translation of GAP-43 mRNA in axons (Yu et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 2018, 46(3):1412-1423).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors need to provide additional evidence to support the role of Fgf16 in Mettl3-mediated regulation of CM proliferation and heart regeneration. For instance, the authors may assess the impact of the sham control, Mettl3 shRNA, mutant Fgf16, and Mettl3 shRNA/mutant Fgf16. If the impact of Mettl3 down-regulation was mediated by up-regulation of Fgf16, no additive impact on CM proliferation, heart regeneration, and improved cardiac function would be expected when Mettl3 shRNA and mutant Fgf16 are co-expressed.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion from reviewers, we performed additional experiments to further support the role of Fgf16 in Mettl3-mediated regulation of CM proliferation and heart regeneration in this revised manuscript. However, it seems that the reviewer’s strategy is not enough to support the role of Fgf16 by using mutant Fgf16 together with Mettl3 shRNA. In our original manuscript, both in vitro and in vivo data strongly evidenced that Mettl3 deficiency greatly promotes CM proliferation and heart regeneration (Figures 2-3). Meanwhile, Mettl3 deficiency significantly increased Fgf16 protein levels in CMs and myocardium with and without heart injury (Figure 8J-M). More importantly, our original data have demonstrated that Fgf16 deficiency significantly suppressed CM proliferation, which indicating that Fgf16 plays an important role in CM proliferation (Figure 8A-D). These findings suggest that Fgf16 might be important for Mettl3-mediated regulation of CM proliferation and heart regeneration.</p><p>To further evidence the direct role of Fgf16 in Mettl3-mediated regulation of CM proliferation and heart regeneration, we further performed additional in vitro and in vivo experiments to assess the impact of Fgf16 knockdown on Mettl3-mediated regulation of CM proliferation and heart regeneration in this revised manuscript. Firstly, primary cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal mice were treated with siRNA control (siNC), siMettl3, and siMettl3+siFgf16 for 48 h, respectively. Ki67 and cTnT double staining revealed that siMettl3 treatment greatly increased the percentage of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cTnT<sup>+</sup> cells compared with control group, indicating an increased proliferation level of CMs. However, siMettl3-increased CM proliferation was significantly blocked by siFgf16 treatment (Figure 8—figure supplement 6A and B). These in vitro data suggest that suppressing Fgf16 expression in Mettl3-deficient CMs can greatly block its proliferation. To further confirm this idea, we also injected neonatal mice at p1 by AAV9-shNC, AAV9-shMettl3, and AAV9-shMettl3+AAV9-shFgf16, respectively. Apex resection was then performed at p3. Heart tissues were collected at 5 dpr and 14 dpr for analysis, respectively (Figure 8—figure supplement 6C). In agreement with in vitro data, immunofluorescent staining revealed that shMettl3 injection increased CM proliferation in ventricular apex at 5 dpr compared with control groups. However, the shMettl3-increased CM proliferation was significantly blocked by shFgf16 injection (Figure 8—figure supplement 6D and E). In addition, histological analysis revealed that scar size in the cardiac apex at 14 dpr was greatly decreased by Mettl3 deficiency compared with control groups. But this shMettl3-induced decrease in scar size was significantly blocked by Fgf16 knockdown (Figure 8—figure supplement 6F and G). In consistent, cardiac function analysis revealed that shMettl3-inceased left ventricular systolic function was significantly blocked by shFgf16 (Figure 8—figure supplement 6H-J). Taken together, our data strongly evidenced the important role of Fgf16 in Mettl3-mediated regulation of CM proliferation and heart regeneration.</p><p>We hope that these additional experiments and response to the comments will make our revised manuscript to be more suitable for publication in this journal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The manuscript reports 333 genes that show overlap between MeRIP-seq (i.e. increased m6A modification) and RNA-seq (i.e. upregulated for expression) at 5 dpr. On the other hand, at 5 dpr, the authors also show increased Mettl3 and m6A levels in the heart. How do the authors explain the contradiction that there seems to be a positive correlation between Mettl3 expression, m6A levels, and Fgf16 expression, while the proposed mechanism involves Mettl3-dependent degradation of Fgf16 mRNA as a potential mediator for decreased cardiac regeneration in these hearts? Should not be there a negative correlation between m6A-modified mRNAs and their expression? A detailed discussion on providing the rationale would improve readership.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion from reviewers, we further modified the discussion in the revised manuscript. Indeed, our data revealed that the levels of Mettl3, m6A, and Fgf16 were increased at 5 dpr compared with sham-operated hearts. It seems there is a positive correlation between Mettl3-m6A signaling and Fgf16 levels. To further determine the correlation, we examined Fgf16 expression in the injured heart with Mettl3 overexpression or silencing at 5 dpr. Our data showed that Mettl3 overexpression increased m6A enrichment in Fgf16 mRNA but suppressed Fgf16 expression levels. In contrast, Mettl3 deficiency decreased m6A enrichment in Fgf16 mRNA but promoted Fgf16 express levels (Figure 8G-M). These findings suggest that Mettl3-mediated m6A negatively regulates the Fgf16 expression during heart injury. Moreover, Mettl3 deficiency-increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration could be significantly blocked by Fgf16 silencing during heart regeneration (Figure 8—figure supplement 6), indicating the important role of Fgf16 in Mettl3-mediated regulation of heart regeneration. Given that the cardiac regenerative capacity of neonatal mouse only appears within one week after birth, we speculate that Fgf16 expression in neonatal heart is increased upon injury, thereby promoting heart regeneration. Meanwhile, the increased Mettl3 expression and m6A modification in the injured neonatal heart may be responsible for preventing excessive expression of Fgf16 through Ythdf2-mediated RNA decay, thereby balancing cardiac regenerative capacity. These responses were also discussed in our revised manuscript (5<sup>th</sup> paragraph in the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Since Fgf16 mRNA expression is induced during heart regeneration, how specific are the reads that are mapped to FgF16 using MeRIP-seq are true reads mapping to m6A modification and not reads captured due to increased abundance for Fgf16 mRNA. This could be clarified by providing both RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq reads together in an IGV plot across Fgf16 gene (between sham and apr) to show specificity and distinction for Fgf16 peaks between the two enrichment methods.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion from reviewers, we provided both RNA-seq and MeRIP-seq reads together in IGV plot across Fgf16 gene in this revised manuscript. MeRIP-seq showed a great increase (about 10 folds) in the m6A peaks of Fgf16 mRNA during neonatal heart injury (Figure 8F, upper panel). However, the RNA-seq reads were only increased by 2 folds in the Fgf16 mRNA during neonatal heart injury (Figure 8F, lower panel). These disproportionate increases indicate that the MeRIP-seq reads are true reads mapping to m6A modification and not reads captured due to increased abundance for Fgf16 mRNA. These responses were also discussed in our revised manuscript (2<sup>nd</sup>-4<sup>th</sup> sentences in 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph in the Result section “Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification downregulates Fgf16 expression in cardiomyocytes”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Since the Mettl3-deficiency leads to increased cardiomyocyte proliferation in both apical and remote areas within the heart, would it be assumed that Mettl3-mediated m6A modifications on mRNAs are also dynamically regulated in remote areas within the heart in response to injury? Having Mettl3 and m6A levels quantified in remote areas would provide deeper insights into pathways regulated between the apical and remote areas of the heart post-injury.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion from reviewers, we performed additional experiments in the revised manuscript to determine Mettl3 and m6A levels in the remote areas during heart injury. Our original data showed that cardiac injury increased Mettl3 expression and m6A levels in apical areas at 5 dpr (Figure 1F-J). To further determine the response of Mettl3 expression and m6A modification in remote areas to apical resection injury, we collected myocardium tissues from remote areas and performed Western blotting and ELISA assays, respectively. In consistent with apical areas, our data showed that Mettl3 expression and m6A levels were also increased in remote areas at 5 dpr compared with control groups (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These data suggest that heart injury could induce the same regulation of Mettl3-m6A signaling in both apical and remote areas. This idea was further supported by our original data showing that Mettl3 deficiency promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation in both apical and remote areas at 5 dpr (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Having the level of m6A determined in the CM and nCM cell types of the heart, would also add significant context to Mettl3-specific roles in CM than in nCMs.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion from reviewers, we further determined the m6A levels in CM and nCM cell types in the neonatal heart. Primary CM and nCM cells were isolated from neonatal heart at p1, followed by RNA extraction and m6A level determination using colorimetric ELISA assay. We found that the levels of m6A in CMs is higher than that in nCMs, indicating the functional importance of m6A modification in CMs in neonatal mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). To determine the response of Mettl3 expression in CMs and nCMs to injury, primary CMs and nCMs were isolated from sham and injured neonatal hearts at 5 dpr. Our data showed that Mettl3 expression was significantly increased in CMs rather than nCMs upon injury (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). In addition, AAV9 system was used to inhibit or overexpress Mettl3 expression specifically in CMs in this study. Taken together, these additional experiments further support the functional importance of Mettl3-m6A signaling in CMs during heart injury and regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

How would the authors rationalize or discuss that the observed changes to m6A-dependent effects on mRNAs such as for Fgf16 are indeed Mettl3-dependent.

Among these four regulators, Mettl3 rather than other three ones were significantly increased in mRNA and protein levels at p14 (non-regenerative stage) compared p3 (regenerative stage) (Figure 1A-C). In consistent with these data, apical resection injury significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of Mettl3 rather than other three regulators compared with sham groups (Figure 1G-J). In agreement with Mettl3 change, cardiac levels of m6A modification were indeed significantly increased during neonatal heart growth (Figure 1D) and apical resection injury (Figure 1F).
