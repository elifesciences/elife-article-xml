programmes for symptomatic and asymptomatic staff at a UK teaching hospital using naso-/oro-pharyngeal PCR testing and immunoassays for IgG antibodies. 1128/10,034 (11.2%) staff had evidence of Covid-19 at some time. Using questionnaire data provided on potential risk-factors, staff with a confirmed household contact were at greatest risk (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.82 [95%CI 3.45–6.72]). Higher rates of Covid-19 were seen in staff working in Covid-19-facing areas (22.6% vs. 8.6% elsewhere) (aOR 2.47 [1.99–3.08]). Controlling for Covid-19-facing status, risks were heterogenous across the hospital, with higher rates in acute medicine (1.52 [1.07–2.16]) and sporadic outbreaks in areas with few or no Covid-19 patients. Covid-19 intensive care unit staff were relatively protected (0.44 [0.28–0.69]), likely by a bundle of PPE-related measures. Positive results were more likely in Black (1.66 [1.25–2.21]) and Asian (1.51 [1.28–1.77]) staff, independent of role or working location, and in porters and cleaners (2.06 [1.34–3.15]).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Covid-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>healthcare workers</kwd><kwd>serology</kwd><kwd>risk

countries in locking down its population to mitigate the impact of the rapidly evolving Covid-19 pandemic. By 5th May the UK had recorded Europe’s highest attributed death toll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Lock-down isolated many UK households but staff maintaining healthcare services continued to be exposed to patients and to other healthcare workers (HCW). National Health Service (NHS) hospitals endeavoured to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) in line with Public Health England (PHE) guidelines in clinical areas and encouraged social distancing elsewhere. Despite these measures the incidence of Covid-19 among HCWs is higher than in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Disparities in the risk and outcomes from COVID-19, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Multiple studies have investigated Covid-19 in HCWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Rivett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Shields et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Houlihan et al., 2020</xref>). However, crucial to designing a safe working environment and maintaining effective healthcare services is an understanding of the risks associated with specific roles and to individuals, and whether risk is associated with social-mixing, direct exposure to Covid-19 patients or PPE type. Some studies have suggested exposure to Covid-19 patients poses increased risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lombardi et al., 2020</xref>), whilst others have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hunter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Galan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Folgueira et al., 2020</xref>). However, none have addressed these questions by comprehensively investigating all staff groups across an institution, simultaneously assessing symptomatic and asymptomatic incidence.</p><p>Alongside routine SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of symptomatic staff, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUH) has offered SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing to all asymptomatic staff to improve infection prevention and control for staff and patients. We present the results of this large, high-uptake programme.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oxford University Hospitals Covid-19 context</title><p>From mid-March 2020 OUH saw daily admissions of patients with Covid-19. By 8th June, 636 patients had been admitted within a week of a confirmed Covid-19 diagnosis. Weekly incidence of new Covid-19 diagnoses in these patients peaked during the week beginning 30th March (n = 136/week, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Routine SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of symptomatic staff (with fever or new persistent cough) began on 27th March; weekly incidence of new staff diagnoses peaked the week beginning 6th April (n = 98/week, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Up to and including the 8th June, 348/1498 (23%) symptomatic staff tested were PCR-positive (2.5% of all 13,800 staff employed at OUH). Ten staff were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 (0.07%); four died (0.03%).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Epidemiological curve for hospital inpatients (panel A) and staff (panel B) diagnosed with Covid-19, by week and timing of asymptomatic staff testing (panel C).</title><p>Each patient admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of Covid-19 within ±7 days of any day during their admission is plotted based on the date of their positive PCR test. Testing for symptomatic staff was made available from 27th March 2020; staff were asked to attend on days 2–4 of symptoms and are plotted in the week of their positive test. Of 1128 staff positive by PCR or serology at the asymptomatic staff clinic, 192 had been previously diagnosed at the symptomatic staff clinic. Of the remaining 936 positive staff, 449 (48%) reported a date when they believed a Covid-19 illness had begun, these are plotted in yellow above, many with symptoms before the availability of staff testing. As 487 (52%) of staff did not provide a date of symptom onset the true values for the yellow bars on the y-axis are likely to be around two times higher. Panel C shows the week asymptomatic staff were tested, those testing SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive and/or IgG-positive are shown in black and those with negative tests in grey. The overall percentage of staff tested each week with positive PCR and/or antibody results is shown above each bar.

Using a composite outcome of either a positive PCR or serology result, by 8th June we detected evidence of Covid-19 at some time in 11.2% of staff. Put in context, UK-wide seroprevalence was 6.8% on 28th May 2020, with a higher incidence among healthcare workers than in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Office of National Statistics Coronavirus, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We observed varying risk to our hospital staff associated with working location, occupational role and demographic factors. The greatest risk was associated with Covid-19 infected household contacts (although only 38.5% of staff with a contact became infected) and with working in Covid-19-facing areas (22.6% vs. 8.6% elsewhere) where there was one additional SARS-CoV-2 infection per ~7 staff compared to elsewhere. On univariable analysis staff with most direct patient contact were at increased risk including porters, cleaners, nurses, healthcare-assistants, therapists and junior doctors. Adjusting for working in a Covid-19 area captured much of this risk, except for porters and cleaners who had the highest adjusted risk of any staff group, and who typically operate across the hospital.</p><p>A heterogenous pattern also emerged across different Covid-19-facing areas. Risk seen on acute medical wards was greater than in the emergency department which was often bypassed by Covid-19 patients, whilst working on a Covid-19 facing ICU was relatively protective. One key difference across these areas was the type of PPE worn and the time periods over which it was mandated. Level-2 PPE (full length gown, gloves, correctly fitted FFP3/N99 mask and full face visor) was mandatory on ICU and HDU throughout, whereas policies changed over time on other wards (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, staff on ICU and HDU received extensive training in donning and doffing and had dedicated space and supervision for this whereas ward staff did not. Prior to 1st April 2020, in line with national guidance, in acute medical areas outside of Covid-19 cohort wards level-1 PPE (fluid resistant surgical mask, gloves, apron and optional eye protection) was only worn for contact with patients with known or suspected Covid-19, potentially leading to unprotected exposure to patients in whom Covid-19 was not suspected, such as afebrile elderly patients with delirium, functional decline or diarrhoea. This likely explains the greater number of staff infected in several acute medical wards (shown in green near the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), compared to Covid-19 cohort wards (shown in red).</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Local recommendations for PPE and testing, based on contemporaneous national Public Health England guidance.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">PPE</th><th valign="top">Testing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Until 25th February 2020</td><td valign="top">Full length gown, gloves, correctly fitted FFP3 mask and full face visor (level-2 PPE) <break/>Side room isolation</td><td valign="top">Clinical syndrome with relevant travel history</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">25th February</td><td valign="top">As above for suspected cases with travel history <break/>For severe community acquired pneumonia without travel history: gown/apron, gloves, and fluid repellent mask (FFP3 for aerosol generating procedures); no need to isolate pending test</td><td valign="top">Clinical syndrome with relevant travel history <break/>Severe community acquired pneumonia</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">8th March</td><td valign="top">Fluid resistant surgical masks, gloves, apron and optional eye protection for symptomatic but unconfirmed inpatients (level-1 PPE).

Universal admission testing was only introduced on 24th April 2020, and the limited availability and speed of testing in the early phase of the pandemic likely delayed identification of some Covid-19 cases.</p><p>It is difficult to say whether level-1 PPE was less protective than level-2. Increased Covid-19 in staff reporting exposure to a Covid-19 patient without PPE suggests surgical masks afford some protection, and protection from influenza has been reported to be similar using surgical versus FFP2 masks.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Radonovich et al., 2019</xref>) However, it is likely that a bundle of measures (level-2 PPE, training, supervision and space for donning and doffing, increased staffing levels) influenced the lower risk in ICU and HDU staff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As with many infection control intervention-bundles, it is difficult to distinguish which component was most important.</p><p>It is also likely that staff-to-staff transmission amplified incidence, based on high Covid-19 rates in several wards without large numbers of Covid-19 patients. Future viral genome sequencing studies may allow analysis of the relative contribution of patients and staff to transmission.</p><p>Increased risk of adverse outcomes has been widely reported in Black and Asian ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Williamson et al., 2020</xref>), with evidence they are also at increased risk of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Disparities in the risk and outcomes from COVID-19, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Khunti et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we show Black and Asian staff were at greater risk of infection after controlling for age, gender, working location, role, and exposure at home. Job role can be thought of as a proxy for socio-economic background but we were not able to control directly for income levels, home circumstances, pre-morbid conditions or other potential structural inequalities. That staff working as porters or cleaners had the greatest adjusted risk of infection is consistent with economics playing a part in risk, potentially reflecting conditions outside of the hospital, for example dense occupancy of living space due to lower incomes.</p><p>Multiple complex causal relationships are included within the multivariable model. For example, ethnicity via structural inequalities may influence occupational role, speciality and exposures outside the hospital, which all subsequently influence infection risk. Within the multivariable model the aOR for ethnicity only represents the part of the infection risk associated with ethnicity that is not mediated by the other factors in the model. As such, the overall impact of ethnicity in the context of current structural inequalities may be better captured by the univariable OR. Similarly, the aOR reported for speciality represents the speciality specific risk that is not mediated via the Covid-facing status of the healthcare workers which is included separately. As most specialty-specific risk in our model was mediated by working in a Covid-19 area rather than by the risks of the speciality per se (e.g. proximity to patient airways), specialities working in Covid-19 areas may appear less at risk if the aORs for each speciality are considered in isolation. Instead, to calculate a personalised Covid-19 risk score, all factors in the multivariable model need to be considered together, that is simultaneously adjusting for all the relevant separate aOR present. For example, an Asian Covid-19-facing medical nurse is 7.64 (95%CI 5.60–10.43) more likely to be infected than a white non-Covid-19-facing administrative worker. Notably, this exceeds the risk of living with someone with known Covid-19 (aOR 4.82, 95% CI 3.45–6.72).</p><p>We observed 24% of staff/patients remained PCR-positive at ≥6 weeks post-diagnosis. Fewer staff than patients were persistently positive at 7–13 days, potentially reflecting greater time from infection to initial diagnosis in asymptomatic staff compared to symptomatic patients, and/or milder infection in staff. However, the proportions of patients and staff persistently positive were similar from ≥14 days onwards.</p><p>Limitations of our study include its cross-sectional nature, with most staff diagnosed retrospectively using serology. As a result, we can only partially reconstruct week-by-week incidence in staff on the basis of contemporaneous testing of symptomatic staff and retrospective staff recall of symptom onset in asymptomatic staff diagnosed once recovered who were unwell before symptomatic staff testing was widely available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The lack information on when most staff were infected also makes it challenging to reconstruct the source of individual staff infections, for example other staff or patients, and to analyze how this varied over time with PPE changes and other infection control interventions.</p><p>It is also unknown what proportion of staff who were infected either mounted no detectable antibody response or in whom it had waned by the time of testing. Despite the cross-sectional design, the numbers of staff tested, meant that testing spanned a seven week period from late April onwards, potentially leading to confounding by week of testing with changes in incidence over time and possible variation in staff groups attending testing. However, we did not see a change in our composite end point of SARS-CoV-2 PCR and/or IgG positive by week of testing, likely because asymptomatic staff testing was undertaken after the peak in incidence at the end of March and beginning of April 2020.</p><p>As our testing programme was voluntary, it is possible that different staff groups participated at different rates. For example, if staff differentially attended based on whether they believed they had already had Covid-19 this may have led to selection bias. However, rates of staff participation were high overall, with 77% registering to participate and 73% attending for a test.</p><p>Additionally, the data gathered on particular exposures may be subject to recall bias. Several risk factors were invariant over the time of the study including gender, ethnicity, approximate age and for most staff their role, specialty and working location. However, exposure histories such as living with someone with suspected Covid-19 or Covid-19 exposure without PPE at work maybe subject to recall bias. To mitigate this, when considering workplace exposure without PPE we present sensitivity analyses in the subset of staff who did not believe they had previously had Covid-19. Our data are also from a single setting and findings may vary by practice, geography and population-wide Covid-19 incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Shields et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Houlihan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our study suggests that an earlier move to universal level-1 PPE may have prevented some infections and that a consistent bundle of level-2 PPE provision and use, training, and supervision and space for donning and doffing protected staff working in high-risk areas. Wider deployment of this bundle should be considered where staff are at increased risk. Our study provides data to inform risk assessments for staff, to ensure those staff most at risk are deployed appropriately. Given likely staff-to-staff transmission where COVID-19 patient pressure was low, there is a need to protect all staff regardless of role. This includes reinforcement of measures to support social distancing and raises questions about the role of social inequality in Covid-19 transmission. If some staff are already immune the impact of any future Covid-19 surge may be less marked for staff, although differential deployment or use of PPE based on immune status would require evidence it was safe and socially acceptable. Our testing programme has been highly popular with staff, ensured enhanced detection of those with Covid-19, and now also provides a large cohort to inform studies on the extent of antibody-mediated protection against future infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Setting and data collection</title><p>OUH spans four teaching hospitals with 1000 beds and 13,800 staff, serving a population of 680,000 and acting as a regional referral centre. The first patients with Covid-19 were admitted to OUH in mid-March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 testing, initially reserved for inpatients, was extended to symptomatic staff and staff household contacts with fever (≥37.8°C) or new-onset cough from 27th March. Testing for symptomatic staff and symptomatic staff household contacts was offered by the hospital’s Occupational Health department between days 2 and 4 of symptoms, only PCR results from staff are presented. Staff awaiting a test or test result were asked to self-isolate at home. From 18th May 2020 onwards, testing criteria were expanded to include staff with new onset anosmia. In line with national guidance, staff without these specific symptoms (fever, cough, anosmia) were considered unlikely to have Covid-19 and permitted to remain at work.</p><p>A voluntary asymptomatic screening programme for all staff working anywhere on site commenced on 23rd April. All staff not meeting the criteria for symptomatic testing were considered eligible for asymptomatic testing. Both naso- and oro-pharyngeal swabs were obtained from each staff member for real-time-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and blood for serological analysis by specially-trained nurses, medical students and other healthcare professionals. Appointments were available up to six days a week across all hospitals, with staff required to register details on a bespoke website within the NHS network prior to booking. Data were collected on age, self-reported gender and ethnicity, role, working location and history of symptoms, whether they were patient facing, and whether they had at any time been exposed to a patient with Covid-19 without any PPE. Staff were asked whether they believed they had had Covid-19 already, and whether they had had household or community-based contact with a suspected or confirmed Covid-19 case.</p><p>Automated reporting of results was followed-up with a phone call for positive PCR results to distinguish contemporaneous from previous infection (&gt;7 days ago). The former were asked to self-isolate for seven days, and their household contacts for 14 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Infection control</title><p>From 1st February 2020, ‘level-2 PPE’ (full length gown, gloves, correctly fitted FFP3/N99 mask and full face visor) was mandated for any contact with a confirmed or suspected case.

Samples from 2 days of testing were processed by the UK Lighthouse Labs network (Milton Keynes) using the Thermo Fisher TaqPath assay (targeting S and N genes, and ORF1ab; Thermo Fisher, Abingdon, UK).</p><p>Serological investigations were performed by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for IgG to nucleocapsid protein on Abbott Architect (Abbott, Maidenhead, UK) with a manufacturer’s signal-to-cut-off index of 1.4, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platform developed at the Target Discovery Institute (University of Oxford) detecting IgG to trimeric spike antigen, using net-normalised signal cut-off of 8 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">The National SARS-CoV-2 Serology Assay Evaluation Group, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess risk factors for infection using a composite endpoint of ‘Covid-19 at any time’, based on a positive RT-PCR test or the detection of IgG by ELISA and/or CMIA. Natural cubic splines were used to account for non-linear relationships with continuous variables. Given the number of potential predictors fitted, backwards model selection was undertaken using AIC values. We screened for first-order interactions between main effects using a Wald p-value threshold of &lt;0.01. We analysed risk factors for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the same approach.</p><p>Similarly, univariable and multivariable logistic regression, was used to assess associations between ‘Covid-19 at any time’ and 11 self-reported symptoms prior to testing. As only 11 potential predictors were included in the model variable selection was not undertaken.</p><p>Univariable and multivariable linear regression was used to assess the relationship between ward-based Covid-19 patient infectious pressure and the proportion of staff working on a ward with Covid-19. Covid-19 infectious pressure was calculated by considering each patient infectious from −2 to +7 days around the date of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Only staff working in a single ward were included in the analysis.</p><p>Analyses were performed using R, version 3.6.3.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are extremely grateful to all the NHS staff who participated in our programme and provided data and samples.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: M Estee Torok (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This was a prospective observational cohort study COVID-19 testing of over 9,000 staff at a UK teaching hospital. The investigators tested symptomatic and asymptomatic staff using nasopharyngeal PCR and immunoassays for SARS-CoV-2. 11% of staff were found to have evidence of current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of risk factors identified household contact with a confirmed positive case to be the greatest risk. Higher rates were also seen in staff working in COVID-facing areas, particularly in acute medicine areas, and in certain ethnic groups (Black and Asian) and occupational groups (e.g. porters and cleaners). Lower rates were seen in ICU staff, likely reflecting PPE measures.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The major issue with this analysis is that there is inadequate control for, and even discussion of, three sorts of potential biases: confounding, selection bias, and measurement error. These are intertwined in complex ways because of the endpoint of the analyses which is composite in three different ways: cumulative (serologic) vs. current (PCR) infection, multiple time points (even putting aside the fact that some were tested more than once), and many different reasons for testing. This creates potential confounding because, all else equal, the probability of infection is highest in the middle of the study for PCR and at the end for serology; at many points it is higher for serology than for PCR.

These are intertwined in complex ways because of the endpoint of the analyses which is composite in three different ways: cumulative (serologic) vs. current (PCR) infection, multiple time points (even putting aside the fact that some were tested more than once), and many different reasons for testing. This creates potential confounding because, all else equal, the probability of infection is highest in the middle of the study for PCR and at the end for serology; at many points it is higher for serology than for PCR. If certain groups of employees were more likely to get serology tests at the end, this would elevate their rates of the outcome. It could create selection bias because the denominator is those tested, not total employees in a category (I think, not completely clear), and different groups may have opted for testing at different rates. It creates measurement error (closely related to the confounding) because the test types have different sensitivities and specificities / NPV and PPV.</p><p>An ideal analysis would adjust for time (by perhaps week) and test type and the interaction (since the shape of the time effect is quite different by test type).

Otherwise the risk factor findings, plausible as they are, are not very robust. I would personally be convinced if these more nuanced analyses showed the same patterns as the overall analysis, even if not as statistically convincing. An overhaul of the analysis of risk factors is needed</p></disp-quote><p>We have undertaken additional analyses and expanded our discussion of potential limitations to reflect these points, including clarifying:</p><p>1) The asymptomatic staff sampling was undertaken over a relatively short period (23 April onwards) that followed the main peak in patient and symptomatic staff cases at the end of March 2020. As such, the potential for confounding arising from changes in PCR results and seroprevalence over time is more limited than if asymptomatic staff testing had occurred from March 2020 onwards. We have added a new panel to Figure 1 (Figure 1C) to illustrate this, including showing the majority of asymptomatic staff were tested over a 3-week period in May 2020.</p><p>2) We now consider the week of testing as a potential predictor in the univariable analysis of risk factors, as suggested by the reviewers. This categorical variable is not selected in the final multivariable model, as it does not improve model fit, i.e. it does not appear to be an important confounder, presumably given the timing of asymptomatic staff testing following the main peak in COVID-19 cases in our hospital. Therefore, the proposed search for interactions with week of testing was not undertaken. We have added discussion of the potential for week of testing-based confounding to our Discussion.</p><p>3) The risk factor analysis was undertaken on data obtained from staff attending asymptomatic testing only, and although there were different reasons for testing (symptomatic and asymptomatic staff), only those attending the asymptomatic programme contributed to the analysis – this has been clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>4) We discussed as a group of authors whether to present additional separate analyses for our serology and PCR results, we initially settled on presenting a composite endpoint using both results to keep the presentation simpler. However, given the question about test type is raised by the reviewers we have now included a separate analysis of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity only (Supplementary file 1C). This shows very similar results to the main analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The other analyses, as well as the risk factor analyses, are confusing in that it is very hard to follow who is being tested with no history of symptoms, past symptoms, future symptoms, etc. Especially confusing is Figure 1 which seems to have only two categories – symptomatic or previously symptomatic, even after asymptomatic testing starts. As stated by another reviewer:</p><p>In addition, I had a number of questions about what governed the testing and how the distribution of cases changed over time.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 A and B provide background context to the asymptomatic staff testing data that follow. The two panels are intended to show the epidemic curve. Therefore, the reason for only including asymptomatic staff who were previously symptomatic is only these staff were able to provide a date of onset of their symptoms. We explain this in the legend. Were we to plot asymptomatic staff diagnoses at the time of their PCR or (in most cases) serological diagnosis this would lead to the visual impression that staff were infected later than they were. However, we accept that the labelling of the x-axis on Figure 1B is potentially unclear and have amended this. In addition, the new Figure 1C shows when asymptomatic staff were actually tested and the proportion of staff testing positive each week.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For the duration of PCR positivity, what determined whether individuals had repeat tests?</p></disp-quote><p>Repeat testing of patients was guided by individual clinician request, in conjunction with the infection and infection prevention and control consult services.</p><p>Repeat testing of staff was undertaken in a cohort of staff who attended the asymptomatic testing service during the first week of testing.

And same with staff roles?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this would be an interesting analysis, however it would require presumed workplace acquisitions in staff to be identified and dated. As most staff were only found to be positive by serology sometime later, the analysis would require a probabilistic reconstruction of when staff likely acquired their infection and the overlaps between staff and between patients and staff.</p><p>We have added this limitation to the Discussion, and it is as an area for follow up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Were the symptoms that enabled staff to get tested restricted to fever and cough for the duration of the study period?</p></disp-quote><p>Staff and their household contacts were eligible for symptomatic testing if they had a fever (≥ 37.8°C) or a new persistent cough.

This clarification has been added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For the asymptomatic screening program, did &quot;asymptomatic&quot; mean no fever and cough, or none of the other symptoms associated with COVID-19?</p></disp-quote><p>Any staff not meeting the criteria for symptomatic testing, and therefore remaining in work, were eligible for the asymptomatic screening programme.

Both are valid questions, with the former answered better by the univariable and the latter by the multivariable estimates.</p><p>For specialty, it may be that specialty per se increases risk, e.g. by physical proximity to patients as part of the specialty, e.g. anaesthetists and patient airway exposure, or that it is mediated by particular specialities caring for greater numbers of patients with COVID-19. From our adjusted analysis it appears that the component mediated by specific contact with COVID-19 patients accounts for most of the risk.</p></body></sub-article></article>
