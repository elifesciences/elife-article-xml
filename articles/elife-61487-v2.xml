domain (DBD) contribute to half of new cancer cases annually. Here we present a thermodynamic model that quantifies and links the major pathways by which mutations inactivate p53. We find that DBD possesses two unusual properties—one of the highest zinc affinities of any eukaryotic protein and extreme instability in the absence of zinc—which are predicted to poise p53 on the cusp of folding/unfolding in the cell, with a major determinant being available zinc concentration. We analyze the 20 most common tumorigenic p53 mutations and find that 80% impair zinc affinity, thermodynamic stability, or both. Biophysical, cell-based, and murine xenograft experiments demonstrate that a synthetic zinc metallochaperone rescues not only mutations that decrease zinc affinity, but also mutations that destabilize DBD without impairing zinc binding. The results suggest that zinc metallochaperones have the capability to treat 120,500 patients annually in the U.S.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metallochaperone</kwd><kwd>tumor suppressor</kwd><kwd>protein misfolding</kwd><kwd>intrinsic disorder</kwd><kwd>zinc binding</kwd><kwd>protein stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30 GM113299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanden</surname><given-names>Adam R</given-names></name><name><surname>Loh</surname><given-names>Stewart N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA200800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carpizo</surname><given-names>Darren R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08 CA172676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carpizo</surname><given-names>Darren R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001006</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carpizo</surname><given-names>Darren R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>p53 folding is critically dependent on zinc, and a synthetic metallochaperone rescues tumorigenic mutations that reduce p53's zinc affinity as well as thermodynamic stability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transcription factor p53 regulates a host of cellular responses to damage and distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kruiswijk et al., 2015</xref>). Its abilities to halt cell cycle progression, upregulate DNA repair pathways, and induce apoptosis help prevent deleterious mutations from propagating in cell populations. Mutations in p53 are an established driver of human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouaoun et al., 2016</xref>). The mutational spectrum of p53 is atypical because tumorigenic alterations are overwhelmingly missense and map to nearly every position within one of the domains of the protein (the DNA-binding domain, or DBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baugh et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, other frequently-mutated tumor suppressors such as BRCA1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">ARUP Scientific Resource, 2020</xref>), retinoblastoma 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">LOVD Gene homepage, 2018</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">PTEN, 2020</xref> are found with mostly nonsense, deletion, or insertion mutations. From a structural standpoint, p53 DBD is unusual in that it is marked by low thermodynamic and kinetic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Joerger and Fersht, 2010</xref>). The apparent melting temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of wild-type (WT) DBD has been measured to be 32–45°C depending on buffer composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butler and Loh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedler et al., 2003</xref>), and the protein unfolds with a half-time of 9 m at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedler et al., 2003</xref>). As a result of this borderline stability, many tumorigenic mutations reduce T<sub>m</sub> below body temperature and/or increase the rate at which the protein unfolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butler and Loh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedler et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of p53’s instability at physiologic conditions is its interaction with zinc. p53 consists of the N-terminal transactivation domain, a central DBD and the C-terminal tetramerization domain. The X-ray crystal structure of DBD (residues 94–312) reveals a β-sandwich with a DNA-binding surface consisting of a loop-sheet-helix motif and two loops (L2 and L3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 1994</xref>). These loops are stabilized by the tetrahedral coordination of a single zinc ion by C176 and H179 of L2 and C238 and C242 of L3. Removing Zn<sup>2+</sup> from DBD causes loss of DNA-binding specificity, widespread changes in the protein NMR spectrum, and a reduction of ~3 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> in the apparent folding free energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butler and Loh, 2003</xref>). This inherent malleability has also been demonstrated in cells by overexpressing Zn<sup>2+</sup>-chelating proteins (metallothioneins) or adding small-molecule Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelators, and observing reversible loss of sequence-specific DNA-binding activity and a switch in recognition by an antibody that recognizes native p53 (PAB1620) to one that binds to unfolded/misfolded p53 (PAB240) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Méplan et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>X-ray structure of WT DBD showing locations of mutations characterized in this study.</title><p>Alpha carbons of mutated residues are colored according to their classifications described in <italic>Results</italic>: zinc-binding class (green), stability class (red), DNA-binding class (blue), and mixed zinc-binding/stability class (orange).

The most common p53 mutation in cancer, R175H, is immediately adjacent to the zinc-chelating residue C176 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and dramatically weakens metal-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butler and Loh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence that some cancers inactivate p53 by upregulating metallothioneins and starving wild-type (WT) p53 of zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mehrian-Shai et al., 2015</xref>). These observations have led our group and others to develop a new class of p53-targeted therapeutics based on Zn<sup>2+</sup> delivery. By our definition, zinc metallochaperones (ZMCs) reactivate mutant p53 by shuttling Zn<sup>2+</sup> from extracellular sources through the plasma membrane and into cells, thereby increasing intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations to levels high enough to remetallate mutant p53. This approach has proven effective for multiple mutants in cell culture and mouse models of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garufi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although the importance of zinc to p53 structure/function has long been recognized, there is still no quantitative thermodynamic model describing the p53-Zn<sup>2+</sup> interaction and its linkage to folding. Previous attempts to characterize DBD folding thermodynamics have yielded valuable insight into mechanisms of p53 dysfunction, and have informed drug development efforts, but are ultimately incomplete because they lack information regarding zinc-binding affinity of folded and unfolded states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullock et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bullock et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, there is disagreement in the literature regarding which mutants are potentially treatable using zinc-based therapies, likely because of the difficulty of inferring physical mechanisms from complex biological data and lack of a consensus definition regarding what constitutes a zinc-binding mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garufi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present and validate a thermodynamic model that partitions DBD-folding energy into two measurable quantities: the free energy of folding of zinc-free DBD (apoDBD; ΔG<sub>apo</sub>), and the free energy of Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding (ΔG<sub>Zn</sub>) to both native and non-native sites. The data reveal for the first time that: (i) ΔG<sub>apo</sub> is extremely unfavorable at 37°C, indicating that wild-type (WT) DBD is intrinsically unfolded in the absence of zinc, and (ii) DBD has one of the highest zinc-binding affinities of any eukaryotic protein yet reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kochańczyk et al., 2015</xref>). Remarkably, the unusually large unfavorable value of ΔG<sub>apo</sub> and the atypically large favorable value of ΔG<sub>Zn</sub> are predicted to nearly cancel each other out at physiological temperature and intracellular zinc concentration, causing the overall free energy change of folding to be near zero.</p><p>Although p53’s instability at 37°C has been previously documented, our modeling emphasizes that p53 is poised between folded and unfolded conformations in the cell, with available zinc concentration being a major determining factor. It further holds that mutations that decrease protein stability (but not zinc-binding affinity) and mutations that decrease zinc-binding affinity (but not protein stability) both cause p53 to lose function by a common unfolding mechanism, and both might be similarly rescued by increasing the concentration of available Zn<sup>2+</sup>. As a test, we apply the model to 22 of the most prevalent cancer-associated p53 variants and classify them into three classes—stability, zinc-binding, or DNA-binding—based on (respectively) ΔG<sub>apo</sub>, K<sub>Zn</sub>, and K<sub>DNA</sub>, the latter being dissociation constants for binding to a panel of p53 recognition elements. We validate the model by testing whether ZMC1 reactivates members of the stability class of p53 mutants in cells, a category not previously regarded as being amenable to Zn<sup>2+</sup> therapy. The results provide a more complete picture of the p53 activation/inactivation landscape and significantly expand the number of p53 mutants that are potentially rescuable by ZMCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DBD-zinc energy landscape</title><p>First, we developed a thermodynamic model to describe the conformational states of DBD as a function of [Zn<sup>2+</sup>].

[Zn<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>free</sub> was buffered at the indicated concentrations using chelators of varying Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinity. Fitting the data to the one-site binding equation yields K<sub>Zn</sub> = (1.6 ± 0.3) x 10<sup>−15</sup> M. To our knowledge, this is one of the lowest K<sub>Zn</sub> values ever reported, with only one other eukaryotic protein possessing comparable affinity (PDZ and LIM domain protein 1; K<sub>Zn</sub> = 3.2×10<sup>−15</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kochańczyk et al., 2015</xref>). Because p53 is a tetramer, we measured K<sub>Zn</sub> of the full-length protein to determine if there is cooperativity between the monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Fitting the data to the Hill-binding equation reveals K<sub>Zn</sub> = (0.4 ± 0.1) x 10<sup>−15</sup> M and n = 0.99 ± 0.02, indicating that each monomer binds zinc independently and that the isolated DBD is an accurate representation of the DBD in the full-length p53 tetramer. We then measured K<sub>Zn,U</sub> by competition assay between urea-denatured apoDBD and the fluorescent Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelator FluoZin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The apparent K<sub>Zn,U</sub> value of (42 ± 7) x 10<sup>−9</sup> M is 10<sup>7</sup>-fold weaker than K<sub>Zn</sub>.

Pure zinc-binding mutants exhibit decreased Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinity but normal stability and thus cluster near a vertical line drawn directly below WT DBD (green box). Members of this class include R175H as well as the direct Zn<sup>2+</sup> ligating mutants C176S, C242S, and H179R. Significantly, the analysis reveals a number zinc-binding mutations (P152L, L194F, R282Q) that were not previously suspected as being so due to their long distances from the metal-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Pure stability mutants are less stable than WT but suffer no zinc-binding deficiency; these are defined by falling near the horizontal line drawn to the left of WT DBD (red box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

The mixed-phenotype mutants (A138V, V267F, R158H, M237I; orange box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) decrease both stability and zinc affinity.

Additionally, several zinc-binding or mixed mutations (L194F, R282Q, V157F, R158H, P152L) lie far from the canonical zinc-binding pocket, suggesting long-range communication between distant regions of DBD. The subtle nature of DBD structure and energetics is also evident from the observation that adjacent mutations can produce markedly different effects. For example, R248Q is a classic DNA-contact mutant whereas R249S is a pure zinc-binding mutant.

The majority of zinc-binding mutants purify with sub-stoichiometric but detectable zinc content (e.g. R175H contains 0.6 equivalents of Zn<sup>2+ 14</sup>), and consequently should show partial DNA-binding activity. We speculated that the loss of DNA-binding may be caused by Zn<sup>2+</sup> misligating to non-native sites (K<sub>Zn,U</sub> = 42 x 10<sup>−9</sup> M; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) that out-compete the native site at the temperature of protein expression (18°C). To test this hypothesis, we attempted to re-establish native metallation status to the zinc-binding mutants P152L, R175H, H179R, and L194F by first removing all bound metal and then remetallating using a EGTA/ZnCl<sub>2</sub> buffering system. This procedure restored measurable DNA-binding affinity (WAF1 oligonucleotide) to all four mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The positive control (WT) and negative control (R280K) yielded the expected results of normal and undetected DNA-binding, respectively. These data suggest that zinc misligation contributes to loss of DNA-binding activity for this class of mutants.</p><p>Interestingly, while most of the data are explained by global increases and decreases in affinity based on thermodynamic category, there do seem to be mutation-specific effects as well. P152L maintains WT-like affinity for WAF1 5', GADD45, and RGC, but loses all measurable affinity for PUMA, Type IV collagenase, p53RFP, MDM2, and BAX. As another example from the stability mutant category, Y220C maintains affinity for WAF1 5', GADD45, PUMA, and Type IV Collagenase, but seems to lose affinity for p53RFP, MDM2, BAX, and RGC. Additionally, E285K gains affinity for all p53REs, but the increase in affinity ranges from threefold for WAF1 5' to 15-fold for MDM2. E285K may bind more tightly to all DNA sequences due to enhanced electrostatic interactions with the phosphate backbone afforded by the negative-to-positive charge reversal near the active site. These results indicate that there are conserved functional consequences of the thermodynamic impairments we measure for p53 mutants that account for the majority of the functional differences we see in DNA-binding phenotype, but there are also mutation-specific effects that are better explained by idiosyncratic structural changes caused by each mutant that our model does not capture.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Tyr to Cys mutants are exceptions to the model</title><p>Y163C, Y205C, Y220C, and Y234C are all destabilized (ΔG<sub>apo</sub> = 3.5–5.0 kcal/mol), but, unlike all other members of the stability class except for M237I, their ΔG<sub>fold</sub> values fail to increase with [Zn<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>free</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We hypothesized that the extra Cys residue forms a new Zn<sup>2+</sup> interaction site in the unfolded state, thereby bringing K<sub>Zn,U</sub> closer to K<sub>Zn</sub> and siphoning the native state of the stabilization energy it would normally receive by binding Zn<sup>2+</sup>. To test this hypothesis, we denatured Y234C apoDBD in 6 M urea and measured K<sub>Zn,U</sub> by Tyr fluorescence. Unfolded Y234C binds zinc twice as tightly as WT [K<sub>Zn,U</sub> = (20 ± 4) x 10<sup>−9</sup> M; n = 6], consistent with the hypothesis with the caveat that the unfolded state in urea is likely different from that in buffer. As an additional test, we made the Y234A mutant and found that this mutation restores the relationship between ΔG<sub>fold</sub> and [Zn<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>free</sub> as predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), with a K<sub>Zn</sub> value identical to that of WT within experimental error (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). These results demonstrate that Y234A is a stability-class mutant and suggest that other Tyr→Cys mutants may also be members of this category. The data also indicate that introducing Cys can encourage zinc misligation in the unfolded state and destabilize native p53 through manipulation of K<sub>Zn,U</sub> in our model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Testing the energy landscape model in cells using ZMC1</title><p>We previously demonstrated that the small-molecule zinc metallochaperone ZMC1 can reactivate p53 mutants of the zinc-binding class in cultured cells. ZMC1 forms a 2:1 complex with Zn<sup>2+</sup> and acts as an ionophore to transport Zn<sup>2+</sup> into the cell, whereupon it buffers [Zn<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>free</sub> to 10–20 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). When ZMC1 was added to human cancer cell lines homozygous for p53<sup>R175H</sup> or one of the direct zinc ligation mutations (p53<sup>C176F</sup>, p53<sup>C238S</sup>, p53<sup>C242S</sup>), cell toxicity was observed with EC<sub>50</sub> values well below that of p53<sup>WT</sup> and p53-null controls. This enhanced ZMC1 sensitivity was shown to be due to a p53-mediated apoptotic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Given the ZMC mechanism, we previously surmised that the spectrum of mutants to which ZMCs were amenable was limited to those with impaired zinc binding. However, the relationship of zinc binding to the energy of protein folding we observed in our model allowed us to hypothesize that raising intracellular zinc concentrations could increase protein stability enough to rescue wild-type conformation of some stability mutants. To test this, we used ZMC1 as a tool to raise intracellular concentrations of zinc in an array of zinc-binding, stability, and mixed classes of p53 mutants generated by site specific mutation in plasmids and expressed in H1299 (p53-null) cells. We also used human tumor cell lines that endogenously express mutant p53, when available.

Cells transfected with R175H, C176S, and L194F show &gt;100 fold enhanced sensitivity to ZMC1 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.002 μM – 0.005 μM) relative to untransfected and vector-only controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A p53<sup>L194F</sup> tumor cell line is also sensitive to ZMC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). EC<sub>50</sub> values of R282Q and P152L are not detectable in the tested range, suggesting that they are not functionally reactivated by ZMC1. R249S belongs to the zinc-binding class and we previously found that Hs700T cells (p53<sup>R249M</sup>) were not sensitive to ZMC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that mutations of R249, being adjacent to the DNA-contact residue R248, distort the structure of the DNA-binding groove regardless of zinc-binding status. The negative control group consists of the DNA-contact mutants R273H and R280K. As expected, these variants show no increased sensitivity to ZMC1, indicating that their DNA-binding defects cannot be ameliorated in a zinc-dependent fashion.</p><p>The most discriminating test of the thermodynamic model is whether the pure stability-class (Y234C, Y234A, V272M, E285K) and mixed stability/zinc-binding class (M237I) of p53 mutants can be reactivated by elevating intracellular zinc. V272M is marked by pronounced ZMC1 sensitivity, with an EC<sub>50</sub> value (0.002 μM) lower than that observed for any of the zinc-binding class mutants. This result demonstrates that a mutation whose sole consequence is to promote unfolding of p53 can be rescued by zinc. Y234C, E285K, and M237I, however, fail to show ZMC1 sensitivity. The negative result for Y234C agrees with the biophysical data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which suggested that the extra Cys residue forms a competing, non-native zinc-binding site in the unfolded state. We tested that hypothesis using the Y234A mutant. As predicted by the zinc misligation model, the EC<sub>50</sub> value of Y234A drops to a value comparable to that of the pure zinc-binding mutants R175H and L194F (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To confirm the result for M237I, we tested two human cancer cell lines that express p53<sup>M237I</sup>. One cell line (T98G) was insensitive to ZMC1 and the other (SUM149PT) showed a partial response in which cell viability remained at ~40% at 10 μM ZMC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The BXPC3 human cancer cell line bearing p53<sup>Y220C</sup> was also insensitive to ZMC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). </p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>p53 refolding in cells monitored by conformation-specific antibody</title><p>To further test the thermodynamic model, and to gain insight as to why some mutants fail to regain their cell-killing functions in the presence of ZMC1, we assayed the extent to which elevated zinc can refold mutant p53 in cells. Refolding was monitored by the reduction in staining by the antibody PAB240, which binds to a cryptic epitope only exposed on p53 unfolding or misfolding (residues 212–217 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stephen and Lane, 1992</xref>]). For the zinc-binding class of mutants, the variants that exhibit low EC<sub>50</sub>s (R175H, C176S, L194F) show reduced binding to PAB240 after ZMC1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), implying that they undergo zinc-mediated refolding. The human cancer cell line T47D bearing the p53<sup>L194F</sup> mutation also showed refolding of mutant p53 by reducing PAB240 staining and increasing PAB1620 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Antibody staining of P152L and R282Q did not change after ZMC1 treatment, consistent with their lack of sensitivity to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We also found that ZMC1 did not refold R249M in Hs700T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that these mutants misfold and/or aggregate in the cell to a conformation that is not amenable to zinc binding or refolding. Another potential explanation for why ZMC1 does not refold certain mutants in cells when there is evidence of refolding in vitro is related to zinc homeostatic mechanisms. Zinc homeostatic genes can be dysregulated in cancer, for example in breast cancer subtypes (luminal, basal, triple-negative) in which cellular zinc levels are elevated compared to normal mammary epithelial cells, and expression of zinc homeostatic genes is perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chandler et al., 2016</xref>). Overexpression of metallothioneins or zinc exporting proteins (ZnTs), which muffle ZMC1’s metallochaperone activity, may also provide a mechanism of resistance. As expected, staining intensities of the DNA-contact mutants R273H and R280K do not change after ZMC1 treatment. R280K cells appear dark in the absence of ZMC1, consistent with the DNA-contact phenotype of this mutant, but R273H stains brightly. This result suggests that the R273H mutation induces misfolding or aggregation in addition to loss of DNA-binding affinity by direct contact.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Response of p53 mutants to ZMC1 treatment in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ZMC1-induced folding of p53 mutants quantified by PAB240 immunofluorescence.

The mixed stability/zinc-binding mutant M237I is an interesting exception. M237I shows the greatest decrease in PAB240 staining after ZMC1 treatment of all mutants tested, yet M237I cells are insensitive to the drug. Increasing intracellular zinc therefore appears to refold M237I, as predicted by our model, but fails to restore its apoptotic activity. In agreement, the human cancer cell lines with p53<sup>M237I</sup> mutation also showed refolding after treatment (by decreasing PAB240 staining after treatment of ZMC1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>) but was not sensitive to ZMC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Mutants for which no increase in transcription is observed for either of the two probe genes (blue or white bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) are P152L and E285K (stability class), M237I (mixed class), and R273H (DNA-contact class).

This behavior is consistent with the thermodynamic model.

To address this question in context of the cell, we employed three cell lines expressing WT p53: MCF7, U2OS, and H460. We immunoprecipitated p53 protein from cell lysates with PAB240 or PAB1620 and blotted with the pan-p53 antibody DO-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Because the two antibodies may have different affinities for p53, the percentages of unfolded and folded p53 cannot be determined quantitatively from this experiment. The intensities of the PAB240 bands, however, are comparable to those of the PAB1620 bands, suggesting that a significant fraction of WT p53 is unfolded in all three cell lines.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A significant fraction of WT p53 is unfolded in cells.</title><p>WT p53 cell lines MCF7, U2OS, and H460 were lysed and immunoprecipitated using PAB240 or PAB1620 antibodies.

Of the 22 most common tumorigenic mutations examined here, all but three reduce stability by &gt;1 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>, decrease Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding affinity by &gt;10 fold, or both. The remaining three belong to the DNA-contact class. These findings suggest that loss of thermodynamic stability and/or metal-binding affinity play a dominant role in p53-related cancers, and underscore p53’s remarkable sensitivity to missense mutation at nearly every codon position.</p><p>In cells, ZMC1 reactivated three of the zinc-binding mutants (R175H, C176S, L194F) for cell killing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), PAB240-monitored refolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and <italic>PUMA</italic>/<italic>NOXA</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We previously demonstrated that the zinc-coordinating mutants (C238S and C242S) were also reactivated by ZMC1, while the R249M mutant was not, due to a lack of wild-type conformation induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, five of the eight zinc-binding class mutants were reactivated by ZMC1 in cells. The biophysical data are thus correlated with the biological results but there are some discrepancies. The energetic modeling does not consider structural effects, so it is expected that some mutants will remain inactive in the cell even if proper stability and zinc binding are restored by metallochaperones. For example, the R282Q mutation, being in the same helix as the DNA-contact mutation R280K, is likely to perturb the structure of the DNA-binding pocket. ZMC1 also failed to functionally rescue the mixed zinc-binding/stability mutant M237I, causing a WT conformation change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) but not an induction of <italic>PUMA</italic>/<italic>NOXA</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). One possible explanation is that certain mutations may cause p53 to be sequestered in the cytoplasm and ZMC1 may not affect this mislocalization.</p><p>One of the primary predictions of the model is that increasing zinc concentration will refold stability class as well as zinc-binding class mutants. The archetypical example of small-molecule-induced p53 stabilization is binding of PhiKan and similar compounds to the surface cavity on Y220C left by the Tyr220→Cys alteration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeckler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2019</xref>). These drugs offer the potential of bio-orthogonality but bind to only a single p53 mutant and do so with (thus far) weak affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 1–100 μM). Zinc-induced stabilization, by contrast, takes advantage of an existing high-affinity site on p53 (K<sub>Zn</sub> ~ 10<sup>−15</sup> M) and can in principle refold any stability-class mutant, but suffers from lack of bio-orthogonality. As evidence for the potential breadth of ZMC therapy, treating cells with ZMC1 reactivated three stability-class mutants in cells (Y234A, V272M, and G245S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2014</xref>]) and in vivo (V272M), failed to reactivate two (Y234C and E285K). Y234C, like all the Tyr→Cys mutants that we tested, is refractory to zinc-induced stabilization most likely because of metal misligation in unfolded or partially folded states. E285K is the most unstable variant that we have characterized, which may explain why elevated zinc alone was insufficient for refolding without the additional stabilizing factor of reduced temperature. Nonetheless, the discovery that ZMC’s can reactivate mutants beyond just the class of zinc deficient mutation is a significant finding.</p><p>Previous work by our laboratory as well as that of Fersht established that the stability of DBD is low at 37°C. The new insight offered by the current study is that DBD achieves this instability by a unique mechanism. In the absence of zinc, we find that WT apoDBD is much more unfolded than previously thought at body temperature (ΔG<sub>apo</sub> = 6.9 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>). This is not due to DBD being intrinsically disordered—it is quite stable at 10°C—but to the anomalously high dependence of ΔG<sub>apo</sub> on temperature. Offsetting DBD’s inherent propensity to unfold is its extraordinary affinity for zinc (K<sub>Zn</sub> = 1.6×10<sup>−15</sup> M), one of the highest yet reported for any eukaryotic protein. These biophysical data suggest that, in the absence of other cellular considerations such as chaperones and p53 binding partners, a dominant factor determining whether p53 is folded or unfolded is the available concentration of cytosolic zinc At typical intracellular concentrations of available Zn<sup>2+</sup> (10<sup>−10</sup> M), our modeling predicts that the folded and unfolded populations are comparable—a prediction supported by conformation-specific antibody experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This balance may explain why so many different missense mutations at nearly every codon position in the DBD gene are associated with loss of p53 function and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baugh et al., 2018</xref>). More often than not, an amino acid substitution at any given position will decrease folding free energy rather than increase it, and loss of thermodynamic stability is the major cause of diseases that are caused by missense mutation of a single protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yue et al., 2005</xref>). To emphasize this point, nearly all mutants examined in this study destabilize DBD and/or decrease its zinc affinity. The remainder are DNA-contact mutants, which can be reliably deduced from inspecting the X-ray crystal structure of DBD.</p><p>Why, then, might p53 have evolved with this unusual and precarious combination of high instability and zinc affinity? One explanation is that it constitutes a built-in failsafe to help rein in p53’s powerful cytotoxic activities should cellular checkpoint pathways become compromised. Carrying this scenario further, one might also speculate that it is a mechanism by which the cell can reversibly regulate p53 function by modulating its conformation through available zinc levels. Evidence for conformational regulation of p53 has existed for some time. Milner and Watson reported that fresh medium induced cell cycle and conformational changes in p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milner and Watson, 1990</xref>). Hainaut, Milner, and colleagues reported that incubating cells and cell lysates with metal chelators can starve p53 of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and induce the PAB240-binding form of p53, which can be rescued by re-introducing zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Méplan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hainaut and Milner, 1993</xref>). They also reported that oxidative agents when applied to cells can also induce the PAB240 conformation in WT p53. Oxidative agents increase intracellular free zinc levels by oxidizing the zinc-binding cysteine residues on cytosolic metallothionein proteins, decreasing their affinity for zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maret, 2017</xref>). Since stress signals can regulate p53 it is also possible that similar stress signals could modulate the relative abundance of holo and apo p53 in the cell by altering zinc affinity or intracellular zinc levels.</p><p>Approximately 10% of the proteins encoded by the human genome bind zinc; however, not until the last decade have researchers discovered that cytosolic zinc levels are in the picomolar range while the total cellular zinc is in the hundreds of micromolar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krezel and Maret, 2006</xref>) and more importantly, that many proteins are functionally regulated by zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maret, 2017</xref>). This explains why there exists a complex repertoire of cellular homestatic genes consisting of cellular importers (ZIPs), antiporters (ZnTs) and cytosolic zinc buffers (metallothioneins). Proteins such tyrosine phosphatases are regulated by zinc, and these proteins typically have zinc affinities in the range of cytosolic free zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>). Although K<sub>Zn</sub> of apoDBD is extremely low (1.6 × 10<sup>−15</sup> M), the effective K<sub>Zn</sub> at physiological temperature (K<sub>Zn,eff</sub>) is orders of magnitude higher owing to the inherent instability of apoDBD at 37°C. K<sub>Zn,eff</sub> is approximated by the product of K<sub>Zn</sub> and K<sub>apo</sub> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>)—a value that our modeling suggests is close to cytosolic [Zn<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>free</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This suggests that physiologic perturbations in cytosolic zinc levels (100’s of pM), could in theory modulate zinc binding to p53 and hence its function. Moreover, given our findings that both apo and holo forms of WT p53 can be detected in cells, this suggests that p53 could potentially be regulated conformationally by zinc.</p><p>In conclusion, we have quantified the folding free energies and zinc-binding affinities of the 22 most prevalent p53 mutations in cancer, many of which have not previously been characterized. Our thermodynamic modeling places the mutations into three distinct classes that will be useful to stratify patients for potential zinc metallochaperone treatment. We have demonstrated that ZMC1 treatment rescues the function of not only zinc-binding class mutants (e.g. R175, C176, H179, C242), but also that of some stability-class mutants (e.g. G245 and V272). Mutations in these six positions alone are associated with new cancer cases in more than 120,000 patients each year in the U.S. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-p53 PAB240 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>EMD Chemicals</td><td>OP29</td><td>1:400 for IF, 2 μg for IP</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-p53 PAB1620 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>EMD Chemicals</td><td>OP33</td><td>1:50 for IF, 2 μg for IP</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-mouse (goat polyclonal, HRP conjugate)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>sc-2005</td><td>1:3000 for western blot</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-p53 (DO-1) (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>sc-126</td><td>1:1000 for western blot</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-p53 (DO-7) (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>sc-47698</td><td>1:1000 for western blot</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-beta-actin (AC-15) (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>sc-69879</td><td>1:2000 for western blot</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit</td><td>NEB</td><td>E0554S</td><td>Site-directed mutagenesis</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>TaqMan assay human p21</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Hs00355782_m1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>TaqMan assay human PUMA</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Hs00248075_m1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>TaqMan assay human NOXA</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Hs00560402_m1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>TaqMan assay human beta-actin</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Hs99999903_m1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>ZMC1</td><td>Synthesized in this work</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Female CR ATH HO (order when 6–8 weeks old)</td><td>Charles River Laboratories</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Samples size and data analysis</title><p>Samples sizes were adjusted to provide smooth interpolation across the experimental range; experimental range spanned at least one order of magnitude greater the highest and lower than the smallest central value (e.g. K<sub>d</sub>, C<sub>m</sub>, EC<sub>50</sub>) unless constrained by physical limitations (solubility, buffer range, etc.).

The DBD is also unusual in being mostly unfolded (in the absence of Zinc) at body temperature due to its intrinsic marginal stability. Previous reports, including by the current authors, provided evidence that DBD stability is impacted by Zinc. Now, Blanden et al. dissect the contributions of mutations and Zinc chaperones to DBD stability, Zinc binding affinity or both, revealing a complex though convincing interplay between these three determinants of DBD activity. They find that p53's Zinc affinity is remarkably high, whereas its body-temperature folding free energy is unfavourable, leading to a nearly perfect cancelling out of the two contributions at physiological conditions. They also examine the ability of Zinc chaperones to promote refolding of commonly observed p53 mutants. This study provides a strong biophysical and biochemical basis that could potentially be useful for personalized oncological regimens for cancer patients who harbor these mutant p53s as ZMC1 is currently at the stage of clinical trials.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) DBD's marginal stability poses special challenges to any molecular study. The authors must make inferences of the DBD's behavior at 37 <sup>o</sup>C, while the protein cannot be purified in an unaggregated form at this temperature. Their results are therefore based on measurements taken at 2-22 <sup>o</sup>C, as noted in the subsection “Extrapolation to physiological conditions”. Even if this is standard practice in the p53 field, I think it's important to note whether this risks any of the conclusions drawn by the authors and provide some reasonable bounds on the errors that this assumption may cause. It seems to me that the very interesting (and major) conclusion of this study that the dGfold of p53 at physiological concentrations may be sensitive to small changes in the concentration of Zinc stands on this analysis. It would therefore be good to assess how safe this conclusion is.</p><p>2) In the Materials and methods, the authors note that &quot;outliers were identified on inspection and excluded based on gross divergence from the modeled fit&quot;. It would be preferrable to see all of the measurements that were done accurately and see the mean and standard errors that result from all of the data. An alternative is for the authors to provide a detailed explanation on the criteria used to exclude data in each figure. I also strongly recommend that any details on the statistical analysis (what type of repeats were made, number of repeats, what the error bars indicate, what data were dropped from the analysis – again, preferably none – etc.) be presented in the figure legends themselves rather than in the Materials and methods to provide immediate context to the readers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61487.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) DBD's marginal stability poses special challenges to any molecular study.

This assertion results from ∆G<sub>apo</sub> being extremely (and unexpectedly) unfavorable at 37 °C, with this figure being extrapolated from measurements taken at lower temperatures. We point out that this method of obtaining thermodynamic folding parameters is commonly used when calorimetry is impractical, and the two techniques have been shown to produce comparable results:</p><p>“Introduced by Pace and Laurents in 1989 (Pace and Laurents, 1989), this method has been shown to reproduce ∆C<sub>p</sub>, T<sub>m</sub>, and ∆H<sub>m</sub> obtained by scanning calorimetry for a number of proteins (Pace et al., 1999; Talla-Singh and Sites, 2008.”</p><p>To assess the validity of the ∆G<sub>apo</sub> extrapolation, we compare our results to those of Prof. Alan Fersht’s group, who carried out a similar analysis of holoDBD stability (Bullock et al., 2000):</p><p>“The conclusion that WT p53 folding is sensitive to [Zn<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>free</sub> fluctuations in the physiological regime carries significant implications, and uncertainty of the ∆G<sub>apo</sub> extrapolation as well as technical artifacts must be considered. […] Given DBD’s high affinity for zinc (K<sub>Zn</sub> = 1.6 fM), the only way to obtain ∆G<sub>holo</sub> = -3.0 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> at 37 °C and 2.5 μM total zinc is for apoDBD to be as unstable as the landscape model predicts.”</p><p>In other words, if apoDBD possessed a “normal” ∆C<sub>p</sub>, the Fersht group would have measured a much larger, more negative ∆G<sub>fold</sub>. In the original manuscript we noted that ∆C<sub>p</sub> of apo DBD (7.0 kcal/mol/K) is almost twice as large as that measured for holoDBD by the Fersht group (3.8 kcal/mol/K) (we went on to describe the additional experiments that we performed to verify this anomalously large number). We now correct ourselves in that the ∆C<sub>p</sub> value in the Fersht study was not measured but calculated, based on the change in solvent accessible surface area between the native structure and a model of the denatured state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the Materials and methods, the authors note that &quot;outliers were identified on inspection and excluded based on gross divergence from the modeled fit&quot;. It would be preferrable to see all of the measurements that were done accurately and see the mean and standard errors that result from all of the data. An alternative is for the authors to provide a detailed explanation on the criteria used to exclude data in each figure. I also strongly recommend that any details on the statistical analysis (what type of repeats were made, number of repeats, what the error bars indicate, what data were dropped from the analysis – again, preferably none – etc.) be presented in the figure legends themselves rather than in the Materials and methods to provide immediate context to the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include details of the number and type of replicates, statistical analyses, data exclusion, etc. in the figure legends (with further details in the Materials and methods) as directed:</p><p>“Samples sizes were adjusted to provide smooth interpolation across the experimental range; experimental range spanned at least one order of magnitude greater the highest and lower than the smallest central value (e.g. K<sub>d</sub>, C<sub>m</sub>, EC<sub>50</sub>) unless constrained by physical limitations (solubility, buffer range, etc.). […] For multiple outliers, the Holm-Bonferroni correction was applied when calculating the 95% prediction interval. R code for outlier testing is available at https://codeberg.org/AlanBlayney/mutant-p53.”</p><p>Re-analyzing the data necessitated three changes to the manuscript.</p><p>1) In the original submission we excluded two data points in the Y220C plot (Figure 3—figure supplement 1, red data points). Their rejection was unjustified, and we now include them. This removes the deflection in the curve and causes K<sub>Zn</sub> to be undetermined. We removed K<sub>Zn</sub> of Y220C from Figure 3—source data 1 (formerly Figure 4) and deleted the Y220C data point from Figure 3C. This change is consistent with Y220C’s lack of reactivation/refolding by ZMC1, as Y220C now behaves like the other Tyr-to-Cys mutants in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 in that they fail to respond to ZMC1 due to creation of extra zinc coordination sites in the unfolded state. We have added all Tyr-to-Cys mutants in Figure 3—source data 1 to reflect this observation, indicating by an asterisk that K<sub>Zn</sub> could not be determined, and that they belong either to the pure stability class or mixed zinc-binding/stability class. These changes do not affect any of the other conclusions of the paper.</p><p>2) In Figure 8—figure supplement 1B, we now exclude the 1 μM ZMC1 data points from the SUM149PT (p53-R349S) cell survival curve, mark these as rejected, and provide justification in the legend. Refitting the data indicates that SUM149PT cells show a partial response to ZMC1. We change the text from “To confirm the result for M237I, we tested two human cancer cell lines that express p53<sup>M237I</sup> and found that they too were insensitive to ZMC1 (Figure 8—figure supplement 1B).” to the following:</p><p>“To confirm the result for M237I, we tested two human cancer cell lines that express p53<sup>M237I</sup>. One cell line (T98G) was insensitive to ZMC1 and the other (SUM149PT) showed a partial response in which cell viability remained at ~40 % at 10 μM ZMC1; Figure 8—figure supplement 1B).”</p><p>The legend to Figure 8—figure supplement 1 now includes:</p><p>“The open triangles in the SUM149PT data were excluded from the fit, as they were outside the 95 % prediction interval and remained so when applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests.”</p><p>The balance of the data indicate that M237I is not refolded or reactivated by ZMC1 and this conclusion remains unchanged in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We include the data and statistical analyses that were used to generate the heat map of DNA-binding affinities (Figure 4, formerly Figure 5) as new source data (Figure 4—source data 1).</p><p>Finally, applying the exclusion criteria confirmed that we were justified in rejecting the data points in Figure 2C (omitted in the original manuscript). We now show the rejected points.</p></body></sub-article></article>
