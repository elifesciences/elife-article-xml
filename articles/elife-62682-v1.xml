heterochromatin. How these enzymes are regulated to mark specific genomic regions as heterochromatic is poorly understood. Clr4 is the sole H3K9me2/3 methyltransferase in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</italic> and recent evidence suggests that ubiquitination of lysine 14 on histone H3 (H3K14ub) plays a key role in H3K9 methylation. However, the molecular mechanism of this regulation and its role in heterochromatin formation remain to be determined. Our structure-function approach shows that the H3K14ub substrate binds specifically and tightly to the catalytic domain of Clr4, and thereby stimulates the enzyme by over 250-fold. Mutations that disrupt this mechanism lead to a loss of H3K9me2/3 and abolish heterochromatin silencing similar to <italic>clr4</italic> deletion. Comparison with mammalian SET domain proteins suggests that the Clr4 SET domain harbors a conserved sensor for H3K14ub, which mediates licensing of heterochromatin formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>methyltransferase</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>posttranslational modifications</kwd><kwd>enzyme kinetics</kwd><kwd>protein complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_139137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schalch</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_163760_1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schalch</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_172904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schalch</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PZ00P3_148269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vadas</surname><given-names>Oscar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S018549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schalch</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Clr4, a highly conserved SUV39 histone methyltransferase, requires its SET domain to sense histone H3K14 ubiquitination in order to maintain heterochromatin and H3K9 methylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Histone methylation plays a critical role in regulating and organizing genomes to maintain genome integrity and establish appropriate gene regulation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greer and Shi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janssen et al., 2018</xref>). Histone H3 lysine 9 di- and trimethylation (H3K9me2/3) are highly conserved hallmarks of heterochromatin, where they provide a platform for the recruitment of chromatin effector complexes.

They share a SET domain as a catalytic core, which builds on a series of curved β-sheets that are sandwiched between distinct pre- and post-SET domains, providing structural elements based on zinc-finger motifs. The SUV39 enzymatic activity facilitates the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to the ε-amino group of lysine 9 on histone H3 with high specificity, thereby converting the cofactor to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH).</p><p>The mechanisms regulating SUV39 proteins to specifically deposit H3K9me2/3 in heterochromatic regions are not well understood. The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> heterochromatin system, closely related to the metazoan systems, with its sole SUV39 protein Clr4, serves as a paradigm for studying the role of this enzyme class in heterochromatin establishment and maintenance. Ectopic tethering experiments with Clr4 have established that H3K9me2/3 can support stable epigenetic transmission of transcriptional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audergon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ragunathan et al., 2015</xref>). Clr4 has further served as a valuable tool to understand its animal orthologs, which share a very similar domain architecture consisting of an N-terminal chromodomain and a C-terminal catalytic SET domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Rik1 is a paralog of the DNA repair protein DDB1 and forms the central scaffold of the CLRC complex that includes the cullin protein Cul4, the WD-40 β-propeller proteins Dos1/Raf1, the RING finger protein Pip1, as well as the replication focus targeting sequence (RFTS) protein Dos2/Raf2 and Clr4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thon et al., 2005</xref>). CLRC features the hallmarks of an intact CRL4-type E3 ligase, which uses the subunit Dos1/Raf1 as a substrate adapter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buscaino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuscu et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work has revealed that the preferred substrate for ubiquitylation by CLRC is lysine 14 on histone H3, yielding H3K14ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oya et al., 2019</xref>), and that H3K14ub controls the activity of Clr4. However, how H3K14ub regulates Clr4 and its role in heterochromatin formation remain to be determined.</p><p>We combined biochemical and structural methods to decipher the molecular mechanism governing the stimulation of Clr4 by H3K14ub. These experiments identified a ubiquitin binding region (UBR) in the catalytic domain of Clr4, which mediates H3K14ub binding, and mutations that disrupt this interaction interface lose heterochromatin function. This reveals a critical regulatory mechanism that uses the SET domain of Clr4 for control of heterochromatin formation by an epigenetic crosstalk.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The catalytic domain of Clr4 senses the presence of H3K14-linked ubiquitin</title><p>To understand the enzymatic reaction underlying the stimulation of Clr4 by H3K14ub, we set out to determine the domains of Clr4 that mediate this effect. Clr4’s domain architecture comprises an N-terminal chromodomain, which is connected by a linker region to the catalytic lysine methyltransferase (KMT) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The KMT domain contains the N-terminal, pre-SET, SET, and post-SET regions and its structure has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Min et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iglesias et al., 2018</xref>). To determine the role of the chromodomain and linker region, we recombinantly expressed both the full-length Clr4 and the isolated KMT domain and quantified their methyltransferase activity using two different assays: (1) incorporation of tritium-labeled methyl groups from a <sup>3</sup>H-SAM donor into histone proteins and (2) fluorescence-based measurement of SAH generation (Cisbio EPIgeneous Methyltransferase Assay kit). As substrates we used unmodified H3 peptide (1–21) and H3 peptide ubiquitinated on K14 (H3K14ub) or K18 (H3K18ub) generated by native chemical ligation procedures. These branched peptides are identical to a native ubiquitin linkage except for a glycine to alanine change in the C-terminal residue of ubiquitin that is covalently linked to K14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows fluorographs of methyltransferase assays for Clr4 full-length and the KMT domain, which both manifest a similar degree of strong stimulation by H3K14ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). To get a sense for the steric requirements involved in stimulation by H3K14ub, we tested H3K18ub, the closest downstream lysine on the H3 tail. H3K18ub is a significantly poorer substrate than H3K14ub, demonstrating that the position of the ubiquitin modification on the H3 tail is critical for optimal Clr4 stimulation and that covalent linkage generating high local ubiquitin concentration is not sufficient. Quantification of the stimulation by the different substrates further showed that H3K14ub elicits a 40–50-fold boost in activity at a substrate concentration of 20 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These experiments confirm the observation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oya et al., 2019</xref> that the H3K14ub substrate triggers a dramatic and specific increase in the methyltransferase activity of Clr4. However, in contrast to the previous study, we observe that the KMT domain is sufficient to mediate this regulatory mechanism. Since the primary effect of H3K14ub traces to the catalytic domain, we decided to further investigate the stimulation mechanism using the isolated KMT domain.</p><p>To fully characterize the H3K14ub-mediated stimulation, we measured enzyme kinetics of Clr4KMT on H3K14ub vs. the unmodified peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). An approximately hundred-fold difference for the Michaelis–Menten (K<sub>M</sub>) constants was measured with 0.33 ± 0.06 µM for H3K14ub and 28.1 ± 8.0 µM for H3. The turnover number (k<sub>cat</sub>) was about three times higher in the presence of H3K14ub (0.81 ± 0.03 min<sup>–1</sup>) compared with unmodified H3 (0.28 ± 0.02 min<sup>–1</sup>).

These assays show that the mutants lose activity on H3K14ub when compared to wild-type Clr4KMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). To establish that the UBR mutants specifically target H3K14ub-mediated stimulation of Clr4 but not activity on unmodified peptide, we determined Michaelis–Menten kinetics for the Clr4-GS253 and Clr4-3FA mutants using a luminescence-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Comparison of the specificity constants k<sub>sp</sub> shows that the efficiency of the UBR mutants on H3K14ub drops approximately 27-fold for Clr4-3FA and 48-fold for Clr4-GS253 compared to the wild-type. This drop in activity is caused by a corresponding drop in K<sub>M</sub>, consistent with the ITC results. The difference between Clr4-3FA and Clr4-GS253 is not statistically significant, but is consistent with small differences observed in the radioactive gel-based and filter-binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the enzymatic activity on H3K14ub, the activity on unmodified H3 peptides is only mildly affected resulting in a k<sub>sp</sub>, that is, 91% of wild-type for Clr4-3FA and 78% for Clr4-GS253 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The UBR mutants, therefore, provide a unique opportunity to investigate the functional importance of the H3K14ub-mediated stimulation for the <italic>S. pombe</italic> heterochromatin system. We introduced the Clr4-GS253 and Clr4-3FA mutations at the endogenous <italic>clr4</italic> locus and crossed them into a dual reporter (<italic>imr1L::ura4<sup>+</sup></italic>/<italic>otr1R::ade6<sup>+</sup></italic>) background for evaluating heterochromatin silencing using comparative growth assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ekwall et al., 1997</xref>). Strains with a functional silencing machinery are able to repress transcripts from these two centromeric reporters, and wild-type cells therefore show restricted growth on medium lacking uracil and turn red on medium containing low concentrations of adenine. Elevated levels of <italic>ura4</italic>, however, render the strains sensitive to growth on media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA), which is converted into the toxic product fluorodeoxyuridine when <italic>ura4</italic> is expressed at elevated levels. The <italic>clr4-GS253</italic> mutant showed increased growth on medium lacking uracil, no growth on FOA plates, and white colonies on low adenine, comparable to the <italic>clr4Δ</italic> mutant, which indicates a severe loss of transcriptional gene silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The <italic>clr4-3FA</italic> mutant also showed a growth phenotype very similar to <italic>clr4Δ</italic>. However, the slightly pinkish color on low Ade plates suggests that the silencing defect is less severe than in <italic>clr4-GS253</italic> or <italic>clr4Δ</italic>. The <italic>clr4</italic> mutants are expressed at normal levels, and co-IP experiments with Rik1 show that they remain associated with the CLRC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). To get a quantitative measure of the loss of transcriptional gene silencing, we analyzed endogenous heterochromatic transcripts at centromeric <italic>dg/dh</italic> repeats and the subtelomeric <italic>tlh1</italic> locus by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The levels of these transcripts were greatly elevated in the <italic>clr4-GS253</italic> mutant, similar to <italic>clr4Δ</italic>. In contrast, the <italic>3FA</italic> mutant showed a more nuanced silencing defect with high transcript levels for centromeric <italic>dh</italic> and telomeric transcripts, and a modest ~10-fold increase for centromeric <italic>dg</italic>. These findings are consistent with the weaker silencing defect of <italic>clr4-3FA</italic> observed in the growth assays and with the weaker loss of enzymatic stimulation in vitro. To test if the loss of gene silencing is associated with loss of H3K9 methylation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) against H3K9me1, H3K9me2, and H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>).

We show here that the poorly understood histone modification H3K14ub leads to the strong stimulation of the methyltransferase activity of the fission yeast SUV39 family enzyme Clr4 through a sensing mechanism in its catalytic domain. The H3K14ub modification has, therefore, the biochemical potential to direct H3K9 methylation by Clr4 with high specificity. These results support a recently proposed regulatory role for H3K14ub in heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oya et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these and our findings, we propose that H3K14ub serves as a licensing mechanism for the deposition of H3K9me2/3 marks and heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In this model, acetylation of H3K14, which is strongly associated with euchromatin, assumes a much more specific role than normally associated with histone acetylation: it serves to prevent ubiquitination of H3K14 similar to a protecting group in organic chemical synthesis. The H3K14ac-specific HDACs Clr3 and Sir2 therefore indirectly control H3K9me2/3 by regulating the availability of H3K14 for ubiquitination by the CLRC ubiquitin ligase complex. Consistent with this model, mutations of H3K14 lead to loss of H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mellone et al., 2003</xref>), which is phenocopied by double deletion of Clr3 and Sir2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alper et al., 2013</xref>). The genetic data further suggests that ubiquitination is essential for the establishment of heterochromatin since mutants of the CLRC complex are completely devoid of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thon et al., 2005</xref>). In the <italic>clr4-GS253</italic> and <italic>clr4-3FA</italic> mutants, we observe a severe loss of heterochromatin, which validates that recognition of H3K14ub by Clr4 is critically important for the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin. In a parallel study, Shan et al. have shown that H3K14ub and the Clr4 UBR are critical factors for sequestration of Clr4 on H3K9M mutants, which mimic oncogenic histone lysine-to-methionine mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We have consistently observed H3K14ub-mediated stimulation in reactions with the isolated KMT domain of Clr4, and we have shown that the N-terminus of Clr4 is not essential for recognition of H3K14ub. Our observations are difficult to reconcile with the results reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oya et al., 2019</xref>, where an intact N-terminus was required for stimulation. We speculate that this discrepancy is caused by the use of different protein expression constructs. While Oya et al. use GST-tagged proteins, we have removed the tags for all constructs. An influence on biochemical activity by the GST-tag has been observed previously for SUV39H2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuhmacher et al., 2015</xref>), and it is therefore conceivable that a GST-tag also influences the behavior of Clr4. Shan et al. have confirmed independently that H3K14ub stimulates the isolated KMT domain as observed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The HDX-MS and mutagenesis results provide a valuable set of constraints that we employed to predict the atomic structure of the Clr4-H3K14ub complex by protein-protein docking using HADDOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez et al., 2003</xref>). The resulting model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) shows that the H3K14ub peptide can comfortably fit the H3 peptide into the binding groove and simultaneously cover Clr4 residues 253–256 mutated in Clr4-GS253 and F427 mutated in Clr4-3FA with its K14-linked ubiquitin moiety. The model suggests that F310, which is also mutated in Clr4-3FA, is unlikely to be involved directly in the interaction with ubiquitin as the N-terminal residues 253–256 shield F310 from interacting with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Comparing this structural model with the best understood regulatory mechanisms of other SET domain proteins reveals interesting parallels and suggests a mechanism for how H3K14ub might stimulate the enzymatic activity of Clr4. EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex PRC2, which methylates H3K27, is stimulated through conformational changes triggered by binding of its own H3K27me product to the neighboring subunit EED in the PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiao and Liu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Justin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooun et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, the UBR that we identified by HDX-MS corresponds structurally to the ‘SET activation loop’ (SAL) observed in PRC2 structures, which stabilizes the SET-I domain, a region inside the SET domain that provides one side of the peptide binding groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qian and Zhou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). In a further example, the mixed lineage leukemia complexes with catalytic SET domain proteins MLL1 or MLL3 are activated by structural rearrangement of the regulatory subunits RBBP5 and ASH2L. RBBP5 thereby assumes a similar position as the SAL in PRC2 and stabilizes the SET-I domain in coordination with ASH2L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In these experiments, apo MLL3 and the MLL3-ASH2L-RBBP5 complex showed little structural differences in the positioning of SET-I, but complex formation significantly reduced the conformational dynamics of the SET-I domain. The structural similarities between these regulatory mechanisms identify the SET-I domain as a potential mediator of the H3K14ub stimulation. In our model, the SET-I domain is sandwiched between the H3K14-linked ubiquitin moiety and the H3 peptide bound in the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Therefore, binding of H3K14ub to Clr4 might not only contribute to high substrate affinity but also to an optimally organized active site.</p><p>Bioinformatic analysis of the UBR sequence using Hidden Markov Models suggests that the UBR sequence is well conserved in the <italic>Ascomycetes</italic> clade of fungi, which includes the <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> Dim-5 protein for example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Comparing the Clr4 motif with motifs obtained using homologous sequences from human SUV39H2, human G9a, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> SUVH4 shows that SUV39H2’s motif is similar to Clr4, while G9a and SUVH4 diverge significantly. This is consistent with our observation that H3K14ub can stimulate SUV39H2, but not G9A or SUVH4. The function of H3K14ub in human cells is poorly understood, but it has been detected by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). In combination with the conservation of the H3K14ub mediated stimulation in SUV39H2, this suggests that the crosstalk observed in fission yeast is conserved in mammals. Further studies will be required to determine the prevalence of the crosstalk between H3K9me2/3 and H3K14ub, and the role it plays in the biology of eukaryotic organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The list of strains used in this study can be found in the Key resources table. Strains were crossed and analyzed either by tetrad dissection or random spore analysis. For tetrad dissection, only spores from complete tetrads were further analyzed. In the absence of any selection markers, the genotype was analyzed by colony PCR. The strain <italic>clr4Δ::kanMX</italic> was generated by transforming a wild-type strain with a DNA fragment containing the <italic>kanMX</italic> cassette plus 80 bp of sequence found upstream and downstream of <italic>clr4</italic> ORF. The transformants were selected on YES plates containing 100 µg/ml of G418, and correct integration was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The strain <italic>3xFLAG-clr4</italic> was generated by CRISPR mutagenesis of a wild-type strain using as homologous repair template a fragment of DNA containing the 3xFLAG tag plus 500 bp of homology flanking the cleavage site and a silent point mutation disrupting the PAM site. The <italic>3xFLAG-clr4-GS253</italic> strain was generated with the same approach by transforming the <italic>3xFLAG-clr4</italic> strain with DNA containing the desired mutations and homologies. The sgRNA sequences used for CRISPR are indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>.

General protocol: the peptides were synthesized by the Tribute peptide synthesizer (PTI) on the previously prepared Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-hydrazine-Cl-Trt-resin (peptide P1) or on Tentagel S RAM resin (peptide P2) yielding peptides with C-terminal hydrazide (peptide P1) or amide (peptide P2). The syntheses were performed on 0.1 mmol scale using Fmoc chemistry. The following base-resistant groups were employed to protect amino acid side chains: Arg(Pbf), Thr(tBu), Lys(Boc), Gln(Trt), Asn(Trt), Ser(tBu). Of note, Lys14 (peptide P1) and Lys18 (peptide P2) were protected with Alloc protecting group. To maximize synthesis yield, pseudoproline dipeptide building blocks were used and amino acids were double coupled where necessary.</p><p>Briefly, the N-terminal Fmoc-group was deprotected with 20% (v/v) piperidine in DMF. Activation of amino acid (5.00 eq., 0.50 mmol) was achieved by addition of HCTU (4.76 eq. 0.48 mmol) and DIEA (10.00 eq., 1.00 mmol). The coupling step was performed by adding the activated amino acid to the resin, followed by 30 min incubation at RT. When the full-length peptides were assembled, the peptidyl-resin was washed with DMF, DCM, and MeOH and dried under vacuum. Importantly, the N-terminal Fmoc protecting group was not removed at this stage to allow further manipulation of the peptide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Alloc deprotection</title><p>The peptidyl-resin was swollen for 30 min in DCM.

Dynamics of ubiquitinated H3 peptide was investigated by comparing its D2O incorporation alone or when in complex with Clr4. Protein or protein complexes were prepared in 5 µl volume, and deuterium exchange was initiated by addition of 45 µl of deuterated buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4/150 mM NaCl/10 mM DTT). For the condition of Clr4 with an excess of H3 peptide, the deuterated buffer was supplemented with H3 peptide (from lyophilized powder).

Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange and structural modeling the authors identify the region of Clr4 that contacts the ubiquitin moiety on the H3 tail and design mutants to interfere with this function. The result is a Clr4 protein incapable of forming heterochromatic domains. Structural and biochemical analyses of homologs of Clr4 from other species suggested that this crosstalk might have been conserved during evolution. These findings shed new light on the intricate relationship between different histone marks and their roles in gene and genome regulation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;SUV39 SET domains mediate crosstalk of heterochromatic histone marks&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Using mutants and HDX, the authors identified the interaction surface of Clr4 for H3K14ub, which they used to design mutants that responded poorly to H3K14ub stimulation. in vivo, these mutations resulted in loss of heterochromatin marks and defects in heterochromatin-based silencing, suggesting that H3K14ub stimulation is essential to K9me-mediated silencing. Finally, the authors show that human SUV39H2 but not G9a or Arabidopsis SUVH4 can be stimulated by H3K14ub in a similar manner.</p><p>The authors provided biochemical and structural insights into the mechanism that increases the H3K9-specific methyltransferase activity of Clr4 by H3K14ub. Although H3K14ub-mediated promotion of H3K9 methylation is shown in Oya et al., EMBO Rep 2019, this study further characterizes the potential mechanism. However, there are some issues with the results that need to resolved before I can recommend this for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. Similarity and difference with the previous study. As the authors acknowledge, this manuscript builds on a previous study by Oya et al., however I think the similarities and the differences need to be made even more explicit and better addressed.</p><p>1.1. The authors should clearly state that Figure 1B and 1C are basically a confirmation of Oya et al., 2019.</p><p>1.2. I am more puzzled by the difference in the mapping of the region required for H3K14ub stimulation. The authors suggest that a difference in the preparation of the recombinant proteins might be responsible. This can and should be tested as it would seemingly be a simple experiment (compare with and without GST tag).</p><p>1.3. Possibly to reconcile their findings with the previous report the authors state in the description of Figure 1 that &quot;the N-terminus plays a regulatory role in the sensing of H3K14ub by the catalytic domain&quot; but I don't see this reflected in the data show in Figure 1C, given that the degree of stimulation is very similar for KMT and FL.</p><p>2. Stimulation-defective mutants. The authors should carefully discuss the stimulation-defective mutants, which should be premised on the retention of their methyltransferase activity on unmodified H3. The authors claim that 30% loss of activity of the Clr4 KMT mutants on unmodified H3 is observed in Figure S3C (Pg 11 line 15), but this cannot be determined from the graph provided, which is normalized to unmodified H3. The authors should (1) make another graph to show the 30% loss and (2) compare Clr4 KMT mutants with catalytic-dead Clr4 KMT or dissolution buffer (no protein). It is still possible that GS253 and F3A mutations simply reduce MTase activity, thus displaying lower activity than WT in the presence of H3K14ub, which would also suggest a different interpretation for the results in vivo.</p><p>3. Heterochromatin localization of Clr4 mutants. The FLAG ChIP results in Figure 4E is not very informative, as with the loss of heterochromatin a loss of Clr4 is predicted. If the authors want to test whether the localization activity of Clr4 mutants is intact, (1) FLAG ChIP in the clr4+, Flag-Clr4GS253/F3A background (i.e., two clr4 alleles exist) or (2) in vitro H3K9me2/3 binding assay should be performed. Since Clr4 N-terminus might regulates MTase activity as discussed in Pg 18 line 19, it is also possible that amino acid substitutions in the KMT region affect the function of N-terminus, including CD. The co-IP in Figure 4C is not sufficient to clarify this point as Clr4 directly binds heterochromatin via its CD, in addition to the CLRC-mediated mechanism, and it is unclear if this is affected in the mutants.</p><p>4. Allosteric vs. binding regulation. On Pg. 11, the authors suggest that an allosteric mechanism is at play, but this is not supported by the data. In fact the observation that providing ubiquitin in trans does not stimulate and rather inhibits the activity on H3K14ub would suggest that the ubiquitin just increases binding affinity. To clarify this the authors should measure binding affinity of WT and mutants to the H3 peptide with and without ubiquitin.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Stirpe and colleagues describe structural insight into a novel regulation mechanism of SUV39 class histone methyltransferases. Clr4 is the sole SUV39-family H3K9me2/3 methyltransferase in fission yeast and recent evidence suggests that ubiquitylation of lysine 14 on histone H3 (H3K14ub) plays a key role in H3K9 methylation. To understand the molecular mechanisms of this regulation, the authors first set up in vitro assay system and demonstrate that H3K14ub promotes Clr4 methyltransferase activity and that the catalytic domain of Clr4 senses the presence of H3K14-linked ubiquitin. The authors then performed hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry analysis and show that ubiquitin moiety binds to a region involving residues 243-261 of Clr4. Using this information, they further show that Clr4 mutants containing amino-acid substitutions in the ubiquitin binding region lose affinity for H3K14ub. The authors also demonstrate that fission yeast strains expressing mutant Clr4 display silencing defect and lose heterochromatic H3K9me2/3. Finally, the authors demonstrate that H3K14ub also stimulates the enzymatic activity of mammalian SUV39H2.</p><p>This is an excellent paper that provides structural insights into how H3K14ub stimulates Clr4 methyltransferase activity. The results presented are of high quality and convincingly controlled. The paper is carefully written, and the conclusions presented are fully supported by the data included. The results described are of high interest to the field of heterochromatin and crosstalk of histone marks. I recommend publication of this paper in <italic>eLife</italic>. The following points shall be addressed by the authors before publication.</p><p>Is the H3K14ub-mediated stimulation a shared property of SUV39 class methyltransferases? This is a quite important question considering the mechanisms underlying heterochromatin assembly in eukaryotic cells. While the authors demonstrate that SUV39H2's enzymatic activity is stimulated by H3K14u (Figure 5A), it would be interesting to test whether the activity of SUV39H1, the other mammalian Su(var)3-9 homologue, is also stimulated by the presence of H3K14ub.<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The Suv39 class of methyl transferases are responsible for establishment and maintenance of constitutive heterochromatin via the deposition of H3K9me2/me3 marks. Clr4 is the sole H3K9me2/me3 HMTase in the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> and is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CLRC complex. It has been shown recently that CLRC mediates the ubiquitylation of H3K14 residue which in turn boosts the methyl transferase activity of Clr4. A region C-terminal to the chromo domain (aa 63-127) was also shown to be required to bind Ubiquitin and provide specificity for ubiquitylated H3K14 relative to inmodified H3 (Oya et al., 2019 EMBO Rep. 2019 20:e48111).</p><p>Here the authors further explore crosstalk between Clr4 activity and H3K14Ub. They do this via a structure-function approach employing a range of structural methods combined with in vivo assays. The primary finding here is that the presence of H3K14ub on histone H3 enhances Clr4 methyl transferase activity and this H3K14ub sensing region resides within the KMT methyltransferase domain itself (aa 192-490) not the aa 63-127 region as previously reported.</p><p>The authors further identify regions within this domain that are responsible for H3K14ub binding and Clr4 mutants which abrogate this interaction. These Clr4 mutants display dramatically reduced activity towards ubiquitylated peptide substrates. in vivo tests show that the same mutants exhibit silencing defects associated with almost a complete loss of H3K9me2/me3 from centromeric heterochromatin. Additionally, the authors show that H3K14ub sensing also appears to operate within the KMT domain of human SUV39H2 but not human G9a or Arabidopsis SUVH4.</p><p>Thus the key differences here from the Oya et al., 2019 study are the structural approaches employed and that Ubiquitin is sensed by the KMT methyltransferase domain itself without the previously identified Ubiquitin binding region in (aa 63-127). The authors offer a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy.</p><p>Additional analyses would perhaps help to strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>1. The relevance of the proposed mechanism in a cellular chromatin context is unclear. A significant fraction of H3K9me2/3 nucleosomes isolated from cells should also carry H3K14ub in cis. How frequently do K9Me2/3 and K14ub co-occur on nucleosomes in heterochromatin regions? This could explored by westerns with anti-H3K9me2 and or me3 – a mobility shift equivalent to monoubiquitylation should be visible.</p><p>2. The authors should consider including mutant peptide controls such as H3K9RK14ub to make sure what is detected here is indeed H3K9 methylation. Additionally, a completely unrelated substrate such as a ubiquitylated H4 N-terminal peptide could be used in the methyltransferase assays to strengthen the authors claims of specificity.</p><p>3. The IP-western (Figure 4C) shows association of Clr4 proteins with the Rik1 and suggesting that they are incorporated into the CLRC complex. However, a more rigorous test would be analysis these IPs by mass spectrometry to determine if the Clr4 GS253 and F3A mutant proteins are indeed assembled into a CLRC complex containing the other components.</p><p>4. The Clr4-F3A mutant appears to have a differential effect on the level of transcript generation from the dg and dh regions of centromeric repeats. For completeness ChIP-qPCR data should be included for both the dg and dh regions (currently only dh is assayed Figure 4 E) to determine if a difference is also detected.</p><p>5. Are similar structural features found in the SUV39H2 KMT domain to those shown for Clr4 (Figure 5C) that would also allow ubiquitin to dock? Does computational comparison between Suv39H2, Clr4, G9a and SUVH4 provide insight into similarities/differences?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62682.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>The following must be addressed in your revision:</p><p>1) Additional support for the claim that the mutants are only (or mostly) impaired in the ubiquitin binding activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed thorough enzyme kinetics for wild type vs mutants, which are shown in Figure 3G and fitted parameters are tabulated in Table 1.

This interpretation is well supported by the comprehensive kinetic analysis discussed in (1). Measuring affinities of the unmodified peptide directly by ITC failed because the Kds are very high and require concentrations that we could not reach. Change to manuscript:</p><p>&quot;Comparison of the kinetic parameters between H3K14ub and H3 substrate indicates that the presence of ubiquitin on lysine 14 leads to a tighter enzyme-substrate complex and to conformational changes in the active site that increase the rate of the methyltransferase reaction.</p><p>To determine whether H3K14ub uses an allosteric site for ubiquitin on Clr4, we challenged the methyltransferase reaction with increasing amounts of free ubiquitin. While we observed no significant increase in activity for unmodified H3, we observed a drop in the activity for H3K14ub at high concentrations of free ubiquitin (Figure 1E). This experiment failed to produce evidence of an allosteric site for free ubiquitin on Clr4 and we conclude that the stimulation of k<sub>cat</sub> is likely to depend on an induced-fit mechanism triggered by binding of H3K14ub to the Clr4 HMT domain.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Better characterization of silencing defects: ChIP-qPCR data should be included for both the dg and dh regions across mutants (Rev 3, point 4).</p></disp-quote><p>We have further characterized the UBR mutants with ChIP-qPCR data for dg, dh and tlh1, and have added them to Figure 4E.

Similarity and difference with the previous study. As the authors acknowledge, this manuscript builds on a previous study by Oya et al., however I think the similarities and the differences need to be made even more explicit and better addressed.</p><p>1.1. The authors should clearly state that Figure 1B and 1C are basically a confirmation of Oya et al., 2019.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added: &quot;These experiments confirm the observation by Oya et al., <sup>2</sup> that the H3K14ub substrate triggers a dramatic and specific increase in the methyltransferase activity of Clr4. However, in contrast to the previous study, we observe that the KMT domain is sufficient to mediate this regulatory mechanism.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.2. I am more puzzled by the difference in the mapping of the region required for H3K14ub stimulation. The authors suggest that a difference in the preparation of the recombinant proteins might be responsible. This can and should be tested as it would seemingly be a simple experiment (compare with and without GST tag).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we cannot explain the discrepancy satisfactorily. However, Shan et al. <sup>1</sup> have completely independently confirmed our result and we therefore chose to focus our resources on characterizing the mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.3. Possibly to reconcile their findings with the previous report the authors state in the description of Figure 1 that &quot;the N-terminus plays a regulatory role in the sensing of H3K14ub by the catalytic domain&quot; but I don't see this reflected in the data show in Figure 1C, given that the degree of stimulation is very similar for KMT and FL.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data do not establish the statistical significance to make this claim firmly and have therefore withdrawn the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Stimulation-defective mutants. The authors should carefully discuss the stimulation-defective mutants, which should be premised on the retention of their methyltransferase activity on unmodified H3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this by the kinetic analysis of the mutants in Figure 3G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Heterochromatin localization of Clr4 mutants. The FLAG ChIP results in Figure 4E is not very informative, as with the loss of heterochromatin a loss of Clr4 is predicted. If the authors want to test whether the localization activity of Clr4 mutants is intact, (1) FLAG ChIP in the clr4+, Flag-Clr4GS253/F3A background (i.e., two clr4 alleles exist) or (2) in vitro H3K9me2/3 binding assay should be performed. Since Clr4 N-terminus might regulates MTase activity as discussed in Pg 18 line 19, it is also possible that amino acid substitutions in the KMT region affect the function of N-terminus, including CD. The co-IP in Figure 4C is not sufficient to clarify this point as Clr4 directly binds heterochromatin via its CD, in addition to the CLRC-mediated mechanism, and it is unclear if this is affected in the mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the FLAG ChIP exclusively reports on the presence of Clr4 in heterochromatic regions and that the data confirm what is expected when heterochromatin is lost. We also agree that the proposed experiments would be very interesting and could potentially provide revealing insight into the recruitment of Clr4. However, we are of the opinion that dissecting the contribution of CD, H3K14ub and potentially other mechanisms to Clr4 recruitment goes beyond the scope of this manuscript, which is focused on the enzymatic stimulation of Clr4 through H3K14ub.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Allosteric vs. binding regulation. On Pg. 11, the authors suggest that an allosteric mechanism is at play, but this is not supported by the data. In fact the observation that providing ubiquitin in trans does not stimulate and rather inhibits the activity on H3K14ub would suggest that the ubiquitin just increases binding affinity. To clarify this the authors should measure binding affinity of WT and mutants to the H3 peptide with and without ubiquitin.</p></disp-quote><p>This point has been addressed in Essential Points 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Is the H3K14ub-mediated stimulation a shared property of SUV39 class methyltransferases? This is a quite important question considering the mechanisms underlying heterochromatin assembly in eukaryotic cells. While the authors demonstrate that SUV39H2's enzymatic activity is stimulated by H3K14u (Figure 5A), it would be interesting to test whether the activity of SUV39H1, the other mammalian Su(var)3-9 homologue, is also stimulated by the presence of H3K14ub.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be very interesting to screen the SUV39 enzyme family to determine which members share the H3K14ub-mediated stimulation. However, we feel that addressing this question is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1.
