migrate. EMT is the hallmark of gastrulation, an evolutionarily conserved developmental process. In mammals, epiblast cells ingress at the primitive streak to form mesoderm. Cells ingress and exit the epiblast epithelial layer and the associated EMT is dynamically regulated and involves a stereotypical sequence of cell behaviors. 3D time-lapse imaging of gastrulating mouse embryos combined with cell and tissue scale data analyses revealed the asynchronous ingression of epiblast cells at the primitive streak. Ingressing cells constrict their apical surfaces in a pulsed ratchet-like fashion through asynchronous shrinkage of apical junctions. A quantitative analysis of the distribution of apical proteins revealed the anisotropic and reciprocal enrichment of members of the actomyosin network and Crumbs2 complexes, potential regulators of asynchronous shrinkage of cell junctions. Loss of function analyses demonstrated a requirement for Crumbs2 in myosin II localization and activity at apical junctions, and as a candidate regulator of actomyosin anisotropy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>cell dynamics</kwd><kwd>apical constriction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD094868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francou</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Kathryn V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Alan and Sandra Gerry Metastasis and Tumor Ecosystems Center of MSKCC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francou</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francou</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Kathryn V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD086478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francou</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Kathryn V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK127821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francou</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name><name><surname>Hadjantonakis</surname><given-names>Anna-Katerina</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Kathryn V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-resolution live and fixed tissue imaging combined with cell and tissue scale data analyses revealed that a ratchet-like constriction of the apical surfaces of cells drives the first step of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition taking place during mouse gastrulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are tissue-level morphogenetic programs necessary for normal embryonic development, cancer progression, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Francou and Anderson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thiery, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ye and Weinberg, 2015</xref>).

The onset of gastrulation involves formation of the primitive streak at the posterior of the pluripotent epiblast, at around embryonic (E) 6.5 day in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrer-Vaquer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakaya and Sheng, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Primitive streak initiation is regulated by the convergence of WNT, BMP, and Nodal signals, which together with FGF signal trigger the EMT process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrer-Vaquer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morgani and Hadjantonakis, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramkumar and Anderson, 2011</xref>). The basement membrane present basally adjacent to epiblast cells is broken down at the primitive streak, thereby facilitating the movement of cells out of the epiblast tissue layer, accompanied by changes in their cell shape, including apical constriction and the basal translocation of cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramkumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams et al., 2012</xref>). Basal cell ingression and migration away from the epiblast epithelium is facilitated through the dissolution of apical junctions. As cells at the primitive streak undergo EMT, more laterally positioned epiblast cells converge toward the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams et al., 2012</xref>), replenishing the pool for continued ingression and ensuring epithelial integrity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse imaging of ZO-1-GFP reporter reveals epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) events at the primitive streak of the mouse gastrula and apical constriction associated with cell ingression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic sagittal section view of embryonic day (E)7.5 mouse embryo and 3D time-lapse imaging performed from the posterior side in glass-bottom dishes with the objective positioned adjacent to the primitive streak (PS).

Apical constriction has been associated with cell ingression during the gastrulation EMT in chick and mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rozbicki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Serrano Nájera and Weijer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams et al., 2012</xref>), but how cells dynamically constrict their apical surfaces during EMT, and what regulates this process remain open questions. The process of gastrulation occurs along divergent time-scales (~1 hr vs. &gt;24 hr) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse, and involves distinct mechanisms and spatial parameters (tissue invagination vs. cell ingression). In the chick embryo, Myosin II plays a role in the formation of the primitive streak, and cell ingression from the epiblast layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rozbicki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Serrano Nájera and Weijer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Voiculescu et al., 2014</xref>). Crumbs2, a protein shown to regulate apical polarity in epithelia, is critical for cell ingression during gastrulation EMT in mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramkumar et al., 2016</xref>). Apical Crumbs2 and myosin heavy chain IIB show an anisotropic accumulation in mouse epiblast cells in the vicinity of the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramkumar et al., 2016</xref>), reminiscent of patterns controlling apical constriction during <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Röper, 2012</xref>), suggesting these proteins are potential regulators of apical constriction during mouse EMT. Visualizing the cellular dynamics of the epiblast during mouse gastrulation has been a longstanding challenge due to the internal location of the tissue which limits optical access and visualization at high resolution.</p><p>Using live imaging of ex utero cultured mouse embryos, and high-resolution visualization and segmentation of epiblast cell membranes, we performed a dynamic quantitative analysis of the apical constriction associated with ingression during the mouse gastrulation EMT. We observed cells undergoing EMT at the mouse primitive streak in a scattered and apparently stochastic manner. Epiblast cells constricted their apical surfaces in a ratchet-like pulsed fashion through asynchronous shrinkage of their apical cell-cell junctions. By analyzing and quantifying the distribution of apical proteins, we uncovered an anisotropic and reciprocal enrichment of actomyosin network and Crumbs complex proteins. Such reciprocal distribution is consistent with actomyosin and Crumbs complex playing a role in regulating junctional shrinkage and apical constriction. The localization of the apical actomyosin network, as well as two kinases aPKC and Rock1, was perturbed in <italic>Crb2</italic> mutants, thereby identifying them as key components of a putative regulatory network driving apical constriction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epiblast cells undergo apical constriction and isolated ingression at the mouse primitive streak</title><p>The mouse gastrulation EMT occurs at the primitive streak, which, by contrast to the chick, does not form a morphologically distinct domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Columnar epithelial epiblast cells with their apical surfaces facing the inner (amniotic) cavity of the embryo apically constrict and elongate basally as they ingress out of the epiblast tissue layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams et al., 2012</xref>). To visualize the dynamic changes in the shapes of all cells in tissue context at single-cell resolution during the gastrulation EMT, we sought to label the membranes and junctions of all epiblast cells and perform time-lapse imaging. Time-lapse imaging of epiblast cells in the vicinity of the primitive streak of developing mouse embryos is challenging for several reasons. Embryos need to be kept intact and tissues cannot be microdissected as epiblast integrity would be lost. The epiblast is cup-shaped with inherent curvature, and it is the tissue located within the deepest extremity of the embryo (up to 60 µm away from the objective), needing to be imaged through the adjacent visceral endoderm and mesoderm tissue layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Even light-sheet systems, which can provide in toto visualization of embryos and have predominantly been used to visualize and segment nuclear-localized reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McDole et al., 2018</xref>), present limitations in imaging membrane and junctional reporters.</p><p>We used a ZO-1-GFP protein fusion reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foote et al., 2013</xref>) to visualize tight junctions, and by extension, the apical surface of epiblast cells. This allowed us to quantify apical surface dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also used a membrane-localized <italic>Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> reporter to visualize their entire plasma membrane, and to identify completion of the apical constriction associated with cell ingression out of the epithelial epiblast layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). 3D time-lapse imaging of embryos at mid/late-streak stage (E7.5) was performed to image the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Time-lapse imaging of ZO-1-GFP embryos revealed that epiblast cells undergo extensive rearrangements as cells on the left and right sides of the embryo converge toward the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams et al., 2012</xref>). The majority of epiblast cells underwent apical constriction and ingression within an ~40 µm region at the posterior midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

The membrane-GFP reporter served as a control for homogeneous membrane fluorescence localization with low anisotropy, and the cohort of proteins analyzed exhibited varying degrees of anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Some proteins, including Crumbs2, ppMRLC, ROCK1, and ZO-1 showed a high level of anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>), though each exhibited a distinct pattern. ZO-1 was observed on all junctions, with variable intensity. Crumbs2 was present on some junctions but absent on others. ppMRLC and ROCK1 also accumulated on some junctions but were reduced on others. Other proteins, including PatJ and F-actin, displayed distinct patterns, but intermediate anisotropy. Finally, a subset of the proteins analyzed, including pMRLC, myosin heavy chain IIB, and aPKC, showed less anisotropy with lower SD and Max/Min values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). These data allowed us to classify these apical proteins based on their junctional distribution and level of anisotropy. Notably, when analyzed at earlier (E7) and later stages (E8) of embryo development, these protein distributions did not exhibit visible differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramkumar et al., 2016</xref>), arguing for a defined window of time where dynamic anisotropies could potentially facilitate a specific mode of cell ingression at gastrulation.</p><p>The anisotropic membrane accumulation of proteins is relevant with respect to the planar cell polarity (PCP) of epithelial cells. The apical proteins we analyzed did not show an overt planar polarized distribution, which we sought to verify quantitatively. We compared the planar polarity index calculated by Tissue Analyzer (amplitude and orientation of polarity) and mean junctional intensity in relation to junction orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) in two different ways, to assess the planar polarity of apical proteins as compared to Celsr1, a protein with a planar polarized distribution implicated in PCP in mouse and chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curtin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mahaffey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>). Celsr1 exhibited a clear planar polarized localization and tended to accumulate on junctions oriented on left-right axis perpendicular to the proximo-distal axis. By contrast, myosin heavy chain IIB, Crumbs2, ppMRLC, ZO-1, and aPKC exhibited no specific axis of planar polarity. These results show that actomyosin network and Crumbs2 complex proteins at the apical junctions do not exhibit planar polarity, but a disordered anisotropy distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Reciprocal distribution of apical proteins at apical junctions</title><p>We next assessed the colocalization and correlation of these different apical proteins at junctions. Segmentation and intensity values, which served as a readout of concentration, were used to systematically compare mean junctional protein intensities and correlate localization. Some proteins such as ppMRLC and Rock1 showed similar patterns with comparable levels of anisotropy and appeared to accumulate on the same junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Co-staining revealed a broader accumulation for ppMRLC. However, where Rock1 was seen to accumulate, ppMRLC was always present, demonstrating strong colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>), close to that observed with a positive control staining for ppMRLC with two different secondary antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, E</xref>).

Thereafter, cells lose their epithelial properties as they form mesoderm, a mesenchymal tissue. By contrast, in the mouse embryo epiblast cells at the primitive undergo ingression in isolation.

Future studies where time-lapse imaging is performed with shorter time intervals should reveal further details of the constriction process.</p><p>The apical constriction we observed is associated with the asynchronous contraction of junctions between neighboring cells, and our fixed tissue imaging showed that it is potentially regulated by the apical actomyosin network. During <italic>Drosophila</italic> gastrulation, an apico-medial network of actomyosin pulls apical cell junctions to simultaneously reduce their length and allow the constriction of the apical surface of cells at the ventral furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coravos and Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mason et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts exhibit polarized apical constrictions driven by both planar polarized junctional and medial actomyosin networks, which predominantly lead to a loss of antero-posterior junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simões et al., 2017</xref>). In the mouse gastrula, we found that cells undergoing EMT contract and lose cell-cell junctions in an asynchronous manner without apparent planar polarity. Our analyses of the junctional distribution of myosin II supports its potential involvement in regulating apical constriction during cell ingression, but does not exclude an additional role played by a medial pool. Pulsed actomyosin activity has been documented during various processes involving cell shape changes, including epithelial apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coravos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heer and Martin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>). The pulsed constriction we observe in mouse gastrulation indicates conservation of this actomyosin behavior as a general mechanism that integrates assembly and disassembly of the network and rearrangement and recruitment of myosin and actin molecules. Furthermore, pulsed contractility could allow a substantial but transient constriction of epiblast apical surfaces during ingression without creating deleterious tension which could impact tissue integrity.</p><p>Since a large numbers of cells undergo EMT and leave the epiblast epithelium at any given time, simultaneous constriction and ingression of multiple neighboring cells could exert extreme tension and deformation in the tissue. Our observation of scattered and asynchronous constriction and ingression of cells at the mouse primitive streak provides a parsimonious explanation for maintaining epithelial integrity, and a continuation of ingression events for over 24 hr throughout gastrulation, in comparison to <italic>Drosophila</italic> gastrulation where all ventral furrow cells form the mesoderm layer in approximately 1 hr. Cell division taking place on the basal side of the epiblast layer has been reported at the primitive streak where it has been proposed to facilitate cell ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mathiah et al., 2020</xref>). Apical constriction and basal cell division could therefore work in concert to promote the correct number of cell ingression events.</p><p>Myosin II is a driver of membrane movement and apical constriction in various contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">An et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mason et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roh-Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simões et al., 2017</xref>). Crumbs2 is involved in the EMT process during mouse gastrulation and exhibits a reciprocal enrichment to myosin heavy chain IIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramkumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The anisotropic membrane localization of Crumbs has been implicated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland development, where it controls the localization of actomyosin cables at the placode border, necessary for apical constriction and tissue invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Röper, 2012</xref>). Recently, Crumbs has also been implicated in apical constriction during neuroblast cell ingression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simões et al., 2022</xref>). We observed the anisotropic and reciprocal enrichment of Crumbs2 and myosin heavy chain IIB, and have identified other proteins exhibiting anisotropic distributions. Although myosin heavy chain IIB, F-actin, aPKC, and ZO-1 are present on all apical junctions, they exhibit a differential anisotropic accumulations between the junctions of any one cell. Other proteins such as ppMRLC and the myosin kinase Rock1, as well as Crumbs2 and its partner PatJ exhibited a higher level of anisotropy. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland placode border, Crumbs and myosin-2 show planar polarized localization with Crumbs being absent from cell junctions that contact the border of the placode, allowing the accumulation of myosin-2 at the placode border and formation of a supracellular actomyosin cable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Röper, 2012</xref>). By contrast, our results in mouse show that Crumbs2, myosin heavy chain IIB, and several other proteins do not exhibit planar polarity, but instead exhibit a disordered anisotropy. Our studies reveal a patterned distribution in which actomyosin regulators and Crumbs2, aPKC, and ZO-1 accumulate on subsets of cell junctions where they display reciprocal enrichment. We hypothesize that these anisotropic distributions are dynamic, and serve to control the asynchronous junction contraction associated with apical constriction.</p><p>Crumbs acts through aPKC and Rock to regulate myosin II localization in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Röper, 2012</xref>), and aPKC has been shown to regulate myosin II junctional localization and activity both positively and negatively in different context, directly or through other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biehler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishiuchi and Takeichi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrov et al., 2017</xref>). The regulation of myosin II by Crumbs and aPKC through Rock in <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland development is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sidor et al., 2020</xref>), and despite Rock membrane association being tightly regulated by Crumbs across the tissue, regionally distinct behaviors have been observed. At placode borders, cells exhibit a polarized accumulation of Crumbs/aPKC and Rock to control actomyosin cable formation, whereas in the center, where cells constrict during the tissue invagination, both Crumbs and Rock are isotropically present at junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sidor et al., 2020</xref>). Our results demonstrate that during mouse gastrulation Crumbs2 controls the apical accumulation and activity of actomyosin, which could account for the defects in apical constriction and ingression in <italic>Crb</italic>2 mutants. We observed Crumbs2 as required for the correct accumulation and distribution of aPKC, myosin heavy chain IIB, Rock1, and F-actin at apical junctions, without alteration of junctional integrity. Crumbs2 along with aPKC could control the anisotropic accumulation of actomyosin, triggering asynchronous junctional reductions resulting in apical constriction during ingression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The defects observed in <italic>Crb</italic>2 mutant embryos are complex; epiblast cells residing both at, and beyond, the primitive streak exhibit reduced apical surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramkumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since a large number of cells fail to ingress and remain within the epiblast layer of <italic>Crb</italic>2 mutants, this results in cell crowding which could lead to changes in cell shape, including a reduction of apical surfaces.</p><p>Our work reveals that pulsed ratchet-like constriction behaviors observed in different species and distinct contexts are conserved in the mouse gastrulation EMT. Crumbs2 together with aPKC and Rock1 could be involved in a network required for myosin II localization and activity at the apical membrane of ingressing mouse epiblast cells. Crumbs2 can potentially also regulate the anisotropic accumulation of the actomyosin network locally at junctions of single cell, facilitating correct apical constriction during ingression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The defects observed in <italic>Crb</italic>2 mutants and the role of Crumbs2 in ingression appear very complex. Further studies will be necessary to determine why Crumbs2 is not required for cell ingression at the onset of gastrulation, and to glean its detailed mechanistic role in cell shape changes, notably apical constriction, but potentially also other membrane movements associated with cell ingression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>FVB or mixed background mice were used for immunofluorescence staining.

Layers of tape were placed on both extremity of the slide to create a slight volume and to avoid extensive compression and flattening of the tissue. The position of the primitive streak was determined to coincide with the posterior midline running from the allantois to the node (two morphologically distinguishable structures), and streak axis was oriented so that the proximo-distal axis was oriented along the vertical axis of the image. Most immunostaining revealed a high concentration of puncta also allowing us to identify the location of the primitive streak after imaging. Embryos were imaged on inverted Leica SP8 or Zeiss LSM880 laser point scanning confocal using 40× oil immersion objectives, with the apical surface of epiblast cells closest to the objective, and images were acquired as Z-stacks with 1 µm step.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Segmentation and quantification of fixed embryo staining</title><p>Confocal images were analyzed using ImageJ.

Briefly, a first membrane segmentation was automatically performed, and then verified and corrected manually. Cells and junctions were tracked and assigned IDs. Most cell parameters used were calculated by the software, including apical surface area, cell elongation magnitude and orientation, number of junctions per cell, and signal intensities along junctions. In brief, cell surface elongation is characterized by an axis and magnitude, and can be represented by a symmetric tensor at the centroid of a cell (images with red nematic bars). Calculation integrates cell area and shape so that cells of similar shape with different sizes are assigned the same value of cell elongation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aigouy et al., 2016</xref>, for detailed equations).</p><p>Color-coded representations of apical surface area, surface elongation, and junction number were generated in Tissue Analyzer.

Anisotropy parameters were calculated from junctional intensities measured within Tissue Analyzer. Intensities were measured along three pixel-wide lines (~500 nm), measurements were extracted from a database created by the software and used externally for calculations. For each single cell analyzed, the mean junction intensity was used to calculate per cell, the SD between the intensity of all junctions, and the junction with the maximal intensity divided by the junction with the minimal intensity (Max/Min ratio). These two parameters were used to evaluate the anisotropic accumulation of proteins at apical junctions. Double immunostainings were used to assess correlative accumulation of proteins, and mean junction intensities were used to create scatter plots to evaluate the dispersion of the intensity across the populations, and their correlation coefficients. Generally, measurements taken of junctions from different embryos were pooled, except for a few examples in which junctions were grouped by individual cells to evaluate the range of anisotropy in different cells.</p><p>For planar polarity of protein localization at apical junctions, Tissue Analyzer calculates a planar polarity characterized by an axis and magnitude, and can be represented by a symmetric tensor at the centroid of a cell (images with red nematic bars).

For F-actin quantification, junctional values represent the intensity measured at the peripheral cortex and the medial values the intensity measured in the medial/cytoplasmic area of the same cells. For quantifications of myosin heavy chain IIB, ppMRLC, aPKC, and Rock1, junctional signal intensities were normalized to the cytoplasmic medial signal intensities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Time-lapse imaging</title><p>For time-lapse imaging, mid- to late-streak stage embryos (E7.5) were dissected with their yolk sac and ectoplacental cone intact in dissection medium (CO<sub>2</sub>-independent DMEM, 10%FBS) at 37°C. Embryos were stabilized in a depression created in a layer of collagen matrix and imaged in glass-bottom 35 mm MatTek dishes. They were placed with their posterior side facing the objective and culture in 50% rat serum/50% DMEM media in an incubation chamber at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Embryos were imaged for a total of 3–6 hr with Z-stacks of 1 µm step acquired every 5 min (minimum time-scale possible to keep embryo and fluorescent signal integrity) on a Leica SP8 laser point scanning confocal or a Nikon A1RHD25 high-speed resonant scanning confocal with 40× objectives. Imaging usually focused on regions of interest in the proximo-distal middle of the primitive steak where the epiblast is the least curved and optimal for image data acquisition and analysis. Since imaging the apical surface of epiblast cells in living mouse embryos is challenging, we evaluated time-lapse experiments on several different microscope systems (laser point scanning confocal, spinning disc, light-sheet). The high-speed resonant scanning confocal (Nikon A1R) allowed us to obtain the best spatial and time resolution, while keeping embryos alive and preserving fluorescent signal integrity. Under these conditions, using the Nikon A1R system, we were unable to acquire images with time resolutions shorter than 5 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Dynamic images analysis and quantification</title><p>Membrane-GFP from <italic>mT/mG</italic> embryos was used to observe apical constriction associated with cell ingression at the primitive streak. For all other imaging and quantification, a ZO-1-GFP knock-in reporter was used as it generally gave the best signal-to-noise enabling observation of apical surfaces of epiblast cells. Analyses were performed in ImageJ and Tissue Analyzer on maximal projections of Z-stacks. Cell tracking in the plane of the epithelium was performed manually using the Manual Tracking plugin in ImageJ. To quantify ingression events, small areas of interest in the vicinity of the primitive streak, corresponding to an ~40 µm region along the predicted midline, were analyzed. All cells were tracked for at least 1 hr, and constriction and ingression events were identified to calculate the ratio of ingression events per hour. Ingression events were considered isolated when the constriction and disappearance of a cell occurred within 30 min or more of the ingression of adjacent neighboring cells, and clustered when occurring within a 30 min window of the ingression of adjacent neighboring cells (two to four cells in different clustered events).</p><p>For dynamic analysis of apical surfaces, small regions of interest at the primitive streak were used for segmentation with Tissue Analyzer. A first segmentation was automatically generated by the software, then each time point manually corrected. Cell parameters, including apical surface area, surface elongation index, and orientation and number of edges, were extracted from the segmentation database, and graphs were plotted using GraphPad Prism.</p><p>The beginning of cell constriction associated with an ingression event was defined as the point when cells started to reduce their apical surface area after a period of oscillation, and so continually until they completely lost their apical domain. The start of constriction was defined as t0 when the apical surface area, rate of change of surface area, and other parameters were plotted against time. Changes in apical surface area (constriction rate) was defined as the inverse value of the derivative of apical surface area: Δarea(t)=area(t-1) – area(t). Oscillations of surface area in epiblast cells away from the primitive streak and before the initiation of ingression were compared with the more dramatic changes in surface area during the constriction period. During ingression, a constriction pulse was defined as an event in which the contraction rate exceeded one SD above the mean of the contraction rate of epiblast cells (above 0.7 µm<sup>2</sup>/min). The number of pulses, occurrence of pulse, and pulse magnitude were quantified manually for each constriction period of each cell and each pulse. The calculated apical area rate of change was integrated in the Tissue Analyzer database, and used to generate color-coded movie representations of surface area, area rate of changes, cell elongation, number of junctions, and junction length. As for fixed embryo analysis, surface elongation index (magnitude) calculated by the software is represented as an index from 0 (round) to 1 (line). Surface elongation is characterized by an axis and magnitude, and is represented by a symmetric tensor at the centroid of a cell (red nematic bars).</p><p>Changes in junction length (shrinkage rate) was defined similarly to cell area changes, as the inverse value of the derivative of junction length: Δlength(t)=length(t-1) – length(t). To analyze and compare junctions length changes over time, correlation of pairs of junctions were quantified and plot as correlation matrix to illustrate a single cell or correlation coefficient plot for pool of single cells. The average shrinkage rate of single junctions during consecutive cell constriction pulses and stable phases was calculated to visualize the asynchronous and differential shrinkage of junctions during single-cell constriction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>Three to six embryos were analyzed for each experiment.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ann Sutherland (Reviewer #1); Jean-Léon Maître (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a nicely done paper with high-quality movies and images, representing a major strength. The main weakness is that many of the claims are based on somewhat unsubstantiated correlations that require further validation. We refer you to the full reports of the reviewers for details.</p><p>1. The issues of temporal resolution and IF quantitation as outlined in the reviews are important to address.</p><p>2. The crumbs2 -/- embryos should be more carefully looked into. This would require extra analyses.</p><p>3. The discrepancies between the findings here and previous publications on crumbs2 should be addressed as they lead to contradictory interpretations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done an exceptional job of documenting both the cell behavior and the patterns of protein localization and their correlation. It is a clear model for the rest of the field to follow in evaluating these aspects of development in any system.</p><p>This meticulous approach is not as clearly evident in the data on the Crumbs2 mutant embryo. Here the authors show localization data, but no live imaging to be able to compare the behavior in the mutant to the wild type. It would seem obvious, given the data obtained from the WT, that a comparable evaluation of the Crumbs2 mutant might show which aspect of the behavior is affected, and thus where Crumbs2 is having its effect. In addition, the findings of the previous publication on Crumbs2 (Ramkumar et al., 2016, also from the Anderson lab) do not support the model proposed here, and in fact, contradict it. The authors should discuss this at the very least and might want to alter their model for the action of Crumbs2 based on it. Related to this, the statement on p18, line 461 that &quot;Epiblast cells fail to ingress…&quot; in the mutant should be more nuanced – they do ingress early, but appear to fail at later stages. Data on the difference in ingression behavior between these stages would be really valuable. This may be beyond the scope of this manuscript, but should be considered. There are many aspects to the Crumbs2 mutant that are not well explained, and seem to be glossed over in favor of a simple explanation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The imaging performed by the authors is fantastic and the analysis is very insightful.

When comparing intensity between WT and Crumbs2 mutants, how do the authors know that they are not measuring a difference in light penetration through the tissue (for example if the mutants would be thicker than WT)? Fluorescence intensities need to be normalized within objects within the same confocal plane (provided that illumination is homogeneous). It seems that the junction to the medial signal is affected by actin F7B. Why not use the same kind of normalization for other markers? If the authors want to claim that there would be less myosin, aPKC, Rock1 in Crumbs2 mutants, they need to take a different approach (ex: qPCR, Western blot). In the end, I think the authors make their point with F7D. Are the SD and max/min values normalized to the mean value of the batch of embryos as well?

However, due to the technically challenging nature of the live imaging experiments performed for this study, for example the apical surfaces of epiblast cells being at the farthest point from the imaging objective, and the dim signal of the fluorescent reporters being used, we were unable to acquire data on the necessary n=3 stage-matched <italic>Crumbs2</italic> mutant embryos.</p><p>Recognizing this gap in knowledge and to make such experiments feasible, we are establishing an alternative image acquisition pipeline making improvements in image data acquisition in particular using alternative microscopic imaging modalities (for example using light-sheet microcopy).

The precise details of the defect observed in <italic>Crumbs2</italic> mutants are still not totally clear. However, we would like to point out that in Ramkumar et al., the timelapse data did not show cells constricting their surfaces, but rather these data revealed that cells having small apical surfaces failed to detach and ingress out of the epiblast layer. Thus, this previous study focused on the subsequent step in the process to that being addressed in the present work.</p><p>Furthermore, epiblast cells outside the domain occupied by the primitive streak and even some cells positioned on the lateral sides of the embryo were reported to exhibit abnormally small apical surfaces. These cells will not normally constrict their apical surfaces, since they are not going to undergo the gastrulation EMT, which is a behavior restricted to the region of the primitive streak. In sum, these previous data do not directly address nor demonstrate that epiblast cells in <italic>Crumbs2</italic> mutants undergo apical constriction.</p><p>Moreover, in <italic>Crumbs2</italic> mutants a large number of cells were reported to fail to ingress at the primitive streak, and consequently they were seen to accumulated within the epiblast epithelial layer. Indeed, we believe that the small apical surfaces observed in <italic>Crumbs2</italic> mutants, are most likely to result from the crowding/jamming of cells within the epiblast layer, and that this causes changes in the shape and volume of cells due to them being spatially constrained. Thus, increased crowding of epithelial cells within a spatially constrained tissue, likely drives reduced apical surfaces and extensive apico-basal elongation, as observed in <italic>Crumbs2</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, the statement on p18, line 461 that &quot;Epiblast cells fail to ingress…&quot; in the mutant should be more nuanced – they do ingress early, but appear to fail at later stages.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a good point regarding the <italic>Crumbs2</italic> mutant phenotype. It is true that in this mutant, a first wave of gastrulation EMT is observed at E6.5. We interpret this to mean that Crumbs2 is not required at the onset of the gastrulation EMT, as the first cells ingress through the primitive streak. Consequently, a small number of mesodermal cells are produced. However, ingression defects in <italic>Crumbs2</italic> mutant embryos are evident within 24hours and are evident by E7.75.</p><p>These distinct sequential phases of gastrulation regulation, initially independent of Crumbs2, but subsequently dependent, were not initially discussed in our manuscript for simplicity, but we have now elaborated these details in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data on the difference in ingression behavior between these stages would be really valuable.

However, we need to take into account that imaging the apical surface of cells within the epiblast layer, which constitutes the most internal surface inside the embryo, is a very challenging task to perform in a gastrulating mouse embryo.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we attempted to image with a shorter time interval than 5min on several different microscope systems and modalities available at our institution (including laser point scanning confocal, spinning disc, light-sheet microscopes) and were not successful in acquiring usable images with the ZO1-GFP knock-in reporter. We also need to take into account that these single-copy GFP knock-in reporters are often dim, thereby exacerbating the issue. In our hands, a high-speed resonant scanning confocal (Nikon A1RHD25) is the system that gave us the best signal-to-noise ratio, spatial resolution and temporal resolution, and was the one used for our most recent movies. Using this system, we were able to acquire a limited number of time-lapses with a time resolution of 2min, but none with a shorter time interval, and from our analyses 2min time intervals did not yield increased detail over 5min time intervals to warrant a detailed analysis.</p><p>We have provided a detailed discussion of these issues within the revised manuscript and edited some of the conclusions.</p><p>A constriction pulse was defined as an event in which the contraction rate exceeded one standard deviation above the mean of the contraction rate of epiblast cells (above 0.7 μm2/min).</p><p>The asynchronous reduction of junctions has been analyzed in several cells from different embryos.

Immunostaining is not a quantitative method, even if the staining and imaging are performed in the same conditions.

We believe he junctional reduction of Myosin, aPKC and Rock1 are generally due to a nonrecruitment or activation at the junctions, and not necessarily reflecting reduced expression at the gene or protein level. We do not believe that methods such as RTqPCR or Western blotting would be informative in the context in which we are looking, especially since they do not yield spatial resolution. Furthermore, we would need to isolate primitive streak cells to consider applying these methods, and we do not believe they would provide sufficient resolution.</p><p>By contrast to the live imaging (Figure 1) which was performed by placing the objective at the posterior side of the embryo in closest proximity to the outer visceral endoderm layer, for fixed tissue imaging embryos were microdissected to recover the posterior side containing the primitive streak, and were imaged on the side of the cavity by placing the objective in closest proximity to the inner epiblast layer, for direct access to the apical surface of epiblast cells at the streak. In this fixed tissue imaging configuration, the apical surfaces of cells in WT and <italic>Crumbs2</italic> mutants were in closest proximity to the imaging objective and thus directly accessible, and the difference in tissue thickness on the other side of the epithelium did not interfere with light penetration. We have edited the figures to clarify how the objective positions are flipped with respect to the primitive streak regions at the embryo’s posterior for live vs. fixed tissue imaging. We have now measured the signal intensity in the cytoplasmic region of WT and <italic>Crumbs2</italic> mutant embryos, and junctional intensity measurements have been normalized to cytoplasmic intensities.</p><p>For the SD and Max/Min data, the intensity values have been normalized to the mean before calculating the SD and Max/Min, but these are not normalized again after calculation.

Figure 5D shows a mix of cells with some having a correlated accumulation, some with very little correlation and others with anti-correlated accumulation.
