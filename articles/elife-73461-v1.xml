The evolution of their dermal skull and dentition is relatively well understood, but this is not the case for the central nervous system. While the brain has poor preservation potential and is not currently known in any fossil lungfish, substantial indirect information about it and associated structures (e.g. labyrinths) can be obtained from the cranial endocast. However, before the recent development of X-ray tomography as a palaeontological tool, these endocasts could not be studied non-destructively, and few detailed studies were undertaken. Here, we describe and illustrate the endocasts of six Palaeozoic lungfish from tomographic scans. We combine these with six previously described digital lungfish endocasts (4 fossil and 2 recent taxa) into a 12-taxon dataset for multivariate morphometric analysis using 17 variables. We find that the olfactory region is more highly plastic than the hindbrain, and undergoes significant elongation in several taxa. Further, while the semicircular canals covary as an integrated module, the utriculus and sacculus vary independently of each other. Functional interpretation suggests that olfaction has remained a dominant sense throughout lungfish evolution, and changes in the labyrinth may potentially reflect a change from nektonic to near-shore environmental niches. Phylogenetic implications show that endocranial form fails to support monophyly of the ‘chirodipterids’. Those with elongated crania similarly fail to form a distinct clade, suggesting these two paraphyletic groups have converged towards either head elongation or truncation driven by non-phylogenetic constraints.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dipnoi</kwd><kwd>endocast</kwd><kwd>tomography</kwd><kwd>palaeoneurology</kwd><kwd>palaeozoic</kwd><kwd>PCA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP160102460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clement</surname><given-names>Alice M</given-names></name><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP200103398</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clement</surname><given-names>Alice M</given-names></name><name><surname>Cloutier</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><name><surname>Collin</surname><given-names>Shaun P</given-names></name><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001785</institution-id><institution>Flinders University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Impact Seed Funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clement</surname><given-names>Alice M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001785</institution-id><institution>Flinders University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Visiting International Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Challands</surname><given-names>Tom J</given-names></name><name><surname>Cloutier</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahlberg</surname><given-names>Per E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cloutier</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Callidus Services Ltd UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Challands</surname><given-names>Tom J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cranial endocasts of fossil and extant lungfish, analysed via tomography and novel principle component analyses designed for use with missing data, show that lungfish forebrain and inner ear regions show the most variation in brain shape evolution through time.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The field of palaeoneurology was founded a century ago and is a long-established branch of inquiry into fossil vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edinger, 1921</xref>). However relatively little attention has been given to investigation into the evolution of the brain in fossil fishes, most likely due to the fact that the brain-braincase relationship is generally not as close as in “higher” vertebrates such as birds and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jerison, 1973</xref>). Nevertheless, there were some pioneering early works specifically investigating fossil fishes which laid the foundation for further palaeoneurological research in early vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janvier, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jarvik, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jarvik, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stensiö, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stensiö, 1927</xref>). These days modern advances in imaging technologies are transforming the palaeoneurological landscape, enabling more in-depth investigations of structure-function relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Walsh and Knoll, 2011</xref>), including in early vertebrates.</p><p>Lungfish represent a unique evolutionary lineage, which has persisted for over 400 million years. Their crania differ quite remarkably from other sarcopterygian fishes in having lost the intracranial joint, possession of an autostylic jaw suspension, unique dentition and differences in the number and arrangement of dermal skull bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schultze, 1986</xref>). Homologues of skull roofing bones across sarcopterygians were difficult to identify, leading to the adoption of an alternate (and unique) labelling scheme that continues to be used today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forster-Cooper, 1937</xref>), with additions and updates from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahlberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cloutier, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miles, 1977</xref>. Furthermore, lungfish skulls have undergone considerable reduction in the degree of ossification and the fusion and/or loss of bone, leading to a massive (~10-fold) reduction in the number of dermal skull bones present in extant Dipnoi compared to some Devonian forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Criswell, 2015</xref>). However, there has been relatively little attention paid to examining brain evolution in early lungfish (Dipnoi), despite the crania of a large number of fossils having been described since early in the 19th Century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sedgwick and Murchison, 1828</xref>), more than 100 fossil lungfish taxa described, and renewed taxonomic interest in lungfish as the extant sister group of the tetrapods.</p><p>While aspects of the anatomy of the central nervous system in extant lungfish have been known for close to 150 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Collin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huxley, 1876</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Northcutt, 1986</xref>), it was only recently that the specific spatial relationship between the brain and the endocranial cavity was investigated. This was examined first in the Australian lungfish, <italic>Neoceratodus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clement et al., 2015</xref>), and later in the lepidosirenid lungfish (<italic>Lepidosiren</italic> and <italic>Protopterus</italic>) and other piscine sarcopterygians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Challands et al., 2020</xref>). It was found that contrary to earlier reports of the lungfish brain filling just a fraction (10%) of its brain cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jerison, 1973</xref>), values in fact ranged between 40% and 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Challands et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clement et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clement et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, these studies highlighted that the forebrain and labyrinth regions in particular had a close correspondance between brain and endocast, in comparison with the mid and hindbrain regions with a looser association.</p><p>Currently, only eight species of fossil lungfish have had the endocast (the negative space within the cranium) described or illustrated in any considerable manner (either full or partial), and are all of Devonian age. These include <italic>Dipnorhynchus sussmilchi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell and Barwick, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clement et al., 2016a</xref>), <italic>Chirodipterus wildungensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Säve-Söderbergh, 1952</xref>), ‘<italic>Chirodipterus’ australis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henderson and Challands, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miles, 1977</xref>), <italic>Griphognathus whitei</italic> and <italic>Holodipterus gogoensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miles, 1977</xref>), <italic>Dipnorhynchus kurikae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Barwick, 2000</xref>), <italic>Rhinodipterus kimberleyensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clement and Ahlberg, 2014</xref>), and <italic>Dipterus valenciennesi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Challands, 2015</xref>). Additional fragmentary neurocranial information is also known in <italic>Scaumenacia curta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boirot and Challands, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Some early investigations into fossil lungfish endocranial morphology led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stensiö, 1963</xref> to suggest that the dipnoan brain 'type' had developed by the beginning of the Devonian and has not undergone any significant changes since that time. However, recent work has shown that the endocasts of some Devonian lungfish continued to change in morphology with the acquisition of new characters certainly into the Upper Devonian period, while also retaining other primitive characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Challands, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clement and Ahlberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clement et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>The polarity of such characters in the cranial endocasts of fossil lungfish has largely been determined by reference to brains of extant taxa; the Lepidosireniformes (<italic>Protopterus</italic> and <italic>Lepidosiren</italic>) and the Ceratodontiformes (<italic>Neoceratodus</italic>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Northcutt, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Northcutt, 2011</xref> stated that pedunculate olfactory bulbs are the likely primitive state in the Dipnoi as this characteristic is observed in <italic>Neoceratodus</italic>, (considered the most morphologically conservative of the extant dipnoan taxa), and also in the extant coelacanth <italic>Latimeria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dutel et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, pedunculate olfactory bulbs are also seen in stem osteichthyans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clement et al., 2018</xref>), as well as several more basal outgroups such as placoderms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Determining the polarity of endocast characters is important at this juncture in dipnoan palaeoneurological research as we are now in a position to recognise and apply more neurocranial characters to phylogenetic analyses. Following on from Friedman’s detailed analysis of lungfish interrelationships based on neurocranial evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedman, 2007</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clement et al., 2016a</xref> conducted the first phylogenetic analysis of Palaeozoic lungfish based entirely on endocast characters, further emphasising their use for such studies. Despite the problematic homology of dermal bones, endocranial anatomy tends to be far more conserved in vertebrates and thus highly valuable for comparative analysis.</p><p>Here, we investigate the endocranial morphology of six Devonian dipnoans (<italic>Iowadipterus halli, Gogodipterus paddyensis, Pillararhynchus longi, Griphognathus whitei, Orlovichthys limnatis,</italic> and <italic>Rhinodipterus ulrichi</italic>) from synchrotron and computed tomography (CT), and compare them with those taxa already known (fossil and extant) using multivariate morphometric analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We hypothesise that, just as cranial elongation manifests in numerous ways by lengthening of either the snout, jaw or cheek regions, the neurocranium (and by consequence, the endocasts) of Devonian lungfish will have also accommodated elongation by modifying different regions to varying extents.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endocast of <italic>Griphognathus whitei</italic> (NHMUK PV P56054) in (<bold>a</bold>), dorsal; (<bold>b, c</bold>), lateral; (<bold>d</bold>), ventral views.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-73461-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Description of endocasts</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title><italic>Griphognathus whitei</italic> (NHMUK PV P56054)</title><p>The skull and endocast of <italic>Griphognathus whitei</italic> show the extremity of the elongated morphotype; the endocast is more than four times longer than it is wide, measuring 130 mm in length but less than 30 mm in width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, it is the olfactory region and forebrain (comprising the olfactory lobes, telencephalon and diencephalon) that have undergone significant elongation, with the mid and hind-brain of similar proportion to that in several other taxa (e.g. <italic>Rhinodipterus</italic> spp.). The shape of the nasal capsules is distinct from other lungfish, in being particularly elongate, forming narrow, oblong ovals. They are situated at the anterior end of remarkably long olfactory canals (comprising almost half the length of the entire endocast) that diverge from each other narrowly at 11°. Numerous canals that may contribute to a medial canal meshwork emanate from the dorsal surface of the olfactory tracts. The lateral branch of the canal for the ramus ophthalmicus profundus n.V and the canal for the ramus buccalis n.VII pass mediodorsally and lateral to the nasal capsule respectively whereas the lateral branch of the nasal vein enters the posterior wall of the nasal capsule.</p><p>The telencephalon is elongate with a distinct subpallium. A canal for the anterior cerebral vein is present dorsally on the telencephalon and is distinguished from a pineal eminence by it projecting laterally and curving ventrally. The hypophyseal recess is small and does not protrude far ventrally as in most other lungfish. There are several small canals exiting the hypophyseal recess. To the anterior a single canal exits and then divides representing the canal for the palatine artery. The canal for the pituitary vein is small and exits antero-lateral and slightly dorsal to the canal for the palatine artery. Emanating from the postero-lateral region of the hypophyseal recess the canals for the pseudobranchial arteries are present.</p><p>The mesencephalic region of the endocast is not well preserved and its dorsal margin is incomplete, although it appears to have been narrow and short. The rhombencephalic region appears relatively conserved and is similar in proportion to <italic>Rhinodipterus kimberleyensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clement and Ahlberg, 2014</xref>) of unremarkable length or width, and with space for housing the endolymphatic ducts in the supraoptic cavities dorsally. Unusually, the canals for the trigeminal complex (n.V) do not protrude far laterally in <italic>Griphognathus</italic> and are relatively difficult to discern.</p><p>Within the inner ear, the semicircular canals are thin and follow a less circular arc than in <italic>Chirodipterus</italic> and <italic>Gogodipterus</italic>, with the posterior and lateral canals being longer than the anterior canal. The lateral and anterior canals bear prominent swelling (for their ampullae) at their bases, while the ampulla in the posterior canal is less well defined. The sinus superior reaches the same level dorsally as the endolymphatic ducts above the roof of the cranial cavity. The utricular recess is relatively large and oblong when viewed laterally, while the sacculus is not as clearly defined as that in <italic>Rhinodipterus</italic>, and its pouches are separated widely from each other, thereby allowing space for a large notochord.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title><italic>Iowadipterus halli</italic> (FMNH PF 12323)</title><p>Although the resolution of the scan data in <italic>Iowadipterus halli</italic> does not allow for fine detail to be elucidated, overall morphology of the endocast and several other features can nevertheless be recognised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

There are no discernible divisions within the two capsules. The large canals for the olfactory nerves (n.I) enter the nasal sacs in their posteromediodorsal region. Below these nerves, there are two other canals exiting the nasal capsule posterolaterally; the larger canal likely contained the orbitonasal vein, and smaller canal likely contained the palatine nerve (VII). The olfactory canals diverge at around 45° from each other. They remain relatively narrow except for a slight bulge just anterior of where they join the telencephalic region, suggesting that these swellings housed sessile olfactory bulbs. On the right side, there is a single canal exiting dorsally from one of these swellings, before changing course to an anterolateral direction. This may represent a branch of the anterior cerebral vein.</p><p>The forebrain region is narrow but dorsoventrally raised. It is dominated by a large single recess for the pineal organ, extending anterodorsally over the junction of the olfactory canals and the telencephalon. In line with the pineal eminence, but situated ventrally, are the two large olfactory canals. Anterior to these in ventral view, a slight swelling for the telencephalon can be seen. In the diencephalic region the hypophyseal recess extends directly ventrally beneath the cranial cavity. Two pairs of canals exit the hypophysis; furthest ventrally and extending anterolaterally is the canal for the ophthalmic artery, and those extending directly laterally carried the pituitary vein.</p><p>The midbrain is wider than the preceding forebrain but much shallower. The dome for the mesencephalon represents the highest dorsal extent of the cranial cavity. On the left side of the specimen, a small canal situated midway up the cranial cavity wall would have housed the oculomotor nerve (n.III), and further dorsal to this is another opening, which may represent the remains of the trochlear canal (n.IV).</p><p>The anterior metencephalic region is marked by a large bifurcating canal for the trigeminal nerves (n.V<sub>1</sub> and n.V<sub>2&amp;3</sub>) projecting laterally. Just posterodorsal to these are the similarly large canals for the facial nerves (n.VII), which soon reconnect with n.V<sub>2&amp;3</sub>.

Each canal possesses a sizeable elongate expansion (ampulla) at its base. The crus commune is situated ventral to the highest points of the anterior and posterior semicircular canals, and the sinus superior is also prominent above the roof of the cranial cavity. The posterior canal is the longest of the three semicircular canals, joining with and at the level of the lateral canal, rather than inserting on top of it as the anterior semicircular canal. The lateral canal is the shortest of the three semicircular canals.

The projection of axes PC2 and PC3, which accounts for 19.36% of the variation, permits a better visualization of the integration and contrasts among variables.

However, from the Late Devonian-Carboniferous onwards, many undergo a decline in the degree of ossification as their skeleton becomes more cartilaginous. This reduction in the dipnoan cranial dermal skeleton was likely accompanied by some changes in the cranial cavity form, but this level of increasingly poor ossification of the neurocranium in those taxa limits our possible comparisons to between the more heavily ossified Devonian forms and extant taxa only. Consequently, some of the oldest lungfish taxa are the most completely known, especially with respect to neurocranial morphology. With the exception of the Permian lungfish <italic>Persephonichthys chthonica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pardo et al., 2014</xref>), no post-Devonian fossil taxa have had their cranial endocasts described. We acknowledge that our investigation of lungfish brain evolution as elucidated from morphometric analysis of cranial endocasts is still preliminary in several respects. Due to the extreme age and rarity of 3D preserved lungfish endocrania, we used all material available to us. Admittedly we cannot hope to control for many factors, including ontogeny, so our interpretations must naturally take that into consideration. However, we hope that our study inspires future work on the neural evolution of both fossil and extant lungfish.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Implications for sensory abilities in early lungfish</title><p>Overall, there is considerable variation in the shape and relative proportions of the endocasts examined. <italic>Griphognathus whitei</italic> stands out as the most extreme case of elongation of the olfactory region, whereas other taxa, such as <italic>Iowadipterus halli,</italic> appear to elongate the midbrain region, whilst retaining very short olfactory canals and more conventionally-shaped nasal capsules (rounded to slightly oval). Although only a partial endocast, <italic>Gogodipterus paddyensis</italic> is nearly indistinguishable from <italic>Pillararhynchus longi</italic> in labyrinth morphology. All ‘chirodipterid’ taxa (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedman, 2007</xref>) appear to share mediolaterally-oriented nasal capsules, close to equidimensional circular arcs of their semicircular canals and a broad angle of bifurcation between the olfactory canals. Despite this, the ‘chirodipterid’ taxa do not consistently cluster together in the analyses, giving further weight to the proposition that these taxa form a paraphyletic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedman, 2007</xref>).</p><p><italic>Rhinodipterus ulrichi</italic> and <italic>‘Chirodipterus’ australis</italic> have endocasts with strongly anteroventrally-directed fore/midbrain portions in comparison with the hindbrain, while presumed close relatives <italic>R. kimberleyensis</italic> and other ‘chirodipterid’ taxa do not display this character. Aside from this, the endocasts of the two <italic>Rhinodipterus</italic> species are broadly similar to each other – the absence of an eminence for the pineal organ in <italic>R. kimberleyensis</italic> is likely simply a preservational artefact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clement and Ahlberg, 2014</xref>). The hypophyseal recess varies from being directed ventrally (<italic>R. kimberleyensis, Orlovichthys limnatis, P. longi</italic>) or posteroventrally (<italic>Dipnorhynchus</italic> spp.<italic>, Dipterus valenciennesi, R. ulrichi</italic>).</p><p>The length of the olfactory canals (usually incorporating olfactory nerve, bulb and tract) and their angle of bifurcation are one of the largest sources of variation among endocasts of different lungfish taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and unsurprisingly, these two features are strongly linked. The shape of the olfactory capsules appears highly variable in Devonian lungfish endocasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). These are most commonly oval-shaped, although the orientation can vary. Others are highly elongate as in <italic>Griphognathus whitei</italic>, to triangular in ‘<italic>Chirodipterus’ australis</italic>. Our study simply captured length but future work on shape and orientation may prove pertinent to the overall plasticity of the olfactory region. The other strongest signals from our data concern the labyrinths, specifically the size and shape of the sacculus, utriculus and the semicircular canals. The semicircular canals (arc height, length, and width) tend to covary as an integrated module, whereas the utriculus and sacculus vary independently of each other. The sacculus is better integrated with the semicircular canals than the utriculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), suggesting a modular dissociation.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Palaeozoic lungfish endocasts in dorsal, ventral, and left lateral views, placed onto phylogeny adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Challands et al., 2019</xref> .</title><p>*The following endocasts were first published elsewhere but new images were created for inclusion in this figure: <italic>Rhinodipterus kimberleyensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clement and Ahlberg, 2014</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>; <italic>Dipterus valenciennesi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Challands, 2015</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>; <italic>‘Chirodipterus’ australis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henderson and Challands, 2018</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>; <italic>Dipnorhynchus sussmilchi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clement et al., 2016a</xref>) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-73461-fig12-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Taken together, our analyses suggest that the olfactory and labyrinth regions are more plastic and may reflect species differences in chemosensory and vestibular sensitivity (and potentially auditory) abilities, whereas the hindbrain remains more conserved. These findings are of note as the olfactory region seems to be changing independently from all other endocast variables, despite elongated dermal crania being modified in different ways (e.g. elongation of the dermal snout, cheek, or jaws). A similar finding has been established for extant cartilaginous fishes, where the olfactory bulbs maintain a substantial level of allometric independence from the rest of the brain in more than 100 species, reflecting differences in ecological niche, particularly habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yopak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yopak et al., 2019</xref>), a relationship which is common to other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yopak et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that these species of lungfish may have had different olfactory abilities for various survival tasks including localizing prey, avoiding predators, and chemosensory communication with conspecifics.</p><p>The inner ears are comprised of a superior division containing the semicircular canals, which are predominantly involved in balance perception, and whose morphology is considered closely correlated with an animal’s orientation within the water column, sensitivity to movement and even visual acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kemp and Christopher Kirk, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malinzak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spoor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spoor et al., 2007</xref>), although the generality of this relationship is being challenged in some more recent works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bronzati et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, the inferior division, or vestibule, contains the sacculus and utriculus, which are sensitive to mechanical acceleration, but also play an auditory role in discriminating and localising sound. Inner ear morphology in fishes tends to be relatively conserved, and when there is variation it is more commonly seen in this inferior division rather than the semicircular canals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ladich and Schulz-Mirbach, 2016</xref>). The sacculus (combined with the lagena in lungfish), is most sensitive to movements in the vertical plane, whereas the utriculus detects angular and linear acceleration predominantly in the horizontal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Platt et al., 2004</xref>). Similar bioimaging techniques and consequent morphometric analyses have been used to successfully predict both auditory and vestibular abilities in other aquatic vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lauridsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramcharitar et al., 2004</xref>), thus lending support to our functional interpretations in lungfish contained herein.</p><p>With soft tissues, such as brains, typically not fossilising, there is a need to use endocasts as proxies to infer or reconstruct gross neural morphology in extinct taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clement et al., 2016b</xref>). With respect to making meaningful biological inferences from lungfish endocasts, evidence from extant lungfish show a moderate-high correspondence between brain and endocast in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Challands et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clement et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, there tends to be considerably higher correspondence in the forebrain and labyrinth regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clement et al., 2015</xref>), and we thus can take more confidence in potential functional interpretations relating to those regions in extinct taxa. Intriguingly, it is in those regions where we see the largest variations in our analyses, highlighting the potential to elucidate significant functional insights into an animal’s sensory capabilities.</p><p>Thus, guided by our findings and the Principle of Proper Mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jerison, 1973</xref>), we believe we can draw some reasonable conclusions about brain evolution in lungfish. The hindbrain region appears to have remained relatively conserved throughout lungfish evolution, and there is no evidence of hypertrophy as is seen in some other lineages, that is within the Chondrichthyes and Actinopterygii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nieuwenhuys et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Striedter and Northcutt, 2020</xref>). The midbrain similarly seems to have remained relatively small and it seems unlikely that vision has ever been a dominant sense in lungfish (in contrast to many actinopterygians).</p><p>In contrast, the forebrain underwent early expansion in some of the oldest members of the lineage and appears to have continued to present day, suggesting an ongoing and increasing reliance in the role of olfaction. Relatedly, the high variability in this region throughout their evolutionary history highlights continuing modification of and importance in the role of olfaction in lungfish.</p><p>And finally, the changes seen in the labyrinth region, particularly the expansion of the utriculus, suggests increasing sensitivity to movements in the horizontal plane, perhaps reflecting changing sensory requirements from one niche to another. For example, we consider that animals living in a shallow, near-shore environment would have less requirement for sensitivity to large changes in the vertical plane compared to nektonic animals living in deeper, open environments throughout the water column. Thus, the modular dissociation between the sacculus +semicircular canals compared to the expansion of the utriculus may potentially be capturing a change from deeper water marine (nektonic) environments (as per some of the earliest lungfish, e.g. <italic>Dipnorhynchus</italic>), to gradually more near-shore/terrestrial ecosystems (a trend seen among Mid-Late Devonian members to present day taxa). However, we acknowledge that it is difficult to determine if increased relative utricular size results from greater reliance of sensitivity in the horizontal plane alone, or if it expands to compensate for example relative stagnation of the sacculus + semicircular canals in some way. Further studies, such as investigation of neuronal densities in extant lungfish labyrinths, may potentially help to clarify this uncertainty in future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Taxonomy of the ‘chirodipterids’</title><p>The genus <italic>Chirodipterus</italic> was erected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gross, 1933</xref>, and the first lungfish endocast to be described was that of <italic>C. wildungensis</italic> from the Upper Devonian in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Säve-Söderbergh, 1952</xref>).

Yet, by the author’s own admission, it was heavily influenced by comparison with the extant Australian lungfish (<italic>Neoceratodus</italic>). His interpretation that <italic>C. wildungensis</italic> had “a cranial anatomy astonishingly closely comparable to that of… <italic>Neoceratodus</italic>” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Säve-Söderbergh, 1952</xref>, pg.

We argue that it seems more likely that the similarities with extant lungfish were (unintentionally) overstated owing to the lack of comparative material at the time, and the true morphology of <italic>C. wildungensis</italic> was probably more similar to that of other Devonian lungfish. Sadly, the condition of the original specimen precludes the possibility of us adequately testing this hypothesis at this time.</p><p>Two of the specimens included in our study, <italic>Pillararhynchus longi</italic> and <italic>Gogodipterus paddyensis</italic>, possess the snub-nosed morphology commonly found among ‘chirodipterids’, and four other taxa are known from 3D-analyses of preserved material, which should enable their endocasts to be reconstructed.

Nevertheless, from our current work we can already identify several characters common to ‘chirodipterids’ (such as a prominent pineal process, mediolaterally-oriented nasal capsules, a ventrally-directed hypophyseal region, near-equidimensional circular arcs of all three semicircular canals), which should be tested in any further studies of chirodipterid taxonomy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Elongated crania</title><p>At the other end of the morphological spectrum from the ‘chirodipterids’, the development of an elongated snout and/or skull has occurred convergently across many genera of actinopterygians but is not a well-established morphology in piscine sarcopterygians. In fact, lungfish are the only sarcopterygian group that developed significant cranial elongation, and those that did were mostly confined to the Middle to Late Devonian (ranging from the Givetian to the Famennian).</p><p>Of those that developed this condition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schultze, 1992</xref> recognised that it has been achieved in a number of different ways: elongation of the anterior dermal bones and the mandible (<italic>Griphognathus, Soederberghia, Rhynchodipterus</italic> and possibly <italic>Jarvikia</italic> and <italic>Fleurantia</italic>); development of a longer series of posterior dermal and cheek bones (<italic>Iowadipterus</italic>); or elongation of the mandibular symphysis (<italic>Rhinodipterus</italic>). Additionally, <italic>Orlovichthys</italic> possesses elongate anterior rostral bones but a short mandible and large mandibular symphysis.

However, the renaissance in dipnoan research during the 1970s and 1980s – largely driven by Roger Miles, Hans-Peter Schultze, Ken Campbell and Dick Barwick – had not yet occurred and as such, the full diversity of forms we now recognise were unknown to him. Stensiö’s assertion that “the Dipnoan brain had … remained practically unchanged” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stensiö, 1963</xref>, pg. 82) was challenged recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clement and Ahlberg, 2014</xref> and is similarly tested by this study.</p><p>Devonian lungfish with elongate crania fail to form a distinct clade, but rather a paraphyletic group that have converged towards head elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schultze, 1992</xref> recognised two groups of long-snouted dipnoans: the rhynchodipterids (<italic>Griphognathus, Rhynchodipterus, Soederberghia</italic>) plus <italic>Fleurantia</italic> and <italic>Jarvkia</italic> and the genus <italic>Rhinodipterus</italic>. These two groups are differentiated by the former being denticulated forms and the latter possessing tooth plates representing different means of feeding. Despite the elongation of the lower jaw in <italic>Rhinodipterus,</italic> the mechanical advantage is similar to other tooth-plated lungfish and different from forms with long crania and denticulate dentition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clement, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The rhynchodipterids were resolved by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marshall, 1986</xref> following analysis of <italic>Holodipterus</italic> and <italic>Fleurantia</italic> which in turn were found to be sister taxa to <italic>Jarvikia,</italic> a grade forming the most derived Devonian dipnoans below Carboniferous forms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friedman, 2007</xref> resolved rhynchodipterids as the sister group to <italic>Chirodipterus wildungensis</italic> in a detailed analysis that incorporated new characters of the endocranium. More recent analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Challands et al., 2019</xref> have provided a more nuanced picture by including more taxa with elongate crania and have confirmed that the rhynchodipterids form a monophyletic group (albeit placed in a more basal position), and also that the ‘rhinodipterids’ are monophyletic (although with the likely exception of <italic>‘R.’ stolbovi</italic>). <italic>Fleurantia</italic> and <italic>Apatorhynchus</italic> are grouped together in a relatively derived position close to the majority of Carboniferous lungfish.</p><p>Other forms with elongate crania are placed in isolated positions alongside short-snouted taxa, and interestingly <italic>Orlovichthys</italic> and <italic>Jarvikia</italic> were found to resolve in the same clade along with taxa with short crania and tooth-plated dentition. <italic>Iowadipterus</italic> is the most basal of the lungfish with an elongated head, representing a unique solution to the morphology.</p><p>The elongation of lungfish crania has been proposed to be related to either feeding functional morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Barwick, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharp and Clack, 2013</xref>) or air-gulping ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gess and Clement, 2019</xref> other references therein). As mentioned earlier, this cranial elongation is achieved via various approaches, either by modification of the dermal bones in the snout, cheek, or in the jaws. Thus, we expected that the neurocranium and endocasts of Devonian lungfish would have also accommodated elongation via different approaches. In contrast, we found that it is nearly always the olfactory region that is elongated regardless of which portion of the dermal skull appears to lengthen, and that the hindbrain remains relatively conserved in form. The most glaring exception to this is that of <italic>Iowadipterus</italic> which appears to have very short olfactory canals but a long and narrow midbrain. We believe further investigation and consideration of this unusual taxon in particular is warranted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The cranial endocasts of six Palaeozoic dipnoans (<italic>Iowadipterus halli, Gogodipterus paddyensis, Pillararhynchus longi, Griphognathus whitei, Orlovichthys limnatis,</italic> and <italic>Rhinodipterus ulrichi</italic>) are created and described from synchrotron and computed tomography (CT) data. These represent a significant addition to the other known Palaeozoic lungfish endocasts (previously only four virtual endocasts had been described from tomographic data, and four others with partial endocasts were described and reconstructed directly from observation of specimens). Morphometric analyses of 10 Palaeozoic and two extant lungfish genera are conducted using standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Bayesian Principle Component Analysis (BPCA) and PCA for incomplete data (InDaPCA), which show the olfactory and labyrinth regions exhibit the largest amount of variation. Functional interpretation suggests that olfaction remains one of their most dominant senses throughout lungfish evolutionary history.

The largest three blocks were scanned at the µCT Lab of Museum für Naturkunde using the following parameters: “c” 140kV, 500 µA, 2000 projections, 360 degrees rotation, 0.139 pixel size; “cd” 100kV, 135 µA, 2000 projections, 360 degrees rotation, 0.139 pixel size; “f” 100kV, 135 µA, 2000 projections, 360 degrees rotation, 0.139 pixel size. Despite this, we unfortunately did not find it possible to reconstruct endocranial morphology from the scanned or remaining segments of this specimen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Measurements and analysis</title><p>Endocast dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) were taken using IC Measure on-screen calibration and measurement software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.theimagingsource.com">https://www.theimagingsource.com</ext-link>). The complete original matrix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>) combined 17 endocast variables examined in 14 specimens representing 12 species (‘<italic>Chirodipterus’ australis</italic> and <italic>Dipterus valenciennesi</italic> were coded for two specimens each). This included 10 Palaeozoic as well as two extant species (<italic>Neoceratodus forsteri</italic> and <italic>Protopterus aethiopicus</italic>). Both specimens of ‘<italic>C’. australis</italic> were included in every analysis, whereas only specimen NHMUK PV P17410 of <italic>D. valenciennesi</italic> was retained in our analyses (the incomplete specimen NMS G.2004-10-1 of <italic>D. valenciennesi</italic> was excluded because it had undergone considerable compression). Specimen NHMUK PV P56038 of ‘<italic>C’. australis</italic> and specimen NHMUK PV P17410 of <italic>D. valenciennesi</italic> are the only two specimens for which all variables are available. <italic>Gogodipterus paddyensis</italic> is the most incomplete specimen missing 11 measurements out of a total of 17 variables. The complete original matrix has 24.7% of missing data, while the complete matrix (excluding one specimen of <italic>Dipterus</italic>) has 21.2% of missing data. Data were log<sub>10</sub>-transformed to minimize differences among taxa.</p><p>The 17 measured endocast variables are defined as follows: ANG_OLF, angle of bifurcation between olfactory canals; D_NII, depth of cranial endocast at level of n.II; D_NV, depth of cranial endocast at level of n.V; DEP_HYP_F, depth of cranial endocast at level of hypophyseal fossa; HF_NII, distance from hypophyseal fossa to n.II; NAS_CAP_L, length of nasal capsules; NII_ OLF_BIF, distance from n.II to point of bifurcation between olfactory canals; NV_HF, distance from n.V to hypophyseal fossa; NX_NV, distance from n.V to n.X; OLF_CAN_L, length of olfactory canals from nasal capsules to point of bifurcation; SAC_H, height of sacculus; SAC_L, length of sacculus; SCC_H, height of semicircular canals; SCC_L, length of semicircular canals from anterior to posterior; SCC_W, width of semicircular canals from midline to lateral canal; UTR_H, height of utriculus; UTR_L, length of utriculus.</p><p>With respect to the first morphometric variable measured (ANG_OLF), we accept that olfactory <italic>nerves</italic> (n.I) lie between the olfactory epithelium within the nasal capsules and the olfactory bulbs, whereas olfactory <italic>tracts</italic> extend from the olfactory bulbs to the telencephalon. For simplicity, we herein refer to the entire length from the anterior of the telencephalon to the nasal capsules as the olfactory <italic>canals</italic>. Expansions within the olfactory canals are sometimes tentatively identified as the likely position of the olfactory bulbs, and can thus inform our interpretation of different taxa as having either a sessile or pedunculate arrangement. However, the angle of bifurcation between the olfactory canals is independent from olfactory bulb position in our analyses.</p><p>We used ordination methods to describe the variation and relationships among the endocranial variables. Preliminary standard principal component analyses (PCA) were performed on the correlation matrix (due to the different units of measurement used) of log<sub>10</sub>-transformed data to maximize either the number of taxa (PCA-taxa; 9 taxa including both specimens of <italic>C. australis</italic>) or the number of variables (PCA-characters; 13 variables). Results from the preliminary standard PCA (PCA-taxa and PCA-characters) are briefly presented herein, but the main variation trends were congruent with both Bayesian PCA (BPCA) and PCA with incomplete data (InDaPCA). Next, in order to contend with the incomplete data, we employed two methods: one with imputation (using assignment of values by inference), that is the Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA), and one without imputation, that is PCA for incomplete data (InDaPCA). Both methods are designed to accommodate upwards of 15% of missing data. The broken-stick method was used to determine the number of non-trivial axes to be interpreted; broken-stick values are provided with the loadings of each analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata4">Source data 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata5">Source data 5</xref>).</p><p>Missing data were estimated using the Bayesian method developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oba et al., 2003</xref> and implemented in the R package ‘pcaMethods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stacklies et al., 2007</xref>). A cross-validation method was used to estimate the number of meaningful components – in this case the two first components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stacklies et al., 2007</xref>). The InDaPCA method used was designed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Podani et al., 2021</xref> and consists of a modified version of an eigenanalysis-based PCA for data containing missing values. The InDaPCA was performed in R using the correlation matrix. In this case, the four first components were considered for interpretation. The package ‘ggplot2’ in R was used to create the graphics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data availablility</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript, supporting files (5 figures and 5 tables), or via a relevant online repository.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Min Zhu as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by George Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Serjoscha Evers (Reviewer #2); Rodrigo Figueroa (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Re-organization of figures to improve the readability of the manuscript.</p><p>2) Presentation of PCA results needs further clarification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Re-organization of figures: It will be proper to move SI-Figures 1-6 to the text. Figure 2b, whose labelings are too small to be read, can be moved to SI. Regarding Figure 3, the bottom two sub-figures can be moved to SI.</p><p>2) The authors have employed three methods to analyse the neurocranial variables. The results from BPCA and InDaPCA are overall consistent, however, there exist some deviations between preliminary classical PCAs and BPCA or InDaPCA. These differences might highlight the advantage of the new methods and need additional comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>These additional comments are directed at specific paragraphs:</p><p>Line 394 : You state that variation in the labyrinth may reflect differences in auditory ability. However, the aspects of labyrinth morphology you evaluate (semicircular canals, utricle, sacculus) are primarily involved in the vestibular function of the inner ear, and not so much in hearing. In fact, in later parts of the discussion you interpret utricular variation as changing the sensitivity for movements of along the horizontal plane – which is a vestibular function, not an auditory one. Thus, I suggest you replace &quot;auditory ability&quot; with &quot;vestibular sensitivity&quot;.</p><p>Paragraph line 404: Here you cite key papers regarding the ecomorphological links of labyrinth morphology (including size) and ecology. I suggest you add the paper of Spoor et al. (2007, PNAS) to this list, which otherwise is a good choice of papers to cite here. In addition, I would like to add that the &quot;agility hypothesis&quot; of labyrinth morphology has been questioned recently with data from non-mammalian study systems, particularly birds (Benson et al. 2017, J. Anat.) and archosaurs (Bronzati et al. 2021; Curr. Biol.). So, I would argue that vestibular form-function relationships in 2021 are actually less well understood that we thought back in say 2015. However, this also offers a good chance for you regarding this manuscript: in order to better understand vestibular ecomorphology, a broader taxonomic approach needs to be implemented, and the data you provide here is very welcome in this regard. In terms of the present text, you may want to think about modifying the paragraph in a way that say that vestibular size and shape is often interpreted as functionally tightly integrated with aspects of locomotion (such as agility), but that more recent data questions the generality of these hypotheses across vertebrates, and that your data can help elucidating these relationships further.</p><p>Line 415: The citation of Willis et al. 2013 is in my opinion not appropriate here, because these authors studied the tympanic middle ear cavities of turtles with regard to the ecological evolution of turtles, but in your sentence, you state that &quot;similar bioimaging techniques and consequent morphometric analyses have been used to successfully predict both auditory and vestibular abilities in other aquatic vertebrates&quot;. Besides, much of the results of the Willis et al. (2013) paper has been revised and critically re-addressed by Foth et al. (2019, J. Anat.). I think the easiest solution is to ditch the citation.</p><p>Paragraph 417: In this paragraph, you state that there is a &quot;moderate correspondence between brain and endocast in life&quot;, citing the cool Clement et al. (2015) study. As I usually work on a different group of animals, I was actually surprised how detailed the correspondence seems to be – if you compare the Clement et al. (2015) results with the brain-endocast comparisons of a turtle (Evers et al. 2019, Zool. J. Linn. Soc.) or a croc (Lessner and Holliday 2020, Anat. Rec.) you will see that the correspondence is quite high, similar to snakes (e.g. Macri et al. 2019, Nat. Comms.) or macrocephalic tetrapods like mammals or birds.</p><p>Line 435ff: It is not immediately clear, why increased utricular sizes should &quot;reflect changing sensory requirements from deeper water marine environments […] to more terrestrial ecosystems&quot;. First, as the utricle detects linear accelerations in the horizontal plane, it is not clear why water depth should play a role (wouldn't we expect saccular changes for this, as the saccule detects linear accelerations in the vertical plane?). Also, as the change from sea to the terrestrial realm essentially is a transition from a 3D environment onto a 2D plane, wouldn't we expect changes to be concentrated in the semicircular canals themselves, as they detect angular accelerations?</p><p>Figures 2 and 3 currently lack panel labels (A, B, C,.…), but you might want to add them for clarity. The respective figure captions also suggest they should be there.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following section is organized following the manuscript sections and text order. The paper is well written and organized, as well as presenting relevant and novel work. Therefore, please consider the following as simple suggestions for improving the manuscript, but not necessary for the work to be accepted for publication.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Line 39-41: Could probably cite papers from Jarvik, Orgiv and Stensio who provided detailed descriptions of the neurocranial morphology of several fossil fishes and are easily within the field of Paleoneurology. Since this work deals with fossil fishes, it seems important to have these represented in the introduction.</p><p>Line 42: Also crocodiles, see Watanabe et al. (2018)</p><p>Line 45: I feel that somewhere in this introduction, maybe at the end of the first paragraph, there should be some brief mention of the work from the first author that indicates a relatively high 'fit' between endocast and brain sizes in an extant lungfish. This would help making the argument of relevance of studying the lungfish endocast in the fossil record as more than simply taxonomic work.</p><p>Line 59: Probably mention here that despite the problematic homology of dermal bones, the endocast anatomy is widely comparable among vertebrates and therefore a good source for comparative analysis.</p><p>Lines 61-67: Probably double-check the zoological nomenclature for citing these taxa. Citing the authors between parenthesis after the scientific names gives the impression that these have been revised/modified.</p><p>Line 81-82: The pedunculate olfactory bulbs have probably independent acquisitions in most if not all of the clades mentioned. Additionally, note that several crown actinopterygians (e.g. some cyprinids) have pedunculate olfactory bulbs as well.</p><p>Description:</p><p>I don't have many comments about this section as it is clear and well-written. I would only recommend that structures that are described in the text should be indicated in the corresponding supplementary figures.

However, the aspects of labyrinth morphology you evaluate (semicircular canals, utricle, sacculus) are primarily involved in the vestibular function of the inner ear, and not so much in hearing. In fact, in later parts of the discussion you interpret utricular variation as changing the sensitivity for movements of along the horizontal plane – which is a vestibular function, not an auditory one. Thus, I suggest you replace &quot;auditory ability&quot; with &quot;vestibular sensitivity&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the sentence to now read: “…and vestibular sensitivity (and potentially auditory) abilities”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Paragraph line 404: Here you cite key papers regarding the ecomorphological links of labyrinth morphology (including size) and ecology. I suggest you add the paper of Spoor et al. (2007, PNAS) to this list, which otherwise is a good choice of papers to cite here. In addition, I would like to add that the &quot;agility hypothesis&quot; of labyrinth morphology has been questioned recently with data from non-mammalian study systems, particularly birds (Benson et al. 2017, J. Anat.) and archosaurs (Bronzati et al. 2021; Curr. Biol.). So, I would argue that vestibular form-function relationships in 2021 are actually less well understood that we thought back in say 2015. However, this also offers a good chance for you regarding this manuscript: in order to better understand vestibular ecomorphology, a broader taxonomic approach needs to be implemented, and the data you provide here is very welcome in this regard. In terms of the present text, you may want to think about modifying the paragraph in a way that say that vestibular size and shape is often interpreted as functionally tightly integrated with aspects of locomotion (such as agility), but that more recent data questions the generality of these hypotheses across vertebrates, and that your data can help elucidating these relationships further.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added Spoor et al. 2007, in addition to a qualifying statement about the consistency of this relationship in vertebrates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 415: The citation of Willis et al. 2013 is in my opinion not appropriate here, because these authors studied the tympanic middle ear cavities of turtles with regard to the ecological evolution of turtles, but in your sentence, you state that &quot;similar bioimaging techniques and consequent morphometric analyses have been used to successfully predict both auditory and vestibular abilities in other aquatic vertebrates&quot;. Besides, much of the results of the Willis et al. (2013) paper has been revised and critically re-addressed by Foth et al. (2019, J. Anat.).

(2015) results with the brain-endocast comparisons of a turtle (Evers et al. 2019, Zool. J. Linn. Soc.) or a croc (Lessner and Holliday 2020, Anat. Rec.) you will see that the correspondence is quite high, similar to snakes (e.g. Macri et al. 2019, Nat.

First, as the utricle detects linear accelerations in the horizontal plane, it is not clear why water depth should play a role (wouldn't we expect saccular changes for this, as the saccule detects linear accelerations in the vertical plane?). Also, as the change from sea to the terrestrial realm essentially is a transition from a 3D environment onto a 2D plane, wouldn't we expect changes to be concentrated in the semicircular canals themselves, as they detect angular accelerations?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this section so that our reasoning about the expanded utriculus potentially reflecting a shallower water niche should be easier to follow: “And finally, the changes seen in the labyrinth region, particularly the expansion of the utriculus, suggests increasing sensitivity to movements in the horizontal plane, perhaps reflecting changing sensory requirements from one niche to another. For example, we consider that animals living in a shallow, near-shore environment would have less requirement for sensitivity to large changes in the vertical plane compared to nektonic animals living in deeper, open environments throughout the water column. Thus, the modular dissociation between the sacculus + semicircular canals compared to the expansion of the utriculus may potentially be capturing a change from deeper water marine (nektonic) environments (as per some of the earliest lungfish, e.g. <italic>Dipnorhynchus</italic>), to gradually more near-shore/terrestrial ecosystems (a trend seen among Mid-Late Devonian members to present day taxa).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 2 and 3 currently lack panel labels (A, B, C,.…), but you might want to add them for clarity.

This would help making the argument of relevance of studying the lungfish endocast in the fossil record as more than simply taxonomic work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now included an additional paragraph detailing the recent work on brainendocast relationship in extant lungfish: “While aspects of the anatomy of the central nervous system in extant lungfish have been known for close to 150 years (Collin 2007; Huxley 1876; Northcutt 1986), it was only recently that the specific spatial relationship between the brain and the endocranial cavity was investigated. This was examined first in the Australian lungfish, <italic>Neoceratodus</italic> (Clement et al. 2015), and later in the lepidosirenid lungfish (<italic>Lepidosiren</italic> and <italic>Protopterus</italic>) and other piscine sarcopterygians (Challands et al. 2020). It was found that contrary to earlier reports of the lungfish brain filling just a fraction (10%) of its brain cavity (Jerison 1973), values in fact ranged between 40-80% (Challands et al. 2020; Clement et al. 2021; Clement et al. 2015). Moreover, these studies highlighted that the forebrain and labyrinth regions in particular had a close correspondence between brain and endocast, in comparison with the mid and hindbrain regions with a looser association.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 59: Probably mention here that despite the problematic homology of dermal bones, the endocast anatomy is widely comparable among vertebrates and therefore a good source for comparative analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the following statement: “Despite the problematic homology of dermal bones, endocranial anatomy tends to be far more conserved in vertebrates and thus highly valuable for comparative analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 61-67: Probably double-check the zoological nomenclature for citing these taxa.

We have already responded to a similar comment from Reviewer #2. Namely, geometric morphometrics has some limitations with regard to the type of data that we analysed: (1) low sample size and (2) missing/incomplete data. In order to have a comprehensive coverage of the brain shape, it would have required us to have numerous landmarks (and semi-landmarks) to represent the complexity of brain shape. First, as already mentioned by Reviewer #2, our sample size (12 taxa) is low (although it is an impressive sample size when considering the type of data). Although there are no universal rules concerning the ratio “number of specimens / number of landmarks” (Zelditch et al., 2012), ideally the sample size must be from two to three times the number of landmarks. Thus, with a sample size of 12 we could have used ca. 4-6 landmarks which is very limited to describe complex shapes. In addition, in order to use geometric morphometrics (2D or 3D), the landmarks should be present on all the specimens. Because of the partial completeness of the studied fossils, the brain endocasts are not uniformly known for each species. Incomplete and deformed specimens prompt the removal of potential landmarks for analyses. Even using right-left reflexion of the endocasts, most specimens do not share all neurocranial information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 293: &quot;no methods of imputation were used&quot; meaning unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased the sentence in order to clarify the meaning of imputation</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 346-349: The clustering of meristics of the same structure are expected, but the cluster of depth of nerves II and V is interesting, especially taking into account they emerge from different regions of the endocast/brain.</p></disp-quote><p>We just want to clarify that we did not used meristic variables (i.e., a quantitative count of structure) but rather morphometric variables (a measurement on a structure).
