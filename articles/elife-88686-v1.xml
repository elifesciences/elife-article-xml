protozoa, and viral infections. Non-canonical inflammasome activation is crucial in the development of septic shock promoting pyroptosis and proinflammatory cytokine production via caspase-11 and gasdermin D (GSDMD). Here, we show that NAD<sup>+</sup> treatment protected mice toward bacterial and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock by blocking the non-canonical inflammasome specifically. NAD<sup>+</sup> administration impeded systemic IL-1β and IL-18 production and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis of macrophages via the IFN-β/STAT-1 signaling machinery. More importantly, NAD<sup>+</sup> administration not only improved casp-11 KO (knockout) survival but rendered wild type (WT) mice completely resistant to septic shock via the IL-10 signaling pathway that was independent from the non-canonical inflammasome. Here, we delineated a two-sided effect of NAD<sup>+</sup> blocking septic shock through a specific inhibition of the non-canonical inflammasome and promoting immune homeostasis via IL-10, underscoring its unique therapeutic potential.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>septic shock</kwd><kwd>nicotinamide dinucleotide</kwd><kwd>gasdermin D</kwd><kwd>interleukin 10</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Berlin Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Junior Clinician Scientist Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iske</surname><given-names>Jasper</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201606370196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nian</surname><given-names>Yeqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002822</institution-id><institution>Central South University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nian</surname><given-names>Yeqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss Society of Cardiac Surgery</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cetina Biefer</surname><given-names>Hector Rodriguez</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH110438</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vasudevan</surname><given-names>Anju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS100808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vasudevan</surname><given-names>Anju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NAD<sup>+</sup> exhibits profound therapeutic effects in experimental septic shock models by dampening the systemic inflammatory response and leading to improved survival.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaukonen et al., 2015</xref>) driven by host cells following systemic bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramachandran, 2014</xref>) and viral infections. The excessive inflammatory response can derail into septic shock resulting in multiple organ failure, the leading cause of death in intensive care units. Inflammasome activation, which downstream pathways cause the release of proinflammatory cytokines and the induction of an inflammatory cell death termed pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumar, 2018</xref>), has been pointed out as the major driver of septic shock. Hereby, a two-armed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-derived induction of the NLRP3-canonical inflammasome, the major source of IL-1β and IL-18 cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopez-Castejon and Brough, 2011</xref>) and the caspase-11-mediated non-canonical inflammasome leading to pyroptosis in monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yi, 2017</xref>), was determined as the underlying mechanism. Mechanistically, caspase-11 acts as a pattern recognition receptor for intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ding and Shao, 2017</xref>) that cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD), a membrane pore-forming protein subsequently inducing pyroptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). The NLRP3-canonical inflammasome in turn was found to be indispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Man et al., 2017</xref>) for septic shock-induced death. However, cross-activation through caspase-11 promoting cytokine release has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kayagaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2015a</xref>), assigning the non-canonical inflammasome a cardinal role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kayagaki et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recent approaches such as anti-proinflammatory cytokine strategies blocking downstream targets of inflammasomes have been ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angus and van der Poll, 2013</xref>) while inhibiting inflammatory key regulators such as NF-κB may promote adverse side-effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraser, 2006</xref>). Hence, contemporary clinical therapy of septic shock is based on symptomatic treatment rather than curative approaches that clear the cause of the disease itself.</p><p>In our previous studies, we have underscored the immunosuppressive properties of NAD<sup>+</sup> in autoimmune diseases and allo-immunity via the regulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tullius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkhal et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, we have shown that NAD<sup>+</sup> administration protected mice from lethal doses of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (L. m.) via mast cells (MCs) exclusively and independently of major antigen presenting cells (APCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rodriguez Cetina Biefer et al., 2018</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism that allows NAD<sup>+</sup>, to concomitantly protect against autoimmune diseases, via its immunosuppressive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tullius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkhal et al., 2016</xref>), and against lethal bacterial infection remains unclear.</p><p>Therefore, in the current study we investigated whether NAD<sup>+</sup> protects against bacterial infection by dampening the systemic inflammatory response associated with sepsis or through enhanced bacterial clearance. Although, wild type (WT) mice subjected to NAD<sup>+</sup> or PBS and lethal doses of pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) exhibited similar bacterial load in various tissues, mice treated with NAD<sup>+</sup> displayed a robust survival. Moreover, NAD<sup>+</sup> protected against LPS-induced death that was associated with a dramatic decrease of systemic IL-1β and IL-18 levels, two major cytokines involved in the inflammasome signaling machinery. More importantly, we show that NAD<sup>+</sup> protected from LPS-induced death by targeting specifically the non-canonical inflammasome via a blockade of the STAT1/IFN-β signaling pathway. Moreover, NAD<sup>+</sup> treatment rendered not only caspase-11 knockout (KO) but WT mice fully resistant to poly(I:C)+LPS-induced septic shock, via an inflammasome-independent pathway mediated by a systemic IL-10 cytokine production.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NAD<sup>+</sup> protects mice against septic shock not via bacterial clearance but via inflammasome blockade</title><p>Our previous studies have underscored the role of NAD<sup>+</sup> in regulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell fate and its immunosuppressive properties via IL-10 cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tullius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkhal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rodriguez Cetina Biefer et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, we have shown that NAD<sup>+</sup> protected mice against lethal doses of L. m. independently of major APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tullius et al., 2014</xref>). However, it remained unclear whether NAD<sup>+</sup> protected mice against lethal doses of L. m., a gram-positive bacterium, via a clearance mechanism or by dampening the inflammatory response. Since L. m. is known to be an intracellular pathogen, we tested if NAD<sup>+</sup> protects as well against <italic>E. coli</italic>, a gram-negative bacterium that is well known to induce septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mellata et al., 2016</xref>). WT mice were treated with NAD<sup>+</sup> or PBS for 2 consecutive days followed by a lethal dose (1×10<sup>9</sup>) of <italic>E. coli</italic> or PBS. Notably, mice treated with PBS died within 5 hr after infection, while mice treated with NAD<sup>+</sup> exhibited an impressive survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, when assessing the bacterial load in liver and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), organs exposed to the infection, by counting CFU in both, NAD<sup>+</sup> and PBS groups, revealed no significant difference, suggesting that NAD<sup>+</sup> does not promote bacterial clearance. More importantly, these data suggest that NAD<sup>+</sup> may reduce the inflammatory response toward bacterial infection. It is well established that the bacterial LPS abundant on the outer membrane exhibits a key role in the pathology of <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angus and van der Poll, 2013</xref>). Thus, we further characterize the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> on septic shock by subjecting mice to a lethal dose (54 mg/kg) of two different LPS serotypes (O111:B4 and O55:B5) described to vary in the antigen lipid A content and to promote distinct hypothermia kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dogan et al., 2000</xref>). Following LPS (O111:B4 and O55:B5) administration, PBS-treated control mice displayed severe symptoms of endotoxic shock with a dramatical body temperature decrease (&lt;23°C) within 15 hr. In contrast, mice subjected to NAD<sup>+</sup> exhibited highly distinct kinetics with a recovery of body temperatures after 15 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When monitoring survival, 100% of PBS-treated mice succumbed to LPS after 24 hr while NAD<sup>+</sup>-treated animals exhibited an overall survival &gt;85% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which was consistent with our bacterial infection model. Mice infected and treated with NAD<sup>+</sup> survived for several months and recovered fully after 10 days. Of note, mice survived for over a year following infection and died of aging. LPS-induced death derives from multi-organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bullock and Benham, 2019</xref>). Therefore, lung, kidney, liver, ileum, and spleen were harvested 15 hr after LPS administration and tissue damage was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Tissue evaluation indicated severe pulmonary hemorrhage, excessive tubular fibrin deposition, hepatocyte cell swelling, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and ileal villi destruction consistent with a multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rossaint and Zarbock, 2015</xref>) in mice treated with PBS. In contrast, NAD<sup>+</sup> administration dramatically attenuated signs of organ failure with significantly less pulmonary hemorrhage and DIC, intact liver and kidney tissue architecture, and preserved ileal villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To elucidate the protective effects of NAD<sup>+</sup> systemic levels of IL-1β and IL-18, two major cytokines implicated in inflammasome activation were measured 10 and 15 hr after intraperitoneal injection of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Of, note IL-6 and TNFα systemic levels were measured as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Our findings indicated that LPS injection resulted in a robust systemic increase of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and IL-18 in the PBS group, which was almost abolished in NAD<sup>+</sup>-treated mice. Taken together, our results suggest that NAD<sup>+</sup> protects mice against septic shock not via bacterial clearance but rather via inflammasome blockade.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NAD<sup>+</sup> protects mice from lethal bacterial infection and endotoxic shock by dampening systemic inflammation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mice were treated with PBS or NAD<sup>+</sup> prior to administration of a lethal dose of either pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by intraperitoneal injection.

Monocytes, especially macrophages, have been described as major drivers of inflammasome-derived cytokine secretion in the context of septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans, 1996</xref>). Thus, to test the effect of NAD<sup>+</sup> on inflammasome function, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were obtained and both canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes were stimulated in the presence or absence of 100 µmol/ml NAD<sup>+</sup>. Activation of the canonical pathway was achieved through LPS priming (1 µg/ml) followed by ATP stimulation (5 mmol/l). Notably, BMDMs subjected to NAD<sup>+</sup> or PBS treatment followed by canonical inflammasome activation did not exhibit any significant difference in IL-1β secretion or pyroptosis that was assessed by LDH release measurement, a marker for cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To trigger the non-canonical inflammasome pathway, BMDMs were primed with Pam3CSK4, a TLR1/2 agonist, followed by cholera toxin B (CTB) and LPS (2 µg/ml) administration. The data showed that NAD<sup>+</sup> treatment resulted in a robust reduction of IL-1β release and cell death when compared to the PBS control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, western blotting revealed that BMDMs cultured in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> exhibited a dramatic decrease of casp-11 expression and its downstream targets including casp-1, IL-1β, and cleaved GSDMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, we observed a prominent decrease in casp-1 expression under NAD<sup>+</sup> treatment that was constant over the time course of 16 hr. In contrast, BMDMs treated with PBS exhibited excessive casp-1 expression at 4 hr that was found to be absent after 16 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which is consistent with the strong cytotoxicity leading to membrane permeabilization and release of casp-1 into the supernatant. Noteworthy, Pam3CK4-derived BMDM priming was not affected by NAD<sup>+</sup> since NF-κB as well as pro-caspase-1 levels had not been altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) underlining the specific inhibition of casp-11. To visualize NAD<sup>+</sup>-mediated blockade of pyroptotic macrophage death, BMDMs were treated with PBS or NAD<sup>+</sup>, primed with Pam3CSK4, then stimulated with LPS and CTB, and cell viability and apoptosis were monitored using the IncuCyte live microscopy system. Hereby, we observed distinct longitudinal kinetics over 100 hr with complete disaggregation of cell integrity in the PBS group contrary to overall preserved cell structure in NAD<sup>+</sup>-treated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). To rule out that NAD<sup>+</sup> impairs LPS internalization into cells, BMDMs were stimulated with CTB and LPS that was coupled to a fluorescent reporter (FITC) and transfection effectivity was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Our data indicated no significant difference between the PBS and NAD<sup>+</sup>-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that NAD<sup>+</sup> does not alter LPS internalization. Notably, BMDMs only stimulated with LPS showed no internalization of LPS consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kayagaki et al., 2013</xref>). Casp-4 and -5 have been delineated as the human homolog of casp-11 in mice carrying out the same effector functions including pyroptosis induction and IL-1β secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). As clinical relevance, we therefore tested whether NAD<sup>+</sup> was also able to block the non-canonical pathway in human macrophages. Hence, human macrophages were differentiated from PBMC and treated with NAD<sup>+</sup> followed by intracellular LPS transfection (Fugene) and IL-1β secretion and cytotoxicity were quantified. The results indicated that NAD<sup>+</sup> treatment significantly dampened both IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), underscoring its therapeutic potential. Collectively, our results suggest that NAD<sup>+</sup> acts directly on macrophages by targeting specifically the non-canonical inflammasome signaling machinery.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NAD<sup>+</sup> specifically inhibits the non-canonical inflammasome by targeting caspase-11.</title><p>Bone marrow was isolated from mice and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were differentiated in vitro.

Therefore, we performed RNA-sequencing of Pam3CSK4 primed BMDMs that were treated with PBS or NAD<sup>+</sup> and subsequently stimulated with CTB+LPS O111:B4. Interestingly, when blotting gene expression differences in a Venn diagram, we found strikingly more genes commonly expressed in the NAD<sup>+</sup> and control group when compared to the PBS-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed a significant downregulation of genes involved in the antiviral response in addition to the cellular response to the type I IFN, IFN-β, when comparing NAD<sup>+</sup> and PBS-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Type I IFN are known to promote the expression of over 2000 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), translated into ISGs-induced proteins which have been shown to act by enhancing pathogen detection and restrict their replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, it was reported that type I IFNs are required for casp-11 expression contributing to non-canonical inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rathinam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). Consistently, LPS-stimulated macrophages from TRIF-deficient mice displayed impaired casp-11 expression, implying a context-dependent role for type I IFN in the regulation of caspase-11 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rathinam et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, when comparing expression of genes involved in IFN-β signaling through cluster analysis we found a significant decrease in a broad range in genes in the NAD<sup>+</sup>-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Most strikingly, GTPases and guanylate binding proteins involved in the downstream signaling of IFN-β were significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) while IFN-β-receptor 2 expression remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Recently, IFN-inducible GTPases and guanylate binding proteins have been assigned a crucial role for the intracellular recognition of LPS and linked caspase-11 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pilla et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, to test if NAD<sup>+</sup> mediated non-canonical inflammasome blockade via IFN-β, NAD<sup>+</sup> or PBS-treated BMDMs were primed with Pam3CSK4 and subsequently stimulated with LPS O111:B4+CTB and 1000 U/ml of recombinant IFN-β. Strikingly, administration of recombinant IFN-β resulted in a complete reversal of NAD<sup>+</sup>-mediated blockade of IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Moreover, IFN-β administration restored casp-11, NLRP3, and GSDMD expression in the NAD<sup>+</sup>-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). It is well established that signal transducer activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1) phosphorylation constitutes the link between intracellular type I IFN signaling and the transcription of ISGs through nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stark and Darnell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014</xref>). Notably, our RNA-sequencing data indicated a significant downregulation of STAT-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, we have previously shown that NAD<sup>+</sup> administration dampens the expression and activation of transcription factors such as STAT-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkhal et al., 2016</xref>). To test, whether NAD<sup>+</sup> blocks IFN-β signaling via STAT-1, BMDMs were subjected to NAD<sup>+</sup> or PBS followed by non-canonical inflammasome stimulation and recombinant IFN-β. After 16 hr STAT-1 expression and phosphorylation were assessed by western blotting. Consistent with our previous results, NAD<sup>+</sup> treatment downregulated expression levels of STAT-1 and phospho-STAT-1. In contrast, addition of recombinant IFN-β treatment to NAD<sup>+</sup>-treated BMDMs restored STAT-1 and phospho-STAT-1 expression that was equivalent to the PBS-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

Casp-11 KO mice were intraperitoneally injected with NAD<sup>+</sup> and PBS and treated with 6 mg/kg poly(I:C) 6 hr prior to LPS administration. Consistent with previous studies the results indicated a modest resistance of casp-11 KO mice (40% survival).

Moreover, IL-10 itself has been shown to prevent mice from septic shock-induced death after a single administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howard et al., 1993</xref>). We have previously delineated immunosuppressive properties of NAD<sup>+</sup> via a systemic production of IL-10, a robust immunosuppressive cytokine. In addition, we have described the pivotal role of NAD<sup>+</sup> protecting toward EAE and allograft rejection via an increased frequency of IL-10 producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tullius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkhal et al., 2016</xref>). To test if IL-10 plays an additional protective role in the context of NAD<sup>+</sup>-mediated protection toward LPS-induced death, WT mice treated with NAD<sup>+</sup> or PBS subjected to intraperitoneal LPS injection (54 mg/kg) and IL-10 expression by macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells was assessed 15 hr after LPS administration. Consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tullius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkhal et al., 2016</xref>), we found significantly augmented frequencies of IL-10 producing CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, we detected a dramatic increase of IL-10 production by macrophages, but not the DC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, IL-10 has been described to inhibit macrophage function and proinflammatory cytokine production in both, human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Waal Malefyt et al., 1991</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiorentino et al., 1991</xref>). Moreover, autocrine IL-10 secretion of macrophages was found to decrease pro-IL-1β concentration by promoting STAT-3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). To investigate the potential autocrine impact of an augmented IL-10 production on macrophage self-regulation, we administered combined IL-10 neutralizing antibody and IL-10 receptor antagonist to BMDMs primed with Pam3CSK4 and stimulated with CTB and LPS O111:B4. The results showed that neutralization of the autocrine IL-10 signaling pathway dampened NAD<sup>+</sup>-mediated decrease of IL-1β secretion and reversed pyroptotic cell death partially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To further investigate the relevance of our in vitro findings, IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice were treated with NAD<sup>+</sup> or PBS, subjected to LPS (54 mg/kg) and survival was monitored. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Latifi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 1995</xref>), mice lacking IL-10 exhibited an inferior protection against septic shock when compared to WT animals. More importantly, IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice subjected to NAD<sup>+</sup> exhibited a compromised survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that systemic production of IL-10 following NAD<sup>+</sup> administration plays a pivotal role in NAD<sup>+</sup>-mediated protection against septic shock.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>IL-10 constitutes an additional mechanism mediating the protective capacities of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the context of septic shock.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Caspase-11 KO (knockout) mice were treated with NAD<sup>+</sup> or PBS.

However, it remained unclear whether NAD<sup>+</sup> conveyed resistance toward L. m. by an augmented bacterial clearance or rather through its immunosuppressive effects dampening pathological systemic inflammation. Although the cell membrane of L. m. has been shown to bear lipoteichoic acids, which resemble the endotoxin LPS from gram-negative bacteria in both, structure and function, it is widely considered as an intracellular bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farber and Peterkin, 1991</xref>). In our current study, we administered a lethal dose of pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, that is well known to promote septic shock, and showed that NAD<sup>+</sup> also protected toward a lethal dose of this gram-negative bacterium. More importantly, we demonstrate that NAD<sup>+</sup> conveys protection toward septic shock by specifically inhibiting the non-canonical inflammasome but not via bacterial clearance. Mechanistically, NAD<sup>+</sup> impedes pro-casp-11 and casp-11 expression in macrophages blocking non-canonical-derived GSDMD cleavage and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, thus inhibiting pyroptotic cell death and proinflammatory cytokine release. The resistance of NAD<sup>+</sup>-treated WT mice against <italic>E. coli</italic> and LPS-induced septic shock reflected the robust inhibitory effect observed in vitro of NAD<sup>+</sup> on the non-canonical inflammasome signaling machinery.</p><p>Until now, the exact mechanism how pro-casp-11 expression and its maturation to casp-11 is regulated remains unclear. Given the low basal expression of both pro-casp-11 and casp-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schauvliege et al., 2002</xref>), a priming signal is required for initiating the non-canonical inflammasome pathway and macrophage sensing of intracellular LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2015b</xref>). Previous work has demonstrated that transcriptional induction of the pro-casp-11 isoforms p42 and p38 in macrophages requires type I IFN stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schauvliege et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yen and Ganea, 2009</xref>) while IFN-β has been shown to promote transcriptional induction and processing of caspase-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rathinam et al., 2012</xref>). In line with these findings, CTB treatment of macrophages primed with Pam3csk4 failed to elicit IL1-β release compared to LPS primed controls while exogenous administration of IFN-β in turn restored CTB-induced IL-1β production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rathinam et al., 2012</xref>) underscoring the transcriptional role of type I IFN. Our RNA-sequencing results indicated a dampened cellular response toward IFN-β while western blotting revealed a significant downregulation of both, pro-casp-11 and casp-11, suggesting a transcriptional downregulation of both enzymes. Consistently, NAD<sup>+</sup> decreased STAT-1 expression and phosphorylation, which constitutes the mechanistic link between extracellular type I IFN stimulation and transcriptional effects through translocation of phosphorylated STAT-1 to the nucleus inducing ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014</xref>). Thus, treatment of stimulated macrophages subjected to NAD<sup>+</sup> with recombinant IFN-β restored STAT-1 signaling, caspase-11 expression, and GSDM cleavage which translated into reconstituted IL-1β production and LDH release. Collectively, NAD<sup>+</sup> mitigates the intracellular response to IFN-β that leads to non-canonical inflammasome induction by suppressing macrophage-derived STAT-1 expression and phosphorylation. Furthermore, we showed that NAD<sup>+</sup> treatment improved resistance of casp-11 KO mice toward poly I:C primed septic shock. More importantly, WT mice treated with NAD<sup>+</sup> exhibited 100% survival while casp-11 KO mice treated with PBS exhibited a modest 40% survival, suggesting that NAD<sup>+</sup> promotes survival beyond non-canonical inflammasome blockade. Our previous studies have delineated the effects of NAD<sup>+</sup> on various immune cells such as dendritic cells and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells including Th1, Th17, regulatory type 1 (Tr1), and Treg cells communicated exclusively through MCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tullius et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elkhal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rodriguez Cetina Biefer et al., 2018</xref>). Thereby, NAD<sup>+</sup> treatment promoted MC-derived induction of TR1 cells that resulted into increased systemic levels of IL-10. Latter one was found to play a cardinal feature during bacterial infection as MC<sup>-/-</sup> mice were more susceptible to L. m. infection than WT animals when treated with NAD<sup>+</sup>. Here, we found a direct effect of NAD<sup>+</sup> on macrophages by specifically inhibiting the non-canonical inflammasome and promoting IL-10 production. Polymorphisms in the IL-10 locus or IL-10R deficiencies have been linked to severe intestinal inflammatory diseases in both, human and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kühn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Begue et al., 2011</xref>). More importantly, mice deficient for IL-10 have been shown to display elevated inflammasome activation and IL-1β production resulting in severe colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) or Ag-induced arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenhill et al., 2014</xref>). When inhibiting the autocrine pathway for IL-10 through combined receptor antagonization and IL-10 neutralization, we found a pronounced increase of IL-1β production of NAD<sup>+</sup>-treated macrophages stimulated with CTB and LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports showing that autocrine IL-10 signaling interferes with the transcription of pro-IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). LDH release, in turn, was only restored partly possibly due to missing effects of second party leucocytes secreting IL-10 in vivo such as Tr1 cells which have been shown to inhibit the transcription of IL-1β and inflammasome-mediated activation of caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yao et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, casp-8, that plays a central role in apoptosis, has been reported as an important mediator of endotoxemia resistance and LPS-driven systemic inflammation. Since our RNA-sequencing results revealed a dramatically attenuated cellular response toward type I IFN with downregulation of various interferon regulatory factors, that have been reported as major regulators of casp-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apelbaum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Newton et al., 2019</xref>), it is possible that NAD<sup>+</sup> may exert protection against septic shock by altering caspase-8 expression as well. Although we have previously reported the protective effect of NAD<sup>+</sup> against apoptosis of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tullius et al., 2014</xref>), it remains yet to be determined how NAD<sup>+</sup> impacts executioner proteins of other cell death processes such as apoptosis and necroptosis.</p><p>Notably, both casp-8 and casp-11 have been found dispensable in the hematopoietic compartment that produces the proinflammatory cytokines necessary to initiate shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mandal et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, NAD<sup>+</sup> treatment may improve resistance of casp-11 KO mice to septic shock by also dampening the initiating proinflammatory cytokine cascade via its systemic IL-10 cytokine production. Importantly, while inhibiting macrophage-derived inflammasome function, NAD<sup>+</sup> does not interfere with NF-κB signaling which has been shown to promote various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases when dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, we dissected the dichotomous capacity of NAD<sup>+</sup> to dampen auto- and allo-immunity while concomitantly protecting toward severe bacterial infection, outlining its unique effects in the context of septic shock.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Young (8–12 weeks) C57BL/6, B6.129P2-IL10tm1Cgn/J, and B6.129S4(D2)-Casp4tm1Yuan/J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA, USA.

The collected tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of sterile PBS and 10-fold serial dilutions plated overnight at 37°C on LB agar plates to determine bacterial load per gram.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Blood was obtained from healthy adult volunteers with the only purpose to isolate PBMCs in order to create a basis for macrophage cultures.

We appreciate your positive assessment of the writing quality and the acknowledgment of the wel-lconducted nature of the study.</p><p>In regard to the reviewer's comment that &quot;The association with IL-10 cytokine production appears weak,&quot; we would like to provide a comprehensive response based on the findings and insights presented in our study (Fig 5). We would like to emphasize several key points to further elucidate this association:</p><p>The established knowledge underscores IL-10's capacity to hinder the activation and proliferation of macrophages, thereby safeguarding against an overly aggressive immune-inflammatory reaction (as referenced). In our earlier investigations, we demonstrated that NAD+ orchestrates a systemic generation of IL-10, which assumes a pivotal function in curtailing proinflammatory responses across various conditions, such as autoimmune diseases (as referenced), alloimmunity (as referenced), and bacterial infections (as referenced). In our latest research, we divulge that the introduction of NAD+ leads to an elevated occurrence of IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages, although not dendritic cells (depicted in Figure 5B and C). Furthermore, our comprehensive analyses have substantiated that NAD+ administration thwarts pyroptosis by specifically targeting the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. Intriguingly, our in vitro outcomes suggest that the neutralization of the autocrine IL-10 signaling pathway through a neutralizing antibody and an IL-10 receptor antagonist partially reverses the NAD+-mediated blockage of pyroptosis. These in vitro results imply that NAD+ induces the production of IL-10 cytokines by macrophages, contributing to the suppression of pyroptosis. To corroborate our in vitro conclusions, we employed IL-10 knockout mice and wild-type mice, both treated with either NAD+ or a placebo solution. The wild-type mice treated with NAD+ displayed a survival rate exceeding 80%, whereas the IL-10 knockout mice exhibited a survival rate of &quot;only&quot; 40%. These in vivo findings align with our in vitro discoveries, underscoring the crucial role of NAD+mediated IL-10 cytokine production in impeding pyroptosis through NAD+ and shielding against septic shock. Drawing from our prior and current investigations, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer's characterization of our work as &quot;weak.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors</p><p>‘’I suggest that animals subject to <italic>E. coli</italic> infection need to be followed-up for longer and sacrificed at a later time points.

We appreciate your valuable insights, and we have carefully considered your suggestions.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We have indeed followed-up for a longer period of time mice subjected to <italic>E. coli</italic> infection and LPS (54mg/kg). Mice infected and treated with NAD+ survived for several months and recovered fully after 10 days. Mice survived for at least a year following infection. We have now included a sentence regarding the long-term survival in the results section of Figure 1 entitled “NAD+ protects mice against septic shock not via bacterial clearance but via inflammasome blockade”. Figure illustrating the level of infiltration of the tissues by neutrophils was added in supplementary data as supplementary figure 4.</p><p>In contrast, WT and IL-10-/- mice failed to withstand <italic>E. coli</italic> or LPS (54mg/kg) administration when treated with a placebo solution. To our knowledge, our investigation represents the pioneering instance of successfully conferring protection against the lethal doses of <italic>E. coli</italic> and LPS administered to animals. Considering the potent immunosuppressive nature of IL-10, our anticipation was that IL-10-/- mice would manifest an exacerbated inflammatory response subsequent to LPS administration, in contrast to WT mice. Our in vivo findings indeed corroborate this assumption, revealing that IL-10-/- mice succumbed more swiftly to LPS administration, displaying statistically significant disparities in survival rates compared to WT mice (p value of 0.0154). The pertinent p-value has been thoughtfully included in Figure 5E of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>“Iske et al. provide experimental data that NAD+ lessens disease severity in bacterial sepsis without impacting on the host pathogen load.

These doses have been shown to result in multiple organ failure (1, 2). For many decades until now an un-numerable number of studies have used LPS as a model of sepsis (3, 4, 5). We have used LPS animal model based on a study published in 2013 by Kayagaki et al. (1), where the authors reported a novel TLR4-independent mechanism but mediated via activate caspase-11. We used the same animal model to demonstrate the specific role of NAD+ in targeting this TLR4-independent mechanism but mediated via activate caspase-11 and underscore NAD+’s mode of protection.</p><p>Moreover, we have not only used LPS but bacterial infection as well using <italic>E. coli</italic>.

We have supporting data indicating that NAD+ mediates protection via a specific blockade of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway, which prevents an over-zealous immune response that results in organ damage and multiple organ failure (MOF). Moreover, we demonstrate that not only NAD+ mediates protection via a specific blockade of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway but prevents septic shock induced death by an additional immunosuppression mediated by the systemic production of IL-10.</p><p>Both Caspase-11 and IL-10 pathways are crucial in NAD+ mediated protection against lethal doses of <italic>E. coli</italic> and LPS administration. Figure 5A indicates that caspase-11-/- mice treated with PBS have a modest survival rate (~40% survival) when compared to the group of mice treated with NAD+ (&gt;80% survival). These data indicate that NAD+ promotes survival via a caspase-11independent mechanism. Similarly, wild type mice subjected to NAD+ administration exhibited &gt;80% survival, while NAD+ administration to IL-10-/- mice resulted only in a 40% survival rate. Based on these findings, we believe that NAD+ mediated protection against septic shock via a blockade of caspase-11 blockade and by IL-10 cytokine production that dampened the overzealous immune response rather than a disease tolerance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“For the in vitro data, the manuscript would benefit from additional experiments using in vitro infection models.”</p></disp-quote><p>In the current study we have used two in vivo models using LPS and <italic>E. coli</italic> a gram-negative bacterium.

Our research has demonstrated the selective inhibition of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway by NAD+, with a primary focus on unraveling the specific signaling pathway influenced by NAD+.
