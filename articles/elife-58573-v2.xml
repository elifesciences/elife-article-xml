The family includes the TET 5-methylcytosine hydroxylases, the EGLN prolyl-hydroxylases that regulate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), and the JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases. All α-KG dioxygenases use α-KG and O<sub>2</sub> as biochemical substrates and generate succinate as product. The AlkB homologs (ALKBHs) are a distinct family of nine α-KG dioxygenases that are homologs of <italic>E. coli</italic> AlkB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedeles et al., 2015</xref>). The bacterial AlkB enzyme catalyzes demethylation of DNA damaged by alkylating agents, via hydroxylation of the methylated DNA followed by spontaneous decomposition to release formaldehyde and recover the DNA base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Falnes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trewick et al., 2002</xref>). Many eukaryotic ALKBHs have been shown to act on DNA or RNA substrates, including mammalian ALKBHs 1–3, 5, eight and FTO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duncan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xie et al., 2018</xref>). The subject of this investigation is ALKBH7, a poorly characterized mitochondrial α-KG dioxygenase which has no known substrates.</p><p>In contrast to a role in DNA repair or RNA modification, structural studies have revealed ALKBH7 lacks a critical nucleotide recognition lid required for binding DNA or RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, a study of mitochondria from several tissues of <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed no differences in mtDNA modifications (6-methyladenine, 5-methylcytosine, etc.) vs. wild-type (WT) at young ages, although <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mtDNA did accumulate more modifications in old-age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pawar et al., 2018</xref>). Together these observations suggest ALKBH7 may not play significant roles in either the repair of known AlkB substrates, or in oxidizing as-yet unknown nucleic acid substrates. Similarly, efforts to identify potential protein substrates of ALKBH7 have not yielded insight to its function, with both a yeast-2-hybrid screen and several large mitochondrial protein:protein interaction databases not reporting any ALKBH7-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bjørnstad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schweppe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Floyd et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While the nucleic acid or protein substrate(s) of ALKBH7 remain(s) unclear, previous studies using RNAi or genetic ablation in human cells have found that ALKBH7 is required for programmed necrosis induced by DNA alkylating agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit protection against alkylation-induced cell death in certain tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, this phenotype is only observed in males, even though <italic>Alkbh7</italic> is not a sex-linked gene. Furthermore, the <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse exhibits obesity due to defective fatty acid β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Solberg et al., 2013</xref>) and an <italic>Alkbh7</italic> mis-sense mutation (R191Q) has been linked to prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is unknown how these phenotypes are linked to the biochemical function of ALKBH7 as an α-KG dioxygenase.</p><p>The heart is a mitochondria-rich tissue, and cardiomyocyte necrosis plays a key role in cardiac pathology such as that occurring in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frangogiannis, 2015</xref>). As such, the requirement for ALKBH7 in other models of necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu et al., 2013</xref>) makes the protein a potential target for the modulation of cell death in response to IR injury. Herein, focusing on heart tissue we employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate ALKBH7 biology, finding that hearts from <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are protected against IR injury. We also find that a core component of this protected phenotype is the rewiring of glucose and glyoxal metabolism in response to elevated glycative stress. These findings imply potential therapeutic utility for ALKBH7 inhibitors to prevent necrosis in IR and other conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The complete original data used to generate all figures in the main document and supplement are contained in a spreadsheet available at DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12200273">10.6084/m9.figshare.12200273</ext-link>.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proteomic analysis to identify ALKBH7 substrates suggests it is not a prolyl-hydroxylase</title><p>Several members of the α-KG dioxygenase superfamily possess prolyl-hydroxylase activity, and ALKBH7 is known to auto-hydroxylate on Leucine 110, suggesting it has hydroxylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).

To determine β-oxidation levels in the heart, a mostly fat-burning organ, Seahorse XF analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes from <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and WT mice was undertaken, revealing a small but significant decrease in oleate oxidation at baseline, with this effect disappearing upon stimulation of maximal respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although HADH is primarily involved in the β-oxidation of short chain fatty acids, we hypothesized based on P-OH proteomic data and the obese phenotype that prolyl-hydroxylation of HADH may regulate its activity. However, western blotting showed no alteration in HADH protein levels between WT and <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and activity assays of both short-chain HADH (<italic>Hadh</italic> gene) and long-chain HADH (<italic>Hadha</italic> gene) revealed no differences between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

As the table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> shows several mitochondrial heat-shock proteins were identified as ALKBH7 interactors, despite no such proteins being differentially hydroxylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This finding is in agreement with a recent antibody-based immunoprecipitation study which suggested a role for ALKBH7 in proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meng et al., 2019</xref>), although the functional significance of this for necrosis is unclear (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and related text). An additional protein hit was the NDUFS7 subunit of respiratory complex I, which the BioPlex interactome database also reports as an ALKBH7 interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schweppe et al., 2018</xref>).

Although ALKBH7 itself appears in the proteomic data set, this is not an indication of improper deletion. The original knockout targeted exons 2–5 containing the active site, whereas the peptides found here were in exon 1. While we cannot exclude the possibility of dominant negative effects due to an inactive truncation product, limited experiments with heterozygous animals (not shown) did not reproduce any phenotypes observed in homozygous knockouts.

GLO-1 is also upregulated, possibly in response to MGO elevation. Both elevated glycolysis and GLO-1 then protect against IR injury.

Due to its higher baseline level of MGO stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>), the <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> heart is likely more dependent on GLO-1 activity and may therefore be hypersensitized to its inhibition. This finding suggests an important role for anti-glycation enzymes such as GLO-1 in cardiac functional homeostasis. In this regard, the mitochondrial protein DJ-1 has been shown to function as a glyoxal detoxifying enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) and was also recently shown to confer cardioprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shimizu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimizu et al., 2020</xref>). However, no differences in the levels of DJ-1 were observed in <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that the signaling pathways engaged by ALKBH7 loss are somewhat specific to GLO-1 and may not engage other dialdehyde detoxification pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Summarizing the current findings, a comprehensive analysis of the <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse heart suggests ALKBH7 is not a functional prolyl-hydroxylase that regulates mitochondrial activity, and that its role in necrosis involves rewiring of MGO metabolism. While our prolyl-hydroxylation proteomic findings were made at baseline, it may be argued that ALKBH7 could adopt a prolyl-hydroxylase function only under stress conditions. However, like all other α-KG dioxygenases, ALKBH7 uses oxygen as a substrate, so would be unlikely to engage additional hydroxylation substrates under oxygen-limited conditions such as ischemia.</p><p>We propose a scheme linking ALKBH7 loss to cardioprotection and glycative stress, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. Specifically, ALKBH7 loss triggers a mild defect in fat oxidation and an elevated rate of glycolysis, possibly via perilipin five and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 2 (proteomic data). The resulting glycative stress triggers rewiring of glyoxal metabolism, in particular GLO-1 induction, which then endows the added benefit of protection against IR injury. In addition, elevation of glycolysis per se may contribute to the cardioprotected phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nadtochiy et al., 2015</xref>). The relative position of GLO-1 as a downstream consequence of altered metabolism or as a driver of it, is currently unclear. In this regard, a recent systems genetic analysis identified <italic>Glo1</italic> as an important gene in the regulation of lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parker et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting GLO-1 and metabolic fuel switching may be parallel responses to ALKBH7 loss. The exact mechanism by which ALKBH7, thought to be a mitochondrial protein, can communicate to GLO-1, a cytosolic protein, is unclear, although our finding that a portion of ALKBH7 protein is located in the cytosol raises the possibility that it is the cytosolic component of ALKBH7 which mediates these effects.</p><p>A surprising finding herein was that GLO-1 was upregulated in <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice without concomitant upregulation of its companion enzyme GLO-2. The GLO-1/GLO-2 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) typically recycles GSH, and as predicted <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited depleted GSH levels. While such a finding might cast focus on oxidative stress as a phenotypic driver in <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, recent discoveries have implicated the GLO-1/GLO-2 system in epigenetic signaling. Specifically, the product of GLO-1, S-lactoylglutathione (SLG), has been shown to mediate the lactylation of lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaffney et al., 2020</xref>), including in histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), which may represent a link between metabolism and gene regulation. As such, it is possible that SLG levels may be elevated in <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, which could drive epigenetic changes that underlie the phenotypes of the knockout. Unfortunately, attempts to quantify lysine-lactylation by western blotting were hampered by a cross-reactivity of the antibody with MGO adducts (pre-print at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/sba8j">https://osf.io/sba8j</ext-link>).</p><p>The origins of the sexual dimorphism in necrosis and IR injury in <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice remain unclear. In this regard, a recent study identified S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNO-R) as a potential modulator of IR injury in male vs. female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casin et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, GSNO-R can function as a formaldehyde dehydrogenase, and formaldehyde is a product of the DNA demethylation reaction carried out by many ALKBHs. As such, it is possible that the role of ALKBH7 in necrosis may involve generation of formaldehyde, such that ALKBH7 deletion in males is protective by lowering the levels of this metabolite, whereas females have elevated GSNO-R levels so are already conditioned to lower formaldehyde levels.</p><p>The results herein may also provide insight to the complex biology of the diabetic heart. The incidence and progression of cardiac pathology such as heart failure is significantly worse in diabetes, and this is thought to be partly due to elevated glycative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kenny and Abel, 2019</xref>). However, somewhat paradoxically the diabetic heart is relatively protected against acute IR injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravingerova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nawata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). As such, it is interesting to speculate whether the mechanisms of ischemic tolerance seen in the male <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> heart, stemming from GLO-1 upregulation, may also apply to the diabetic heart. An additional ramification of the current results may be in the area of cancer biology, where there has been interest in the potential use of GLO-1 inhibitors to target metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaffney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rabbani et al., 2018</xref>). The apparent cardiotoxic effects of SBB-GSH-CpE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggest that caution may be required in the use of such drugs to ensure they do not elicit cardiac toxicity.</p><p>Although the precise biologic function and substrates of the ALKBH7 enzyme remain unknown, it is tempting to speculate that the native function of the enzyme may be in the detoxification of MGO or reactive intermediates prior to the formation of glycative adducts, such that ALKBH7 deletion drives the responses seen herein, to limit formation of MGO and its downstream intermediates. Recently, it was found that an R182Q substitution in ALKBH7 was positively selected for during the evolution of nectivorous bats (whose diet is mostly sugar) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gutiérrez-Guerrero et al., 2020</xref>), thus furthering the notion that ALKBH7 is inherently linked to glucose metabolism, a major source of MGO. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of MGO homeostasis in the heart and suggest novel therapeutic targets for protection of tissues against IR injury. Further work is required to elucidate the signaling mechanisms that link the biochemical function of ALKBH7 to MGO metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and materials</title><p><italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice on a C57BL/6J background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Solberg et al., 2013</xref>) were bred conventionally (WT x KO), PCR genotyped at weaning, and maintained according to the ‘NIH Guide’ (8th edition, 2011) on an IACUC approved protocol, with food and water available ad libitum.

Eight pairs of samples were prepared and analyzed in April 2017 in a core facility setting, yielding data for 61 metabolites. A further nine pairs of samples were prepared and analyzed in April 2019 in the senior author’s laboratory, yielding additional data for 71 metabolites. Overall the analysis included 90 metabolites in total with 43 common between both data sets. As such the number of biological replicates varied between 8 and 17 depending on the metabolite in question. To process the metabolomic data set, outliers were flagged where the group-wise (WT or <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) data for a given metabolite exhibited a greater than 25% standard error, and individual values outside the 95% confidence intervals were removed. Missing values were imputed as weighted medians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aittokallio, 2010</xref>) ,only in situations where more than 75% of original values were still present. Of a potential 2286 total data points, 21 outliers and 32 missing values were imputed, representing 2.3% of the total data set.</p><p>For the measurement of glycolytic flux, following 20 min of stable normoxic perfusion, <sup>12</sup>C glucose in KH buffer was replaced with [U-<sup>13</sup>C] glucose, and hearts perfused for a further 5 min. Hearts were then freeze-clamped and processed similar to steady-state metabolomics, with a custom SRM library used to detect isotopologues of common metabolites. Fractional saturation of selected metabolites with <sup>13</sup>C label was determined, with correction for natural <sup>13</sup>C abundance, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nadtochiy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Hearts from male WT and <italic>Alkbh7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were fractionated by differential centrifugation as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nadtochiy et al., 2018</xref>). Protein content was determined by the Folin-Phenol (Lowry) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lowry et al., 1951</xref>). Non-mitochondrial samples were diluted two-fold in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and incubated at 100°C for 5 min. Mitochondrial samples were diluted two-fold in sample loading buffer containing five times the standard concentration of SDS and incubated at 25°C for 30 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% or 15% gels) and transferred to 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antibodies as recommended by manufacturer’s protocols. Antibodies used include anti-ALKBH7 (#A2331, Abclonal, Woburn MA), anti-HSPD1 (#AP2859b Abgent, San Diego, CA), anti-LONP1 (#AP19551c Abgent), anti-CLPP (#PA5-79051 Thermo-Fisher, Waltham MA), anti-methylglyoxal (#ab243074 Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-GLO1 (#ab137098 Abcam), anti-HADHSC (#sc-376525 Santa Cruz Biotech’, Dallas TX), Anti DJ-1 (#2134, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and anti ANT1 (#ab110322, Abcam​​). Detection employed horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies with chemiluminescent detection (KwikQuant, Kindle Bioscience, Greenwich, CT). Sample loading was normalized to Ponceau S staining of membranes immediately after transfer. For most blots frozen samples were used following appropriate fractionation, but for MGO adduct blots we found the signal decayed over time with sample storage at minus 80°C, so freshly harvested samples were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Blue-native electrophoresis</title><p>Mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes were extracted and analyzed essentially as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beutner et al., 2017</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matthias Barton, MD as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James Galligan (Reviewer #1); John Calvert (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the current study, the authors sought to examine the role of ALKBH7 in the control of necrosis following the onset of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Using a multi-omics approach, the authors found that ALKBH7 does not seem to function as a prolyl-hydroxlase or mediate changes in the heart via protein-protein interactions. Rather, ALKBH7 deficient hearts have elevated levels of glycative stress and an upregulation in the expression of the anti-glycative stress protein glyoxylase-1 (GLO-1). The latter is shown to mediate the cardioprotection found in the hearts of ALKBH7 deficient mice. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive assessment of how ALKBH7 deficiency alters glyoxal metabolism in the heart and how this can impart protection against ischemic injury. The experimental approach is appropriate and the results are presented in a clear manner. Remaining issues are related to supporting the conclusions that ALKBH7 elicits hormetic signaling to upregulate GLO-1.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The authors state &quot;it is tempting to speculate that the native function of the enzyme may be in the repair of glycative adducts, such that its deletion drives the responses seen herein to limit formation of such adducts&quot; but this is not very likely, given the structure of these adducts, particularly MG-H1. This hydroimizalone is highly stable and not likely to undergo any type of enzymatic removal. The removal of the intermediate, however, is more likely (akin to the proposed mechanism of action of DJ-1). Further, the removal of the adduct, itself, is unlikely to contribute substantially to the elevated concentrations of methylglyoxal observed. Thus, the more likely scenario is that ALKBH7 may detoxify methylglyoxal. Given that the substrates for this enzyme are &quot;poorly characterized&quot; this may be the mechanism by which ALKBH7 knockout results in increased methylglyoxal, thus leading to the increased GLO-1 protein expression. This notion should at least be discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>– How were non-specific <italic>Alkbh7</italic> interacting proteins controlled for in the FLAG-pulldown experiments? Gel images should be included in the supplement.</p><p>– Given the suggestion that <italic>Alkbh7</italic> may regulate the glyoxalase pathway (or act on methylglyoxal, directly), it is important to quantify the levels of methylglyoxal and SLG. The western blotting data is not overtly convincing and the authors clearly have the MS capability to carry out a more elegant quantification of glyoxalase function/activity. This can also be done with the 13C flux experiment. Do the authors see elevations in 13C-methylglyoxal and/or 13C-SLG? Lastly, the reduction in GSH and the combination of increased GLO-1 and (modestly) reduced GLO-2 certainly suggests that suggests that SLG would be increased, rather than methylglyoxal, and the effects observed may be due to increased SLG, rather than increased methylglyoxal.</p><p>– In line with the point addressed above, is it possible that the female mice do not display these changes in methylglyoxal metabolism and this is the reason for the sexual dimorphism? Inclusion of the female mice is a bit confusing but perhaps this is a useful &quot;control&quot; for the hormetic effects of methylglyoxal?</p><p>– Figure 6: SBB-GSH-CpE is simply a modified GSH and thus very likely to act on multiple enzymes that act on GSH and/or GSH detoxification products. While this is a commercial inhibitor &quot;specific for GLO-1&quot; and no characterization of the off-target effects of this compound is required, the levels of methylglyoxal, at minimum, must be measured here to demonstrate that the inhibitor is, in fact, elevating the levels of methylglyoxal.</p><p>– Figure 6: are methylglyoxal-derived modifications elevated following SBB-GSH-CpE treatment?</p><p>– The authors appear to have quantified α-KG in their metabolomics supplement, with no statistical changes being noted. Given the dependence of <italic>Alkbh7</italic> on α-KG, the authors should state that this was measured, indicating no significant changes. Without demonstrating elevations in methylglyoxal and/or SLG, it is hard to conclusively argue the hormetic effects of methylglyoxal in this context.</p><p>– The evidence for the induction of hormetic signaling in the absence of ALKBH7 is not fully supported. Specifically, the link directly tying ALKBH7 to GLO-1 is missing. The authors suggest that Nrf2 could be contributing. This would indicate that elevated levels of oxidative stress could be in play. Additionally, the authors indicate that SLG could be a link. In both cases, evidence to support either potential mechanism is not provided. Some insights are needed to support the hormetic-signaling hypothesis.</p><p>– The authors clearly show that removing glucose from the perfusate attenuates the protective effects of ALKBH7 in the setting of myocardial ischemia injury. From this data, the authors suggest that this supports a role for elevated glyoxal metabolism. However, the MGO levels should still be elevated in the hearts and more importantly GLO-1 levels should still be elevated. It seems to reason that this data would indicate a deficit in fat utilization.</p><p>– The authors provide evidence that the deficiency of ALKBH7 does not provide protection in the female heart and that with age male ALKBH7 mice lose protection against ischemic injury. It would be nice to know if the levels of MGO or GLO-1 are altered in either instance.</p><p>– The authors provide compelling evidence for minimal changes in hydroxyproline levels in ALKBH7 mice at baseline. While this is indicative of basal conditions, there is not any evidence related to the activity of ALKBH7 in the setting of myocardial ischemia. If ALKBH7 is a stress-induced protein, it is possible that changes in hydroxyproline-modified proteins could become evident under these conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58573.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The authors state &quot;it is tempting to speculate that the native function of the enzyme may be in the repair of glycative adducts, such that its deletion drives the responses seen herein to limit formation of such adducts&quot; but this is not very likely, given the structure of these adducts, particularly MG-H1.

As such, it is unlikely we will be able to have functional measurements of MGO or SLG by mass-spectrometry in the near future. In lieu of a mass spectrometric assay for MGO, we attempted to measure MGO levels in WT and <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> hearts using a colorimetric MGO assay kit (Biovision K500-100). However, MGO was not detectable in any of the biological samples tested. A note to this effect has been added to the Results text (subsection “Metabolomics analysis in <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> confirms rewired glyoxal metabolism”).</p><p>Regarding SLG, we did previously highlight the possible role of SLG in mediating the effects of ALKBH7 loss, via lactylation of lysine residues (Discussion). We performed a western blot on WT and <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> samples using a novel lactyl-lysine antibody, but simultaneously we discovered that this antibody also recognizes MGO adducts (preprint posted at https://osf.io/sba8j). In addition, another lab has raised issues on the topic of lysine lactylation (preprint at https://osf.io/kyab5). We have now modified this section of the Discussion to incorporate these novel findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In line with the point addressed above, is it possible that the female mice do not display these changes in methylglyoxal metabolism and this is the reason for the sexual dimorphism?

MGO adduct levels were elevated in <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> males, and this drove our thinking that hormetic signaling is a mechanism underlying induction of GLO-1, which then confers protective benefits in IR injury.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that female <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice still exhibited an elevation in GLO-1 at both the protein and activity level (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C/D/E). However, the elevated GLO-1 activity in female <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> only approached the levels seen in WT males, owing to a lower baseline GLO-1 activity in females (note – these data are split across two figures in the manuscript and supplement, so are shown collated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58573-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Underlying this lower GLO-1 activity, we also found that female <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice did not exhibit an elevation in MGO adduct formation relative to WT (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1F/G/H). This suggests that glycative stress is blunted in females, such that female <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice may not reach a threshold of GLO-1 activity required for protection.Although a skeptical response to these data might be “well GLO-1 is not important for protection because it is elevated in both male and female but only the males are protected”, it should be emphasized that the data in Figure 6 show that GLO-1 inhibition abrogates protection, which argues the necessity of GLO-1 for the protected phenotype. These new findings in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 are now discussed in the Results section (subsection “Loss of ALKBH7 protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6: SBB-GSH-CpE is simply a modified GSH and thus very likely to act on multiple enzymes that act on GSH and/or GSH detoxification products.

As mentioned above, attempts to measure MGO levels using a colorimetric assay were unsuccessful. Regarding MGO adducts, the time of SBB-GSH-CpE treatment in the perfused heart experiments was only 10 minutes, which would be unlikely to result in elevated MGO adduct formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors appear to have quantified α-KG in their metabolomics supplement, with no statistical changes being noted.

Neither α-KG nor succinate were significantly different between WT and KO, suggesting the enzyme does not contribute to the overall levels of these metabolites. This is in line with the finding that α-KGDH and SDH (complex II) activities were unaltered (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The evidence for the induction of hormetic signaling in the absence of ALKBH7 is not fully supported.

We have no evidence that Nrf-2 is involved, and so have rewritten this part of the Results section to remove mention of this signaling pathway, as well as deemphasizing hormesis throughout the manuscript. The updated schematic in Figure 6D also reflects our revised interpretation of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors clearly show that removing glucose from the perfusate attenuates the protective effects of ALKBH7 in the setting of myocardial ischemia injury. From this data, the authors suggest that this supports a role for elevated glyoxal metabolism. However, the MGO levels should still be elevated in the hearts and more importantly GLO-1 levels should still be elevated. It seems to reason that this data would indicate a deficit in fat utilization.</p></disp-quote><p>While the result in question (loss of protected phenotype due to lack of glucose) could be interpreted as indicating an inability to switch to fat metabolism, and this would be consistent with previous reports on the <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse (Solberg et al., 2013) we now note in the text that lack of glucose resulted in no difference in baseline cardiac function, suggesting no problem in adapting to burning fat only in the knockouts (subsection “Cardioprotection in <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> requires GLO-1”). This is also supported by the seahorse data showing no defect in maximal respiration on fat only. In addition, fat oxidation does not occur during ischemia, so a difference in FAO should not matter for the ischemic setting.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree there was a lack of clarity in explaining the logic for these experiments, and it is easy to see how the paragraph describing the glucose-free perfusion experiments, with a subject heading on glyoxal metabolism and a paragraph below on GLO-1, could easily be misconstrued as supporting “a role for elevated glyoxal metabolism”.</p><p>We have re-written this section to provide more clarity on our interpretation of the glucose-only result. We have also broken out the glucose-only perfusion data and the GLO-1 inhibitor data into two separate sections, each with their own subject headings (subsections “Cardioprotection in <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> requires glycolysis” and “Cardioprotection in <italic>Alkbh7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> requires GLO-1”) and further discussion and context for each.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors provide evidence that the deficiency of ALKBH7 does not provide protection in the female heart and that with age male ALKBH7 mice lose protection against ischemic injury.

We were unable to procure additional aged mice to see if similar differences were present in old vs. young, although we did provide a reference showing that GLO-1 levels decline with age (Rabbani, Xue and Thornalley, 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors provide compelling evidence for minimal changes in hydroxyproline levels in ALKBH7 mice at baseline.

It is therefore unlikely that any differences in proline hydroxylation (addition of oxygen) would be seen under ischemic conditions. We have added a note about this to the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
