Integrating changes in signal transduction pathways and cellular metabolism is essential for effective NK cells responses. The glycolytic enzyme Pyruvate Kinase Muscle 2 (PKM2) has described roles in regulating glycolytic flux and signal transduction, particularly gene transcription. While PKM2 expression is robustly induced in activated NK cells, mice lacking PKM2 in NK cells showed no defect in NK cell metabolism, transcription or antiviral responses to MCMV infection. NK cell metabolism was maintained due to compensatory PKM1 expression in PKM2-null NK cells. To further investigate the role of PKM2, we used TEPP-46, which increases PKM2 catalytic activity while inhibiting any PKM2 signalling functions. NK cells activated with TEPP-46 had reduced effector function due to TEPP-46-induced increases in oxidative stress. Overall, PKM2-regulated glycolytic metabolism and redox status, not transcriptional control, facilitate optimal NK cells responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>immunology</kwd><kwd>nk cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walls</surname><given-names>Jessica F</given-names></name><name><surname>Subleski</surname><given-names>Jeff J</given-names></name><name><surname>Palmieri</surname><given-names>Erika M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gonzalez Cotto</surname><given-names>Marieli</given-names></name><name><surname>McVicar</surname><given-names>Daniel W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106811/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Walls</surname><given-names>Jessica F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18/ERCS/6005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finlay</surname><given-names>David K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pharmacological activation of the metabolic activities of PKM2 in murine NK cells disrupts cellular redox balance and inhibits optimal NK cell effector functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural Killer (NK) cells are key lymphocytes for the control of viral infection and cancer immunosurveillance. Glycolysis is important for the function of NK cells as inhibition of glycolysis disrupts normal NK cell effector functions including the production of IFNγ and the lysis of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donnelly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keating et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loftus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kedia-Mehta et al., 2019</xref>). Glucose breakdown through glycolysis provides energy, in the form of ATP, both directly and via generation of pyruvate to fuel mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Oxidation of glucose also produces glycolytic intermediates that feed into ancillary metabolic pathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to support cellular processes including biosynthesis and antioxidant activities. For instance, the glycolytic intermediate glucose-6-phosphate can feed into the PPP for the production of nucleotides and to generate NADPH, an important cofactor for cellular biosynthesis and for maintaining cellular redox control. Glycolytic intermediates and enzymes can also play a role in directly regulating immune functions. For example, in T lymphocytes, the metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate can control Ca<sup>2+</sup>/NFAT signalling and the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has a role outside of glycolysis where it can control the translation of IFNγ and IL-2 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). Another glycolytic enzyme linked to the control of immune functions is an isoform of the final enzyme in glycolysis, pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM).</p><p>In most tissues, alternative splicing of the PKM gene yields two isoforms, PKM1 and PKM2. PKM1 forms a homo tetramer that efficiently converts phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP into pyruvate and ATP. While PKM2 can similarly form a catalytically efficient tetramer, it is also found as a monomer/dimer (called monomeric PKM2 hereafter) that has substantially less catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christofk et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, in situations where PKM2 is predominantly mono/dimeric, the rate of glycolytic flux may be slowed leading to an accumulation of upstream glycolytic intermediates that can be diverted into other pathways such as the PPP to support cellular biosynthesis. Accordingly, PKM2 expression has been found to be elevated in many cells with high biosynthetic burdens including tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hitosugi et al., 2009</xref>). Monomeric PKM2 has also been shown to have functions independent of its metabolic role in glycolysis, primarily in the nucleus where it contributes to transcriptional control through interactions with the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hitosugi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Demaria and Poli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2016</xref>). The balance between catalytically less active mono/dimeric PKM2, with potential signalling roles, and catalytically more active tetrameric PKM2, without signalling roles, is controlled by a range of cellular factors. For instance, mono/dimeric PKM2 is converted to the catalytically efficient tetramer when levels of upstream metabolites such as fructose-1,6-phosphate or serine are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasiou et al., 2012</xref>). In this way, PKM2 operates as a rheostat by sensing upstream pools of glycolytic and biosynthetic intermediates and tuning glycolytic rates accordingly to carefully balance metabolic needs for cellular growth and function.</p><p>While activated NK cells are known to engage elevated levels of glycolysis to support rapid growth, proliferation and function, how glycolytic flux is controlled to promote these processes in NK cells is not understood. In particular, what role PKM2 plays in supporting NK cell metabolic and functional responses is unknown. Here, we use genetic and pharmacological approaches in vitro to show that PKM2 does not have a significant role in regulating the transcriptional landscape of NK cells. Additionally, we find that although PKM2 is highly expressed in activated NK cells, in the absence of PKM2 these cells can precisely adjust the expression of PKM1 to control overall PKM activity demonstrating a remarkable capability of NK cells for precise metabolic plasticity. In contrast, acute pharmacological activation of PKM2 catalytic activity blunted NK cell growth and effector functions. These defects were associated with increased levels of ROS and a transcriptional signature indicating oxidative stress that we linked to reduced PPP metabolites and decreased NADPH levels. Overall, this study reveals an important metabolic role for PKM2 in supporting the PPP and redox balance in activated NK cells and highlights that PKM2 does not have a profound transcriptional role in all immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PKM2 expression is induced in activated NK cells</title><p>To investigate whether NK cell activation in vivo is associated with changes in PKM2 expression mice were injected with poly(I:C) and splenocytes were isolated for analysis. There was a significant increase in the expression of PKM2 in NK cells from mice that received poly(I:C) as measured by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To further investigate PKM2 expression splenic NK cells were cultured for 6 days in low-dose IL-15, a cytokine required for DC-mediated NK cell priming in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lucas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubois et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koka et al., 2004</xref>) (called ‘cultured NK cells’ hereafter). These cultured NK cells were purified and stimulated with IL-2 plus IL-12 and PKM2 protein and mRNA expression measured over the course of 24 hr by western blot analysis and rtPCR, respectively. The expression of PKM2 increased over time following activation peaking at 24 hr post cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The mammalian Target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has been shown to be active both in NK cells stimulated in vivo following poly(I:C) injection, and in IL-2/IL-12 stimulated NK cells, and is an important regulator of NK cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donnelly et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of mTORC1 activity using the inhibitor rapamycin significantly reduced the abundance of PKM2 mRNA and protein in IL-2/12 stimulated cultured NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Rapamycin efficacy was confirmed by immunoblot for phosphorylation of the mTORC1 target, ribosomal s6 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Similarly, we confirmed that <italic>Pkm1</italic> mRNA is expressed and regulated by mTORC1 in IL-2/12 stimulated NK cells along with PKM1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Although we were primarily concerned with the pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) family of enzymes, we also confirmed that NK cells do not express the liver- and erythrocyte-specific isoforms of pyruvate kinase, PK-L and PK-R respectively, using quantitative proteomics. We observed upwards of 6 × 10<sup>6</sup> copies of PKM peptide in IL-2/12 stimulated NK cells, with no detectable peptides from the <italic>Pklr</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). As both PKM1 and PKM2 are induced with IL-2/12 stimulation, we next asked if they are present in comparable quantities. Interestingly, quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that PKM2 is ninefold more abundant than PKM1 in cytokine activated NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). PKM2 is known to exist in three different oligomeric conformations, monomers, dimers and tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angiari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shirai et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore assessed what conformation PKM2 was expressed by cultured NK cells. This was achieved using disuccinimidylsuberate (DSS) crosslinking in unstimulated or IL-2/12-stimulated NK cells, whereby proteins in close proximity are ‘linked’ to each other by DSS. The cells can then be lysed and assessed by immunoblot for PKM2 expression. Western blotting revealed that IL-2/12-stimulated NK cells express both monomeric and tetrameric PKM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Therefore, PKM2 expression is robustly increased in activated NK cells, is the dominant pyruvate kinase isoform in these metabolically active cells and is present as both monomers and tetramers.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PKM2 is expressed and is the predominant PKM isoform in activated murine NK cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Wildtype C57Bl/6 mice were injected with saline (100 μL), low-dose poly(I:C) (100 μg/100 μL) or high-dose poly(I:C) (200 μg/100 μL) I. P.

Therefore, we used RNAseq analysis to investigate whether there were any differences in gene expression in <italic>Pkm2</italic><sup>NK-KO</sup> versus <italic>Pkm2</italic><sup>NK-WT</sup> NK cells.

To further investigate the effect of PKM2 in NK cell gene expression, an acute pharmacological approach was used to manipulate PKM2 function. TEPP-46 is a pharmacological activator of PKM2 function that promotes the oligomerisation of mono/dimeric PKM2 into tetrameric, catalytically active PKM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasiou et al., 2012</xref>), resulting in the loss of non-glycolytic PKM2 signalling functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angiari et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, cultured NK cells were stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 in the presence or absence of TEPP-46 and analysed by RNA-seq.

TEPP-46-treated NK cells also showed reduced proliferation in response to IL2/IL12 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was consistent with the concept that monomeric PKM2 promotes cellular growth by limiting the last step of glycolysis and allowing glycolytic intermediates to be diverted into biosynthetic pathways. In this scenario, TEPP-46 would drain glycolysis of glycolytic intermediates and reduce biosynthesis and cellular growth. However, NK cells stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 plus TEPP-46, the basal rates of glycolysis were equivalent to those of NK cells stimulated with IL-2/IL-12 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). There was also a small but significant effect on NK cell glycolytic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). While metabolomics analysis showed no decrease in the levels glycolytic intermediates there were decreased levels of the PPP metabolite ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) arguing that in the presence of TEPP-46 glucose-6-phosphate might be withheld from the PPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d,e</xref>). Since the PPP is important for the biosynthesis of nucleotides and for maintaining redox balance in the cell, we considered whether decreased flux through the PPP in response to TEPP-46 might lead to increased cellular ROS levels. Indeed, TEPP-46-treated NK cells showed a dramatic increase in ROS compared to vehicle controls, as measured using the flow cytometric ROS probe H2-DCFDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Inhibition of flux through the PPP using the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor, DHEA, similarly resulted in an increase in ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). The PPP supports redox balance because it generates NADPH, the electron donor required for the redox enzymes glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase. Accordingly, we found a significant decrease in the levels of NADPH in TEPP-46-treated NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Moreover, supporting that there was increased oxidative stress in TEPP-46-treated NK cells, our RNAseq data showed that two of the most significantly upregulated genes in TEPP-46-treated NK cells were members of the metallothionein family, namely <italic>Mt1</italic> and <italic>Mt2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>).

While there was no difference in the membrane potential-dependent mitochondrial mass in TEPP-46 treated NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>), we found that there was a substantial decrease in the basal rates of OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>). Additionally, there was a greatly decreased maximum respiration and spare respiratory capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g,h</xref>). Normal mitochondrial mass with reduced maximum respiration suggest that there was reduced fueling of OXPHOS. Two prominent metabolic cycles that feed electrons into the mitochondrial electron transport chain are the TCA cycle and the Citrate-Malate shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loftus et al., 2018</xref>). The metabolites of both these cycles were reduced in TEPP-46 treated NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8i</xref>). While malate is shared between both these metabolic cycles, succinic and fumaric acids are specific for the TCA cycle. In line with decreased fueling of oxidative metabolism, the levels of glutamine and glutamate were also reduced indicative of impaired glutaminolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8j</xref>). The transcription factor cMyc is important for glutamine metabolism and was also found to be reduced in TEPP-46-treated NK cells; however, this was only at the protein level as it was not found to be altered in the transcriptomic dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8k</xref>). Considering the increased ROS in TEPP-46-treated NK cells, we investigated whether the use of cellular antioxidants could reverse NK cell dysfunction. Interestingly, the addition of antioxidant MitoQ was sufficient to partially restore the expression of cMyc protein expression in TEPP-46-treated NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). We could also profoundly reduce TEPP-46 induced ROS using the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>). In addition, NAC treatment could rescue the production of IFNγ, but not that of TNF in NK cells stimulated with IL2/12+TEPP46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Antioxidant treatment can protect against TEPP-46 induced ROS.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cultured NK cells were stimulated with IL-2/12 for 18 hr +/- TEPP-46 (50 μM) in the presence or absence of MitoQ (50 nM) or left unstimulated (low-dose IL-15).

This ‘moonlighting’ activity has been demonstrated in macrophages, T cells and cancer cells where PKM2 supports the function of transcription factors including HIF1α and STATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angiari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palsson-McDermott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Our study shows that PKM2 has no significant role in regulating HIF1α and STAT associated gene expression in NK cells. The data clearly show that while PKM2 is the most highly expressed isoform in NK cells, either deletion of PKM2 or allosteric tetramerisation of PKM2 has minimal impact upon the NK cell transcriptome and that there was no evidence of significantly altered expression of HIF1α or STAT target genes. This study highlights that diversity of regulatory circuits in immune cells and shows the importance of verifying mechanisms in individual immune cell subsets.</p><p>Stimulated NK cells preferentially express PKM2 over PKM1 for metabolic reasons. Unlike PKM1, PKM2 can exist in different conformations that have different catalytic activities. PKM2 tetramers are highly enzymatically active and have a Km for phosphoenolpyruvate of 0.03 mM, whereas PKM2 mono/dimers are considerably less active with a Km of 0.46 mM as measured in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mazurek, 2011</xref>). Therefore, the expression of PKM2 gives NK cells the ability to quickly regulate their glycolytic flux toward anabolic or catabolic processes and confers upon them a level of metabolic plasticity. It has been previously demonstrated that NK cells lacking the metabolic regulator mTORC1 are defective in responding to MCMV challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, mice treated with 2-deoxyglucose, a glycolytic inhibitor are impaired in their responses to MCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mah et al., 2017</xref>). However, in this study, genetic deletion of <italic>Pkm2</italic> resulted in a normal phenotype 4 days post-MCMV infection. <italic>Pkm2</italic><sup>NK-KO</sup> cells only express PKM1 which in theory should be kinetically more efficient at producing pyruvate than <italic>Pkm2</italic><sup>NK-WT</sup> cells. It would have been expected that these PKM1-only expressing cells would demonstrate dysregulated metabolism and higher levels of glycolytic flux. However, the PKM1-only expressing NK cells in this study demonstrated a remarkable ability to transcriptionally titrate the overall level of PKM1 to match a similar level of glycolytic flux to <italic>Pkm2</italic><sup>NK-WT</sup> cells in vitro. We propose that this compensation is sufficient to allow NK cells to mount a normal immune response to MCMV infection, a process for which regulated NK cell metabolism is known to be important.</p><p>Although, PKM1 can metabolically compensate for PKM2, there is no evidence in the literature that PKM1 can substitute for PKM2-mediated signalling and transcriptional regulation. The data presented in this study show that PKM2 deletion does not adversely affect previously described PKM2-regulated signalling axes. These data are surprising as PKM2 has been previously shown to regulate cMyc, HIF1α and STAT5 signalling in CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angiari et al., 2020</xref>). Although cMyc was reduced with TEPP-46 treatment in this study, it is important to note that this effect is secondary PKM2 metabolic regulation of NK cells as it is TEPP46-induced ROS production that leads to reduced cMyc protein expression. This was demonstrated by the rescued cMyc expression upon the addition of antioxidants. However, the reduced levels of cMyc protein were not sufficient to have a substantial impact on the expression of described cMyc target genes as there were only a total of 6 DEG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The increased ROS in TEPP46 treated cells is likely to have accumulated over the 24 hr activation period and by extension it is likely that cMyc expression was not impaired at earlier time points. This may explain the lack of a cMyc gene signature in the list of differentially expressed genes identified in the RNAseq analysis. It will be of interest to further explore the relationship between PKM2, ROS and cMyc in the regulation of NK cell function.</p><p>It is also tempting to speculate that the profound differences in PKM2 function between NK cells and other cell types may be due to both functional and technical reasons. Although NK cells and T cells are both lymphocytes and have similar functional roles, their methods and contexts of activation vastly differ. T cells require a two-signal activation composed of both TCR/costimulatory molecule ligation and/or IL-2 signalling. In the context of PKM2-mediated T cell metabolic signalling, it is possible that receptor-mediated signalling may play an important role in activating the non-metabolic functions of PKM2. Indeed, in TCR stimulated T cells, levels of phosphoenolpyruvate (a PKM substrate) positively regulates activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ho et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, in theory, increased PKM2 activity would drain the pool of phosphoenolpyruvate, resulting in decreased NFAT activation in response to TCR ligation. It is interesting to note that NFAT has been previously shown to regulate transcription at the cMyc promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mognol et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore this may somewhat explain why NK cells have a less profound signalling phenotype than CD4+ T cells. In this study, NK cells were activated in vitro using cytokines. It is interesting to speculate that receptor mediated activation of NK cells may similarly reveal a signalling role for PKM2 in vitro.</p><p>From a technical point of view, it may also be that the method of PKM2 manipulation plays a role in whether PKM2 is required for transcription in different experimental systems. Indeed, most studies investigating PKM2 in immune cells using genetic approaches utilise shRNA to knock it down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kono et al., 2019</xref>) or acute excision of exon 10 using tamoxifen Cre models in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palsson-McDermott et al., 2015</xref>). Knockdown approaches do not always lead to total deletion of the protein and may have differential effects to a total knock out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zimmer et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, studies that utilise a tamoxifen Cre method of PKM2 ablation may also see more acute effects of PKM2 deletion. For example, Palsson-McDermott et. al, utilised a tamoxifen Cre x <italic>Pkm</italic>2<sup>fl/fl</sup> mouse model and observed some interesting transcriptional effects on HIF1α target genes such as <italic>Ldha</italic>. This Cre model differs from the one utilised in our current study as using the <italic>Ncr1</italic> Cre model involves deletion of PKM2 in vivo and during the immature stage of NK cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Narni-Mancinelli et al., 2011</xref>). It is possible that deletion of PKM2 during NK cell development in vivo in this study may allow for selection for cells that have PKM2-independent transcriptional programs. It is also possible to speculate that earlier deletion of PKM2, for example, in haematopoietic progenitor stage using a <italic>Vav</italic> Cre model may reveal an interesting developmental phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgiades et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches is important for studying metabolic systems and while each has its limitations, they combine to provide confidence in the overall results and conclusions. Herein, both approaches show the PKM2 does not critically regulate the NK cell transcriptome. However, both genetic and pharmacological approaches support an important metabolic role for PKM2 in NK cells. In PKM2<sup>NK-WT</sup> cells the recalibration of PKM1 levels indicates the importance of maintaining exact pyruvate kinase activity. Acute activation of PKM2 using TEPP-46 showed that controlling pyruvate kinase activity is important as it supports flux through the PPP to maintain redox balance in NK cells. Rerouting of glucose into the PPP has been shown to occur immediately after oxidative injury in skin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuehne et al., 2015</xref>) and PPP-controlled antioxidant response has also been shown to be important in the control of inflammatory macrophage responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baardman et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly CD4+ T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) divert glucose into the PPP to increase NADPH production for protection against ROS. This allows these RA-associated T cells to bypass normal cell cycle control points and to become hyperinflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). These studies indicate that there is an intricate relationship between PPP-derived antioxidants and immune function. Interestingly, PKM2 has been shown to be a key regulator of antioxidant defence in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, through direct regulation of flux into the PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated that PKM2-controlled metabolism is required for normal NK cell responses as treatment with TEPP-46 is detrimental to the production of a range of NK cell cytokines including IFNγ and TNFα. Moreover, mitochondrial damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>) or directly targeting OXPHOS using pharmacological inhibitors has also been shown to inhibit NK cell cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keating et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kedia-Mehta et al., 2019</xref>) and accordingly we found that one metabolic consequence of TEPP-46 treatment is the inhibition of mitochondrial OXPHOS.</p><p>TEPP-46 has been tested as an anti-tumour drug, whereby it has been shown to inhibit tumour growth in xenograft models in <italic>nu/nu</italic> mice which lack a functional immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasiou et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is important to consider the impact that such therapies would have for the antitumour immune responses. Although TEPP-46 showed some promise in preventing tumour growth, it is tempting to speculate that its efficacy may be hindered in mouse models with complete immune systems. As shown in this study, TEPP-46 is detrimental to NK cell metabolism and function. Similarly TEPP-46 has been shown to be anti-inflammatory in EAE models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angiari et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, PKM2 targeting therapies may not be suitable for treating cancer unless they can be specifically targeted to tumour cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Harlan (Bicester, U.K.) and maintained in compliance with Irish Department of Health and Children regulations and with the approval of the University of Dublin’s ethical review board.

Tandem mass tag (TMT) labelling and peptide clean-up were performed according to the SP3 protocol. Samples were eluted into 2% dimethyl sulphoxide in water, combined and dried in vacuo. The TMT samples were fractionated using off-line high pH reverse phase chromatography: samples were loaded onto a 4.6 × 250 mm Xbridge BEH130 C18 column with 3.5 µm particles (Waters). Using a Dionex BioRS system, the samples were separated using a 25-min multistep gradient of solvents A (10 mM formate at pH 9 in 2% acetonitrile) and B (10 mM ammonium formate pH 9 in 80% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peptides were separated into 48 fractions which were consolidated into 24 fractions. The fractions were subsequently dried and the peptides redissolved in 5% formic acid and analysed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

Samples were denatured at 95°C for 10 min, separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. PKM1 (D30G6), PKM2 (D78A4) and phospho- S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236) (D57.2.2E) were obtained from Cell Signalling. Actin (AC-15) was obtained from Abcam. Total S6 ribosomal protein (C-8) was obtained SantaCruz Biotechnology. Where western blotting stripping was required, Restore western blot stripping buffer (Thermo Fisher) was used, blots were re-blocked and subsequently probed for different proteins. For DSS crosslinking cells were suspended at 1 × 10<sup>7</sup>/ml in PBS and treated with 500 μM DSS for 30 min at room temperature. After 30 min, 5 µl of 1M Tris pH 7.5 was added to quench unreacted DSS. Cells were then lysed in sample buffer and electrophoresed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Seahorse metabolic flux analysis</title><p>For real-time analysis of the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of purified and expanded NK cells cultured under various conditions, a Seahorse XF-24 Analyser or a Seahorse XFe-96e Analyser (Agilent Technologies) was used. In brief, 750,000 MACS purified, expanded NK cells were added to a 24-well XF Cell Culture Microplate, 200,000 MACS purified NK cells to a 96-well XFe Cell Culture Microplate. All cell culture plates were treated with Cell-Tak (BD Pharmingen) to ensure that the NK cells adhere to the plate. Sequential measurements of ECAR and OCR following addition of the inhibitors (Sigma) oligomycin (2 μM), FCCP (1 μM), rotenone (100 nM) plus antimycin A (4 μM), and 2-deoxyglucose (2DG, 30 mM) allowed for the calculation of basal glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, basal mitochondrial respiration, and maximal mitochondrial respiration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Pyruvate kinase activity assay</title><p>For analysis of pyruvate kinase activity, cultured NK cells were purified and stimulated and lysed using assay buffer from the manufacturer (Biovision). Calls were lysed as 75,000 cells per well and carried out in triplicate technical replicates. The assay was measured using absorbance over time on a SpectraMax plate reader.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>NADPH level assay</title><p>Cells were lysed in 0.1 M NaOH with 0.5% DTAC for NADPH determination at 0.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well. Relative NADPH levels were then determined using the NADPH-Glo assay kit (Promega) as per manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>Two million MACS purified NK cells were washed twice in cold PBS. Cells were then lysed using the Gene Jet lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher). mRNA was purified using the Gene Jet RNA kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was quantified using NanoDrop. RNA was then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and sent on dry ice to the Frederick National Laboratory Sequencing facility for sequencing. RNA samples were first subjected to quality control analysis. RNA-Seq samples were then pooled and sequenced on HiSeq4000 using Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep and paired-end sequencing. The samples had 52 to 246 million pass filter reads with more than 90% of bases above the quality score of Q30. Reads of the samples were trimmed for adapters and low-quality bases using Cutadapt before alignment with the reference genome (Mouse - mm10) and the annotated transcripts using STAR. Library complexity was measured in terms of unique fragments in the mapped reads using Picard’s Mark Duplicate utility. The gene expression quantification analysis was performed for all samples using STAR/RSEM tools.</p><p>For mRNA quantification, BAM files were imported into Partek Genomic Suite software (Partek Inc) and the built-in RNA-seq workflow pipeline was used. Reads were aligned and quantified using RefSeq transcripts database based on the E/M algorithm.</p><p>Gene-level RPKMs were used for subsequent analyses. Differentially expressed genes were identified by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The threshold value has been set at 1.5-fold change and a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05. Differentially expressed genes were analysed by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA; Ingenuity Systems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Metabolomics</title><sec id="s4-15-1"><title>GC-MS metabolomics</title><p>Untargeted metabolomics was carried out by West Coast Metabolomics at UC Davis. 10 × 10<sup>6</sup> MACS purified NK cells were washed three times in cold PBS. Samples were then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. At UC Davis, samples were re-suspended with 1 ml of extraction buffer (37.5% degassed acetonitrile, 37.5% isopropanol and 20% water) at –20°C, centrifuged and evaporated to complete dryness. Membrane lipids and triglycerides were removed with 50% acetonitrile in water. The extract was aliquoted into two equal portions and the supernatant evaporated again. Internal standards C08-C30 fatty acid methyl esters were added and the sample derivatised by methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine and subsequently by <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide for trimethylsilylation of acidic protons. Gas chromatography-time-of-flight analysis was performed by the LECO Pegasus IV mass spectrometer. Samples were additionally normalised using the sum of peak heights for all identified metabolites (mTIC Normalisation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-2"><title>LC-MS metabolomics</title><p>Cell pellets for targeted analysis were washed and resuspended in ice cold 80% methanol. Phase separation was achieved by centrifugation at 4°C and the methanol-water phase containing polar metabolites was separated and dried using a vacuum concentrator. The dried metabolite samples were stored at −80°C and resuspended in Milli-Q water the day of analysis. An Agilent 6410 Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer interfaced with a 1200 Series HPLC quaternary pump (Agilent) was used for ESI-LC–MS/MS analysis in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Seven concentrations of standards, processed under the same conditions as the samples, were used to establish calibration curves. The best ﬁt was determined using regression analysis of the peak analyte area. Chromatographic resolution was obtained in reverse phase on a Zorbax SB-C18 (1.8 μm; Agilent) for amino acids and an Eclipse Plus C18 (1.8 μm; Agilent) for TCA and PPP intermediates, with a ﬂow rate set at 0.4 ml/min. Data were normalised to protein concentration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed by GraphPad Prism 8, with the tests used indicated in the figure legend. Datasets where two independent parameters were being compared (genotype and stimulation/treatment) were analysed by two-way ANOVA with Sidaks post-test. Datasets one variable parameter (treatment) with more than two groups were analysed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test. Datasets with one variable (treatment) and two groups were analysed by a Students t test. Data were log transformed where appropriate before analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ruoning Wang (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Walls et al. examine the role of PKM2 in NK cells. PKM2, the glycolytic enzyme that converts PEP to pyruvate, is expressed in NK cells and further upregulated during NK cell activation by Il-2/IL-12 stimulation. However, NK cells lacking PKM2 are activated normally in vitro and in vivo during MCMV infection, as indicated by proliferation, production of IFNγ and TNF, expression of Granzyme B, and viral clearance. The authors attribute the lack of phenotype to compensatory induction of PKM1. The authors' findings also suggest that while in other cell types PKM2 may &quot;moonlight&quot; in a transcriptional role, any such role for PKM2 in NK cells seems not to influence NK cell activation, at least in the contexts studied.</p><p>PKM2, unlike PKM1, can form a tetramer with increased enzyme activity. In other contexts, such tetramerization is thought to enhance flux through glycolysis which disfavors glycolytic intermediates from being diverted to biosynthetic shunts like the PPP. The authors next asked how such tetramerization of PKM2 may influence NK cell activation, using a small molecule TEPP-46 that enhances PKM2 tetramerization. The authors found that TEPP-46 treatment during NK cell activation led to reduced cellular growth, reduced production of the PPP metabolites R5P and NADPH, increased cellular ROS, and reduced oxidative metabolism, as well as reduced production of IFNγ and TNF and reduced expression of Granzyme B.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide some mechanistic insight into how PKM2 tetramerization leads to reduced NK cell activation. Does treatment with ROS scavengers like NAC or cell permeable glutathione rescue the effects of TEPP-46 on NK cell activation?</p><p>2) Does PKM2 undergo tetramerization in a physiological context? Given the lack of a phenotype in the PKM2 KO in the in vitro or in vivo conditions that the authors analyzed, it seems like tetramerization may not occur (because PKM1, which is upregulated, is thought to not tetramerize). At the very least, the authors should discuss under what conditions PKM2 tetramerization can occur to suppress NK cell activation.</p><p>3) The authors should confirm that TEPP-46 has no effect in PKM2 KO cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59166.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide some mechanistic insight into how PKM2 tetramerization leads to reduced NK cell activation.

TNF and IL-10 could not be rescued by NAC treatment.</p><p>We also find that TEPP46 treatment reduces the protein expression of cMyc in NK cells, a transcription factor that has shown to be required for NK cell functional responses by our previous study (Loftus et al., 2018) (Figure 8K). However this altered cMyc expression is not strongly reflected in the transcriptomic dataset when using a fold change cut off of 2. Interestingly, we show that the ROS scavenger Mitoquinol rescued the protein expression of cMyc in TEPP-46 treated NK cells. These data have now been included in in Figure 9 and the Discussion has been modified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Does PKM2 undergo tetramerization in a physiological context?

The relative biological benefit of having either mono/dimeric or tetrameric PKM2 has been of much interest to us. We have now included a crosslinked western blot showing that IL-2/12 stimulated NK cells have both monomeric and tetrameric PKM2 (Figure 1E) levels of which could be adjusted when the cells are in different anabolic or catabolic states. As demonstrated in this manuscript, too much pyruvate kinase activity is detrimental to the cell and leads to oxidative stress making regulation essential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should confirm that TEPP-46 has no effect in PKM2 KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, this is another important comment. We have done this and can confirm that TEPP-46 does not affect PKM2-KO NK cells with respect to IFNγ production and granzyme B expression. We also ensured that TEPP-46 does not increase pyruvate kinase activity in PKM2-KO NK cells, confirming that it has specificity for PKM2 and not PKM1. These data are now included as Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
