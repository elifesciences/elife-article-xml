in purine recycling in humans. Inherited mutations that suppress HGPRT activity are associated with Lesch–Nyhan disease (LND), a rare X-linked metabolic and neurological disorder in children, characterized by hyperuricemia, dystonia, and compulsive self-injury. To date, no treatment is available for these neurological defects and no animal model recapitulates all symptoms of LND patients. Here, we studied LND-related mechanisms in the fruit fly. By combining enzymatic assays and phylogenetic analysis, we confirm that no HGPRT activity is expressed in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, making the APRT homolog (Aprt) the only purine-recycling enzyme in this organism. Whereas APRT deficiency does not trigger neurological defects in humans, we observed that <italic>Drosophila Aprt</italic> mutants show both metabolic and neurobehavioral disturbances, including increased uric acid levels, locomotor impairments, sleep alterations, seizure-like behavior, reduced lifespan, and reduction of adenosine signaling and content. Locomotor defects could be rescued by Aprt re-expression in neurons and reproduced by knocking down <italic>Aprt</italic> selectively in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) dopaminergic neurons, the mushroom bodies, or glia subsets. Ingestion of allopurinol rescued uric acid levels in <italic>Aprt</italic>-deficient mutants but not neurological defects, as is the case in LND patients, while feeding adenosine or <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) during development fully rescued the epileptic behavior. Intriguingly, pan-neuronal expression of an LND-associated mutant form of human HGPRT (I42T), but not the wild-type enzyme, resulted in early locomotor defects and seizure in flies, similar to <italic>Aprt</italic> deficiency. Overall, our results suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> could be used in different ways to better understand LND and seek a cure for this dramatic disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Lesch–Nyhan disease</kwd><kwd>purine salvage pathway</kwd><kwd>dopaminergic neurons</kwd><kwd>adenosine signaling</kwd><kwd>adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT)</kwd><kwd>hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Laboratory funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Birman</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003068</institution-id><institution>École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Laboratory funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Birman</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Association Malaury</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Laboratory funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ceballos-Picot</surname><given-names>Irène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Association Lesch-Nyhan Action</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petitgas</surname><given-names>Céline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Labex MemoLife</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petitgas</surname><given-names>Céline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Purine recycling deficiency triggers metabolic and neurological defects reminiscent of Lesch–Nyhan disease in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, paving the way for studying this disorder and carrying out drug screening in an invertebrate organism.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The purine salvage pathway is an essential component of cellular metabolism that allows the recovery of free purine bases derived from the diet or from the degradation of nucleic acids and nucleotides, thus avoiding the energy cost of de novo purine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Nyhan, 2014</xref>). Energy-intensive tissues, such as cardiac muscle and brain cells, extensively use this pathway to maintain their purine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ipata, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>). The two main recycling enzymes involved in the salvage pathway in mammals are hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which converts hypoxanthine and guanine into IMP and GMP, respectively, and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), which converts adenine into AMP.</p><p>APRT and HGPRT deficiencies induce very different disorders in humans. Loss of APRT seems to have only metabolic consequences, leading to the formation of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine crystals in kidney, which can be fatal but is readily prevented by allopurinol treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bollée et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Harambat et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, highly inactivating mutations in HGPRT trigger Lesch–Nyhan disease (LND), a rare neurometabolic X-linked recessive disorder with dramatic consequences for child neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Lesch and Nyhan, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Seegmiller et al., 1967</xref>). The metabolic consequence of HGPRT deficiency is an overproduction of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) that can lead to gout and tophi, or nephrolithiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Sass et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kelley et al., 1967</xref>). Affected children also develop severe neurological impairments, such as dystonia, choreoathetosis, spasticity, and a dramatic compulsive self-injurious behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Nyhan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jinnah et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Torres et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Schretlen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Madeo et al., 2019</xref>). They have a developmental delay from 3 to 6 months after birth, and most of them never walk or even sit without support. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as febuxostat or allopurinol, are given to patients after diagnosis to decrease their uric acid levels and prevent the formation of urate crystals in kidney, which can lead to renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kelley et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Torres et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lahaye et al., 2014</xref>). However, there is as yet no treatment to alleviate the neurological symptoms of LND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Torres and Puig, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jinnah et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Madeo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To date, the causes of neurobehavioral troubles in LND are still not elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jinnah et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell et al., 2016</xref>). The most favored hypothesis is a dysfunction of the brain’s basal ganglia, and particularly of its dopaminergic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumeister and Frye, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Visser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Nyhan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Saito and Takashima, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Egami et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, analyses revealed a marked loss of dopamine (DA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Lloyd et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ernst et al., 1996</xref>) and DA transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Wong et al., 1996</xref>) in the basal ganglia of LND patients. DA deficits have also been reported in HGPRT knockout rodents, but without motor or behavioral defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Finger et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dunnett et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jinnah et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jinnah et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Meek et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies reported that HGPRT deficiency disrupts proliferation and migration of developing midbrain DA neurons in mouse embryos, arguing for a neurodevelopmental syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Witteveen et al., 2022</xref>). This could result from ATP depletion and impaired energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bell et al., 2021</xref>) or an overactivation of de novo purine synthesis, leading to the accumulation of potentially toxic intermediates of this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">López, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">López et al., 2020</xref>). Pharmacological models have also been developed by injecting the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine into neonatally rat brains, which induced a self-mutilation behavior in response to DA agonist administration in adulthood. However, these models are of limited utility as they do not reproduce the basic genetic impairment of LND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Breese et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Knapp and Breese, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>New animal models are therefore needed to study LND pathogenesis and find efficient therapeutic molecules. The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> presents many advantages for translational studies and drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fernández-Hernández et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Perrimon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Papanikolopoulou et al., 2019</xref>). Although the importance of this invertebrate model for studying rare human genetic diseases is now recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Oriel and Lasko, 2018</xref>), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> LND model has not yet been developed to our knowledge. This is probably due to the fact that no HGPRT activity has been detected in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Miller and Collins, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker, 1974a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker, 1974b</xref>). However, an ortholog of APRT is expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Johnson et al., 1987</xref>), encoded by the <italic>Aprt</italic> gene. It is therefore possible that part of the functions of human HGPRT, and in particular those essential for nervous system development and neurophysiology, are endorsed by Aprt in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Here, we studied the effects of <italic>Aprt</italic> deficiency on purine metabolism, lifespan, and various adult fly behaviors, including spontaneous and startle-induced locomotion, sleep, and seizure-like bang sensitivity (BS). We show that Aprt is required during development and in adult stage for many aspects of <italic>Drosophila</italic> life, and that its activity is of particular importance in subpopulations of brain dopaminergic neurons and glial cells. Lack of Aprt appears to decrease adenosinergic signaling and induces both metabolic and neurobehavioral symptoms in flies, as is the case with HGPRT in humans. We also find that expression of an LND-associated mutant form of HGPRT, but not the wild-type enzyme, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons, induced neurobehavioral impairments similar to those of <italic>Aprt</italic>-deficient flies. Such a potential toxic gain-of-function effect of mutated HGPRT had not yet been demonstrated in an animal model .</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evolution of HGPRT proteins</title><p>The pathways of purine anabolism/catabolism and recycling have been closely conserved between <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>): all genes related to purine metabolism have homologs in both species, except for the human <italic>HPRT1</italic> gene encoding HGPRT (step 13 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which has no ortholog in flies, and the lack of urate oxidase in humans (step 20). In accordance with pioneering reports from about 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Miller and Collins, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker, 1974a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker, 1974b</xref>), we confirmed that no HGPRT enzymatic activity can be detected in extracts of wild-type <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (see below Table 2), using either hypoxanthine or guanine as substrate in the reaction medium. This intriguing observation prompted us to carry out a more precise analysis of the evolution of HGPRT.</p><p>HGPRT proteins are ancient, for they are present in both bacteria and archaea. However, the analysis of the phyletic distribution of HGPRT proteins revealed their striking rareness in insecta. This conclusion is based on PSI-Blast sequence similarity searches on the NCBI Insecta database (taxid: 6960, 50557). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the only 11 HGPRT proteins found in Insecta cluster mainly with bacteria, but also with fungi, apicomplexa, and acari (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, red font, see legend for details). These and further evidence support the acquisition of HGPRT in a few insecta species by horizontal gene transfer (G. Matassi, unpublished observations). In particular, HGPRT has no homolog in Drosophilidae, with the potential exception of a single species, <italic>Drosophila immigrans</italic>, in which our most recent PSI-BLAST analysis detected one hit (accession KAH8256851.1, annotated as hypothetical protein). Yet this sequence is 100% identical to the HGPRT of the Gammaproteobacterium <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>. A phylogenetic analysis showed that the <italic>D. immigrans</italic> HGPRT clusters with the <italic>Serratia</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting either a contamination of the sequenced sample or a very recent horizontal gene transfer event. The second scenario is more likely since the corresponding nucleotide sequences differ by five synonymous substitutions (out of 534 positions). We also carried out structural similarity searches against the RCSB Protein Data Bank repository using the human HGPRT structure as query (PDB identifiers: 5HIA or 1Z7G).

We therefore suspected that adenosine level could be reduced in the absence of Aprt activity, leading to alterations in adenosinergic neurotransmission. Indeed, we found a significant decrease in adenosine level either in whole flies (by 61.0% on average, p&lt;0.01) or in heads (by 48.0%, p&lt;0.05) in <italic>Aprt</italic><sup>5</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We then examined the consequences of this reduction on molecular components of the adenosinergic system, namely G protein-coupled adenosine receptors and equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs), which carry out nucleobase and nucleoside uptake of into cells. Only one seven-transmembrane-domain adenosine receptor, AdoR, is present in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which is very similar to mammalian adenosine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dolezelova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brody and Cravchik, 2000</xref>), and three putative equilibrative nucleoside transporters (Ent1-3) have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sankar et al., 2002</xref>) but only one, Ent2, showed nucleoside transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Machado et al., 2007</xref>).

Secondly, we expressed an LND-associated mutant form of human HGPRT in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons, which also yielded behavioral symptoms. Our results suggest that the fruit fly can be used to study the consequences of defective purine recycling pathway and HGPRT mutation in the nervous system.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>Aprt</italic>-deficient flies replicate lifespan and metabolic defects caused by HGPRT deficiency</title><p>Flies that carry a homozygous null-mutation in <italic>Aprt</italic> develop normally and live until the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Johnson and Friedman, 1983</xref>). While a previous study reported that heterozygous <italic>Aprt</italic>/+ flies have an extended lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Stenesen et al., 2013</xref>), we observed that homozygous <italic>Aprt</italic><sup>5</sup> mutants have in contrast a significantly reduced longevity. The lack of HGPRT activity in LND also reduces lifespan expectancy, generally under 40 years of age for properly cared patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Stenesen et al., 2013</xref> showed that, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, dietary supplementation with adenine, the Aprt substrate, prevented the longevity extension conferred either by dietary restriction or heterozygous mutations of AMP biosynthetic enzymes. This suggests that lifespan depends on accurate adenine level regulation. It is possible that adenine could accumulate to toxic levels during aging in homozygous <italic>Aprt</italic> mutants, explaining their shorter lifespan. Alternatively, since AMP is the Aprt product, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that protects cells from stresses inducing ATP depletion, could be less activated in Aprt mutants. Multiple publications explored the role of AMPK in lifespan regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Sinnett and Brenman, 2016</xref>) and downregulating AMPK by RNAi in adult fat body or muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Stenesen et al., 2013</xref>), as well as its ubiquitous inactivation under starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>), both reduced fly lifespan.</p><p>In humans, HGPRT deficiency induces hypoxanthine and guanine accumulation, resulting from lack of recycling, and increased de novo purine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Harkness et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ceballos-Picot et al., 2015</xref>). This in turn leads to uric acid overproduction that increases the risk for nephrolithiasis, renal failure, and gouty arthritis if not properly treated. In insects, the end product of purine catabolism is not uric acid but allantoin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, step 20). However, urate oxidase, the enzyme that converts uric acid into allantoin, is specifically expressed in the Malpighi tubules, an excretory organ producing pre-urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wallrath et al., 1990</xref>). Uric acid could therefore accumulate in fly tissues and hemolymph if purine salvage pathway is impaired. Accordingly, we observed an increase in uric acid levels in <italic>Drosophila Aprt</italic> mutant heads, which could be reduced to normal levels by providing allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to protect against renal failure in LND patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Aprt is required in dopaminergic and mushroom body neurons for young fly motricity</title><p>We found that <italic>Aprt</italic>-null adult flies show reduced performance in the SING test, which monitors locomotor reactivity to startle and climbing ability. This phenotype appears at an early age, starting from 1 d a.E. The performance continued to decrease until 8 d a.E. and then appeared to stabilize up to 30 d a.E.

Interestingly, knocking down <italic>Aprt</italic> during 3 d only in adult flies also induced SING impairment, which argues against a developmental flaw.

Here, we found that knocking down <italic>Aprt</italic> either in all DA neurons or only in the PAM DA neurons was sufficient to induce early SING defects. In contrast, knocking down Aprt with <italic>TH-Gal4</italic> that labels all DA neurons except for a major part of the PAM cluster did not induce SING defects, indicating that Aprt expression in subsets of PAM neurons is critical for this locomotor behavior.</p><p>Inactivating <italic>Aprt</italic> in all mushroom body neurons also induced a lower performance in the SING assay. This important brain structure receives connections from DA neurons, including the PAM, and is enriched in DA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Waddell, 2010</xref>). We recently reported that activation of MB-afferent DA neurons decreased the SING response, an effect that requires signalization by the DA receptor dDA1/Dop1R1 in mushroom body neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). We also observed a SING defect after knocking down <italic>Aprt</italic> either in all glial cells or more selectively in glial subpopulations expressing the glutamate transporter Eaat1, but not in the ensheathing glia. Astrocyte-like glial cells expressing <italic>Eaat1</italic> extend processes forming a thick mesh-like network around and inside the entire mushroom body neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Sinakevitch et al., 2010</xref>). It could be hypothesized that SING also requires Aprt expression in these MB-associated astrocytes. However, re-expressing <italic>Aprt</italic> with <italic>Eaat1-Gal4</italic> did not lead to SING rescue in Aprt mutant background. This suggests that the presence of Aprt in neurons can somehow compensate for <italic>Aprt</italic> deficiency in glia, but the reverse is not true. In conclusion, proper startle-induced locomotion in young flies depends on Aprt activity in PAM DA and mushroom body neurons, and in <italic>Eaat1</italic>-expressing glial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neuronal Aprt regulates spontaneous activity and sleep</title><p>Because sleep is regulated by the mushroom body as well as DA neurons in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artiushin and Sehgal, 2017</xref>), we monitored spontaneous locomotor activity and sleep pattern of <italic>Aprt</italic><sup>5</sup> mutants. Their activity profile appeared normal, with unaltered morning and evening anticipation, indicating that the circadian rhythms are surprisingly maintained in light-dark (LD) conditions in the absence of a functional purine recycling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This experiment also highlighted that <italic>Aprt</italic>-deficient flies are hyperactive during the night, which suggests that they sleep less than wild-type flies. This could be confirmed by measuring their sleep pattern on video recordings. <italic>Aprt</italic> mutants show a reduced walking speed, sleep less during both day and night, and have difficulty in maintaining sleep. Downregulating <italic>Aprt</italic> selectively in neurons reproduced the sleep defect, whereas doing it in glial cells only had no effect. We have not attempted here to identify further the neuronal cells involved in this phenotype. Like for the SING behavior defect, it could involve PAM DA neurons as subpopulations of this cluster have been shown to regulate sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Nall et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the lack of purine recycling markedly disrupts sleep in <italic>Aprt</italic>-deficient flies, making them more active at night. This is strikingly comparable to young LND patients who have a much disturbed sleep time during the night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Mizuno et al., 1979</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Lack of Aprt reduces adenosine signaling leading to DA neuron overactivation</title><p>We observed that <italic>Aprt</italic> deficiency did not decrease DA levels in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain. This prompted us to study another neuromodulator, adenosine, which is indirectly a product of Aprt enzymatic activity. The purine nucleoside adenosine is one of the building blocks of RNA and the precursor of ATP and cAMP, but is also the endogenous ligand of adenosine receptors that modulate a wide range of physiological functions. In brain, adenosine regulates motor and cognitive processes, such as the sleep-wake cycle, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, memory, and drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Soliman et al., 2018</xref>). In normal metabolic conditions, adenosine is present at low concentrations in the extracellular space and its level is highly regulated, either taken up by cells and incorporated into ATP stores or deaminated by adenosine deaminase into inosine. In mammals, several nucleoside transporters mediate the uptake of adenosine and other nucleosides into cells, named equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporters, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boswell-Casteel and Hays, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Pastor-Anglada and Pérez-Torras, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We observed a marked reduction in adenosine levels in <italic>Aprt</italic> mutant flies. While we did not observe any alteration in the transcript levels of <italic>AdoR</italic>, the gene coding for the only adenosine receptor in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, transcript levels of an adenosine transporter, Ent2, were increased more than twofold in <italic>Aprt</italic> mutants. Interestingly, one paper reported a similar strong increase in <italic>Ent2</italic> expression in <italic>AdoR</italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Knight et al., 2010</xref>). These results suggest that AdoR signaling is less activated in <italic>Aprt</italic>-deficient flies compared to controls. We also observed that the lack of AdoR decreased Aprt expression and activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, possibly from increased <italic>Ent2</italic> expression and so higher adenosine influx which could downregulate Aprt by a feedback mechanism.</p><p>Adenosine and DA receptors are known to interact closely in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Franco et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kim and Palmiter, 2008</xref>). A previous study performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae showed that an increase in astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can silence DA neurons through AdoR stimulation by a mechanism potentially involving the breakdown of released astrocytic ATP into adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Nall et al., 2016</xref>). We previously showed that DA neuron activation can decrease fly performance in the SING test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Fly nocturnal hyperactivity can also be caused by an increase in DA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), in accordance with our observation that Aprt-deficient flies sleep less and are more active during the night. Therefore, both the locomotor and sleep defects induced by the lack of Aprt activity could be explained by DA neuron overactivation that would result from reduced adenosinergic signaling.</p><p>Adenosine has been proposed before to be involved in neurological consequences of LND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Visser et al., 2000</xref>).

In flies, the BS test is often used to model epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Song and Tanouye, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Parker et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we observed that 30-day-old <italic>Aprt</italic> mutant flies show a transient seizure-like phenotype after a strong mechanical shock. Although seizure duration appeared shorter in <italic>Aprt</italic><sup>5</sup> than in typical BS mutants such as <italic>bss</italic>, at least one other BS mutant, <italic>porin</italic>, was reported to have similar short recovery times as <italic>Aprt</italic>-deficient flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Graham et al., 2010</xref>). Previous works demonstrated that BS is linked to neuronal dysfunction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Parker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kroll and Tanouye, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kroll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Saras and Tanouye, 2016</xref>). Knocking down <italic>Aprt</italic> in specific cells such as neurons, glia, or muscles did not trigger this phenotype, suggesting that Aprt must be inactivated in several cell types to induce seizure.</p><p>Interestingly, knocking down <italic>Aprt</italic> by RNAi in all cells during development also induced the BS behavior, but not for 3 d only in adult flies, at variance with the SING phenotype. We have fed the mutants with a diet supplemented with various compounds involved in purine metabolism, including allopurinol, adenine, hypoxanthine, adenosine, or its analog N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) either throughout larval development or in adult stage. Only adenosine and m<sup>6</sup>A, ingested during development, rescued the BS behavior. This suggests that loss of Aprt induces a lack of adenosine in the developing nervous system, as we observed in adult flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which may alter neural circuits controlling BS behavior in adults. The adenosine analog m<sup>6</sup>A cannot be incorporated into nucleic acids and is excreted in the urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Schram, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batista, 2017</xref>). The rescuing effect we observed with m<sup>6</sup>A suggests thereby that both this compound and adenosine are required as adenosine receptor agonists or allosteric regulators during development, rather than nucleotide precursors.</p><p>Adenosine can strongly inhibit cerebral activity and its role as endogenous anticonvulsant and seizure terminator is well established in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Masino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Weltha et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, deficiencies in the adenosine-based neuromodulatory system can contribute to epileptogenesis. For instance, increased expression of astroglial adenosine kinase (ADK), which converts adenosine into AMP, leads to a reduction in brain adenosine level that plays a major role in epileptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Weltha et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, therapeutic adenosine increase is a rational approach for seizure control. Our observation that feeding adenosine or its derivative m<sup>6</sup>A rescued the seizure-like phenotype of <italic>Aprt</italic> mutant flies further suggests that adenosinergic signaling has partly similar functions in the fly and mammalian brains. In addition, the decrease in adenosine levels we observed in <italic>Aprt</italic> mutants could result from enhanced ADK activity that would compensate for the lack of Aprt-produced AMP.</p><p>We and others recently observed that m<sup>6</sup>A and related compounds sharing an adenosine moiety are able to rescue the viability of LND fibroblasts and neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of LND patients cultured in the presence of azaserine, a potent blocker of de novo purine synthesis (Petitgas and Ceballos-Picot, unpublished results; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Ruillier et al., 2020</xref>). Like in flies again, allopurinol was not capable of rescuing the cell viability in this in vitro model.

Such an approach was justified by the fact that the lower the residual activity of mutant HGPRT, the more severe the symptoms are in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fu and Jinnah, 2012</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). However, it could be conceivable that part of these symptoms result from compensatory physiological mechanisms or a deleterious gain-of-function conferred to the HGPRT protein by the pathogenic mutations. Here, we observed that neuronal expression of mutant human HGPRT-I42T, which expresses a low enzymatic activity, but not the wild-type HGPRT protein, induced early locomotor defects in young flies and BS in older flies, similarly to the defects induced by Aprt deficiency. This suggests a potential neurotoxicity of the pathological mutant form of HGPRT, which could be related to disturbances in purine metabolism or other signaling pathways. The human mutant form might not be properly degraded and accumulate as aggregates, potentially exerting neuronal toxicity. Such an approach opens interesting perspectives to better understand the endogenous function of HGPRT and its pathogenic forms. Indeed, the identification of a potential inherent neurotoxicity of defective forms of human HGPRT is a new element, which could be explored in further work in the fly and also in rodent models.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>A new model of LND in an invertebrate organism?</title><p>LND, a rare X-linked metabolic disorder due to mutations of the <italic>HPRT1</italic> gene, has dramatic neurological consequences for affected children.

APRT and HGPRT are known to be functionally and structurally related. Both human APRT and HGPRT belong to the type I PRTases family identified by a conserved phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) binding motif, which is used as a substrate to transfer phosphoribosyl to purines. This binding motif is only found in PRTases from the nucleotide synthesis and salvage pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Sinha and Smith, 2001</xref>). Moreover, the purine substrates adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine share the same chemical skeleton and APRT can bind hypoxanthine, indicating that APRT and HGPRT also share similarities in their substrate binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ozeir et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we find that <italic>Aprt</italic> mutant flies show symptoms partly comparable to the lack of HGPRT in humans, including increase in uric acid levels, reduced longevity, and various neurobehavioral defects such as early locomotor decline, sleep disorders, and epilepsy behavior.

LND is caused by mutations in the enzyme HGPRT, but this enzyme does not exist in fruit-flies, which instead only have Aprt for purine recycling. They demonstrate that mutants lacking the Aprt enzyme accumulate uric acid, which like in humans can be rescued by feeding flies allopurinol, and have decreased longevity, locomotion and sleep impairments and seizures, with striking resemblance to HGPRT loss of function in humans. They demonstrate that both loss of function throughout development or specifically in the adult ubiquitously or in all neurons, or dopaminergic neurons, mushroom body neurons or glia, can reproduce the phenotypes (although knock-down in glia does not affect sleep). They show that the phenotypes can be rescued by over-expressing a wild-type form of the Aprt gene in neurons. They identify a decrease in adenosine levels as the cause underlying these phenotypes, as adenosine is a neurotransmitter functioning via the purinergic adenosine receptor in neurons. In fact, feeding flies throughout development and in the adult with either adenosine or m6A could prevent seizures. They also demonstrate that loss of adenosine caused a secondary up-regulation of ENT nucleoside transporters and of dopamine levels, that could explain the phenotypes of decreased sleep and hyperactivity and night. Finally, they provide the remarkable finding that over-expression of the human mutant HGPRT gene but not its wild-type form in neurons impaired locomotion and induced seizures.

Analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Aprt mutations and RNAi-mediated knockdown reveals similar phenotypes to LND, particularly neurological defects, reduced nighttime sleep, and potentially seizures. LND is currently resistant to treatments and screening of a limited number of compounds in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has not identified a compound that can reduce all of the associated phenotypes. It is appropriate, therefore, that claims to have developed a clinically exploitable model for human LND have been toned down. Future drug screening may well prove profitable, but currently the evidence that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Aprt will be a suitable model for LND remains speculative.</p><p>The second approach adopted is to express a 'humanised mutated' form of HGPRT in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which holds more promise for the development of a pharmacological screen. In particular, the locomotor defect is recapitulated but the seizure-like activity, whilst reported as being recapitulated, is debatable. A recovery time of 2.3 seconds is very much less than timings for typical seizure mutants. Nevertheless, the SING behaviour could be sufficient to screen against. However, this is not explored. With respect the short seizure duration, the authors cite similar findings for porin loss of function, but the cited study similarly did not employ anti-seizure drug exposure to validate that this phenotype is seizure related.</p><p>In summary, this is a largely descriptive study reporting the behavioural effects of an Aprt loss-of-function mutation. RNAi KD and rescue expression studies suggest that a mix of neuronal (particularly dopaminergic and possibly adenosinergic signalling pathways) and glia are involved in the behavioural phenotypes affecting locomotion, sleep and seizure. There remains insufficient evidence to have full confidence that the Arpt fly model will prove valuable for understanding / treating LND.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88510.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Petitgas</surname><given-names>Céline</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ESPCI Paris, CNRS, PSL Research University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Seugnet</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre de Recherche en Neurosciences de Lyon</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bron</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dulac</surname><given-names>Amina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ESPCI Paris, CNRS, PSL Research University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Matassi</surname><given-names>Giorgio</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Univ of Udine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Udine</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mteyrek</surname><given-names>Ali</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ESPCI Paris, CNRS, PSL Research University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fima</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ESPCI Paris, CNRS, PSL Research University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Strehaiano</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ESPCI Paris, CNRS, PSL Research University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dagorret</surname><given-names>Joana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ESPCI Paris, CNRS, PSL Research University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chérif-Zahar</surname><given-names>Baya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ESPCI Paris, CNRS, PSL Research University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marie</surname><given-names>Sandrine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Université catholique de Louvain</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brussels</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ceballos-Picot</surname><given-names>Irène</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, Paris-Descartes University, Sorbonne Paris Cité University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Birman</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ESPCI Paris, CNRS, PSL Research University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The current manuscript focuses on the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Aprt) and how the lack of its function affects nervous system function.

The exception is an instance when authors mention 'data not shown' and here data should either be provided, or claims removed: &quot;feeding flies with adenosine or m6A did not rescue the SING phenotype of Aprt mutants (data not shown)&quot;. It is important to show these data (see below).</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended by the reviewer, these results are now shown in the new Figure S15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sleep is used to refer to lack of movement of flies to cross a beam for more than 5 minutes. However, lack of movement does not necessarily mean the flies are asleep, as they could be un-motivated to move (which could reflect abnormal dopamine levels) or engaged in incessant grooming instead.These differences are important for future investigation into the neural circuits affect by LND.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the method we used could overestimate sleep duration because flies that don't move do not necessarily sleep either, as it is the case with brain-dopamine deficient flies (Riemensperger et al., PNAS 2011). To address this issue, we have recorded video data showing that after 5 min of inactivity, wild-type and Aprt5 mutant flies are less sensitive to stimulation, indicating that they were indeed asleep. This is now shown in the new Figure S10 and mentioned on page 17, lines 338-339 in the main text. In addition, in this work we report that Aprt mutant flies have a nocturnal insomnia phenotype. Sleep overestimation is not, therefore, an issue that could challenge these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that based on BLAST genome searchers, there are no HPRTI (encoding HGPRT) homologues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, such a claim would require instead structure-based searches that take into account structural conservation despite high sequence divergence, as this may not be detected by regular BLAST.</p></disp-quote><p>To reinforce our conclusions about the lack of homologue of the human HPRT1 gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have now added a Results section about the evolution of HGPRT proteins on pages 6-7, lines 122150, and two phylogenetic analyses as new Figures S2 and S3 with more details in legends. We have also carried out structural similarity searches against the RCSB PDB repository. The structuralanalysis did not identify any relevant similarity with HGPRT 3D structures in Insecta (mentioned lines146-150). We hope these new analyses address the Reviewer's concerns. Furthermore, as shown in Table S2, no enzymatic HGPRT activity could be detected in extracts of wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A protein that would be structurally similar to human HGPRT but with a divergent sequence could not be involved in purine recycling without expressing HGPRT-like activity. In contrast, enzymatic Aprt activity could be easily detected in this organism (Figure S4 and Table S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work raises important questions that still need resolving. For example, the link between uric acid accumulation, reduced adenosine levels, increased dopamine and behavioural neurologic consequences remain unresolved. It is important that they show that restoring uric acid levels does not rescue locomotion nor seizure phenotypes, as this means that this is not the cause of the neurologic phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer about the potential importance of our results and the need to resolve the exact origin of the neurological phenotypes. This would need to be addressed in further studies in our opinion. The fact that allopurinol treatment did not improve the locomotor ability of Aprt5 mutant flies is now shown in Figure 1D, E to emphasize this result. Results showing that allopurinol does not rescue the bang-sensitivity phenotype of Aprt-deficient mutants are shown in Figure S14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Instead, their data indicate adenosine deficiency is the cause. However, one weakness is that for the manipulations they test some behaviours but not all. The authors could attempt to improve the link between mechanism and behaviour by testing whether over-expression of Aprt in neurons or glia, throughout development or in the adult, and feeding with adenosine and m6A can rescue each of the behavioural phenotypes handled: lifespan, SING, sleep and seizures. The authors could also attempt to knock-down dopamine levels concomitantly with feeding with adenosine or m6A to see if this rescues the phenotypes of SING and sleep.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. However, carrying out all these experiments properly with enough repeats will require about two more years of work. Because of that, they could not be included in the revision of the present article. Here we show that Aprt overexpression in neurons, but not in glia, rescues the SING phenotype of Aprt5 mutants (Figure 2B and 2E). We have also added in the revised article the new result that Aprt overexpression reduces transcript levels of DTH1, which codes for the neural form of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (new Figure 5F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Visualising the neural circuits that express the adenosine receptor could reveal why the deficit in adenosine can affect distinct behaviours differentially, and which neurologic phenotypes are primary and which secondary consequences of the mutations. This would allow them to carry out epistasis analysis by knocking-down AdoR in specific circuits, whilst at the same time feeding Aprt mutants with Adenosine.</p></disp-quote><p>Deciphering the specific circuits involved in the various effects of adenosine would indeed be extremely interesting. Unfortunately very few is currently known about the neural circuits that express AdoR in flies. No antibody is available to detect this receptor in situ and mutated AdoR gene coding for a tagged form of the receptor has not been engineered yet to our knowledge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The revelation that the mutant form of human HGPRT has toxic effects is very intriguing and important and it invites the community to investigate this further into the future.</p><p>To conclude, this is a fundamental piece of work that opens the opportunity for the broader scientific community to use <italic>Drosophila</italic> to investigate LND.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for his thoughtful and positive comments on our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The study attempts to develop a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model for the human disease of LND. The issue here, and the main weakness of this study, is that <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not express the enzyme, HGPRT, which when mutated causes LND. The authors, instead, mutate the functionally-related <italic>Drosophila</italic> Aprt enzyme. However, it is unknown whether Aprt is also a structural homologue. Because of this, it will likely not be possible to identify pharmacological compounds that rescue HGPRT activity via a direct interaction (unless modelling predicts high conservation of substrate binding pocket between the two enzymes, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in our Provisional Responses prior to revision of the Reviewed Preprint, the enzymes APRT and HGPRT are actually known to be functionally and structurally related. We apologize for not providing this information in the original submission. This point is now made clearer in the revised article on page 39, lines 785-792. Indeed, both human APRT and HGPRT belong to the type I PRTases family identified by a conserved phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) binding motif, which is used as a substrate to transfer phosphoribosyl to purines. This binding motif is only found in PRTases from the nucleotide synthesis and salvage pathways (see: Sinha and Smith (2001) Curr Opin Struct Biol 11(6):733-9, doi: 10.1016/s0959-440x(01)00274-3). The purine substrates adenine, hypoxanthine and guanine share the same chemical skeleton and APRT can bind hypoxanthine, indicating that APRT and HGPRT also share similarities in their substrate binding sites (Ozeir et al. (2019) J Biol Chem. 294(32):11980-11991, doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.009087). Moreover, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Aprt and Human APRT are closely related as the amino acid sequences of APRT proteins have been highly conserved throughout evolution (see Figure S5B in our paper).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An additional weakness is that the study does not identify a molecule that may act as a lead compound for further development for treating LND. Rather, the various rescues reported are selective for only a subset of the disease-associated phenotypes. Thus, whilst informative, this first section of the study does not meet the study ambitions.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we identify adenosine and N6-methyladenosine as rescuers of the epileptic behavior in Aprt mutant flies (shown in Figure 7E, F). Interestingly, the same molecules have been found to rescue the viability of fibroblasts and neural stem cells derived from iPSCs of LND patients, in which de novo purine synthesis was prevented (discussed on page 38, lines 747-753). This suggests that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model reported here could help to identify new genetic targets and pharmacological compounds capable to rescue HGPRT mutations in humans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second approach adopted is to express a 'humanised mutated' form of HGPRT in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which holds more promise for the development of a pharmacological screen. In particular, the locomotor defect is recapitulated but the seizure-like activity, whilst reported as being recapitulated, is debatable. A recovery time of 2.3 seconds is very much less than timings for typical seizure mutants. Nevertheless, the SING behaviour could be sufficient to screen against. However, this is not explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be very interesting to do a pharmacological screen in this second LND model. However, we did not have the possibility to carry out such a screen yet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, this is a largely descriptive study reporting the behavioural effects of an Aprt loss-offunction mutation. RNAi KD and rescue expression studies suggest that a mix of neuronal (particularly dopaminergic and possibly adenosinergic signalling pathways) and glia are involved in the behavioural phenotypes affecting locomotion, sleep and seizure. There is insufficient evidence to have confidence that the Arpt fly model will prove valuable for understanding / treating LND.</p></disp-quote><p>Here we report many common phenotypes between the Aprt fly model and the symptoms of LND patients (reduced longevity, locomotor problems, sleep defects, overproduction of uric acid that is rescued by allopurinol treatment…). Moreover, APRT and HGPRT enzymes are both functional and structural homologues, as explained in our answers. We also found that the same drugs can rescue the seizure-like phenotype in Aprt-deficient flies and the viability of LND fibroblasts and neural stem cells, derived from iPSCs of LND patients, in which de novo purine synthesis is prevented (Figure 7E, F). In many respects, our results therefore suggest that Aprt mutant flies could be useful to better understand LND, and potentially to screen for new therapeutic compounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>From the Reviewing Editor:</bold></p><p>(1) How are the pathways of purine catabolism different between flies and mammals?

We added words in the revised article about purine anabolism/catabolism pathways lines 123-126 (see below our detailed response to Reviewer 1’s Recommandations). HGPRT is present in Bacteria, Archea and Eukaryota, and nearly all animal phyla. However, BLAST search indicates that HGPRT homologues cannot be found in most insect species, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>. To reinforce our conclusions about the lack of homologue of the human HPRT1 gene in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we have now added a Results section about the evolution of HGPRT proteins on pages 6-7, lines 122-150, and two phylogenetic analyses as new Figures S2 and S3 with details in legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to BLAST a structural based modelling method should be used to establish the loss of HGPRT in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the phylogenetic analyses, we have confirmed that no HGPRT enzymatic activity can be detected in wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> extract (Table S2).

As mentioned in our provisional responses to the Public Reviews, we would like to emphasize, however, that reviewers #1 and #2 expressed more confidence than reviewer #3 in the potential usefulness of our work. Reviewer #1 indeed stated that: “The findings provide a new example of how manipulating specific genes in the fruit fly allows the study of fundamental molecular processes that are linked to a human disease”, and reviewer #2 further wrote: &quot;Altogether, these are very important and fundamental findings that convincingly demonstrate the establishment of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model for the scientific community to investigate LND, to carry out drug testing screens and find cures”, and added: “To conclude, this is a fundamental piece of work that opens the opportunity for the broader scien2fic community to use <italic>Drosophila</italic> to inves2gate LND”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>An important prerequisite for the current study is that there appears to be no HGPRT &quot;activity&quot; in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

I feel clarifying this would provide more insight into the motivation of the experimental approach.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer and the Reviewing Editor, we have addressed the evolution of HGPRT proteins more precisely in the revision. We have added a section on this subject in Results on pages 67, lines 122-150, and two phylogenetic analyses as Figures S2 and S3 with details in legends. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out a few years ago by Giorgio Matassi, who is now co-author of this paper. The most striking result was the great impact of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of HGPRT in Insects (Figures S2 and S3). Our analysis of the phyletic distribution of HGPRT proteins revealed their striking rareness in Insecta, and in particular, their absence in Drosophilidae. The PSIBlast search detected however a significant hit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> immigrans (accession KAH8256851.1). Yet, this sequence is 100% identical to the HGPRT of the Gammaroteobacterium Serratia marcescens. Indeed, a phylogenetic analysis showed that <italic>D. immigrans</italic> HGPRT clusters with the Serratia genus (see Figure S3). This can be interpreted either a contamination of the sequenced sample, or as a very recent horizontal gene transfer event. The second scenario is more likely for the corresponding nucleotide sequences differ by 5 synonymous substitutions (out of 534 positions). A powerful approach to try to understand the &quot;origin&quot; of the <italic>D. immigrans</italic> protein would be to analyze whether horizontal gene transfer has affected its chromosomal neighbours. This approach, proposed previously by G. Matassi (BMC Evol Biol, 2017, 17:2, doi: 10.1186/s12862-016-0850-6), is highly demanding in terms of computing time and would require an ad hoc study.

The potential applicability to LND would be best restricted to the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not making our goals clearer. Our purpose was to find out if purine recycling deficiency could lead to metabolic and neurobehavioral disturbances in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as it is the case in human LND patients when HGPRT is mutated. Interestingly, we observed that mutation of the only purine recycling enzyme in flies, Aprt, did induce defects in part comparable to that of LND in humans, including overproduction of uric acid that is rescued by allopurinol treatment, reduced longevity, and various neurobehavioral phenotypes including bang-sensitive seizure, sleep defects and locomotor impairments. We also identified adenosine and N6-methyladenosine as rescuers of the epileptic behavior in these mutants. These drugs were also identified as therapeutic candidates in screens based on iPSCs from LND patients. This suggests that Aprt deficiency in Drosophila could be used as a model to better understand this disease and find new therapeutic targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regardless of the above comment, the concluding sentence of the abstract is inappropriate.

To meet this statement, this study needs to identify a treatment that rescues all of the behavioural phenotypes associated with the Aprt mutation, in addition to rescuing the influences of the mis-expression of mutated HGPRT.</p></disp-quote><p>APRT and HGPRT are both functionally and structurally related. Both human APRT and HGPRT belong to the type I PRTases family identified by a conserved phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) binding motif, which is used as a substrate to transfer phosphoribosyl to purines. This binding motif is only found in PRTases from the nucleotide synthesis and salvage pathways (see: Sinha and Smith (2001) Curr Opin Struct Biol 11(6):733-9733-9, doi: 10.1016/s0959-440x(01)00274-3). The purine substrates adenine, hypoxanthine and guanine share the same chemical skeleton and APRT can bind hypoxanthine, indicating that APRT and HGPRT also share similarities in their substrate binding sites (Ozeir et al. (2019) J Biol Chem. 294(32): 11980-11991, doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.009087). This point has been made clearer in the Discussion page 39, in lines 785-792.. Finally, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Aprt and Human APRT are closely related as the amino acid sequences of APRTs have been highly conserved throughout evolution (shown in Figure S5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With respect to expression of the mutated HGPRT: the short seizure recovery time of 2.3 seconds is not very convincing evidence of a seizure phenotype. This is far below the timings reported for typical BS mutations. Because of this, the authors should run a positive control (e.g. one of the wellestablished BS mutations: parabss, eas or jus) to validate their assay. Moreover, was the seizure induced by the Aprt mutation (17.3 secs - again a low value) rescued by prior exposure to an antiepileptic? Could this behaviour be, instead, related to the SING locomotor phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>The assay we used to test for bang-sensitivity has been validated in previous articles from different laboratories. We agree that the recovery times we observed were shorter than those of the BS mutations mentioned by the reviewer. However, we could cite another <italic>Drosophila</italic> BS mutant, porin, that shows similarly short recovery times (2.5 and 6 sec, according to the porin alleles tested, Graham et al. J Biol Chem. 2010, doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.080317). This is now mentioned on page 36 lines 717-720. In addition, the BS phenotype we observed with Aprt mutants was robust and highly significant compared to control flies (Figure 7). We did not try to rescue this phenotype by exposing the flies to an antiepileptic, but we do not think that it can be related to the SING phenotype. Indeed, providing adenosine or N6-methyladenosine to Aprt5 mutant flies was able to rescue the BS phenotype (Figure 7E, F), but did not rescue the locomotor defects (new Figure S15). Moreover, SING performances of Aprt5 mutant flies at 8 or 30 d a. E. are decreased nearly in almost identical way (Figure 1C), while we observed an effect on BS behavior at 30 d a. E., which implies that the SING and BS behaviors are most likely unrelated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 731 states that 'Aprt mutants show a typical BS phenotype' - whilst accurate to some extent (e.g. the behaviour depicted in the supp videos), it should be made clear, it should be made clear that the recovery time is uncharacteristically short and thus differs from typical BS mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the sentence in the revised article to mention that (page 36, lines 717-718).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 732 stating that BS phenotype is often linked to neuronal activity - what other links would there be?
