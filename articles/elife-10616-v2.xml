This photo-induced Sph-driven calcium release requires the two-pore channel 1 (TPC1) residing on endosomes and lysosomes. Further, uncaging of Sph leads to the translocation of the autophagy-relevant transcription factor EB (TFEB) to the nucleus specifically after lysosomal calcium release. We confirm that Sph accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes of cells derived from Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) patients and demonstrate a greatly reduced calcium release upon Sph uncaging. We conclude that sphingosine is a positive regulator of calcium release from acidic stores and that understanding the interplay between Sph homeostasis, calcium signaling and autophagy will be crucial in developing new therapies for lipid storage disorders such as NPC.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10616.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10616.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10616.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sphingosine is a small fat molecule that has been suggested to act as a signal inside cells. Individuals with a rare neurodegenerative disease called Niemann-Pick disease type C accumulate sphingosine and other fat molecules in cell compartments called lysosomes. Intriguingly, this fat accumulation is accompanied by an altered movement of calcium ions in and out of lysosomes.</p><p>In healthy cells, an increase in calcium ion levels can trigger a process called autophagy, in which proteins and other cell components are destroyed in a controlled manner. This is thought to be caused by the release of calcium ions from lysosomes, which stimulates a protein called TFEB to move into the nucleus of the cell to activate genes involved in autophagy. Two proteins on the surface of lysosomes called TPC1 and TPC2 are believed to act as channels that can release calcium ions from lysosomes. However, it was not clear how sphingosine could disrupt calcium ion movements in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C.</p><p>Here, Hoeglinger et al. have used a new approach to understand how calcium ions and sphingosine are linked in both healthy and diseased cells. The experiments use a form of sphingosine called “caged sphingosine” that is only activated when it is exposed to a flash of light, which makes it possible to increase the levels of this molecule in cells in a precise way. Hoeglinger et al. found that sphingosine triggered the release of calcium ions from lysosomes. This release required the TPC1 protein and resulted in TFEB moving into the cell nucleus.</p><p>Further experiments confirm that sphingosine accumulates in the lysosomes of cells taken from patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C. In these cells, the activation of caged sphingosine resulted in a much smaller release of calcium ions from lysosomes than that observed in healthy cells. Together, Hoeglinger et al.’s findings show that sphingosine acts as a signal to trigger the release of calcium ions from lysosomes, which in turn promotes autophagy. The next challenge is to find out exactly how sphingosine opens the calcium ion channels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10616.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10616.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Niemann-Pick type C</kwd><kwd>calcium homeostasis</kwd><kwd>two-pore channel 1</kwd><kwd>lipid localization</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>caged compound</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>289278 - Sphingonet</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Höglinger</surname><given-names>Doris</given-names></name><name><surname>Riezman</surname><given-names>Howard</given-names></name><name><surname>Platt</surname><given-names>Frances M</given-names></name><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>Carsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Center for Competence in Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chemical Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilera-Romero</surname><given-names>Auxiliadora</given-names></name><name><surname>Riezman</surname><given-names>Howard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBL Interdisciplinary Postdoc Programme</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haberkant</surname><given-names>Per</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sphingosine acts as a lipid messenger molecule in intracellular signaling networks that are relevant to lysosomal function and Niemann-Pick disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sphingosine (Sph) and other small sphingolipids such as ceramide (Cer) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are bioactive lipids, which play crucial roles in central cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell growth, differentiation and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartke and Hannun, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hannun and Obeid, 2008</xref>).

In cells, Sph can be generated in lysosomes, the plasma membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as the Golgi complex by hydrolysis of Cer through the action of ceramidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernardo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hwang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mao et al., 2001</xref>). In a physiological context, Sph is reported to mediate cell growth arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cuvillier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>) and is involved in the pathophysiology of the lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). In this progressive neurodegenerative disease, which is caused by mutations in the lysosomal proteins NPC1 or NPC2, Sph accumulates alongside other lipids such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and glycosphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">te Vruchte et al., 2004</xref>). Specifically, Sph storage is the first detectable biochemical change following inactivation of NPC1 leading to chronically lowered calcium concentration in the acidic compartment, as well as subsequent secondary lipid storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, the calcium release from acidic stores was recently monitored by a genetically encoded calcium indicator directly fused to endolysosomes which showed reduced calcium release from NPC patient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shen et al., 2012</xref>) in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</xref>) but found that the calcium content in the lysosomes remains unchanged and that the calcium release is blocked by the accumulated lipids. This is in contrast to previous studies showing that the defect in calcium levels in NPC disease is likely due to a store filling defect and that intraluminal calcium levels were reduced using an intra-lysosomal calcium probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</xref>). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the interplay between calcium uptake and release from the endolysosomes and how this mechanism is deregulated in the NPC disease.</p><p>Cells use calcium as a versatile tool for modulating intracellular signaling by increasing the intracellular free calcium concentration [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> either globally or locally. Second messengers such as <italic>myo</italic>-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) or cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) open well-characterized calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the muscle sarcomere, the main intracellular calcium store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berridge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fliegert et al., 2007</xref>). The intraluminal calcium concentrations in the ER varies from 100–800 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burdakov et al., 2005</xref>). Since the endosomal/lysosomal system was identified as an important source of intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haller et al., 1996</xref>), the luminal calcium concentrations of acidic vesicles was determined to range between 400–600 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christensen et al., 2002</xref>). The mechanisms responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>filling and release from these acidic stores are not yet fully understood. The main players involved in lysosomal calcium release and signaling are transient receptor potential (TRP) channels such as mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pryor et al., 2006</xref>) and two two-pore channels (TPC1 and TPC2), which are thought to be Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels activated by nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), Mg<sup>2+</sup>or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brailoiu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brailoiu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rybalchenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pitt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jentsch et al., 2015</xref>). A very recent study showed that lysosomal calcium signaling regulates autophagy through the actions of the phosphatase calcineurin and the transcription factor EB (TFEB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Medina et al., 2015</xref>) which places the lysosome at the center of this very important signaling hub and underlines the importance of understanding the regulation of lysosomal calcium signaling.</p><p>In this work, we investigate the role of Sph in intracellular calcium signaling by employing photoactivatable (“caged”) Sph. Caged lipids are biologically inactive as long as they are covalently attached to certain photolabile groups (“cage groups”), which prevent recognition and metabolism inside cells. The active species is then released inside cells by short irradiation with a flash of light, which induces a cleavage reaction in the cage group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Höglinger et al., 2014</xref>). In this manner, it is possible to rapidly elevate the intracellular concentration of the lipid with precise spatiotemporal resolution. It is currently difficult to know the physiological and spatial distribution of sphingosine generated under physiological conditions, particularly inside the lysosome where the majority of sphingosine is generated via the action of acidic ceramidases. This tool therefore provides a very useful system with which to probe sphingosine cell biology in greater detail.</p><p>We discovered that uncaging Sph in a variety of cell types leads to an immediate and transient increase in cytosolic calcium, which is not released from the ER but from acidic stores. We further pinpoint the endosomal/lysosomal channel TPC1 to be a main contributor to this response and demonstrate that Sph-induced calcium release leads to the nuclear translocation of TFEB. We also show that the calcium release in NPC patient cells is reduced while the Sph levels in the lysosomal compartments are increased. These findings will be helpful in elucidating the pathogenic cascade of NPC and will generally further our understanding of the function of the acidic compartments in calcium homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and synthesis of caged Sph and caged dhSph</title><p>We synthesized caged variants of Sph by chemically attaching two different cage groups to the amino functionality of Sph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): R<sub>1</sub> is a diethylamino-coumarin group, which allows for very fast, sub-second uncaging kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schade et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hagen et al., 2003</xref>) as well as visualization of cages lipids via its fluorescent properties.

To this end, HeLa cells were incubated with 2 µM Sph-Cou for different times and subjected to +/- UV uncaging. In +UV cases, the whole dish of labelled cells was exposed to UV light from a mercury arc source for a comparably long time of 2 min to ensure complete uncaging of all cells. Cellular lipids were then extracted and coumarin-containing lipids were visualized by thin layer chromatographic analysis (TLC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We showed that caged Sph was taken up by cells and that its photo-induced cleavage was successful inside the cells. This experiment also demonstrated that caged Sph did not participate in lipid metabolism during up to 60 min of incubation, as no additional fluorescent bands could be detected on the TLC plate. The drawback of this analysis was that only lipids equipped with a coumarin cage could be visualized via TLC. In order to gain a more accurate estimate of the uptake, stability, and successful uncaging of Sph-Cou as well as the negative control compound dhSph, we investigated control HeLa cells, Sph-Cou and dhSph-Cou treated HeLa cells by lipidomic analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the relative amounts of Sph, S1P, dhSph and dhS1P detected in control, non-UV treated (caged) and UV-treated (uncaged) conditions for uncaging Sph-Cou as well as dhSph-Cou. The stability of the caged Sph (and caged dhSph) in the cells was confirmed because comparable levels of sphingoid bases were measured in control and caged conditions, indicating that no cleavage of the carbamate-linked cage group took place. Additionally, incubation with Sph-Cou or dhSph-Cou did not appear to perturb the long chain base homeostasis in the cells as all endogenous sphingoid bases showed similar concentrations compared to control conditions. Under the exaggerated illumination conditions used in the TLC and lipidomics experiments, Sph levels were found to increase 3.4 fold relative to control conditions in cells incubated with Sph-Cou, indicative of successful uncaging. This increase was specific for Sph and was not observed for dhSph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The levels of S1P also increased in UV-treated conditions, albeit only at a minute level (0.2% of Sph). We attributed this increase to ongoing metabolism during and after uncaging reaction. It seems that the long time of illumination as well as time for the following steps (collection of the cells and extraction of the lipids) was long enough for phosphorylation to occur on a very small fraction of Sph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The negative control dhSph was also uncaged successfully, as indicated by a 13.9 fold increase of dhSph in uncaged cells compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). This greater increase is explained by the fact that the caged lipids were added at the same concentrations, even though the endogenous levels of dhSph are 5 to 8 fold lower compared to Sph (according to our mass spectrometric data). Finally, it is important to consider that the TLC and mass spectrometric experiments were performed to show that the uncaging reaction is successful in a cellular environment. They should not be interpreted as quantitative measures of the amount of released Sph. Very long illumination conditions were necessary to uncage enough cells so that these analyses were made possible. All following live-cell experiments were performed on a dual scanner confocal microscope with local uncaging of a subcellular area in the cell with simultaneous fluorescence recording. The uncaging area and uncaging times could therefore be kept to a minimum. In this manner, a greatly reduced release of Sph as well as minimal phosphorylation can be expected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Uncaging of Sph results in cytosolic calcium transients</title><p>In order to observe the immediate effects of photo-induced Sph release on intracellular calcium signaling in living cells, we loaded HeLa cells with the membrane-permeant calcium indicator Fluo-4/AM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Williams et al., 1999</xref>), which reacts to increases in cytosolic calcium concentrations with corresponding increases in fluorescence intensity. We performed uncaging experiments using a confocal microscope by recording Fluo-4 fluorescence before and after brief irradiation (3 s–6 s) of a local circular area (~9 µm<sup>2</sup>) within the cell.

We calculated the mean calcium traces for each lipid and found a pronounced transient increase for both caged Sph variants, whereas the negative control compound dhSph-Cou gave no significant change in calcium levels under exactly the same delivery/uncaging conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), indicating that the signal was specifically due to sphingosine. To analyze single cell responses, we calculated the maximum amplitude of each calcium trace and visualized their distribution in a histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We defined individual cells with more than 20% increase over the average baseline fluorescence as responding cells. While all cells responded when Sph-Cou/+UV treated, less than 15% (4 out of 29 cells) responded under control conditions (dhSph-Cou/+UV). Moreover, under control conditions, the few responding cells gave rise to markedly reduced amplitudes.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-10616-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10616.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Local uncaging of Sph leads to calcium transients.</title><p>Time-lapse movie of HeLa cells loaded with the calcium indicator Fluo-4 and treated with Sph-Cou.

When performing uncaging experiments in presence of these inhibitors, we found only slight differences of the calcium response compared to basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These differences might be explained by cell-to-cell variability as well as a general perturbation of the cells when using these inhibitors. We conclude that the observed calcium signals were caused by the rapid, photoinduced Sph release rather than S1P formation. Interestingly, external addition of free Sph to the medium of the cells did not evoke changes in calcium levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The reasons for this are not fully resolved, but we speculate that Sph is more rapidly metabolized after entering cells than it is delivered. Sufficiently high doses of externally applied Sph (&gt; 5 µM) are then cytotoxic. The rapid increase in Sph after uncaging overcomes this problem and hence leads to calcium signaling. We also added free Sph prior to the uncaging experiment and found again no difference in the calcium response.

Taken together, these results point towards the acidic compartment as the primary source of the Sph-induced calcium signal that we observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Investigating the mechanism of acidic compartment calcium release by Sph</title><p>To further specify the machinery involved in this Sph-induced calcium efflux from the acidic compartments, we employed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mice with a single knock out of either the endosomal/lysosomal calcium channels TPC1 or TPC2 as well as MEFs from a double knock out mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruas et al., 2014</xref>). In WT MEFs, uncaging of Sph led to an immediate cytosolic calcium increase in the same way as was observed in HeLa cells, indicating that this effect is not cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Due to the different morphology and size of the fibroblasts, the amplitudes of the calcium transients were less pronounced in MEFs than in HeLa cells, since the area of uncaging was kept identical. This prompted us to set the threshold for responders to 10% increase over baseline. TPC2 knockout MEFs also gave rise to calcium transients with comparable amplitudes. Employing TPC1 knockout fibroblasts, however, resulted in a large reduction of the mean calcium response. Under these conditions, only 6 of 25 cells exhibited amplitudes greater than the response threshold and even those were markedly decreased compared to WT conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). This striking effect shows the specificity of Sph-induced calcium release via the TPC1 channel. To confirm this, we also employed MEF from the TPC1/TPC2 double knockout mouse. Under these conditions, only 9 of 31 cells gave calcium signals with greater amplitudes than the threshold, much like in the TPC1-KO conditions. We conclude that there is a connection between an increase in cellular Sph and the release of calcium from the acidic compartments through the action of TPC1, which is known to be localized to early, recycling, and late endosomes as well as lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brailoiu et al., 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10616.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Knock-out studies of two-pore channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from a wild-type mouse (33 cells) or from two-pore channel 1 (TPC1) knock-out mice (25 cells), two-pore channel 2 (TPC2, 20 cells) knock-out mice or from a double knock-out mouse (DKO, 31 cells) were loaded with 2 µM Sph-Cou and uncaged for 3 s as indicated.

We applied these tools to a variety of cell types, ranging from cultured HeLa cells to primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human patient fibroblasts and showed that in all those cells, an acute increase in Sph was always followed by an immediate release of calcium from GPN-sensitive acidic stores. We also showed that plasma membrane and ER calcium channels were not initially involved in this calcium response. Furthermore, we could pinpoint TPC1, an endosomal/lysosomal channel of the two-pore channel family to be essential in this newly found signaling pathway. When employing embryonic TPC1 knockout fibroblasts, no calcium increase upon uncaging of Sph was observed. TPC2 knockout fibroblasts, however, reacted similarly to WT fibroblasts, confirming the specific requirement of the TPC1 isoform for Sph induced calcium signaling. The involvement of the other main acidic compartment calcium channel TRPML1 was also tested. Loss-of-function in TRPML1 led to a slight increase in Sph-induced calcium release, which might be explained by some redundancy between TRPML1 and TPCs in the regulation of lysosomal calcium concentrations.</p><p>Acidic compartment calcium signaling has recently emerged as an important part of intracellular events such as vesicle fusion and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patel and Docampo, 2010</xref>) as well as induction of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Medina et al., 2015</xref>). Our knowledge of the machinery involved and its regulation, however, remains incomplete. The two-pore channels (TPCs) are the subject of current controversies regarding ion selectivity and dependencies on activating ligands. While many reports agree that TPC channels are NAADP-regulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brailoiu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brailoiu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pitt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calcraft et al., 2009</xref>), others indicate a broader ion specificity of TPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rybalchenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peiter et al., 2005</xref>) or alternative ligands such as PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cang et al., 2013</xref>).

A very recent study confirmed that TPCs conduct both Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions and that they are activated by NAADP as well as PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jentsch et al., 2015</xref>). The biological relevance of two-pore channels was recently highlighted by a report showing that TPCs are crucial to successful infection of host cells by the Ebola virus and that disruption of TPC function leads to halted virus trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakurai et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the progression of Ebola infection is also dependent on the NPC1 protein, which was shown to be necessary for viral escape from the lysosomal compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">(Herbert, et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carette, et al., 2011</xref>). These recent findings will certainly encourage further efforts to understand the link between lysosomal calcium signaling and the defects in Niemann-Pick disease. In our study, we could confirm that NPC patient fibroblasts responded with lower amplitudes of the calcium transients after Sph uncaging, which is indicative of a reduced pool of calcium in the acidic compartments of these cells, in accordance with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> summarizes our results and illustrates that we pinpointed TPC1 as the mediator of a Sph induced rise in cytosolic calcium. We also correlated a reduced calcium release in fibroblasts from NPC patients with a significant storage of Sph in the late endosomes/lysosomes of these patient cells by using a novel bifunctional Sph probe. Short pulse-chase experiments also indicated lack of efflux from lysosomes in NPC fibroblasts compared to cells from healthy controls.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10616.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary of findings.</title><p>Sph causes calcium release from acidic stores through the action of TPC1.

NPC1 has been shown to be involved in the transport of amines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaufmann and Krise, 2008</xref>), but conclusive data on the transport of Sph and other potential substrates are absent as there is no direct functional assay for NPC1. A study using radiolabelled sphingolipids to follow metabolism and transport in NPC disease concluded that Sph efflux from endolysosomes is not restricted in NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blom et al., 2012</xref>). However, these data were obtained using long, 1–4 h chase times during which the precursor lipid was likely metabolized to a high degree and incorporated into other lipids, leaving only a small fraction of Sph for quantitative analysis. This and other obstacles to the study of lipids affirm the need for new tools, which circumvent the lipid metabolic machinery and give a faithful representation of the subcellular lipid localization. With our tools and shorter chase times in the range of 10–20 min, we observed reduced acidic compartment calcium release as well as increased Sph storage and a failure in Sph efflux in NPC disease cells.</p><p>Disrupted autophagy is another hallmark of NPC shared by many other neurodegenerative disorders as neurons are particularly vulnerable to defects along the autophagic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nixon, 2013</xref>). TFEB was shown to up-regulate transcription of genes which support autophagosome formation and lysosomal biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Settembre et al., 2011</xref>) and could therefore be a considered a novel target to promote lysosomal clearance in lipid storage and neurodegenerative disorders. TFEB overexpression has already been shown to be beneficial in attenuating the storage phenotype in several storage disorders such as Batten disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Medina et al., 2011</xref>) or Pompe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spampanato et al., 2013</xref>). Similar overexpression strategies showed promising results even in mouse models of more common neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Decressac et al., 2013</xref>), Alzheimer disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polito et al., 2014</xref>) or Huntington disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsunemi et al., 2012</xref>). The regulatory functions of Sph and TFEB are therefore key targets for future investigations of neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p>Taken together, we describe intracellular Sph as a new small molecule effector of lysosomal calcium homeostasis, the lysosome as triggerable calcium store via the TPC1 channel, and specific transcription factor translocation as a consequence of lysosomal calcium release. Our results further highlight the importance of elucidating the interplay between lysosomal calcium signaling and Niemann-Pick type C disease. This interplay might also be important for the progression of diseases caused by Ebola or Marburg virus infection. Sph should be considered as a new and important player in this field and understanding the regulation of its signaling will likely further our understanding of these named diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Common laboratory chemicals were purchased from commercial sources (Acros, Fluka, Merck, Sigma-Aldrich or VWR) at highest available grade and were used without further purification.

Cells were washed, overlaid with 1 mL imaging buffer and UV-irradiated on ice for 2.5 min using a 450–1,000 W high-pressure mercury lamp (Newport, #66924, series #1166) equipped with a glass filter to remove wavelengths below 345 nm (Newport, #20CGA-345), operated at 1,000 W. Cells were immediately fixed with MeOH at -20°C for 20 min. Not crosslinked lipids were extracted by washing 3x with 1 mL of CHCl<sub>3</sub>/MeOH/AcOH 10:55:0.75 (v/v) at RT. Cells were then incubated with 50 µl of click mixture (1 mM ascorbic acid, 100 μM TBTA, 1 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> and 2 μM Alexa 488 azide in PBS) for 1 h at RT in the dark. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with 50 µl of primary antibody (rabbit α-LAMP1, Cell Signaling, 1:100 in PBS supplemented with 4% BSA and 0.02% Triton) overnight at 4°C. Coverslips were again washed in PBS and incubated with secondary antibody (α-rabbit conjugated to AlexaFluor555, Cell Signaling, 1:800) for 1 h, washed and mounted in DAPI-containing mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA 94010, #H-1200). Microscopy images were captured at RT using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM780) with a 63x oil objective. Settings were as follows: DAPI-channel (405 nm excitation (ex), 409–475 nm emmission (em); green channel: 488 nm ex, 489–550 nm em; red channel: 561 nm ex, 569–655 nm em). Images were further processed using imageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"> <title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for the support by the staff of the Advanced Light Microscopy Facility of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory for maintaining the microscopes used in this study.

If you can address the first point convincingly, the reviewers felt that the story would be very important.</p><p>1) The main potential novelty is in defining a physiologic role for sph in regulation of calcium release from endolysosomes with consequent signaling and cell regulatory functions. This is highly suggested by this study, but the study relies primarily on a 'pharmacologic' albeit novel and powerful approach using the delivery of caged sph. As such, the role of endogenous sph is not established. In this regard, the 3.5 fold increase in intracellular sph after uncaging may represent a supraphysiologic response (one reviewer was not aware of physiologic conditions where intracellular sph increases by that much). The study would be much stronger if there were ANY additional results to implicate endogenous sph in this mechanism and this pathway.</p><p>Moreover, the authors use various approaches but they don't connect them or control for them appropriately. For example, they show that exogenous sph does not work but they don't measure cellular sph after the exogenous sph which is important. If this is at the same level as what they see with caged-sph, then they have a problem.</p><p>Similarly, if they are unable to uncage dh-sph (they don't measure free dh-sph in response to uncaging the way they measure sph after uncaging sph), then they cannot use this as a basis to claim high specificity (which is one of the most important points in support of the specificity and therefore significance of the sph effects on calcium.) The finding that dh-sph is not functional is a strong indication of specificity of action; therefore to clinch this point, the authors need to measure dh-sph after its uncaging.</p><p>2) There is no evidence that Sph directly interacts with the TPC1 channel-no targets of Sph were identified. They could use click chemistry and show that uncaged Sph is bound to something specific to a calcium transporter or something specific to the lysosome-but this is likely beyond the scope of the present study. Because exogenous Sph itself does not induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, the Discussion, Conclusions, and the title should be toned down.</p><p>3) The effects of TFEB may or may not be related to the specific action of lysosomal sph. They use pac-sph to 'establish' the sub cellular localization of sph, but this compound would resemble more exogenous sph in its pharmacology and therefore should not act on TFEB or calcium. Does the pac-Sph translocate TFEB? If not, then its cellular localization is irrelevant. If it does, then how come 'plain' sph does not act on calcium? Does exogenous sph induce TFEB?</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Sphingosine releases calcium from endolysosomes via the two-pore channel 1&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the comments below, we regret to inform you that the reviewers noted a number of issues that would need to be addressed in full before the manuscript could be considered further for presentation in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Sphingosine (SPH) has been long demonstrated to act as a bioactive lipid to mediate various biological responses, such as cell proliferation inhibition and programmed cell death, but the mechanisms for it to mediate biological responses remain largely unclear. The present manuscript makes an interesting and potentially important observation that SPH releases calcium from endolysosomes via the two-pore channel 1 (TPC1). The authors developed photoactivatable SPH, caged sph, which was taken up by cells and was converted to free SPH upon photoactivation. This allowed the authors to study how free SPH transiently activates the release of calcium from different cellular compartments. The authors provide evidence that free SPH on its own, not through its metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate, can induce the release of calcium to the cytosol from intracellular calcium stores. More importantly, the authors demonstrate that the calcium release is specific to SPH but not to its naturally occurring analogue dihydrosphingosine that differs from SPH by a single double bond. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanism by which SPH mediates biological responses.</p><p>The results are incomplete with respect to biological effects resulting from calcium mobilization by SPH. One would predict that this magnitude of acute calcium release would mimic many of the effects of stimuli that induce downstream effects through calcium mobilization. Providing evidence with respect to some biological effects would significantly improve the manuscript.</p><p>It is worrying that sphingosine proper does not cause a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This really needs clarification. Additionally, the authors state in the Results and Discussion that Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves initiate at the point of uncaging and propagate throughout the cell but this is not quantified and this is not clear from the supplemental movie.</p><p>The pharmacology of the sphingosine-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is not so well defined. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, it is unclear exactly how Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was blocked (Ni v EGTA v both). The effect of XeC is modest but activation of TPCs is thought to result in secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, GPN appears to induce a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal that is comparable in amplitude to ATP (which the authors ascribe to ER release) which is surprising. Perhaps the GPN response causes ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Uncaging after addition of ATP/GPN is complicated by the elevated baseline. Would exogenous ATP fully deplete ER stores of calcium? What about using thapsigargin? There is little discussion of why Ned-19 is ineffective. Please show effects of Ned-19 on NAADP action or some positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>It is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that sphingosine responses are reduced upon TPC1 knockdown but it is not so clear whether this is a direct effect of sphingosine on TPC1.</p><p>The authors claim that sphingosine-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are reduced in NPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) does not reflect this (the proportion of responding cells is only slightly reduced) and it is unclear if there is an effect on the amplitude. The apparent reduction in signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> in NPC is not dissimilar to the effect of Sph kinase block in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (FtY720), XeC/PM block in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and TPC2 silencing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> yet a role for the intended targets in sphingosine action were discounted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>-5.</p><p>The subcellular localisation/pulse chase data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> needs quantitation and the authors' claim that sphingosine localizes to the endolysosomal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) is not so convincing.</p><p>The authors imply that reduced sphingosine-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in NPC is due to activation of TPC1 by elevated sphingosine levels causing a reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the acid Ca<sup>2+</sup> store. A previous study (led by co-authors) however concluded that reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in the acid Ca<sup>2+</sup> store was due to reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (Lloyd-Evans, 2008). In the Introduction, the authors refer to a study where Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup> store was reduced in NPC but in that study (Shen; 2012), lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> content was unchanged and rather lipid accumulation was proposed to block Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through TRPML. This is a little confusing and potentially misleading. Cause-effect relationships are blurred.</p><p>Other Points:</p><p>1) The approach to block the conversion of SPH into S1P with DMS and FTY720 is somewhat problematic because DMS is a non-specific SPHK inhibitor and FTY720 is a SPH analogue, and both may mimic SPH in inducing calcium release on their own. Please note that FTY FTY720 is not an inhibitor of SK1. Moreover, the concentrations of DMS and FTY may not be sufficient to displace sph from sphingosine kinase. The authors should use genetic approaches to block the conversion of SPH to S1P in cells</p><p>2) Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> do not establish metabolic inertness of the caged compound. There is time dependent uptake, the signal is too faint to detect a sizable metabolite in the order of 10-20% or so, and this approach does not evaluate for spontaneous uncaging (the product would not be fluorescent).</p><p>3) The authors need to measure levels of sphingosine and metabolites at the earliest time point if they are able to.</p><p>4) Results and Discussion; full name of EGTA is not ethylene tetra-acetic acid</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. It looks like PM block has a significant effect on the sph response? This appears to be of the same magnitude as the loss in NPC. Also, this figure, in contrast to the legend, does not show the effects of EGTA or Ni.</p><p>6) SPH can also be quickly converted to ceramides through ceramide synthases or reverse action of ceramidases. The authors should investigate if blocking the conversion of SPH to ceramides can affect the calcium release by uncaged SPH. Also, studies in Farber's disease would be important.</p><p>7) The authors should investigate if increasing the generation of endogenous SPH by activating a ceramidase can induce the release of calcium from a calcium store(s).</p><p>8) The authors could measure the content of calcium in the endolysosomal system to determine if uncaging SPH indeed empties this calcium store. This will give another line of evidence that SPH releases calcium from this particular cellular compartment.</p><p>9) The max. amplitude change comparisons are often hard to compare – would additional kermel density estimations help, or report means where the data are relatively Gaussian?</p><p>10) The data on localization of Sph in NPC are hard to interpret (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Only one cell is shown, and it appears to include significant ER staining. LAMP1 staining also seems unusual in this one cell compared to other published reports for NPC1 mutant cells. Please add additional examples and consider including an ER marker to strengthen your conclusions.</p><p>11) A recent paper in Science showed a connection between NPC1 and TPC proteins in that both seem to be needed for Ebola virus entry. Please cite and speculate how your work relates to that story.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10616.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The main potential novelty is in defining a physiologic role for sph in regulation of calcium release from endolysosomes with consequent signaling and cell regulatory functions.</italic> </p><p>We agree that one of the most exciting findings of our work is a potential role of Sph. Because the subject is calcium release, the reviewers (and also the readers) expect to see an effect similar to IP<sub>3</sub>-induced calcium release from the ER. We believe that the effect of Sph on intralysosomal calcium levels is more subtle yet not less important. As our results on monitoring TFEB translocation clearly demonstrate, simple elevation of intracellular calcium by uncaging calcium does not induce translocation. The major effect of Sph on calcium homeostasis therefore is not likely to be the cytosolic calcium increase, but rather the emptying of the lysosomal compartment. Consequently, chronically elevated levels of Sph in NPC cells are responsible for lowered lysosomal calcium levels due to their effect on TPC1 channels. The physiological role is therefore only observable in a pathologic situation. We do NOT demonstrate a classical second messenger system where physiological Sph levels are elevated rapidly and a rapid response results.</p><p><italic>This is highly suggested by this study, but the study relies primarily on a 'pharmacologic' albeit novel and powerful approach using the delivery of caged sph.</italic> </p><p>Based on what we said above, we now indeed create a potentially artificial Sph transient. However, we need to do this, because the global elevation of Sph above a certain level (10 µM) is toxic to cells. In NPC but not in WT cells, Sph accumulates (1-2 µM) in the lysosome, but not in other organelles.</p><p><italic>As such, the role of endogenous sph is not established. In this regard, the 3.5 fold increase in intracellular sph after uncaging may represent a supraphysiologic response (one reviewer was not aware of physiologic conditions where intracellular sph increases by that much).</italic> </p><p>Here we run into one of the aforementioned misunderstandings. We failed to make it clear that the 3.5-fold increase in Sph levels after uncaging as measured by mass spectrometry was due to a supramaximal illumination for chemical analysis and higher than that achieved in the cell biology experiments. For the mass spec analysis we had to perform a batch experiment where a 6 cm dish was fully illuminated for 2 min to be able to detect the uncaged species. In the live cell microscopy experiments, we illuminate only a region of 9 µm2 within a single cell for 3 sec, before we start monitoring cytosolic calcium levels in the entire cell. Hence, the increase in Sph levels will much smaller in the physiological experiments (unfortunately, there is no fluorescent sensor available to directly measure Sph levels in cells).</p><p><italic>The study would be much stronger if there were ANY additional results to implicate endogenous sph in this mechanism and this pathway.</italic></p><p>We would like to state that there is indeed support of our claim that Sph acts as a signaling molecule in lysosomes. In an admittedly correlative study, Fran Platt’s lab showed that increased <italic>endogenous</italic> levels of Sph correlate well with reduced lysosomal calcium levels in NPC disease (Lloyd-Evans et al. Nat. Med. 2008).</p><p>Further, we have invested quite some effort to measure lysosomal calcium release on isolated lysosomes upon addition of “endogenous” Sph. However, after consultation of specialists in the field we learned that this has never been published before. Not surprisingly we failed to set up a robust assay that demonstrates the release of lysosomal calcium after Sph elevation in a lysosomal preparation. Measuring lysosomal calcium directly in living cells is complicated by the fact that all calcium sensors are strongly pH-dependent. Ideally, we would generate a new construct of TPC1 fused to an extralysosomal calcium indicator such as a genetically-encoded calcium indicator. This is subject of current investigations in the Galione lab and needs significant optimization before it will be useful for our purpose.</p><p> <italic>Moreover, the authors use various approaches but they don't connect them or control for them appropriately. For example, they show that exogenous sph does not work but they don't measure cellular sph after the exogenous sph which is important. If this is at the same level as what they see with caged-sph, then they have a problem.</italic> </p><p>We refer to the misunderstanding mentioned above. The levels of Sph measured in mass spec studies after uncaging is not relevant for the live-cell microscopy experiments. It simply served to show that Sph was not released until illumination and that “endogenous” Sph was released. Nevertheless, we tried to measure intracellular Sph levels after addition of exogenous Sph as suggested. However, this is quite challenging as most of the exogenous Sph simply associates with the PM and cannot be washed away. This has been previously seen by the Riezman lab when radiolabeling cells using 3H-sphinganine. This rapid cell association leads to overestimation of the “internal” Sph levels. A crude estimate of how much Sph was taken up by the cells can be gained from measuring S1P-levels, which increased quite slowly in a time-dependent manner (much slower than the calcium signal happens after uncaging Sph, see inserts). We are aware that a quantification of Sph after addition to cells is not useful because excess Sph cannot be washed away. Due to these complications, we decided not to include the data in the manuscript, but we add it for the reviewers only.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10616.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparative lipid analysis by mass spectrometry.</title><p>Lipid extracts of HeLa cells pulsed with (<bold>A</bold>).

When we uncaged Sph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, we also measured dh-Sph (which did not change). We now added to the data set the results of uncaging dh-Sph and measuring dh-Sph and Sph levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and added a paragraph in the Results section.</p><p> <italic>2) There is no evidence that Sph directly interacts with the TPC1 channel-no targets of Sph were identified.

Because exogenous Sph itself does not induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, the Discussion, Conclusions, and the title should be toned down.</italic> </p><p>We agree that showing direct interaction of Sph with TPC1 would improve the manuscript and simplify conclusions. However, we currently only have hints pointing to such an interaction. Crosslinking experiments followed by proteomic profiling with pacSph (see Haberkant et al, 2015) revealed TPC1 as a Sph interactor in one experiment out of three (interestingly, TPC2 did not show up at all). Since TPC1 expression levels are quite low and any potential interaction could easily be missed in such a complex experiment, we tried crosslinking on lysosomal purifications and detection by Western Blot. Unfortunately, we could not reliably detect any such interaction. We also tried to overexpress a new TPC1-FLAG construct followed by crosslinking with pacSph. Again, Western Blot experiments were not successful with this construct. We are now considering the possibility that Sph, analogous to NAADP, exerts its function on TPC1 via an adaptor protein. The search for such proteins will unfortunately exceed the scope of this manuscript (as mentioned by the reviewers). However, we believe that the lysosomal interactome of Sph will be a fabulous topic for the future. To reflect these difficulties, we changed the title to “Intracellular sphingosine releases calcium from lysosomes”</p><p> <italic>3) The effects of TFEB may or may not be related to the specific action of lysosomal sph. They use pac-sph to 'establish' the sub cellular localization of sph, but this compound would resemble more exogenous sph in its pharmacology and therefore should not act on TFEB or calcium.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge that there was a mix-up of results and reasoning on our side. We have now changed the first sentence subsection “Subcellular localization of Sph in NPC disease to “Next, we investigated whether Sph is localized to the endosomal/lysosomal compartment in control as well as NPC1 fibroblasts by using a newly reported photoactivatable and clickable version of Sph (pacSph) “We clearly demonstrate that pac-Sph is located predominantly to the lysosome. This is supported now by Haberkant et al. where the metabolism of pac-Sph is shown, albeit in cells that lack the S1P-lyase.</p><p><italic>Does the pac-Sph translocate TFEB? If not, then its cellular localization is irrelevant. If it does, then how come 'plain' sph does not act on calcium? Does exogenous sph induce TFEB?</italic></p><p>We investigated the effects of pacSph as well as exogenous Sph on TFEB and did not observe any translocation. This is to be expected as both lipids do not release lysosomal calcium. As for using pacSph to probe for lipid localization, we would argue that this is an important tool. Our study (and the related manuscript Haberkant et al, 2015) uses pacSph for the first time to visualize subcellular sphingolipid distribution. Even though pacSph does not induce lysosomal calcium, most probably because it does not reach sufficiently high concentrations in a short period of time, this probe still reports on endogenous Sph localization. This is important for our conclusion that Sph acts on the lysosome.</p><p>To demonstrate the difference of elevated Sph levels after uncaging vs addition, we now used a caged version of pac-Sph and showed that it elevates calcium levels after uncaging just as caged-Sph does (see the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10616.020</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Uncaging of caged pacSph increases cytosolic calcium.</title><p>Mean Fluo-4 fluorescence traces of HeLa cells incubated with Sph-Cou or TFS.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p><italic>The results are incomplete with respect to biological effects resulting from calcium mobilization by SPH. One would predict that this magnitude of acute calcium release would mimic many of the effects of stimuli that induce downstream effects through calcium mobilization. Providing evidence with respect to some biological effects would significantly improve the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>Following the findings of Medina et al. (Nat Cell Biol 2015), starvation conditions lead to mTOR release from the lysosomal surface as well as lysosomal calcium release, subsequent TFEB dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation. We confirm this now by showing that Sph-induced lysosomal calcium release leads to TFEB translocation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, uncaging calcium in the cytosol by a flash of light does not lead to TFEB translocation despite the same massive signal (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It should be mentioned that many other calcium effects will likely also be induced by lysosomal calcium release, simply because the fast increase following Sph uncaging will induce calcium-induced calcium release from the ER.</p><p> <italic>It is worrying that sphingosine proper does not cause a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This really needs clarification.</italic></p><p>Unfortunately, the addition of Sph to the extracellular space is cytotoxic and frequently induces apoptosis. Therefore only low micromolar amounts can be added in a live cell experiment which is mentioned in several papers (e.g. Chang, J. Dermat. 2004). We believe that, while the lipid enters properly, fairly rapid metabolism will prevent that sufficient amounts will reach the lysosome. Local uncaging at internal membranes seems to overcome this problem. Sph is now available in sufficient amounts close to its target. Further, we can dose Sph release well by choosing a larger or smaller area or less light. We now discuss this in the main text.</p><p><italic>Additionally, the authors state in the Results and Discussion that Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves initiate at the point of uncaging and propagate throughout the cell but this is not quantified and this is not clear from the supplemental movie.</italic> </p><p>To us, it was not surprising that a calcium wave starts from the point of uncaging. This can be explained by the above mentioned calcium-induced calcium release that is known to propagate through the cytosol. In addition, the diffusion or transport of the released Sph will also not be as fast as a water soluble compound would be. Nevertheless, we eliminated the sentence stating that the calcium wave propagates through the cell to avoid confusion.</p><p><italic>The pharmacology of the sphingosine-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is not so well defined. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, it is unclear exactly how Ca<sup>2+</sup>influx was blocked (Ni v EGTA v both).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers to spot this shortcoming. We now altered the figure legend accordingly.</p><p><italic>The effect of XeC is modest but activation of TPCs is thought to result in secondary Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER.</italic> </p><p>First, it was important to see that XeC was unable to block Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. This supported our hypothesis that Sph does not activate release from the ER. The traces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> further show that the response to Sph uncaging is now reduced which we attribute to the lack of calcium-induced calcium release via the IP3 channel. It should be mentioned that the initial phase of the calcium increase is the same in XeC and control treated cells (and also in PM blocked cells).</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, GPN appears to induce a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal that is comparable in amplitude to ATP (which the authors ascribe to ER release) which is surprising. Perhaps the GPN response causes ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</italic> </p><p>First, it was important to see that XeC was unable to block Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.

Would exogenous ATP fully deplete ER stores of calcium?</italic> </p><p>We tried to give another dose of ATP and most cells did not produce a second calcium transient. Of course, this only controls for ATP dosage. The proper experiment would have been to over-express the adrenergic receptor. Nevertheless, the strong calcium release after ATP will have likely emptied most of the available ER pool. In fact, after ATP addition, Fluo-4 (K<sub>d</sub> for Ca<sup>2+</sup> = 345 nM) saturates meaning that the intracellular calcium concentration probably exceeds 1 µM. As ATP is not washed away, the ER stores should not refill.</p><p><italic>What about using thapsigargin?</italic> </p><p>We tried thapsigargin once and found no calcium elevation after Sph uncaging. When looking up the literature, we found that thapsigargin-induced calcium mobilization indeed abolishes the effect of GPN, meaning that lysosomal calcium stores are sensitive to thapsigargin and likely its inhibitory effect on ATPases (Sivaramakrishnan et al., J. Cell Sci. 2012).</p><p><italic>There is little discussion of why Ned-19 is ineffective. Please show effects of Ned-19 on NAADP action or some positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</italic> </p><p>Our mistake: It was shown that Ned-19 is ineffective on TPC1 (but triggers TPC2). We now added a sentence stating this fact and cite Pitt et al., Sci Signal 2014.</p><p> <italic>It is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that sphingosine responses are reduced upon TPC1 knockdown but it is not so clear whether this is a direct effect of sphingosine on TPC1.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that we do not show direct binding of Sph to TPC1 and that this would be very important. But with all respect, this is a major task beyond the scope of this manuscript. We are aiming on showing this interaction in a future collaboration with structural biologists. For the reviewers only: we used a photo-crosslinking and clickable Sph derivative and performed proteomic analysis after cross-linking, clicking on biotin and extracting the lipid-protein conjugates. In one of two replicates, TPC1 was identified while TPC2 was not found. While these data are very preliminary, they support a direct interaction of Sph with TPC1.</p><p><italic>The authors claim that sphingosine-mediated</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> <italic>signals are reduced in NPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) does not reflect this (the proportion of responding cells is only slightly reduced) and it is unclear if there is an effect on the amplitude.</italic> </p><p>The average responder shows a clearly reduced amplitude. Further, the fraction of cells that respond with less than 50% amplitude change was 28% in control cells and 69% in NPC fibroblasts.</p><p><italic>The apparent reduction in signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> in NPC is not dissimilar to the effect of Sph kinase block in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (FtY720), XeC/PM block in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and TPC2 silencing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> yet a role for the intended targets in sphingosine action were discounted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>-5.</italic> </p><p>We agree that we show many traces with a reduced calcium response after treatment. Here, however, there is no treatment. We just compare two very similar cell types (healthy vs NPC subject cells). Just because a pharmacological treatment reduces the calcium response, this does not invalidate a comparison of the two cell lines.</p><p> <italic>The subcellular localisation/pulse chase data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> needs quantitation and the authors' claim that sphingosine localizes to the endolysosomal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) is not so convincing.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this hint. We now quantified the colocalization by determining Pearson’s correlation coefficients, added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and expanded the corresponding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p> <italic>The authors imply that reduced sphingosine-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in NPC is due to activation of TPC1 by elevated sphingosine levels causing a reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels within the acid Ca<sup>2+</sup> store. A previous study (led by co-authors) however concluded that reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in the acid Ca<sup>2+</sup> store was due to reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (Lloyd-Evans, 2008). In the Introduction, the authors refer to a study where Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup> store was reduced in NPC but in that study (Shen; 2012), lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> content was unchanged and rather lipid accumulation was proposed to block Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through TRPML. This is a little confusing and potentially misleading. Cause-effect relationships are blurred.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the statements are a bit confusing. We now changed the Introduction and made clear in the Discussion that the given statements are part of an ongoing discussion in the field.</p><p> <italic>Other Points: 1) The approach to block the conversion of SPH into S1P with DMS and FTY720 is somewhat problematic because DMS is a non-specific SPHK inhibitor and FTY720 is a SPH analogue, and both may mimic SPH in inducing calcium release on their own. Please note that FTY FTY720 is not an inhibitor of SK1. Moreover, the concentrations of DMS and FTY may not be sufficient to displace sph from sphingosine kinase. The authors should use genetic approaches to block the conversion of SPH to S1P in cells.</italic></p><p>Unfortunately, the use of RNAi against both Sph kinases was unsuccessful, probably because we blocked the main sphingolipid degradation pathway leading to toxic sphingolipid levels (now stated in the text). We then employed the non-sphingosine analog inhibitor SKI-II which gave a similarly small effect on Sph-induced calcium release. The data is incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p> <italic>2) Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> do not establish metabolic inertness of the caged compound. There is time dependent uptake, the signal is too faint to detect a sizable metabolite in the order of 10-20% or so, and this approach does not evaluate for spontaneous uncaging (the product would not be fluorescent).</italic> </p><p> <italic>3) The authors need to measure levels of sphingosine and metabolites at the earliest time point if they are able to.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a thorough control of sphingosine levels before and after uncaging was missing. We now teamed up with the group of Howard Riezman. They performed a lipidomics analysis. Results: incubation with caged Sph does not lead to changes in any of the sphingoid bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). After uncaging, Sph increased 3.4-fold while dihydroSph did not.</p><p><italic>4) Results and Discussion; full name of EGTA is not ethylene tetra-acetic acid.</italic> </p><p>Corrected, thank you.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. It looks like PM block has a significant effect on the sph response? This appears to be of the same magnitude as the loss in NPC. Also, this figure, in contrast to the legend, does not show the effects of EGTA or Ni.</italic> </p><p>It is well known that the use of calcium channel blockers reduces the size of the intracellular calcium pool simply because the leaky ER loses calcium that is partially pumped out and cannot be refilled. Therefore, in PM blocked cells, the response will be always reduced.</p><p><italic>6) SPH can also be quickly converted to ceramides through ceramide synthases or reverse action of ceramidases. The authors should investigate if blocking the conversion of SPH to ceramides can affect the calcium release by uncaged SPH. Also, studies in Farber's disease would be important.</italic> </p><p>Although we did not specifically investigate ceramide formation, the Sph kinase inhibitor FTY720 we used also happens to block ceramide synthase activity (Lahiri et al, J. Biol. Chem. 2009). Regarding Farber’s disease: there are around 80 cases reported worldwide and it would be very tough to get cells from such patients. We agree that it would be very interesting to do such experiments.</p><p><italic>7) The authors should investigate if increasing the generation of endogenous SPH by activating a ceramidase can induce the release of calcium from a calcium store(s).</italic> </p><p>We are not aware of a small molecule able to activate ceramidase. Over-expression looks like a dirty experiment as the cell would try to adapt to the higher Sph levels, especially considering the aforementioned toxicity.</p><p><italic>8) The authors could measure the content of calcium in the endolysosomal system to determine if uncaging SPH indeed empties this calcium store. This will give another line of evidence that SPH releases calcium from this particular cellular compartment.</italic> </p><p>This would be a great experiment. Unfortunately, these are also very difficult experiments as the lysosome is quite acidic (and worse, inhomogeneous ‘pH’) and calcium indicators will have altered calcium affinities (and quantification) under these conditions. Genetically encoded calcium sensors cannot be employed because the uncaging procedure would bleach them and hence would prevent quantification.</p><p><italic>9) The max. amplitude change comparisons are often hard to compare – would additional kermel density estimations help, or report means where the data are relatively Gaussian?</italic> </p><p>We agree that the histograms are not very easy to compare. However, once the reader has focused on this form of presentation, it is quite informative. We looked at a Gaussian presentation of the mean. Unfortunately, the cell number available does not suffice to present decent curves.</p><p><italic>10) The data on localization of Sph in NPC are hard to interpret (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Only one cell is shown, and it appears to include significant ER staining. LAMP1 staining also seems unusual in this one cell compared to other published reports for NPC1 mutant cells. Please add additional examples and consider including an ER marker to strengthen your conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We agree. We now show at least two cells in all co-localization conditions. Further, we also show a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> that provides the Pearson’s coefficient for 6 to 10 cells per co-localization.</p><p><italic>11) A recent paper in Science showed a connection between NPC1 and TPC proteins in that both seem to be needed for Ebola virus entry. Please cite and speculate how your work relates to that story.</italic></p><p>The mentioned paper came out after we submitted the original manuscript. We now cite this paper and discuss its content in the conclusion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
