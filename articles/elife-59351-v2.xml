redundant enhancers, are found in a wide range of organisms and are critical for robust developmental patterning. However, their mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesized that shadow enhancers drive consistent expression levels by buffering upstream noise through a separation of transcription factor (TF) inputs at the individual enhancers. By measuring the transcriptional dynamics of several <italic>Kruppel</italic> shadow enhancer configurations in live <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, we showed that individual member enhancers act largely independently. We found that TF fluctuations are an appreciable source of noise that the shadow enhancer pair can better buffer than duplicated enhancers. The shadow enhancer pair is also uniquely able to maintain low levels of expression noise across a wide range of temperatures. A stochastic model demonstrated the separation of TF inputs is sufficient to explain these findings. Our results suggest the widespread use of shadow enhancers is partially due to their noise suppressing ability.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In all higher organisms, life begins with a single cell. During the early stages of development, this single cell grows and divides multiple times to develop into the many different kinds of cells that make up an organism. This is a highly regulated process during which cells receive instructions telling them what kind of cell to become.</p><p>These instructions are relayed via genes, and a particular combination of activated genes determines the cell’s fate. Specific pieces of DNA, known as enhancers, act as switches that control when and where genes are active, while so-called shadow enhancers are found in groups and work together to turn on the same gene in a similar way.</p><p>Shadow enhancers are often active during the early stages of life to direct the formation of specialized cells in different parts of the body. But so far, it has been unclear why it is beneficial to the divide the role of activating genes across several shadow enhancers rather than a single one.</p><p>Here, Waymack et al. examined shadow enhancers around a gene called <italic>Kruppel</italic> in embryos of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Manipulating the shadow enhancers showed that they help to make gene activity more resistant to changes. Factors such as fluctuations in temperature have different effects on each shadow enhancer. Having several shadow enhancers working together ensures that, whatever happens, the right genes still get activated. For genes like <italic>Kruppel</italic>, which are key for healthy development, the ability to withstand unexpected changes is a valuable evolutionary benefit.</p><p>The study of Waymack et al. reveals why shadow enhancers are involved in the regulation of many genes, which may help to better understand developmental defects. Many conditions caused by such defects are influenced by both genetics and the environment. Genetic illnesses can vary in severity, which may be related to the roles of shadow enhancers. As such, studying shadow enhancers could lead to new approaches for treating genetic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>noise</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>shadow enhancers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-HD073191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wunderlich</surname><given-names>Zeba</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HD095246</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wunderlich</surname><given-names>Zeba</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010336</institution-id><institution>Hellman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wunderlich</surname><given-names>Zeba</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-EB009418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fletcher</surname><given-names>Alvaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008227</institution-id><institution>ARCS Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waymack</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMS1763272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enciso</surname><given-names>German</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>594598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enciso</surname><given-names>German</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proper development depends on establishing precise gene expression patterns in spite of the inherent noise in transcription, shadow enhancers buffer this noise by binding distinct input transcription factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The first evidence that transcription occurred in bursts, as opposed to as a smooth, continuous process, was observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Electron micrographs showed that even highly transcribed genes had regions of chromatin lacking associated transcripts in between regions densely associated with nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKnight and Miller, 1979</xref>). As visualization techniques have improved, it is increasingly clear that transcriptional bursting is the predominant mode of expression across organisms from bacteria to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chubb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanchez and Golding, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>). These bursts of transcriptional activity, separated by periods of relative silence, have important implications for cellular function, as mRNA numbers and fluctuations largely dictate these quantities at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Csárdi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). Such fluctuations in regulatory proteins, like TFs and signaling molecules, can propagate down a gene regulatory network, significantly altering the expression levels or noise of downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Given the inevitable fluctuations in regulatory proteins like TFs, it is unclear how organisms establish and maintain the precise levels of gene expression seen during development, where expression patterns can be reproducible down to half-nuclear distances in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>). Many mechanisms that buffer against expression noise, either inherent or stemming from genetic or environmental variation, have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lagha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stapel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raj et al., 2010</xref>). For example, organisms use temporal and spatial averaging mechanisms and redundancy in genetic circuits to achieve the precision required for proper development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stapel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erdmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lagha et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we propose that shadow enhancers may be another mechanism by which developmental systems manage noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barolo, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Shadow enhancers are groups of two or more enhancers that control the same target gene and drive overlapping spatiotemporal expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barolo, 2012</xref>). Shadow enhancers are found in a wide range of organisms, from insects to plants to mammals, particularly in association with developmental genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannavò et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bomblies et al., 1999</xref>). While seemingly redundant, the individual enhancers of a shadow enhancer group have been shown to be critical for proper gene expression in the face of both environmental and genetic perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perry et al., 2010</xref>). Such perturbations may exacerbate fluctuations in upstream regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung and Ma, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Although shadow enhancers are shown to be pervasive in developmental systems and necessary for robust gene expression, their precise mechanism of action is still unknown. One proposed mechanism is that having multiple enhancers controlling the same promoter reduces the effective ‘failure rate’ of the promoter and ensures a critical threshold of gene expression is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perry et al., 2011</xref>). An alternative, but not mutually exclusive, possibility is that shadow enhancers ensure robust expression by buffering noise in upstream regulators. Several studies suggest that individual enhancers of a shadow enhancer group tend to be controlled by different sets of TFs, which we call a ‘separation of inputs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wunderlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannavò et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghiasvand et al., 2011</xref>). We hypothesize that this separation of inputs allows shadow enhancers to buffer against fluctuations in upstream TF levels to drive more consistent expression levels.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> gap gene <italic>Kruppel</italic> (<italic>Kr</italic>) provides a useful system in which to probe the mechanisms of action of shadow enhancers. During early embryogenesis, <italic>Kr</italic> expression is critical for thorax formation, and like the other gap genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, has quite low noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Preiss et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubuis et al., 2013</xref>). During this time, <italic>Kr</italic> is controlled by the activity of two enhancers, proximal and distal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perry et al., 2011</xref>), that drive overlapping expression in the center of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We call the two individual enhancers together the <italic>shadow enhancer pair</italic>. Previous experiments have shown that each enhancer is activated by different TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wunderlich et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we focus on differences in activation, as the key repressors of <italic>Kr</italic>, Knirps and Giant, are likely to regulate both enhancers. By measuring live mRNA dynamics, we can use the <italic>Kr</italic> system in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos to assess whether and how shadow enhancers act to buffer noise and to identify the sources of noise in the developing embryo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dual allele imaging shows the individual <italic>Kruppel</italic> enhancers drive largely independent transcriptional dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the endogenous <italic>Kruppel</italic> locus with distal (blue) and proximal (orange) shadow enhancers driving <italic>Kr</italic> (teal) expression in the central region of the embryo.

Still frame from live imaging experiment where nuclei are red circles and active sites of transcription are green spots.

(<bold>D</bold>) The fluorescence of each allele in individual nuclei can be tracked across time as a measure of transcriptional activity. The graph shows a representative trace of transcriptional activity of the two alleles in a single nucleus across the time of nc14. These traces are used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the transcriptional activity of the two alleles in a nucleus across the time of nc14.

The number of transcriptional spots tracked during nc14 in the AP bin of maximum expression was counted for all embryos imaged for each homozygous and hemizygous construct. The graph shows the average of this value for homozygous embryos, divided by double the value observed in the corresponding hemizygous construct.

We showed that the individual <italic>Kr</italic> enhancers can act largely independently in the same nucleus, while identical enhancers display correlated activity. We constructed a simple mathematical model to describe this system and found that TF fluctuations are necessary to reproduce the correlated activity of identical enhancers in the same nucleus. The shadow enhancer pair drives lower noise than either duplicated enhancer, and using the model, we found that this is a natural consequence of the separation of TF inputs. Additional experiments, including simultaneous measurements of TF levels and expression and a decomposition of noise sources, further demonstrate that the shadow enhancer pair is less sensitive to fluctuations in TF levels than is a single enhancer. Additionally, the shadow enhancer pair is uniquely able to maintain low levels of expression noise across a wide range of temperatures. We suggest that this noise suppression ability is one of the key features that explains the prevalence of shadow enhancers in developmental systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Individual enhancers in the shadow enhancer pair act nearly independently within a nucleus</title><p>To test our hypothesis that the separation of inputs between <italic>Kruppel’s (Kr)</italic> shadow enhancers provides them with noise-buffering capabilities, we needed to first test the ability of each enhancer to act independently. In previous work, we found that the individual enhancers in the shadow enhancer pair are controlled by different activating TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wunderlich et al., 2015</xref>). These experiments established that the enhancers responded differently to perturbations in key TFs, indicating that each enhancer uses a distinct regulatory logic. The proximal enhancer is activated by Hunchback (Hb) and Stat92E, and the distal enhancer is activated by Bicoid (Bcd) and Zelda (Zld) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given this separation of inputs, the shadow enhancer pair could provide a form of noise buffering if variability in gene expression is driven primarily by fluctuations in upstream factors. Conversely, variability in upstream regulators may be low enough in the developing embryo that these fluctuations are not the primary driver of downstream expression noise. If this were the case, the separation of inputs is unlikely to be a key requirement of shadow enhancer function.</p><p>To investigate these possibilities, we measured and compared the correlation of allele activity in homozygous or heterozygous embryos that carry two reporter genes. <italic>Proximal homozygotes</italic> contained the proximal enhancer driving a reporter, inserted in the same location on both homologous chromosomes, and <italic>distal homozygotes</italic> similarly had the distal enhancer driving reporter expression on both homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also made heterozygous embryos, called <italic>shadow heterozygotes</italic>, which had one proximal and one distal reporter, again in the same location on both homologous chromosomes. To measure live mRNA dynamics and correlations in allele activity, we used the MS2-MCP reporter system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). This system allows the visualization of mRNAs that contain the MS2 RNA sequence, which is bound by an MCP-GFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertrand et al., 1998</xref>). In the developing embryo, only the site of nascent transcription is visible, as single transcripts are too dim, allowing us to measure the rate of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lucas et al., 2013</xref>). In blastoderm-stage embryos with two MS2 reporter genes, we can observe two distinct foci of fluorescence corresponding to the two alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>), in line with previous results that suggest there are low levels of transvection at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukaya and Levine, 2017</xref>).

Our counts of active transcription sites in homozygous embryos correspond well to the expected value calculated from hemizygous embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, if global factors affecting both enhancers dominate, there would be no difference in allele activity correlations. During the ~1 hr of nuclear cycle 14 (nc14) we found that allele activity is more than twice as correlated in both proximal and distal homozygotes than in shadow heterozygote embryos at 47–57% egg length, which encompasses the central region of <italic>Kr</italic> expression during this time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The difference in our ability to measure allele correlation in the more anterior and posterior regions of the embryo stems from the slightly different expression patterns driven by the proximal and distal enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). The lower allele correlation in shadow heterozygote embryos indicates not only that the individual member enhancers of the shadow enhancer pair can act largely independently in the same nucleus, but that differential TF inputs are likely the primary determinants of transcriptional bursts in this system. Notably, heterozygotes still show marginal allele correlation, indicating that some correlation is induced by either shared input TFs or factors that affect transcription globally. The independence of individual <italic>Kr</italic> enhancers allows for the possibility that shadow enhancers can act to buffer noise by providing distinct inputs to the same gene expression output.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Transcription factor fluctuations are required for the observed differences in the correlations of enhancer activity</title><p>To explore the conditions needed for the two <italic>Kr</italic> enhancers to act nearly independently within the same nucleus, we generated a simple model of enhancer-driven dynamics.

If the difference in transcription correlation between homozygotes and heterozygotes is due to fluctuating numbers of TFs, we expected that the bursting TFs model will recapitulate this behavior, while the constant TFs model will not. However, if the constant TFs model is also able to recapitulate the observed difference in correlations, then the correlations are likely a consequence of the identical enhancers simply being regulated by the same set of TFs.</p><p>For each model, we used the 10 best parameter sets to simulate transcriptional activity in homozygote and heterozygote embryos and analyzed the resulting allele correlations. We found that the bursting TFs model always produced results in which both homozygote allele correlations are significantly higher than the heterozygote, which qualitatively mirrors the experimental observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). None of the best fitting parameter sets for the constant TF model were able to produce the experimentally-observed behavior and always resulted in near zero correlations for both the homozygote and heterozygote embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Notably, using the bursting TFs model, all the simulated allele correlations were lower than the experimentally observed values, for example the simulated heterozygote allele correlation was near zero, while the experimental value was 0.14 at the embryo’s midpoint. We hypothesized that this discrepancy was because the model assumes complete independence of the proximal and distal enhancer input TFs, while in reality, there may be some degree of shared inputs, either of known TFs or a general component of the transcriptional machinery. To test this hypothesis, we generated a model that added a common TF to the bursting TFs model and attempted to fit the model parameters. Some of the best parameter sets recapitulated the nonzero correlation of the heterozygote embryos, indicating that a shared factor may play a role in this system; however, this behavior was inconsistent from one parameter set to the next (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the simpler bursting TFs model, which consistently recapitulated the key features of the allele correlation data, was more suitable for subsequent analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, in our minimalist model of enhancer-driven transcription, the presence of TF fluctuations is required for the observed differences in allele correlation. These results also demonstrate the advantage of using a single generic TF for each enhancer. By abstracting away TF interactions, we reduced the complexity and number of parameters in the model, which allowed us to explore the relationship between TF production and allele correlation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The shadow pair’s activity is less sensitive to fluctuations in Bicoid levels than is the activity of a single enhancer</title><p>Both the experimental measurements of allele correlation and the computational model suggest that input TF fluctuations are an appreciable source of noise for enhancer activity.

As the Bcd-GFP transgene was inserted in a Bcd null background, the resulting embryos should receive roughly WT levels of Bcd. The females flies were heterozygous for the maternally deposited Bcd-GFP, and therefore, we estimate that roughly half of the Bcd proteins were labeled.

We therefore measured the correlation of nuclear Bcd-GFP levels to the slope of MS2 signal. When the enhancer is active, MS2 signal has a positive slope, when the enhancer is inactive, slope is negative. If the shadow enhancer pair is less sensitive than the distal enhancer to fluctuations in Bcd levels, we would predict higher correlation between Bcd-GFP levels and the activity of the distal enhancer than that of the shadow enhancer pair. We find that the transcription dynamics driven by the distal enhancer are indeed significantly more correlated to nuclear Bcd-GFP levels (median r = 0.18) than the dynamics driven by the shadow pair (median r = 0.14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; p-value=6.1×10<sup>−3</sup>), although both correlations are modest (see Discussion). The lower correlation indicates that transcription driven by the shadow pair is less sensitive to Bcd level fluctuations than is the distal enhancer. Our modeling recapitulates this finding, showing that the separated TF inputs of the shadow pair are sufficient to explain the observed decreased sensitivity to TF fluctuations (median r = 0.14 for the distal enhancer; 0.11 for the shadow pair; p-value=2.2×10<sup>−2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

Intrinsic noise corresponds to sources of noise, such as TF binding and unbinding, that affect each allele separately.

Extrinsic noise corresponds to global sources of noise, such as TF levels, that affect both alleles simultaneously. It is measured by the degree to which the activities of the two reporters change together. Intrinsic and extrinsic noise are defined such that, when squared, their sum is equal to total noise<sup>2</sup>, which corresponds to the CV<sup>2</sup> of the two identical alleles in each nucleus in our system (see Materials and methods). Because our data do not meet one key assumption needed to measure extrinsic and intrinsic noise with the two-reporter approach (see Discussion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), we use the terms inter-allele noise and covariance in place of intrinsic and extrinsic noise.</p><p>Based on our separation of inputs hypothesis and CV data, we expected the total noise associated with the shadow enhancer pair to be lower than that associated with the duplicated enhancers.

To address this, we have, for the first time, extensively characterized the noise associated with shadow enhancers critical for patterning the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. By either tracking biallelic transcription or simultaneously measuring input TF levels and transcription, we tested the hypothesis that shadow enhancers buffer noise through a separation of TF inputs to the individual member enhancers. Our results show that TF fluctuations play a significant role in transcriptional noise and that a shadow enhancer pair is better able to buffer both extrinsic and intrinsic sources of noise than duplicated enhancers. Using a simple mathematical model, we found that fluctuations in TF levels are required to reproduce the observed correlations between reporter activity and that the low noise driven by the shadow enhancer pair may be a natural consequence of the separation of TF inputs to the member enhancers. Lastly, we showed that a shadow enhancer pair is uniquely able to buffer expression noise across a wide range of temperatures. Together, these results support the hypothesis that shadow enhancers buffer input TF noise to drive robust gene expression patterns during development.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Temporal fluctuations in transcription factor levels drive expression noise in the embryo</title><p>When measured in fixed embryos, the TFs used in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic development show remarkably precise expression patterns, displaying errors smaller than the width of a single nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Little et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2008</xref>). It therefore was unclear whether fluctuations in these regulators play a significant role in transcriptional noise in the developing embryo. By measuring the temporal dynamics of the individual <italic>Kr</italic> enhancers, each of which is controlled by different transcriptional activators, we show that TF fluctuations do significantly contribute to the noise in transcriptional output of a single enhancer. Within a nucleus, expression controlled by the two different <italic>Kr</italic> enhancers is far less correlated than expression driven by two copies of the same enhancer, indicating that TF inputs, as opposed to more global factors, are the primary regulators of transcriptional bursting in this system. Our current findings leave open the possibility that additional mechanisms, such as differences in 3D nuclear organization between different reporters, may also contribute to the differences in noise that we see.</p><p>We also showed that activity driven by the <italic>Kr</italic> shadow enhancer pair is less sensitive to levels of a single TF than is activity driven by an individual <italic>Kr</italic> enhancer. While prior work has shown that changes in TF levels precede changes in target transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bothma et al., 2018</xref>), the sensitivity of individual enhancers to changes in TF levels had not been previously quantified. The correlation between Bcd levels and activity of the distal enhancer is modest, and we expect that this reflects both the influence of additional TF inputs and nuclear heterogeneity that causes the local Bcd levels available to the enhancer to differ from total nuclear levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mir et al., 2018</xref>). We suspect that the correlation between the activity of the distal enhancer and Bcd levels in the microenvironment surrounding the enhancer is higher than what we were able to measure here.

In that study, the authors showed that the activity of one reporter did not inhibit expression of the other reporter, and therefore their calculations assumed no negative covariance between the reporters’ expression output. In our system, we found a small amount of negative covariance between the activity of two alleles in the same nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). For this reason, we called our measurements covariance and inter-allele noise. The negative covariance we observed indicates that activity at one allele can sometimes interfere with activity at the other allele, suggesting competition for limited amounts of a factor necessary for reporter visualization. The two possible limiting factors are MCP-GFP or an endogenous factor required for transcription. If MCP-GFP were limiting, we would expect to see the highest levels of negative covariance at the center of the embryo, where the highest number of transcripts are produced and bound by MCP-GFP. Since the fraction of nuclei with negative covariance is highest at the edges of the expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), the limiting resource is likely not MCP-GFP, but instead a spatially-patterned endogenous factor, like a TF.</p><p>Currently, the field largely assumes that adding reporters does not appreciably affect expression of other genes. However, sequestering TFs within repetitive regions of DNA can impact gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Janssen et al., 2000</xref>), and a few case studies show that reporters can affect endogenous gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laboulaye et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson and Gasson, 2001</xref>). If TF competition is responsible for the observed negative covariance between reporters, a closer examination of the effects of transgenic reporters on the endogenous system is warranted. In addition, TF competition may be a feature, not a bug, of developmental gene expression control, as modeling has indicated that molecular competition can decrease expression noise and correlate expression of multiple targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wei et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Additional functions of shadow enhancers and outlook</title><p>There are likely several features of shadow enhancers selected by evolution outside of their noise-suppression capabilities. Preger-Ben Noon, et al. showed that all shadow enhancers of <italic>shavenbaby</italic>, a developmental TF gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, drive expression patterns in tissues and times outside of their previously characterized domains in the larval cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Preger-Ben Noon et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that shadow enhancers, while seemingly redundant at one developmental stage, may play separate, non-redundant roles in other stages or tissues. Additionally, a recent study investigating shadow enhancer pairs associated with genes involved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic development found that CRISPR deletions of the individual enhancers result in different phenotypes, suggesting each plays a slightly different role in regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunipace et al., 2019</xref>). In several other cases, both members of a shadow enhancer pair are required for the precise expression pattern generated by the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Sherif and Levine, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunipace et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). These sharpened expression patterns achieved by a shadow enhancer pair may reflect enhancer dominance or other forms of enhancer-enhancer interaction and are likely another important function of shadow enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Sherif and Levine, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the case of <italic>Kr</italic>, the endogenous expression pattern is best recapitulated by the shadow enhancer pair, with the individual enhancers driving slightly more anterior or posterior patterns of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Sherif and Levine, 2016</xref>). Additionally, the early embryonic <italic>Kr</italic> enhancers drive observable levels of expression in additional tissues and time points, but these expression patterns overlap those driven by additional, generally stronger, enhancers, suggesting that the primary role of the proximal and distal enhancers is in early embryonic patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoch et al., 1990</xref>). Therefore, while we cannot rule out the possibility that the proximal and distal enhancers perform separate functions at later stages, it seems that their primary function, and evolutionary substrate, is controlling <italic>Kr</italic> expression pattern and noise levels during early embryonic development.</p><p>Here, we have investigated the details of shadow enhancer function for a particular system, and we expect that some key observations may generalize to many sets of shadow enhancers. Shadow enhancers seem to be a general feature of developmental systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannavò et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>), but the diversity among them has yet to be specifically addressed. While we worked with a pair of shadow enhancers with clearly separated TF activators, shadow enhancers can come in much larger groups and with varying degrees of TF input separation between the individual enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannavò et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>). To discern how expression dynamics and noise driven by shadow enhancers depend on their degree of TF input separation, we are investigating these characteristics in additional sets of shadow enhancers with varying degrees of differential TF regulation. Our current results combined with data gathered from additional shadow enhancers will inform fuller models of how developmental systems ensure precision and robustness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ChrII attP site; PBac{y[+]-attP-3B}VK00002</td><td valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td valign="top">BDSC:9723 FLYB: FBti0076425</td><td valign="top">Fly line injected for transgenic reporters</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Kr</italic> proximal enhancer</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fly line with MS2 expression driven by <italic>Kr</italic> proximal enhancer inserted on chromosome II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Kr</italic> distal enhancer</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fly line with MS2 expression driven by <italic>Kr</italic> distal enhancer inserted on chromosome II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">shadow enhancer pair</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fly line with MS2 expression driven by <italic>Kr</italic> shadow enhancer pair inserted on chromosome II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">duplicated distal enhancer</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fly line with MS2 expression driven by two copies of <italic>Kr</italic> distal enhancer inserted on chromosome II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">duplicated proximal enhancer</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fly line with MS2 expression driven by two copies of <italic>Kr</italic> proximal enhancer inserted on chromosome II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">endogenous distal enhancer</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fly line with MS2 expression driven by <italic>Kr</italic> distal enhancer at endogenous spacing from promoter, inserted on chromosome II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Bcd-GFP; Bcd-eGFP</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>, <italic>Cell</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fly line with mutated endogenous Bcd (<italic>bcd<sup>E1</sup></italic>) rescued with GFP-tagged Bcd transgene on X chromosome</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MCP-GFP</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>, <italic>Current Biology</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fly line expressing MCP-GFP on chromosome III and His-RFP on chromosome II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MCP-mCherry</td><td valign="top">Hernan Garcia Lab</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fly line expressing MCP-mCherry as transgene on Chromosome II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>hunchback</italic> P2 enhancer</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>, <italic>Current Biology</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fly line with MS2 expression driven by <italic>hb</italic> P2 enhancer on chromosome II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">mRNADynamics</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>, <italic>Current Biology</italic></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>MATLAB</italic> pipeline for tracking and analysing MS2 transcriptional spots</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of transgenic reporter fly lines</title><p>The single, duplicated, or shadow enhancers were each cloned into the pBphi vector, upstream of the <italic>Kruppel</italic> promoter, 24 MS2 repeats, and a <italic>yellow</italic> reporter gene as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukaya et al., 2016</xref>.

Individual embryos were then imaged on a Nikon A1R point scanning confocal microscope using a 60X/1.4 N.A. oil immersion objective and laser settings of 40uW for 488 nm and 35uW for 561 nm. To track transcription, 21 slice Z-stacks, at 0.5 um steps, were taken throughout the length of nc14 at roughly 30 s intervals. To identify the Z-stack’s position in the embryo, the whole embryo was imaged after the end of nc14 at 20x using the same laser power settings. Later in the analysis, each transcriptional spot’s location is described as falling into one of 42 anterior-posterior (AP) bins, with the first bin at the anterior of the embryo. Unless otherwise indicated, embryos were imaged at ambient temperature, which was on average 26.5°C. To image at other temperatures, embryos were either heated or cooled using the Bioscience Tools (Highland, CA) heating-cooling stage and accompanying water-cooling unit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Burst calling and calculation of transcription parameters</title><p>Tracking of nuclei and transcriptional spots was done using the image analysis Matlab pipeline described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>. For every spot of transcription imaged, background fluorescence at each time point is estimated as the offset of fitting the 2D maximum projection of the Z-stack image centered around the transcriptional spot to a gaussian curve, using Matlab <italic>lsqnonlin</italic>. This background estimate is subtracted from the raw spot fluorescence intensity. The resulting fluorescence traces across the time of nc14 are then subject to smoothing by the LOWESS method with a span of 10%. The smoothed traces were used to measure transcriptional parameters and noise. Traces consisting of fewer than three time frames were removed from calculations. To calculate transcription parameters, we used the smoothed traces to determine if the promoter was active or inactive at each time point. A promoter was called active if the slope of its trace (change in fluorescence) between one point and the next was greater than or equal to the instantaneous fluorescence value calculated for one mRNA molecule (F<sub>RNAP</sub>, described below). Once called active, the promoter is considered active until the slope of the fluorescence trace becomes less than or equal to the negative instantaneous fluorescence value of one mRNA molecule, at which point it is called inactive until another active point is reached. The instantaneous fluorescence of a single mRNA was chosen as the threshold because we reasoned that an increase in fluorescence greater than or equal to that of a single transcript is indicative of an actively producing promoter, while a decrease in fluorescence greater than that associated with a single transcript indicates transcripts are primarily dissociating from, not being produced from, this locus. Visual inspection of fluorescence traces agreed well with the burst calling produced by this method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Using these traces and promoter states, we measured burst size, frequency and duration. Burst size is defined as the integrated area under the curve of each transcriptional burst, from one ‘ON’ frame to the next ‘ON’ frame, with the value of 0 set to the floor of the background-subtracted florescence trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> panel C). Duration is defined as the amount of time occurring between the frame a promoter is determined active and the frame it is next determined inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> panel F). Frequency is defined as the number of bursts occurring in the period of time from the first time the promoter is called active until 50 min into nc14 or the movie ends, whichever is first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> panel E). The time of first activity was used for frequency calculations because the different enhancer constructs showed different characteristic times to first transcriptional burst during nc14. For these, and all other measurements, we control for the embryo position of the transcription trace by first individually analyzing the trace and then using all the traces in each AP bin (anterior-posterior; the embryo is divided into 41 bins each containing 2.5% of the embryo’s length) to calculate summary statistics of the transcriptional dynamics and noise values at that AP position.</p><p>All Matlab codes used for burst calling, noise measurements, and other image processing are available at the Wunderlich Lab GitHub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waymack, 2020</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/KrShadowEnhancerCode">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/KrShadowEnhancerCode</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Simultaneous tracking of Bcd-GFP and enhancer activity</title><p>To compare the sensitivity of the activity of the shadow pair and distal enhancer to Bcd levels, we tracked the fluorescence of Bcd-GFP and MCP-mCherry in individual nuclei across the time of nc14. To obtain embryos for simultaneous tracking, we crossed female flies heterozygous for Bcd-GFP and MCP-mcherry with male flies homozygous for either the shadow pair or distal enhancer reporter. Bcd-GFP and MCP-mCherry are maternally deposited and thereby allow us to measure levels of Bcd and enhancer activity in individual nuclei of the resulting embryos. Embryo collection and preparation was performed as described above. The same microscope, objective, and Z-step profile were used as described above, but laser settings were switched to 40uW for 561 nm and 35uW for 488 nm. Analysis of transcriptional activity was performed as described above. Time traces of Bcd-GFP levels in individual nuclei were subjected to background correction by subtracting the average fluorescence of the regions of the image not containing a nucleus at each time point from the raw Bcd-GFP fluorescence. The resulting Bcd-GFP time traces were then subjected to smoothing by the MATLAB <italic>smooth</italic> function, using the LOWESS method with a span of 10%. To measure the sensitivity of enhancer activity to Bcd levels, we correlated the slope of MS2 traces to the corresponding Bcd-GFP levels in the same nucleus. Slope was calculated between the MS2 values at consecutive time points and compared to the Bcd-GFP value at the earlier of the two time points. This process was done for all time points through 50 min into nc14.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Conversion of integrated fluorescence to mRNA molecules</title><p>To put our results in physiologically relevant units, we calibrated our fluorescence measurements in terms of mRNA molecules.

Using this conversion factor, we can calculate the integrated fluorescence of a single mRNA (F<sub>1</sub>) as well as the instantaneous fluorescence of an mRNA molecule (F<sub>RNAP</sub>). With our microscope, F<sub>RNAP</sub> is 379 AU/RNAP and F<sub>1</sub> is 1338 AU/RNAP∙min. With these values, we are able to convert both integrated and instantaneous fluorescence into total mRNAs produced and number of nascent mRNAs present at a single time point, by dividing by F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>RNAP</sub>, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calculation of noise metrics</title><p>To calculate the temporal CV each transcriptional spot <italic>i</italic>, we used the formula:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>m<sub>i</sub></italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is the fluorescence of spot <italic>i</italic> at time <italic>t.</italic></p><p>We also decomposed the total noise experienced in each nucleus to inter-allele noise and co-variance, analogous to the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>.</p><p>Inter-allele noise is calculated one nucleus at a time.

The two enhancer models were also used to calculate allele correlation between homozygotes and heterozygotes because a distinction between the mRNA produced by <italic>C</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>2</sub> was made. This approach works because, for example when considering the homozygote embryos, each single enhancer resides in the same nucleus and is therefore affected by the same fluctuating TF numbers. In the duplicated enhancer model, each enhancer <italic>E<sub>1</sub></italic> or <italic>E<sub>2</sub></italic> is affected by the same fluctuations in the number of transcription factor T. An analogous logic applies to the heterozygotes.</p><p>To fit the two enhancer models to experimental data, we retained several parameters from the single enhancer models. Parameters <italic>r</italic> and <italic>α</italic> were directly calculated from the data, and, as such, did not vary across models. We assume that parameters concerning transcription factors (<italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>β</italic><sub>−1</sub>, <italic>γ</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>γ</italic><sub>−1</sub>, <italic>n</italic><sub>1</sub>, and <italic>n</italic><sub>2</sub>) are not affected by the presence of an additional enhancer. Therefore, in our model, only <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> are free to change. To fit the values of <italic>k</italic><sub>on1</sub><italic>, k</italic><sub>on2</sub><italic>, k</italic><sub>off1</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>off2,</sub> we set the other model parameters to the median values of the 10 best parameter sets in the respective single enhancer model. We then used a similar simulating annealing approach to fit the <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> values. We used the resulting values to simulate transcriptional traces and to calculate the predicted CV values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Theoretical modeling of inter-allele noise</title><p>To make a prediction about the expected change in inter-allele noise between single and two enhancer reporter constructs, we used the theory put forth in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sánchez and Kondev, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>. This formalism can be used to calculate the expected mean and variance of the transcriptional output of a promoter, given the possible states of the promoter, transition rates between states, and the rate of transcription resulting from each state. In these papers, the authors apply their formalism to different promoter architectures. Here, we generate a simpler model, in which we abstract away the individual transcription factor (TF) binding configurations, which would be numerous and poorly parametrized, and simply define states by whether an enhancer is looped to the promoter and activating transcription. Since these models do not account for fluctuations that would contribute to extrinsic noise, for example fluctuations in TF or RNA polymerase levels, they can predict the dependence of intrinsic noise on enhancer arrangement.</p><p>To apply this model to our system, we used these parameters: γ, degradation rate of mRNA; <italic>p,</italic> production rate of mRNA; <italic>k</italic>, on rate for enhancer-promoter looping; <italic>l,</italic> off rate for enhancer-promoter looping. We generated five models that represent different configurations of either one or two enhancers controlling a single promoter. Key assumptions are that the parameters describing this system are independent of both the position of the enhancer relative to the promoter and the presence of a second enhancer controlling the same promoter. In Model 1, there is a single enhancer controlling one promoter. There are two states, when the enhancer and promoter are not looped (mRNA production rate of 0), and when the enhancer and promoter are looped (mRNA production rate of <italic>p</italic>). In Model 2 (OR model), there are two enhancers controlling one promoter, transcription is activated if either enhancer is looped, and both enhancers can’t be bound at the same time. In Model 3 (additive model), there are two enhancers controlling one promoter, transcription is activated if either enhancer is looped, and, if both enhancers are bound, transcription occurs at twice the rate of single enhancer looping states. In Model 4 (synergistic model), there are two enhancers controlling one promoter, transcription is activated if either enhancer is looped, and, if both enhancers are bound, transcription occurs at three times the rate of single enhancer looping states. In Model 5 (XOR model), there are two enhancers controlling one promoter, transcription is activated if either enhancer is looped, and, if both enhancers are bound, no transcription occurs. Results of these models are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Hernan Garcia for providing advice on MS2 imaging, the MCP-GFP fly line, and a plasmid containing the MS2 reporter construct, Nick Lammers for assistance in the calibration of MS2 signal to mRNA counts, Clarissa Scholes for assistance in image processing, Lily Li for assistance in data analysis and comments on the text, Ceazar Nave for feedback on the text and figures, and Thomas Schilling and Rahul Warrior for useful suggestions for the project.

interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This study uses creative approaches to examine sources of gene expression noise and the relationships among shadow enhancers in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. A novel live imaging strategy is used to track expression of allele-specific expression that, combined with careful genetic analysis and manipulation of transcription factor levels, shows how the distinct regulation of different shadow enhancers reduces expression noise compared to identical copies of enhancers. Consequently, this work advances our understanding of how enhancers with largely overlapping functions interact and how variation in transcription factors relates to gene expression noise.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;Shadow enhancers suppress input transcription factor noise through distinct regulatory logic&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All three reviewers found the premise of this work exciting and novel, with intriguing functional data. They also all appreciated the modeling work. However, they were also in unanimous agreement that additional experimental work is needed to elevate the impact of this work on the field to the level expected for publication in this particular journal. Because this work is expected to take longer than the typical 2 month revision timeline for <italic>eLife</italic>, I am rejecting this work, but encouraging resubmission of a version that addresses the issues raised. As one reviewer wrote during our discussion &quot; It was frustrating to see great data, ideas, and analyses that were not critically tested.&quot; The reviewers' full comments are below.</p><p>The post-review discussion highlighted the following points as most critical:</p><p>1) Addressing the technical concerns raised in the reviews and clarifying methods. As one reviewer wrote &quot;it's extremely hard to judge the quality of the current results (even in the Materials and methods)&quot;.</p><p>2) At a minimum, use smFISH to confirm the live imaging results/model predictions. Better would be to more directly measure fluctuations of input TFs (e.g., HaloTags or LlamaTags).</p><p>3) Functional data testing arguments emerging from the model. Specifically, analyzing enhancers with specific TF binding sites mutated/deleted and examining the impact of manipulating TFs were suggested as ways to further test the credibility of the conclusions presented.</p><p>Please note that we aim to publish articles with a single round of revision that would typically be accomplished within two months. This means that work that has potential, but in our judgment would need extensive additional work, will not be considered for in-depth review. We do not intend any criticism of the quality of the data or the rigor of the science. We wish you good luck with your work and we hope you will consider <italic>eLife</italic> for future submissions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Waymack et al. investigate the control of transcriptional dynamics of the gap gene Kruppel in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo via two independent shadow enhancers. I like the main experiment in Figure 1 and I think the results are clear. Measuring expression from two identical alleles shows higher correlation than when two different enhancers are used, suggesting A) the factors that provide input into each enhancer may be different, and B) that variations in local concentrations of upstream activators and repressors play a role in transcriptional activation/dynamics. All in one shot.</p><p>Presumably properties of the traces from each locus in the heterozygote could be used to predict whether expression from a particular site of transcription was driven by the proximal or distal enhancer. It might have been nice to use two different reporters (MS2 vs. PP7) to label the two alleles independently and unambiguously, but this would have required additional constructs and controls and I think the results should be basically the same. This is an elegant experiment using existing tools.</p><p>They go on to examine the amount of noise created by input transcription factor fluctuations using a largely modeling-based approach. This is one of the central claims of the paper, though the coefficient of variation is only very slightly improved. Though I'm not able to fully evaluate the model, the idea does make sense; if noise in activator A is independent from noise in activator B, under certain regimes one input and therefore output will remain accurate despite a certain amount of variability. It is nice to formalize this in a model and find it to be true at least some of the time. Importantly, results in Figure 3 begin to test their initial model and they find that identical pairs of enhancers together in the same construct do not buffer noise as well as a heterologous shadow enhancer pair. Doubling the number of enhancers does not reduce noise if the enhancers rely on the same inputs.</p><p>What I would have liked to see is additional experimental tests. 1) It would be great to know whether the upstream inputs do indeed differ, and if changing their contributions would modify the system in a predictable way based on the models. 2) It would be great to measure an upstream input directly and determine whether its fluctuations correlate with the observed output.</p><p>For 1): A main conclusion is that each enhancer has different inputs, which is suggested by the observed correlation between identical alleles but which breaks down comparing across alleles. Each enhancer is likely to share some inputs while others may vary; they are after all quite similar spatial patterns. These potential inputs are discussed only minimally and the authors do not attempt to test what they might be. Zld, Bcd, Hb, and Stat – all their predicted inputs – have nicely characterized binding sites. I would have liked to see a small number of constructs in which potential input factor binding sites have been mutagenized or added. This may reduce (or increase) expression levels or patterns, but the remaining pattern could be evaluated for dynamics and correlation. Zld binding sites, for instance, can often be removed without removing the pattern but with changes to expression dynamics. Or, Zld sites could be added to an enhancer missing them to make the enhancer pair more similar.</p><p>For 2): New methods are available to visualize protein live and compare it directly to RNA output. Since a major claim of the paper depends on variability of upstream input it would be fantastic to measure an input relative to output and see if that also fits the predictions about variability and noise, and to measure output using either identical or different enhancers. It is possible that fluctuations in local chromatin state, for example, or local changes in topology create noise and not TF concentrations. Measuring TFs directly would allow for direct attribution (or not!). This may be beyond the current scope, but this would have been a way to add impact and reinforce the central claims of the manuscript.</p><p>Overall the manuscript is a bit light on experimental data and does not attempt to validate their models or predictions other than fitting the original data, then testing pairs of the same enhancers. Seeing similar effects for a second gene would help, but 1) and/or 2) above would be even better. That said, I like the direction of the work and the data from Figure 1. Given the reluctance of <italic>eLife</italic> to recommend additional experiments and that reviewers should evaluate the work as it stands, I do like the manuscript, and I think the conclusions drawn are reasonably well supported by the data provided. I think stronger arguments could be made with additional experimental data. I am generally positive but a little on the fence on my recommendation and look forward to seeing what other reviewers think.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors interrogate the role of shadow enhancers. They use two apparently redundant enhancers of the Kr gene as a paradigm. They generated MS2&lt;yellow transgenic reporters, driven either by the proximal or distal Kr enhancer, or a combination of both (referred to as shadow het or pair). The authors use an elegant approach to study the impact of fluctuations in TF inputs in single nuclei, by tracking biallelic transcription within a developmental pattern. By combining quantitative imaging with mathematical modeling, they show that a major function of the Kr shadow enhancers is to buffer transcriptional noise. This buffering is attributed to the natural variation in input regulators that is created by the presence of two separated enhancers.</p><p>To my knowledge, such in depth characterization of bi-allelic cross-correlation in transcriptional output has never been performed in vivo, and as such the results are novel and exciting. In particular, the question of noise buffering in an in vivo developmental context is fundamental and quantified in depth in this manuscript. However, I do have some concerns about the quantification methodology, in particular because the precise description underlying how this quantification was developed and the nature of its underlying assumptions is lacking. Moreover, given that noise buffering is among the key findings of the paper, I think that the authors should demonstrate it using an orthogonal approach. If the authors can address the major questions raised, I would recommend this work for publication.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>– Is there a particular reason to justify the usage of different transgenic lines for the allelic correlation aspect (Figure 1-2) and the noise quantification? It would be less confusing to quantify these two metrics using the same genetic paradigm.</p><p>In all figures:</p><p>• Dotted lines are too dim</p><p>• Error bars for experimental data should be added</p><p>• Numerical statistics (number of nuclei, number of videos) in each figure legend should be added instead of putting the information separately in Table 2.</p><p>To help understanding the similarities and distinctions of the two enhancers, the authors should provide a quantitative description of each enhancer alone, and the shadow heterozygote, in terms of</p><p>a) % of activation across A/P axis, with ideally still images at different time points in nc14 (and videos in supplemental data). This will clarify the mono- versus bi-allelic activation at the border of the pattern. This may help understand why measurements of the allelic correlation in the anterior most part of the embryo (20%-40% egg length) is only shown for “proximal”. Similarly, can the authors explain why the allelic correlation is measured at the posterior part only for “distal”? If this is due to the documented “shift” in Kr pattern (Jaeger 2004, El Sherif et al., 2016), the authors should comment on it.</p><p>b) Intensity profiles over time, at different positions of egg length (as in Scholes et al., 2019), and intensity per nucleus across the embryo length (similar to Bothma et al., 2014).</p><p>c) In the main text, the authors should be more explicit with the differential inputs: from the schematic in Figure 1, the distal enhancer seems to be regulated by the pioneer factor Zelda, while the proximal is not. Knowing that Zelda acts as a quantitative timer (Dufourt et al., 2018, Yamada et al., 2019), to what extent is noise buffering due to priming by a pioneer factor? Would the shadow pair still show low transcriptional noise in embryos depleted of maternal Zelda?</p><p>Allelic correlation:</p><p>To quantitatively compare the effect of each enhancer and the combined trans-heterozygote, they measure the correlation in allelic activity. This is the major result of Figure 1 and yet the authors don't explain clearly how they measure it. An explicative panel and a few sentences in the main text should help.</p><p>Moreover, they do not mention the presence of sister chromatids: if they observe transcription from duplicated sister chromatids, how does that affect the quantification analysis? Do they assume that replication occurs independently in both alleles? If so they should explicitly mention this.</p><p>Image analysis:</p><p>Does the procedure include an estimation of background intensities (free MCP-GFP), which varies substantially from embryo to embryo and within embryos?

This should be mentioned in the text.</p><p>Is spot detection performed in 2D (max projected Z-stacks) or in 3D?</p><p>Bursting:</p><p>The description of the burst calling algorithm is absent. If burst calling is arbitraty/manually determined, this should be clearly stated. This point is not critical for the results of this manuscript. However, authors should pay attention in clearly stating the assumptions for inferring promoter switching rates: indeed with a temporal resolution of 30 seconds, and without single molecule sensitivity, defining what is a clear “OFF” state (versus low activity below the threshold of detection) is difficult. Moreover in the Figure 5—figure supplement 1, can the author show raw traces instead of smoothened ones such as those depicted? The figure legend of this figure should be corrected: red circles should be the “on” promoters and not the black ones.</p><p>When comparing their model to the experimental data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, error bars are present for the simulated data but absent from the experimental data. This should be corrected.</p><p>Calibration:</p><p>The authors mention Lammers et al. as the procedure they follow, but this paper is not referenced (and to my knowledge only deposited on Biorxiv, and thus has not been peer-reviewed). However Lammers at al. state clearly that their calibration procedure with the hb-MS2 transgene “should generalize to all measurements taken using the same microscope”.</p><p>Given that the authors use heterozygous MCP-GFP females (while Garcia et al., Lammers et al. use homozygous) and that imaging settings/laser power etc varies dramatically from one lab to another, I am concerned about this calibration, although I agree that this factor may not dramatically alter the results of the manuscript.</p><p>However, to have another independent assay and avoid increasing uncertainty with multiple obscure calibration steps, I recommend performing single molecule FISH experiments on their transgenes. It would then be relatively straightforward to convert integrated MCP-GFP traces to absolute mRNA counts. If the authors end up with a similar calibration factor, this orthogonal method will strengthen their conclusion. Moreover, single molecule experiments could be used to examine the effect of the two Kr enhancers on the variability of mRNA production (see below).</p><p>Quantification of noise:</p><p>The formula of the CV is wrong and is the opposite of what is described in the main text.</p><p>Figure 3: can the author explain how they found a 15% difference in CV for the shadow pair compared to the 2x distal transgene. Was this calculated at a particular %egg length?</p><p>Can the author discuss why the shadow pair does not demonstrate any minimal noise beyond 60% egg length? A similar trend is observed with the simulated data (Figure 4C).</p><p>These results suggest that the shadow enhancer pair buffers noise, but only under certain circumstances and only by a 15% difference. Thus, the authors should dampen their conclusions to better reflect the data presented.</p><p>A major finding of this manuscript is noise buffering is accomplished at least in part by the presence of shadow enhancers. Yet transcriptional noise is measured with only one approach, live imaging, from which image analysis part is critical and not well-described here. Therefore, the authors should confirm the observed differences in transcriptional noise with an orthogonal approach such as single molecule FISH, as performed in Little et al., 2013 or Boettiger, 2013. By assessing the production of each “pseudo-cell” in nc14 or alternatively within a “column” of nuclei at a given position of the A/P axis, the authors could then assess how variable is the production of mRNA in each of the genotypes. These experiments would also permit to discuss the effect of spatial and temporal averaging as mentioned by the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript, &quot;Shadow enhancers suppress input transcription factor noise through distinct regulatory logic,&quot; Waymack and colleagues explore how shadow enhancers drive consistent expression levels by buffering upstream noise through a separation of transcription factor inputs at individual enhancers. By measuring the transcriptional dynamics of several Kruppel shadow enhancer configurations in live <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, show that enhancers act largely independently. The authors suggest that TF fluctuations are an appreciable source of noise that the shadow enhancer pair can better buffer than duplicated enhancers. The authors demonstrate that shadow enhancer pairs are uniquely able to maintain low levels of expression noise across a wide range of temperatures. Finally, a stochastic model supports their conclusion that the separation of TF inputs is enough to explain these findings.</p><p>Overall, this was a great paper and is exploring an important question in the field. It is well controlled with thoughtful experiments and modeling.</p><p>That said, I have some suggestions that could help the authors solidify their conclusions. Namely, one of the main conclusions is that TF fluctuations are the main source of noise that is suppressed by enhancers with different inputs. The authors go on to explore how shadow enhancers suppress noise across a wide range of temperatures. However, this does not test the effects of TF fluctuations and how they impact transcription directly. It would be great if they could test this though perturbations at either binding sites in the enhancers, or better still, through transient increases or decreases in the varying TF inputs. This could be done, for example, by noisy promoters driving the TFs in early embryos (HS::Hb or another variant), or by playing with copy number, etc. The authors could also image the distribution of the factors around the sites of transcription (Tsai et al., 2017, 2019). Again, this would explore how TF fluctuations impact shadow enhancers in a more direct way.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Shadow enhancers can suppress input transcription factor noise through distinct regulatory logic&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

As reviewers wrote: The quantification of noise in a multicellular organism with live imaging is very elegant and has, to my knowledge, never been performed by this bi-allelic approach in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. The Kr system with its set of two types of enhancers is very well adapted to the question. GFP-tagged Bcd was also used to measure Bicoid fluctuations and enhancer activity (shadow pair or distal enhancer) in the same nucleus, which showed that changes in the activity of the shadow pair were less correlated with Bcd levels than changes in the activity of the distal enhancer.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were very pleased with the revisions and new data added directly visualizing transcription factor input alongside mRNA response. They were also all enthusiastic about this work being suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. One reviewer, however, had some reservations about Bcd experiment and thus strength of one element of the conclusions. I've included this reviewer’s concerns (which were supported by the other two reviewers during the discussion phase) below. I anticipate that these concerns can be addressed with only text revisions to moderate the strength of conclusions drawn in one part of the manuscript and to add missing information about the copy number of Bcd-GFP</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>I think the data presented in the manuscript strongly support the first part of the title : “Shadow enhancers can suppress input TF noise”. However, more experimental data are needed to support the conclusion that noise buffering is achieved via “distinct regulatory logic”.</p><p>I appreciate the efforts of the authors to quantify Bicoid fluctuations while assessing transcriptional output dictated by the distal enhancer or the shadow pair (new Figure 3). However, I think that these data should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>First, the quantification are performed in a 3Xbicoid background (unless the authors introduced Bcd-GFP in a Bcdnull background, but this is not mentioned). Thus, the statement that half the Bcd proteins were labeled would not be strictly rigourous. If indeed there are 3 copies of Bcd, the shape of the Bcd gradient might be affected. Moreover, I would expect that fluctuations in this TF activator would be higher if Bcd was solely produced by the transgene Bcd-GFP. If there are indeed only two copies of Bcd, this should be clarified in text.</p><p>Second and most importantly, knowing that Bcd nuclear distribution is not homogeneous (as alluded to in the Discussion) (Mir, 2017, Mir et al., 2018), Bcd concentration should have been measured at the Transcription Site, as performed in Tsai, 2017 or Yamada, 2018, not across the entire nucleus.</p><p>Additionally, the difference in the correlation of Bcd-MS2 between the two transgenes (shadow pair vs distal) presented in Figure 3F is relatively modest. This panel would benefit from the control proximal alone.</p><p>I understand that with the current pandemic, it is quite difficult to perform experiments. However, to claim that noise buffering is achieved via distinct responses to TF fluctuations, the paper would need more data (such as smFISH, imaging new transgenes with TF mutations, and perturbing TF concentrations with heterozygous mutants in trans).</p><p>Having said that, I believe that a re-written manuscript with less emphasis on the cause of noise buffering would be a of great value that clearly deserve publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I would build the manuscript around the solid finding that shadow enhancers buffer noise and perhaps end the paper with the possible explanation of noise buffering (actual Figure 3 results revised, see comments above). This may also help to clarify the manuscript, as the text itself is highly complex and could be well-served by simplifying the structure to highlight a single key advance per sentence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59351.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

These results are summarized in a new Figure 3 and subsection “The shadow pair’s activity is less sensitive to fluctuations in Bicoid levels than is the activity of a</p><p>single enhancer” of the main text. Using eGFP-tagged Bcd, we simultaneously measured Bcd fluctuations and enhancer activity (shadow enhancer pair or distal enhancer) in the same nucleus across the time of nc14. Bcd primarily activates the distal but not the proximal enhancer, and therefore, we hypothesized that the shadow enhancer pair activity would be less influenced by Bcd levels than the distal enhancer. Experimentally, we find that the activity of the shadow pair is significantly less correlated with Bcd levels than the activity of the distal enhancer (Figure 3E). We agree that this experiment was an important addition to the paper and allowed for an exciting finding!</p><p>3) We have designed and ordered flies that contain enhancer mutations to test our computational model. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the results from these flies have been severely delayed. Our institution has not yet opened for non-essential research activity, so a timeline for these results is unclear. Instead, to address the concerns about further model testing, we have added two modeling components to the study:</p><p>a) We noted that the modeling results of single enhancer allele correlations presented in Figure 2 matched our experimental results qualitatively, but not quantitatively. Specifically, the model predicted that heterozygotes carrying a copy each of the proximal and distal reporter would have no correlation in transcriptional activity, while the experiments resulted in a modest, positive correlation in these heterozygotes. We hypothesized that the discrepancy between model and experiment might be due to a shared transcription factor. By modifying the model to include a shared transcription factor, our model can recapitulate the nonzero correlation in the heterozygotes, suggesting that a shared factor may play a role in this system (now included in Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>b) With the addition of experimental measurements of transcription factor levels, we realized we had the opportunity to use our model to generate predictions of the correlations between transcription factor levels and enhancer activity, to match our experimental measurements. We found that, without any modifications, our model yielded predicted correlations that closely match the experimental data (now included in Figure 3G).</p><p>In addition to these changes, we have also included a point-by-point response to all the reviewers’ comments. We hope that these additions and revisions have satisfied all the reviewers’ questions and concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] For 1): A main conclusion is that each enhancer has different inputs, which is suggested by the observed correlation between identical alleles but which breaks down comparing across alleles.

RNAi was not possible for Hb and Zelda at that time, so we used alternative approaches. Ventral mis-expression of Hb results in expanded expression of the proximal enhancer, but reduced expression of the distal enhancer. To assess the regulation by Zelda of the different enhancers, we measured expression in stage 4, pre-blastoderm, embryos.

This illustrates our observation that the proximal enhancer alone drives slightly more anterior expression, while the distal enhancer drives slightly more posterior expression.

Additionally, we find in our current data that the distal enhancer becomes active 5-10 minutes earlier in nc14 than the proximal enhancer (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><p>We would expect that the reviewer’s hypothesis would bear out. Any severe depletion of a key maternal factor like Zelda will drive higher noise and abnormal or possibly fatal developmental patterning.

These traces are used to calculate the correlation of allele activity in each nucleus.

In the context of shadow enhancers’ role in buffering transcriptional noise, since our measurement of noise (CV) normalizes for expression levels, we do not expect this to significantly affect our results. We were further convinced that this was a reasonable approach by the findings of (Lammers et al., 2020), which showed that a model of transcriptional bursting that took into account the activity of both sister chromatids produces the same results as a model that did not distinguish the two sister chromatids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Image analysis:</p><p>Does the procedure include an estimation of background intensities (free MCP-GFP), which varies substantially from embryo to embryo and within embryos?

We have added “For every spot of transcription imaged, background fluorescence at each time point is estimated as the offset of fitting the 2D maximum projection of the Z-stack image centered around the transcriptional spot to a gaussian curve, using Matlab <italic>lsqnonlin</italic>. This background estimate is subtracted from the raw spot fluorescence intensity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Spot detection:</p><p>For each trace, how is the zero determined?

In our measurements of burst size, the value of zero is set to the floor of the fluorescence trace, above which we integrate the area under the curve of the transcriptional trace. To clarify this in the text we have added: “Burst size is defined as the integrated area under the curve of each transcriptional burst, from one “ON” frame to the next “ON” frame, with the value of 0 set to the floor of the background-subtracted florescence trace (Figure 6—figure supplement 3C).”</p><p>Spot detection is performed in 2D on maximum projection Z-stacks. We have added this clarification in our description of background correction in subsection “Burst calling and calculation of transcription parameters”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Bursting:</p><p>The description of the burst calling algorithm is absent. If burst calling is arbitraty/manually determined, this should be clearly stated. This point is not critical for the results of this manuscript. However, authors should pay attention in clearly stating the assumptions for inferring promoter switching rates: indeed with a temporal resolution of 30 seconds, and without single molecule sensitivity, defining what is a clear “OFF” state (versus low activity below the threshold of detection) is difficult. Moreover in the Figure 5—figure supplement 1, can the author show raw traces instead of smoothened ones such as those depicted? The figure legend of this figure should be corrected: red circles should be the “on” promoters and not the black ones.</p><p>When comparing their model to the experimental data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, error bars are present for the simulated data but absent from the experimental data. This should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree our assumptions in burst calling should be clearly stated. In subsection “Burst calling and calculation of transcription parameters” we describe how we call a promoter as “ON” or “OFF”, which correspond to the beginning and end of a burst respectively. “To calculate transcription parameters, we used the smoothed traces to determine if the promoter was active or inactive at each time point. A promoter was called active if the slope of its trace (change in fluorescence) between one point and the next was greater than or equal to the instantaneous fluorescence value calculated for one mRNA molecule (F<sub>RNAP</sub>, described below). Once called active, the promoter is considered active until the slope of the fluorescence trace becomes less than or equal to the negative instantaneous fluorescence value of one mRNA molecule, at which point it is called inactive until another active point is reached. The instantaneous fluorescence of a single mRNA was chosen as the threshold because we reasoned that an increase in fluorescence greater than or equal to that of a single transcript is indicative of an actively producing promoter, while a decrease in fluorescence greater than that associated with a single transcript indicates transcripts are primarily dissociating from, not being produced from, this locus.”</p><p>In Figure 6—figure supplement 3, we have added a panel showing how a raw fluorescent trace is smoothed to the resulting curves. We show the burst properties on the smoothed traces because we calculate these parameters using the smoothed traces. In these figures the black open circles are indicating the time points in the trace where the promoter was switched to “ON”, while the red filled circles indicate the time points in the trace where the promoter was switched to “OFF”. As the reviewer points out, this was unclear in our original figure legend so we have adjusted it to read: “Black open circles indicate time points where the promoter is switched to being called “on”, red filled circles indicate time points where the promoter is switched to being called “off””.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When comparing their model to the experimental data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, error bars are present for the simulated data but absent from the experimental data.

However Lammers at al. state clearly that their calibration procedure with the hb-MS2 transgene “should generalize to all measurements taken using the same microscope”.</p><p>Given that the authors use heterozygous MCP-GFP females (while Garcia et al., Lammers et al. use homozygous) and that imaging settings/laser power etc varies dramatically from one lab to another, I am concerned about this calibration, although I agree that this factor may not dramatically alter the results of the manuscript.</p><p>However, to have another independent assay and avoid increasing uncertainty with multiple obscure calibration steps, I recommend performing single molecule FISH experiments on their transgenes. It would then be relatively straightforward to convert integrated MCP-GFP traces to absolute mRNA counts. If the authors end up with a similar calibration factor, this orthogonal method will strengthen their conclusion. Moreover, single molecule experiments could be used to examine the effect of the two Kr enhancers on the variability of mRNA production (see below).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. We did indeed carry out a calibration using the same protocol as Lammers, et al. (which is now published), but specifically using measurements taken with our own microscope, using our standard imaging parameters. We measure the F<sub>MS2</sub> value for our microscope, which is the average integrated fluorescence of one transcriptional spot driven by the hb P2 enhancer construct during the time of nuclear cycle 13 (nc13). As in the published protocol, we relate this value to N<sub>FISH</sub>, the published value of the mean number of transcripts produced by a single locus of this enhancer during the same time period of nc13 (measured by FISH), with the equation α = N<sub>FISH</sub>/F<sub>MS2</sub>. The calculated calibration factor, α, is then specific for our microscope and imaging parameters and enables us to estimate the instantaneous and integrated fluorescence of single mRNA molecules as described in subsection “Conversion of integrated fluorescence to mRNA molecules”. As the reviewer notes, this conversion is not crucial for our study as none of our conclusions rest on knowing the number of transcripts produced by any of the enhancer constructs. We simply chose to include estimates of enhancer activity in terms of number of transcripts produced to display our results in more biologically-relevant units.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Quantification of noise:</p><p>The formula of the CV is wrong and is the opposite of what is described in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this mistake, we have corrected the formula to read “CV(<italic>i</italic>) = standard deviation(<italic>m<sup>i</sup></italic>(<italic>t</italic>))/mean(<italic>m<sup>i</sup></italic>(<italic>t</italic>))”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: can the author explain how they found a 15% difference in CV for the shadow pair compared to the 2x distal transgene.

Yet transcriptional noise is measured with only one approach, live imaging, from which image analysis part is critical and not well-described here. Therefore, the authors should confirm the observed differences in transcriptional noise with an orthogonal approach such as single molecule FISH, as performed in Little et al., 2013 or Boettiger, 2013. By assessing the production of each “pseudo-cell” in nc14 or alternatively within a “column” of nuclei at a given position of the A/P axis, the authors could then assess how variable is the production of mRNA in each of the genotypes. These experiments would also permit to discuss the effect of spatial and temporal averaging as mentioned by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers request for additional approaches to measure transcriptional noise. From the editor’s summary of the reviewer comments, the consensus was that we needed to either perform smFISH or simultaneous TF-MS2 tracking to further address the role of shadow enhancers and transcriptional noise. We opted to perform simultaneous TF-MS2 tracking to assess the relationship of TF levels and enhancer activity. We describe this experiment and the results in subsection “The shadow pair’s activity is less sensitive to fluctuations in Bicoid levels than is the activity of a single enhancer” of the modified manuscript and in the answer to point #2 at the top of this response letter. We appreciate the reviewers’ requests for these additional experiments as they enabled the finding that the activity of the <italic>Kr</italic> shadow enhancer pair is less sensitive to fluctuations in Bcd levels than is that of the single distal enhancer (new Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] That said, I have some suggestions that could help the authors solidify their conclusions. Namely, one of the main conclusions is that TF fluctuations are the main source of noise that is suppressed by enhancers with different inputs. The authors go on to explore how shadow enhancers suppress noise across a wide range of temperatures. However, this does not test the effects of TF fluctuations and how they impact transcription directly. It would be great if they could test this though perturbations at either binding sites in the enhancers, or better still, through transient increases or decreases in the varying TF inputs. This could be done, for example, by noisy promoters driving the TFs in early embryos (HS::Hb or another variant), or by playing with copy number, etc. The authors could also image the distribution of the factors around the sites of transcription (Tsai et al., 2017, 2019). Again, this would explore how TF fluctuations impact shadow enhancers in a more direct way.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments from the reviewer and have added additional experimental data addressing the question of the relationship between TF fluctuations and resulting transcription. These results are summarized in a new Figure 3 and subsection “The shadow pair’s activity is less sensitive to fluctuations in Bicoid levels than is the activity of a single enhancer” of the main text, as well as the answer to point #2 at the beginning of this response letter. Using GFP-tagged Bcd, we simultaneously measured TF (Bcd) fluctuations and enhancer activity (shadow pair or distal enhancer) in the same nucleus across the time of nc14. We find that changes in the activity of the shadow pair are significantly less correlated with Bcd levels than are changes in the activity of the distal enhancer (Figure 3E). We agree that this experiment was an important addition to the paper and allowed for an exciting finding!</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>I think the data presented in the manuscript strongly support the first part of the title : “Shadow enhancers can suppress input TF noise”. However, more experimental data are needed to support the conclusion that noise buffering is achieved via “distinct regulatory logic”.</p><p>I appreciate the efforts of the authors to quantify Bicoid fluctuations while assessing transcriptional output dictated by the distal enhancer or the shadow pair (new Figure 3). However, I think that these data should be interpreted with caution.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. However, we would like to leave the title as is. There are three pieces of evidence that show that the two <italic>Kruppel</italic> enhancers use distinct regulatory logic:</p><p>1) The first, and strongest piece of evidence, which we build upon here, comes from our previous work (Wunderlich et al., 2015). In this work, we demonstrated that the individual enhancers respond differently to depletion or over-expression of three key transcription factors (Bicoid, Hunchback, and Stat92E). We have clarified the experimental basis for this claim, where we write:</p><p>“These experiments established that the enhancers responded differently to perturbations in key TFs, indicating that each enhancer uses a distinct regulatory logic.”</p><p>2) The second piece of evidence is the difference in correlations between homozygous and heterozygous embryos shown in Figure 1. We have tried hard to think of alternative explanations as to why homozygote reporter embryos would have higher correlations than heterozygote embryos, and, while we introduce a possible alternative in the manuscript, we still feel distinct regulatory logic is the most likely explanation.</p><p>3) Lastly, some of the reviewer’s concerns seem to stem from the assumption that the embryos we imaged with tagged Bcd were 3X Bcd. However, the embryos were actually 2X Bcd, which we have clarified in the text.</p><p>Therefore, we want to keep the existing title as it best conveys our main message. However, we have dampened our conclusions regarding our Bcd fluctuation experiments and added discussion of other possible mechanisms, as addressed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, the quantification are performed in a 3Xbicoid background (unless the authors introduced Bcd-GFP in a Bcdnull background, but this is not mentioned). Thus, the statement that half the Bcd proteins were labeled would not be strictly rigourous. If indeed there are 3 copies of Bcd, the shape of the Bcd gradient might be affected. Moreover, I would expect that fluctuations in this TF activator would be higher if Bcd was solely produced by the transgene Bcd-GFP. If there are indeed only two copies of Bcd, this should be clarified in text.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this concern from the reviewers and realize that we did not make clear that the embryos in our experiments have 2X levels of Bcd. The tagged Bcd-GFP was placed in a Bcd-null background (Gregor et al., 2007), and we have added the following to clarify this:</p><p>“To allow for tracking of both Bcd levels and enhancer activity, we crossed female flies that express eGFP-tagged Bcd <italic>in the place of endogenous Bcd</italic> (called Bcd-GFP from here on; Gregor et al., 2007) and MCP-mCherry with male flies homozygous for either the shadow pair or distal enhancer reporter. <italic>As the Bcd-GFP transgene was inserted in a Bcd null background, the resulting embryos should receive roughly WT levels of Bcd.”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second and most importantly, knowing that Bcd nuclear distribution is not homogeneous (as alluded to in the Discussion) (Mir 2017, Mir 2018), Bcd concentration should have been measured at the Transcription Site, as performed in Tsai, 2017 or Yamada, 2018, not across the entire nucleus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that looking at local Bcd levels around the transcriptional sites would be the best method of quantification, but, due to the pandemic, we cannot access a microscope with this level of spatial resolution. While total nuclear levels of Bcd do not completely capture the levels of Bcd available to an individual transcription site, it does provide an upper limit to the amount of Bcd available to a transcription site as well as a rough lower limit to the degree of Bcd fluctuations. Since local levels of Bcd will likely fluctuate much more than total nuclear levels, we suspect that differences in enhancer activity correlation between the <italic>Kr</italic> distal enhancer versus the shadow enhancer pair with local Bcd levels would be larger than what we observe with total nuclear Bcd levels. We emphasize this distinction between total nuclear Bcd levels and local levels available to an enhancer in the Discussion:</p><p>“The correlation between Bcd levels and activity of the distal enhancer is modest, and we expect that this reflects both the influence of additional TF inputs and nuclear heterogeneity that causes the local Bcd levels available to the enhancer to differ from total nuclear levels (Mir et al., 2018). We suspect that the correlation between the activity of the distal enhancer and Bcd levels in the microenvironment surrounding the enhancer is higher than what we were able to measure here.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the difference in the correlation of Bcd-MS2 between the two transgenes (shadow pair vs distal) presented in Figure 3F is relatively modest. This panel would benefit from the control proximal alone.</p><p>I understand that with the current pandemic, it is quite difficult to perform experiments. However, to claim that noise buffering is achieved via distinct responses to TF fluctuations, the paper would need more data (such as smFISH, imaging new transgenes with TF mutations, and perturbing TF concentrations with heterozygous mutants in trans).</p><p>Having said that, I believe that a re-written manuscript with less emphasis on the cause of noise buffering would be a of great value that clearly deserve publication in eLife. I would build the manuscript around the solid finding that shadow enhancers buffer noise and perhaps end the paper with the possible explanation of noise buffering (actual Figure 3 results revised, see comments above).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that measuring the correlation between Bcd levels and activity of the proximal enhancer would be informative and also appreciate the reviewers’ empathy regarding the current situation and the difficulty of performing additional experiments. Regarding our claim of distinct responses to TF fluctuations between the two enhancers, in our previous work, we have conclusively shown that the two enhancers respond differently to TF inputs (Wunderlich et al., 2015). In our current work, our allele correlation experiments (Figure 1) strongly suggest that the low correlation seen between the two enhancers in heterozygous embryos, compared to the significantly higher correlation between identical enhancers in homozygous embryos, is a result of the different TF regulation of the two enhancers. Given that these reporters are in the same <italic>trans</italic> environment, in the same genomic location and genetic background, the only difference between our homozygous and heterozygous embryos is the DNA sequence of the two reporters. Therefore, TF fluctuations are the most likely cause of the different activities of the two enhancers in a single nucleus. We do appreciate that further experiments could be done to test if other mechanism are at play. To address this and temper our conclusions as requested, we have made the following changes to the text:</p><p>Subsection “The shadow pair’s activity is less sensitive to fluctuations in Bicoid levels than is the activity of a single enhancer” – alteration of the sentence: “These findings indicate that the shadow enhancer pair is better able to buffer fluctuations in a single activating TF than is single enhancer, <italic>likely</italic> due to the shadow enhancer pairs’ separation of TF inputs.”</p><p>Subsection “Modeling indicates the separation of input TFs is sufficient to explain the low noise driven by the shadow enhancer pair” – alteration of the sentence: “Therefore, <italic>in our simplified model</italic>, we can conclude that the separation of input TFs is sufficient to explain the lower noise driven by the shadow enhancer pair construct.”</p><p>Discussion paragraph one – alteration of the sentence: “Together, these results support the hypothesis that shadow enhancers buffer input TF noise to drive robust gene expression patterns during development.”</p><p>Discussion paragraph two – addition of the following: “Our current findings leave open the possibility that additional mechanisms, such as differences in 3D nuclear organization between different reporters, may also contribute to the differences in noise that we see.”</p><p>Subsection “A stochastic model underscores importance of transcription factor fluctuations” – alteration of the sentence: “indicating that these differences <italic>in the model system</italic> are a direct result of the separation of input TFs to the proximal and distal enhancers.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This may also help to clarify the manuscript, as the text itself is highly complex and could be well-served by simplifying the structure to highlight a single key advance per sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to simplify several complex sentences.</p></body></sub-article></article>
