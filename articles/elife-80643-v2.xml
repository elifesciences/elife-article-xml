terminally differentiated epithelia that assemble multiple motile cilia used to promote fluid flow. To template these cilia, MCCs dramatically expand their centriole content during a process known as centriole amplification. In cycling cells, the master regulator of centriole assembly Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is essential for centriole duplication; however recent work has questioned the role of PLK4 in centriole assembly in MCCs. To address this discrepancy, we created genetically engineered mouse models and demonstrated that both PLK4 protein and kinase activity are critical for centriole amplification in MCCs. Tracheal epithelial cells that fail centriole amplification accumulate large assemblies of centriole proteins and do not undergo apical surface area expansion. These results show that the initial stages of centriole assembly are conserved between cycling cells and MCCs and suggest that centriole amplification and surface area expansion are coordinated events.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every day, we inhale thousands of viruses, bacteria and pollution particles. To protect against these threats, cells in our airways produce mucus that traps inhaled particles before they reach the lungs. This mucus then needs to be removed to prevent it from becoming a breeding ground for microbes that may cause a respiratory infection. This is the responsibility of cells covered in tiny hair-like structures called cilia that move together to propel the mucus-trapped particles out of the airways.</p><p>These specialized cells can have up to 300 motile cilia on their surface, which grow from structures called centrioles that then anchor the cilia in place. Multiciliated cells are generated from precursor cells that only have two centrioles. Therefore, as these precursors develop, they must produce large numbers of centrioles, considerably more than other cells that only need a couple of extra centrioles during cell division. However, recent studies have questioned whether the precursors of multiciliated cells rely on the same regulatory proteins to produce centrioles as dividing cells.</p><p>To help answer this question, LoMastro et al. created genetically engineered mice that lacked or had an inactive form of PLK4, a protein which controls centriole formation in all cell types lacking multiple cilia. This showed that multiciliated cells also need this protein to produce centrioles. LoMastro et al. also found that multiciliated cells became larger while building centrioles, suggesting that this amplification process helps control the cell’s final size.</p><p>Defects in motile cilia activity can lead to fluid build-up in the brain, respiratory infections and infertility. Unfortunately, these disorders are difficult to diagnose currently and there is no cure. The findings of LoMastro et al. further our understanding of how motile cilia are built and maintained, and may help future scientists to develop better diagnostic tools and treatments for patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>multiciliated</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>deuterosome</kwd><kwd>Plk4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holland</surname><given-names>Andrew Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM133897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holland</surname><given-names>Andrew Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA266199</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holland</surname><given-names>Andrew Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetically engineered mouse models show that PLK4 protein and kinase activity are essential for multiciliogenesis, demonstrating that the early steps of centriole assembly are conserved between cycling and multiciliated cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are specialized epithelial cells that line the surface of the respiratory tract, brain ventricles, and reproductive systems. MCCs contain tens to hundreds of motile cilia that collectively beat to drive fluid flow across epithelial surfaces. Each motile cilium is templated by a centriole or basal body that docks at the plasma membrane and extends a ciliary axoneme. Abnormalities in motile cilia assembly or function cause several pathologies, including chronic respiratory tract infections, hydrocephalus, and reduced fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spassky and Meunier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Terré et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In cycling cells, centriole duplication is tightly controlled so that a single new procentriole is created on the wall of each of the two parent centrioles during every cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nigg and Holland, 2018</xref>). By contrast, MCC progenitors with two parent centrioles produce tens to hundreds of new centrioles during their differentiation to generate the basal bodies required for multiciliogenesis. MCCs utilize two pathways to promote massive centriole amplification: a ‘centriole pathway’ where multiple procentrioles assemble on the wall of the two parent centrioles, and a ‘deuterosomal pathway’ where dozens of specialized structures called deuterosomes provide the nucleation sites for multiple procentrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sorokin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steinman, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenner, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalnins and Porter, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Brenner, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klos Dehring et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Jord et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Revinski et al., 2018</xref>). MCC differentiation is defined by distinct stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Jord et al., 2017</xref>). In mouse ependymal cells, procentrioles form around parent centrioles and deuterosomes during amplification (A) phase. Procentrioles elongate during growth (G) phase and detach from their growing platforms at disengagement (D) phase. Disengaged centrioles migrate and dock at the apical membrane to become basal bodies that form motile cilia during the multiple basal body (MBB) phase.</p><p>How MCCs control the final number of centrioles generated remains an open question. Centriole number scales with apical surface area in multiciliated mTECs and <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nanjundappa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulkarni et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, mechanical stretching forces help couple centriole number with MCC apical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulkarni et al., 2021</xref>). However, while mouse MCCs amplify centrioles in a single round of centriole biogenesis, <italic>Xenopus</italic> epidermal MCCs produce centrioles in two distinct waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Jord et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulkarni et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it remains to be established whether similar or distinct mechanisms operate to set centriole numbers in mammalian MCCs.</p><p>Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is the master regulator of centriole biogenesis and is required for centriole assembly in all cycling mammalian cell types studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Habedanck et al., 2005</xref>). During centriole duplication, CEP152 and CEP192 recruit PLK4 to the surface of the parent centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cizmecioglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hatch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sonnen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2014</xref>). PLK4 kinase activity directs the assembly of STIL and SAS6 into a central cartwheel that provides the structural foundation for the new procentriole, and inhibition of PLK4 activity blocks centriole assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dzhindzhev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kratz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moyer et al., 2015</xref>). PLK4 is recruited to the surface of both parent centrioles and deuterosomes in MCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nanjundappa et al., 2019</xref>). However, recent work has shown that inhibiting PLK4 kinase activity with the ATP-competitive small molecule centrinone has no impact on centriole amplification in mouse multiciliated ependymal cells or mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nanjundappa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, shRNA-mediated depletion of PLK4 modestly delays centriole assembly in mTECs but does not reduce the final number of centrioles produced or the fraction of cells forming motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nanjundappa et al., 2019</xref>). These data suggest there are distinct requirements for PLK4 in promoting centriole assembly in cycling cells and differentiating mouse MCCs. However, PLK4 levels are upregulated ~20-fold in differentiating mTECs, and it remains plausible that partial inhibition or depletion of PLK4 is not sufficient to prevent centriole amplification in MCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoh et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we use genetic approaches to define the requirements of PLK4 protein and kinase activity for centriole amplification in MCCs. These genetic tools have the advantage of achieving highly specific and penetrant target engagement. In addition, we investigate the impact of blocking centriole amplification on the differentiation and surface area scaling of MCCs. Our data show that PLK4 protein and kinase activity are required for centriole assembly in mouse MCCs, demonstrating that the early stages of centriole assembly are similar in cycling cells and MCCs. Moreover, we show that centriole amplification drives an increase in apical surface area in airway MCCs, suggesting that increased centriole number is a central driver of surface area scaling in MCCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a conditional loss-of-function allele of PLK4</title><p>To test the requirement of PLK4 for centriole amplification in MCCs, we created mice with exon 5 of the <italic>Plk4</italic> gene flanked by <italic>LoxP</italic> recombination sites (hereafter <italic>Plk4<sup>F</sup></italic> allele).

This suggests that either PLK4 kinase activity is dispensable for centriole amplification in mTECs or centrinone is unable to effectively inhibit PLK4 in this cell type.</p><p>Tracheal epithelial cells express high levels of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Florea et al., 2001</xref>). Given that Pgp efflux pumps confer multidrug resistance, it is plausible that centrinone is actively pumped out of mTECs. To test this, we treated mTECs with 10 μM of centrinone in the presence or absence of the broad-spectrum efflux pump inhibitor Verapamil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellamy, 1996</xref>). While Verapamil alone reduced the percentage of multiciliated mTECs at ALI 7, the number of centrioles produced in multicliated cells was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F, G</xref>). Treatment with 10 μM centrinone and Verapamil reduced the number of centrioles in MCCs to approximately half that observed in cells treated with 10 μM of centrinone alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F, G</xref>). This suggests that drug efflux pumps may serve to reduce the effective intracellular concentration of centrinone in mTECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PLK4 kinase activity is required for centriole assembly in MCCs</title><p>Our experiments with centrinone revealed limitations of using small molecule inhibitors to probe the role of PLK4 kinase activity in MCCs.

In this manuscript, we employed a genetic approach to test the impact of inactivating the <italic>Plk4</italic> gene or kinase activity in differentiating mouse MCCs. Conditional knockout of PLK4 blocked procentriole assembly and multiciliogenesis without preventing MCC differentiation. Although the PLK4 receptor CEP152 was recruited to deuterosomes and parent centrioles in MCCs lacking PLK4, the cartwheel proteins STIL and SAS6 were not, demonstrating that PLK4 plays a crucial role in the earliest stages of centriole amplification in MCCs. These results conflict with prior work that observed a delay in centriole assembly in MCCs that were depleted of PLK4 using an shRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nanjundappa et al., 2019</xref>). The most likely explanation for this discrepancy is that shRNA-mediated depletion of PLK4 failed to achieve a sufficient level of target depletion required to block centriole assembly. Taken together, our data show the centriolar and deuterosomal pathways of centriole biogenesis in MCCs have a striking resemblance to the established centriole assembly pathway of cycling cells.</p><p>While high doses of the PLK4 inhibitor centrinone reduced centriole production in ependymal MCCs, this was not the case in mTECs. Similarly, a previous study also reported that there was no decrease in centriole number in mTECs treated with centrinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nanjundappa et al., 2019</xref>). These data could be interpreted to suggest that PLK4 kinase activity is dispensable for centriole amplification, at least in mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nanjundappa et al., 2019</xref>). However, the doses of centrinone used may not fully inhibit PLK4 activity in mTECs, possibly because of the expression of multidrug-resistant transporters that pump drugs out of tracheal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Florea et al., 2001</xref>). To address this limitation, we developed a strategy to conditionally ablate PLK4 kinase activity using genetic tools that enable specific and more complete PLK4 inhibition. We show that selectively ablating PLK4 kinase activity leads to a failure of centriole amplification in mTECs and ependymal cells, thereby phenocopying the loss of PLK4 protein. MCCs lacking PLK4 kinase activity possessed fewer deuterosomes that were larger in size. Since deuterosomes are unaffected in MCCs lacking PLK4, we speculate that deuterosomes loaded with kinase-inactive PLK4 undergo fusion events that are driven by the self-assembly properties of PLK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montenegro Gouveia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Centriole amplification in MCCs occurs within a cloud of PCM and fibrogranular material. Several centriole components are concentrated within the fibrogranular material, and this has been proposed to facilitate the rapid assembly of centrioles in MCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mercey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). In the absence of PLK4, or the centriole protein SAS4, multiple centriole, PCM, and distal appendage proteins formed large independent assemblies in mTECs. These assemblies were not observed in multiciliated ependymal cells, which produce ~3 times fewer centrioles than mTECs and likely have lower concentrations of centriole proteins. The high abundance of centriole proteins in differentiating mTECs is likely to drive self-interactions that promote the formation of distinct assemblies when centriole amplification is blocked.</p><p>In addition to containing aggregates of centriole proteins, mTECs that fail centriole amplification have a smaller apical surface area. Centriole number has been shown to scale with apical area in multiciliated mTECs and <italic>Xenopus</italic> epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nanjundappa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulkarni et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, it remains unclear exactly how this scaling relationship is established. Our results show that the apical area of mTECs progressively expands during differentiation, but this fails to occur in cells that lack PLK4 or SAS4 and do not undergo centriole amplification. This suggests that centriole amplification is a central driver of surface area expansion in mammalian MCCs. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> epithelial cells, depleting centriole number did not reduce the surface area of MCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulkarni et al., 2021</xref>). However, multiciliated <italic>Xenopus</italic> epithelial cells undergo two waves of centriole amplification that take place before and after radial intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulkarni et al., 2021</xref>). By contrast, mammalian MCCs do not radially intercalate and use a single round of centriole production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al Jord et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that multiple pathways could operate to calibrate centriole numbers with the MCC apical area. Future studies will be required to define how centriole amplification feeds back to tune the apical surface area of mammalian MCCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit polyclonal CEP164</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EMD Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ABE2621</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(IF) use 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse monoclonal acetylated-α-tubulin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">12152</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(IF) use 1:1000, (IHC) use 1:500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rat polyclonal ZO-1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">14-9776-82</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(IF) use 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit polyclonal DEUP1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mercey et al., 2019</xref>.<break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-019-0427-x">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-019-0427-x</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(IF) use 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse monoclonal SAS6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sc-81431</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(IF) use 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit polyclonal PCNT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab4448</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(IF) use 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse monoclonal FOXJ1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">14-9965-82</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(IF) use 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit polyclonal PLK4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moyer et al., 2015</xref>.<break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201502088">https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201502088</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(IF) use 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit polyclonal STIL</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moyer et al., 2015</xref>.<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201502088">https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201502088</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(IF) use 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit polyclonal CEP135</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Homemade, raised against a.a. 649–1140.

After cooling for 20 min, complete polymerization mixture was added to the filters (20% acrylamide, 0.04% bisacrylamide, 7% sodium acrylate, 0.5% TEMED, 0.5% ammonium persulfate, in 1× PBS) and a coverslip was placed on top. Samples were kept on ice for 20 min, and then incubated at RT for 1 hr. One punch was cut from each filter using a 4-mm biopsy puncher. Punches were boiled in SDS buffer (0.2 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, and 5% SDS) for 1 hr. Punches were washed 10× 20 min in PBS at RT. Immunolabeling and expansion of samples was performed as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantification of centriole number in fixed samples</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Ependymal cells</title><p>Regions that contained a high density of MCCs were selected.

In control ependymal cell samples, all MCCs in the disengagement phase of centriole amplification were counted. Cells for which individual centrioles could not be resolved were excluded from our analysis. The CEP135 foci in each cell were quantified using a semi-automated ImageJ macro. A circle was drawn around all CEP135 foci in each cell. A threshold was applied to each image, and CEP135 intensity maxima were identified and counted by ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>mTEC cultures</title><p>Measurements of apical area were made using ImageJ.

At least three fields of view were selected per sample and all DEUP1+ cells were analyzed. PLK4 intensity on deuterosome measurements were made using a semi-automated ImageJ macro. A circle was drawn to encompass all deuterosomes for a given cell. Deuterosomes were identified by DEUP1 signal based on a pre-set threshold which was kept the same throughout all images in a replicate. Signal intensity of PLK4 (raw integrated density) was then measured within the DEUP1 threshold. For a given cell, the background-subtracted intensity within each thresholded region was added together to calculate the total PLK4 intensity on deuterosomes per cell. The SAS6 and STIL intensity measurements were collected in the same way.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantifications of deuterosome number and area</title><p>Quantification of deuterosome number and area was performed using a semi-automated ImageJ macro. Cells were manually segmented and deuterosomes were identified by automated thresholding of the DEUP1 signal. DEUP1 intensity maxima were used to count deuterosome numbers. The area of the thresholded region was divided by the deuterosome number to calculate the average deuterosome area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</title><p>To prepare cells for photobleaching experiments, WT and PLK4 KO mTECs expressing GFP-Centrin were isolated and differentiated as described above. On ALI day 3, the filters with adhered cells were cut out from the transwell insert and inverted onto a glass coverslip with a drop of differentiation media. A plastic ring was placed on top of the filter to keep it in contact with the coverslip. Cells were imaged on a Leica Sp8 inverted microscope using a 63×/1.4 NA objective. An region of interest (ROI) was drawn around all or part of a GFP-Centrin signal at the centrioles or aggregates and photobleached to approximately 80% of the pre-bleach fluorescence intensity with 10 pulses of 488 nm laser light (1039 ms exposure). A Z-series of 13 planes (0.5 μm step size) was acquired immediately before and after bleaching. GFP-Centrin fluorescence intensities within the bleached ROI were measured using ImageJ. The first post-bleach intensity was subtracted from the pre-bleach and post-bleach values and then normalized to give the percentage of the pre-bleach intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software.

key for centriole amplification during differentiation of multiciliated cells (MCCs) has been questioned based on PLK4 chemical inhibition. In this fundamental study, using mouse models engineered to lack PLK4 or PLK4 activity, LoMastro et al., provide exceptional evidence that PLK4 and its activity are essential for centriole amplification in MCCs. Moreover, they show that centriole amplification in MCCs drives expansion of their apical surface. The findings settle the debate whether PLK4 is crucial for centriole amplification in multiciliated cells and will determine how cell biologists and experts interested in multi-ciliogenesis-related pathologies understand this process.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80643.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lüders</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01z1gye03</institution-id><institution>Institute for Research in Biomedicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Garcia-Gonzalo</surname><given-names>Francesc R</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00ha1f767</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas Alberto Sols UAM-CSIC</institution></institution-wrap><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.06.494981">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.06.494981v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Before publication, please revise your manuscript addressing a few points raised by the reviewers.
