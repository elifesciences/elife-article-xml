Primary metabolism can be measured by the universally conserved TOR (Target of Rapamycin) pathway to balance growth and development with the available energy and nutrients. Recent work suggests that plants may measure defense metabolites to potentially provide a strategy ensuring fast reallocation of resources to coordinate plant growth and defense. There is little understanding of mechanisms enabling defense metabolite signaling. To identify mechanisms of defense metabolite signaling, we used glucosinolates, an important class of plant defense metabolites. We report novel signaling properties specific to one distinct glucosinolate, 3-hydroxypropylglucosinolate across plants and fungi. This defense metabolite, or derived compounds, reversibly inhibits root growth and development. 3-hydroxypropylglucosinolate signaling functions via genes in the ancient TOR pathway. If this event is not unique, this raises the possibility that other evolutionarily new plant metabolites may link to ancient signaling pathways.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29353.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants, like all organisms, must invest their resources carefully. Growing new roots or shoots may allow a plant to better exploit its environment. But a plant should never leave itself vulnerable to disease. As such, there must be a balance between allocating resources to growth or to defense.</p><p>Brassicas like cabbage, Brussels sprouts and wasabi use unique compounds called glucosinolates to protect themselves against pests and disease-causing microbes. These same compounds give these vegetables their distinctive flavors, and they are the source of many of the health benefits linked to eating these vegetables. Yet it was not known if glucosinolates could also affect a plant’s growth and development.</p><p>Malinovsky et al. tested a number of purified glucosinolates with the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> and found that one (called 3-hydroxypropylglucosinolate) caused the plants to grow with stunted roots. When 10 other species of plant were grown with this glucosinolate, almost all had shorter-than-normal roots. The effect was not limited to plants; baker’s yeast also grew less when its liquid media contained the plant-derived compound.</p><p>The reason glucosinolates can protect plants against insect pests, provide us with health benefits, and widely inhibit growth is most likely because they have evolved to interact with proteins that are found in many different organisms.Indeed, through experiments with mutant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, Malinovsky et al. revealed that their glucosinolate influences the TOR complex. This complex of proteins works in an ancient and widespread signaling pathway that balances growth and development with the available energy and nutrients in organisms ranging from humans to yeast to plants.</p><p>The TOR complex plays such a vital role in living cells that problems with this complex have been linked to diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Importantly, the chemical structure of this glucosinolate is unlike other compounds that have already been tested against the TOR complex. As such, it is possible that this glucosinolate might lead to new drugs for a range of human diseases. Further, as this compound affects plant growth, it could also act as a starting point for new herbicides.</p><p>Together these findings show how studying molecules made in model organisms and understanding how they function can lead to the identification of new compounds and targets with an unexpectedly wide range of potential uses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>defense metabolism</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>metabolite regulation</kwd><kwd>TOR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001732</institution-id><institution>Danmarks Grundforskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNRF99</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malinovsky</surname><given-names>Frederikke Gro</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomsen</surname><given-names>Marie-Louise F</given-names></name><name><surname>Nintemann</surname><given-names>Sebastian J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bourgine</surname><given-names>Baptiste</given-names></name><name><surname>Burow</surname><given-names>Meike</given-names></name><name><surname>Kliebenstein</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 13391205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kliebenstein</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 1330337</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kliebenstein</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA-D-PLS-7033-H</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kliebenstein</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Young defense metabolites are often believed to be solely outputs but evidence suggests that they can regulate ancient signaling pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Herbivory, pathogen attacks and weather fluctuations are just some of the factors that constantly fluctuate within a plants environment. To optimize fitness under this wide range of conditions, plants utilize numerous internal and external signals and associated signaling networks to plastically control metabolism and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henriques et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith and Stitt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rexin et al., 2015</xref>). This metabolic and developmental plasticity begins at seed germination, where early seedling growth is maintained by heterotrophic metabolism relying solely on nutrients and energy stored in the seed including the embryo. Upon reaching light, the seedling transitions to autotrophy by shifting metabolism to initiate photosynthesis and alters development to maximize photosynthetic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rexin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Galili et al., 2014</xref>). Until light is available, it is vital for the plant to prioritize usage from the maternal energy pool, to ensure the shoot will breach the soil before resources are depleted. Because the time to obtaining light is unpredictable, seedlings that had the ability to measure and accordingly adjust their own metabolism would likely enjoy a selective advantage. In this model, energy availability would an essential cue controlling growth throughout a plant’s life and not solely at early life-stages. On a nearly continuous basis, photo-assimilates, such as glucose and sucrose, are monitored and their internal levels used to determine the growth potential by partitioning just the right amount of sugars between immediate use and storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith and Stitt, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Illustrating the key nature of metabolite measurement within plants is that glucose, is measured by two separate kinase systems that are oppositely repressed and activated to determine the potential growth capacity, SnRKs1 (sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinases 1) and the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sheen, 2014</xref>). SnRKs1s are evolutionarily conserved kinases that are activated when sugars are limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lastdrager et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis) has two catalytic SnRK1-subunits, KIN10 and KIN11 (SNF kinase homolog 10 and 11), that activate vast transcriptional responses to repress energy-consuming processes and promote catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-González, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crozet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-González et al., 2007</xref>). This leads to enhanced survival during periods of energy starvation. Oppositely, the TOR kinase is a central developmental regulator, whose sugar-dependent activity controls a myriad of developmental processes including cell growth, cell-cycle, and cell-wall processes. The TOR pathway functions to modulate growth and metabolism by altering transcription, translation, primary and secondary metabolism, as well as autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sheen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sablowski et al., 2014</xref>). The TOR kinase primarily functions in meristematic regions where it promotes meristem proliferation. Within these cell types, TOR measures the sugar content and if the tissue is low in sugar, TOR halts growth, even overruling hormone signals that would otherwise stimulate growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>). In plants, TOR functions within a conserved complex that includes RAPTOR (regulatory-associated protein of TOR) and LST8 (lethal with sec-13 protein 8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henriques et al., 2014</xref>). RAPTOR likely functions as an essential substrate-recruiting scaffold enabling TOR substrate phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rexin et al., 2015</xref>), and LST8 is a seven WD40 repeats protein with unclear function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moreau et al., 2012</xref>). TOR complex (TORC) activity is positively linked with growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rexin et al., 2015</xref>) as mutants in any component lead to qualitative or quantitative defects in growth and development and even embryo arrest in strong loss-of-function alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Menand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deprost et al., 2005</xref>). Although the energy sensory kinases KIN10/11 and TOR sense opposite energy levels, they govern partially overlapping transcriptional networks, which are intimately connected to glucose-derived energy and metabolite signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sheen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-González et al., 2007</xref>). Having two systems to independently sense sugar shows the importance of measuring internal metabolism. A key pathway controlled by TOR in all eukaryotes is autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu and Bassham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shibutani and Yoshimori, 2014</xref>). In non-stressed conditions, continuous autophagy allows the removal of unwanted cell components like damaged, aggregated or misfolded proteins by vacuolar/lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inoue et al., 2006</xref>). Under low energy conditions, TORC inhibition leads to an induction of autophagy to free up energy and building blocks, through degradation of cytosolic macromolecules and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shibutani and Yoshimori, 2014</xref>). Autophagy-mediated degradation is facilitated by formation of autophagosomes; double membrane structures that enclose cytoplasmic cargo, and delivers it to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shibutani and Yoshimori, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Le Bars et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhuang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In nature, plant plasticity is not only limited to responding to the internal energy status, but to an array of external environmental inputs. The multitude of abiotic and biotic factors that plants continuously face often require choices between contradictory responses, that requires integrating numerous signals across an array of regulatory levels to create the proper answer. For example; plant defense against biotic organisms requires coordination of metabolic flux to defense and development while in continuous interaction with another organisms and the potential for interaction with other organisms. A proper defense response is vital for the plant as a metabolic defense response to one organism can impart an ecological cost by making the plant more sensitive to a different organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Züst et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, a plant must choose the most appropriate defense response for each situation to optimize its fitness and properly coordinate its defense response with growth and development. A key defense mechanism intricately coordinated across development is the synthesis of specific bioactive metabolites that are often produced in discrete tissues at specific times. A current model is that developmental decisions hierarchically regulate defense metabolism with little to no feed-back from defense metabolism to development. However, work on the glucosinolate and phenolic pathways is beginning to suggest that defense metabolites can equally modulate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonawitz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonawitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Francisco et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francisco et al., 2016b</xref>), thus suggesting that development and defense metabolism can directly cross-talk.</p><p>To asses if and how defense metabolites can signal developmental changes, we chose to investigate the glucosinolate (GSL) defense metabolites. The evolution of the core of GSL biosynthesis is relatively young, and specifically modified GSL structures are even more recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sønderby et al., 2010</xref>). There are &gt;120 known GSL structures limited to plants from the <italic>Brassicales</italic> order and some <italic>Euphorbiaceae</italic> family members, with Arabidopsis containing at least 40 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sønderby et al., 2010</xref>). GSLs are amino acid derived defense metabolites that, after conversion to an array of bioactive compounds, provide resistance against a broad suite of biotic attackers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sønderby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lambrix et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kliebenstein et al., 2002</xref>). GSLs not only exhibit a wide structural diversity, but their composition varies depending on environmental stimuli, developmental stage and even across tissues. This, combined with the information-rich side chain, makes GSLs not only an adaptable defense system, but also prime candidates for having distinctive signaling functions. Previous work has suggested that there may be multiple signaling roles within the GSLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Francisco et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francisco et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khokon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bednarek et al., 2009</xref>). Tryptophan-derived indole GSLs or their breakdown products alter defense responses to non-host pathogens illustrated by biosynthetic mutants devoid of indole GSLs being unable to deposit PAMP-induced callose in cell walls via an unknown signal and pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bednarek et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, indole GSL activation products have the ability to directly alter auxin perception by interacting with the TIR1 auxin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katz et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to indole GSLs, mutants in aliphatic GSL accumulation alter flowering time and circadian clock oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kerwin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>). The aliphatic GSL activation product, allyl isothiocyanate can induce stomatal closure but it is unknown if this is specific to allylGSL or a broader GSL property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khokon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>). AllylGSL (other names are 2-propenylGSL and sinigrin) can also alter plant biomass and metabolism in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Francisco et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francisco et al., 2016b</xref>). While these studies have provided hints that the GSL may have signaling potential, there is little understanding of the underlying mechanism or the structural specificity of the signal. To explore whether built-in signaling properties are a common attribute of GSLs, we screened for altered plant growth and development in the presence of specific purified aliphatic GSLs. In particular, we were interested in identifying candidate signals whose activity could ensure fast repartitioning of resources between development and defense. Here we present a novel signaling capacity specific to the aliphatic 3-hydroxypropylglucosinolate (3OHPGSL). Our results suggest that 3OHPGSL signaling involves the universally conserved TOR pathway for growth and development, as mutants in TORC and autophagy pathways alter responsiveness to 3OHPGSL application.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>3ohpgsl inhibits root growth in arabidopsis</title><p>We reasoned that if a GSL can prompt changes in plant growth it is an indication of an inherent signaling capacity. Using purified compounds, we screened for endogenous signaling properties among short-chain methionine-derived aliphatic GSLs by testing their ability to induce visual phenotypic responses in Arabidopsis seedlings. We found that 3OHPGSL causes root meristem inhibition, at concentrations down to 1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The observed response is concentration-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).

We grew the Col-0 reference accession and the <italic>myb28-1 myb29-1</italic> mutant that is devoid of endogenous aliphatic GSLs in the presence and absence of exogenous 3OHPGSL. At day 10, the foliar 3OHPGSL levels were analyzed. Col-0 without treatment had average foliar levels of 3OHPGSL of 3.2 µmol/g and grown on media containing 5 µM, 3OHPGSL contributed an additional 2.2 µmol/g raising the total 3OHPGSL to 5.4 µmol/g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The <italic>myb28-1 myb29-1</italic> mutant had no measurable 3OHPGSL on the control plates and accumulated ~1.4µmol/g upon treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In agreement with the lower foliar 3OHPGSL accumulation in the <italic>myb28-1 myb29-1</italic> mutant background, this double mutant had a lower root growth response to exogenous 3OHPGSL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, this confirms that the level of 3OHPGSL application is within the physiological range.</p><p>We then tested if 3OHPGSL or potential activation products inhibit root growth because of cell death or toxicity. The first evidence against toxicity came from the observation that even during prolonged exposures, up to 14 days of length, Col-0 seedlings continued being vital and green (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). If there was toxicity the seedlings would be expected to senesce and die. We next tested if the strong root growth inhibition by 50 µM 3OHPGSL is reversible. Importantly, root inhibition is reversible, as the 3OHPGSL-mediated root stunting could be switched on and off by transfer between control media and media containing 3OHPGSL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Based on the toxicity and GSL assays, we conclude that the 3OHPGSL treatments are at reasonable levels compared to normal Arabidopsis physiology, and that the phenotypic responses we observed were not caused by flooding the system with 3OHPGSL or toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Root inhibition is specific to 3OHPGSL</title><p>To evaluate whether 3OHPGSL mediated root inhibition is a general GSL effect or if it is structurally specific to 3OHPGSL, we tested if aliphatic GSLs with similar side-chain lengths, but different chain modifications, would induce similar root growth effects. First, we assessed 3-methylsulfinyl-propyl (3MSP) GSL, the precursor of 3OHPGSL, and the alkenyl-modified three carbon glucosinolate allyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast to 3OHPGSL, neither of these structurally related GSLs possessed similar root-inhibiting activities within the tested concentration range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). We also analyzed the potential root inhibition for the one carbon longer C4-GSLs 4-methylsulfinylbutyl (4MSB) and but-3-enyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Neither of these compounds could inhibit root growth at the tested concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). There is no viable commercial, synthetic or natural source for the 4-hydroxybutyl GSL which prevented us from testing this compound. To test if the presence of a hydroxyl is essential for this response, we tested if either the R or S form of 2-hydroxybut-3-enylGSL had similar effects. This showed that neither enantiomer was similar to 3OHPGSL and that both actually stimulated root growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) The fact that only 3OHPGSL inhibits root elongation suggests that the core GSL structure (comprised of a sulfate and thioglucose) does not cause the effect. Importantly, this indicates that 3OHPGSL root inhibition is not a generic result of providing extra sulfur or glucose from the GSL core structure to the plant, as these compounds would be equally contributed by the other GSLs. Furthermore, the results confirm that there is no general toxic activity when applying GSLs to Arabidopsis. This evidence argues that the 3OHPGSL root inhibition effect links to the specific 3OHP side chain structure, indicating the presence of a specific molecular target mediating the root inhibition response.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29353.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Root growth is not inhibited by all aliphatic GSLs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway, from the C3 3-methyl-sulphinyl-propyl (3MSP) to the secondary modified 3-hydroxyl-propyl (3OHP) and 2-propenyl (allyl/sinigrin).

Thus, we proceeded to test if mutants in the TOR pathway alter sensitivity to 3OHPGSL. Because TORC activity is sugar responsive, we investigated whether 3OHPGSL application may alter the response to sugar in genotypes with altered TORC activity. We first used the TOR kinase overexpression line GK548 (TORox) because it was the only one of several published TOR overexpression lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deprost et al., 2007</xref>) that behaved as a TOR overexpressor within our conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The active site TOR inhibitors were originally developed for mammalian cells and inhibit root growth in various plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montané and Menand, 2013</xref>). Similar to 3OHPGSL, the active-site TOR inhibitor AZD-8055 (AZD) induces a reversible concentration-dependent root meristem inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montané and Menand, 2013</xref>). By directly comparing 3OHPGSL treatment with known TOR chemical inhibitors in the same system, we can test for interactions between 3OHPGSL and the known TOR inhibitors. An interaction between 3OHPGSL application and a known TOR inhibitor, e.g. an antagonistic relationship, is an indication that the same target is affected. To assess whether interactions between 3OHPGSL and TOR signaling occur, we grew seedlings vertically on media with combinations of 3OHPGSL and AZD and root-phenotyped the plants to compare the effect on root morphology. This identified a significant antagonistic interaction between AZD and 3OHPGSL (3OHP x AZD), both in terms of root length response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and in initiation of the differentiation zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This antagonistic interaction is also supported by the appearance of first root hair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), as the premature initiation of the differentiation zone in the presence of 10 µM 3OHPGSL did not change further upon co-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Together, this suggests that the TOR inhibitor AZD and 3OHPGSL have a target in the same signaling pathway as no additive effect is observed.

The lack of root rounding and root hair inhibition suggest that AZD and 3OHPGSL both target the TOR pathway, but at different positions. Alternatively, the 3OHPGSL may be a more specific TOR inhibitor and the additional AZD phenotypes could be caused by the ATP-competitive inhibitor having alternative targets in plants.

Application of exogenous 3OHPGSL caused reversible root meristem inhibition by morphological reprogramming of the root zones, i.e. dramatically reduced the root meristem size and limited root cell elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This response occurred at levels within the endogenous range and there was no evidence of cell death in any treated root, suggesting that this is not a toxicity response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Additionally, these morphological responses were specific to 3OHPGSL and not caused by any structurally or biosynthetically related GSL, suggesting that these responses were not because of generic properties shared by GSLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Exposing a wide phylogenetic array of plants, including lineages that have never produced GSLs, to 3OHPGSL showed that application of this compound can inhibit growth broadly across the plant kingdom as well as in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests conservation of the downstream signaling pathway across these diverse plant lineages. Equally, if the signaling compound is not 3OHPGSL itself, but a derivative, then the required biosynthetic processes must be conserved. This conservation largely rules out the specific GSL activation pathway controlled by Brassicales specific thioglucosidases, myrosinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barth and Jander, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bones and Rossiter, 2006</xref>). The phylogenetic conservation of the 3OHPGSL response led us to search for a target pathway controlling growth and development that would be evolutionary well conserved between the tested species.</p><p>By comparing the root phenotype identified with 3OHPGSL application to the published literature, we hypothesized that 3OHPGSL treatment may affect TORC, a key primary metabolic sensor that controls growth and development, and is conserved back to the last common eukaryotic ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henriques et al., 2014</xref>). Active site TOR inhibitors inhibit root growth in numerous plant species similar to 3OHPGSL application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montané and Menand, 2013</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that 3OHPGSL may function via TORC. A model with 3OHPGSL affecting TORC would explain how 3OHPGSL can alter root development across the plant kingdom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Mechanistic support for this hypothesis came from a number of avenues. First, 3OHPGSL can block the TOR-mediated sugar activation of arrested meristems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Second, the TORox mutant intensifies 3OHPGSL linked signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and correspondingly loss-of-function mutants of the substrate binding TORC component <italic>raptor2</italic> diminish the 3OHPGSL effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, there are clear phenotypic overlaps between the root phenotypes induced by known TOR inhibitors and 3OHPGSL, e.g. root inhibition, inhibition of cell elongation, and notably the dramatic reduction of the meristem sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Critically, 3OHPGSL and known small-molecule inhibitors of TOR were mutually antagonistic for a number of phenotypes. In pharmacology, the outcomes of a drug combination can either be antagonistic, additive or synergistic, depending on whether the effect is less than, equal to, or greater than the sum of the effects of the two drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jia et al., 2009</xref>). Antagonistic interactions, as observed with 3OHPGSL and AZD, can occur if two drugs exhibit mutual interference against the same target site, or if their targets converge on the same regulatory hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jia et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these lines of evidence suggest that 3OHPGSL or a derived metabolite targets the TOR pathway to alter root meristem development within Arabidopsis and potentially other plant species.</p><p>Extending the analysis to pathways downstream of TORC, showed that loss of ATG5, a vital component of the autophagic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu and Bassham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shibutani and Yoshimori, 2014</xref>), intensifies the 3OHPGSL response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>-DB). This supports the hypothesis that 3OHPGSL signaling proceeds through the TOR complex, but also suggest that this signal requires parts of the autophagic machinery. Loss of another autophagic component, ATG2, did not influence the 3OHP response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>). Together, this raises the possibility that 3OHPGSL influenced responses involve predominantly a micro-autophagy pathway, which is ATG5- but may not be ATG2-dependent, rather than the macro-autophagy pathway that depends upon both genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ryabovol and Minibayeva, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Micro-autophagy removes captured cytoplasmic components directly at the site of the vacuole via tonoplast invagination. The cargo to be degraded ranges from non-selective fractions of the cytoplasm to entire organelles, dependent on the type of micro-autophagy. The two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, and thereby ATG5, have been shown to be involved in several forms of micro-autophagy, such as starvation-induced, non-selective, and glucose-induced selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, micro-autophagy involves vacuolar movement of cargo, and the vacuole is considered the main storage site for glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mikkelsen et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, ATG5 may be responsible for enabling the movement of exogenously applied 3OHPGSL out of the cytoplasm where it or a derivative metabolite could interact with the TORC pathway and into the vacuole. This would decrease the concentration of the 3OHPGSL associated signal and could explain why the <italic>atg5-1</italic> mutant is more sensitive to 3OHPGSL application. Further work is required to test if ATG5 is functioning to attenuate the 3OHPGSL associated signal.</p><p>A conundrum for defense signaling compounds to affect growth is the evolutionary age discrepancy; defense metabolites are typically evolutionarily very young, as they are often species or taxa specific, while growth regulatory pathways are highly conserved across broad sets of plant taxa. This raises the question of which mechanism(s) may allow this connection between young metabolites and old regulatory pathways. This suggests that plants may sense young metabolites using evolutionarily old signaling pathways. Similar evidence is coming from other secondary metabolite systems suggesting that this may be a general phenomenon. For example, an indolic GSL activation product can interact with the conserved <italic>TIR1</italic> auxin receptor to alter auxin sensitivity within Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katz et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, an unknown phenolic metabolite appears to affect regulation of growth and development by influencing the Mediator complex that is conserved across all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonawitz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonawitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2014</xref>); and the plant polyphenol resveratrol directly inhibits the mammalian TOR to induce autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, young plant metabolites can influence evolutionarily conserved pathways. Interestingly, this strongly resembles the action of virulence-associated metabolites within plant pathogens. Pseudomonad bacteria produce the evolutionarily young coronatine that alters the plant defense response by interacting with the conserved JA-Ile receptor COI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xie et al., 1998</xref>). In plant/pathogen interactions, this ability of pathogen-derived metabolites to alter plant defense signaling is evolutionarily beneficial because it boosts the pathogen’s virulence <italic>in planta</italic>. It is less clear if this selective pressure model also applies to plant defense compounds that interact with endogenous signaling pathways. Following the plant/pathogen derived model, it is tempting to assume that such plant defense metabolites have been co-selected on their ability to affect the biotic attacker and simultaneously provide information to the plant. However, an alternative hypothesis that is that these examples may simply be serendipitous cases, where the defense metabolites happened to interact with a pathway and are potentially of no evolutionary benefit. In this model, the plant might still be adapting to the evolution of this new regulatory linkage. In the particular case of 3OHPGSL, the AOP3 enzyme that makes this compound evolved prior to the split between <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> suggesting that these species have had at least several million years/generations of potential to adapt. However, the two hypotheses need to be empirically tested. Central to testing between the two hypotheses is to assess if the observed signaling effects have any fitness benefit for the plant suggesting that even if the connections arose by serendipity that they have been maintained by a selective benefit. This will require field testing the fitness of plants that contrast for the presence of these connections. An alternate way to test between these hypotheses would be to conduct a broad survey of plant metabolites to test how many can affect signaling within the plant. If a large fraction of metabolites have potential signaling function, it is unlikely that all of these are simply serendipitous cases that have not had sufficient time to be removed by natural selection. However; earlier studies have provided evidence that both allyl GSL and the GSL breakdown product indole-3-carbinol affect plant signaling and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Francisco et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Francisco et al., 2016b</xref>). In addition, <italic>R</italic>- and <italic>S</italic>-2-hydroxybut-3-enyl GSL promoted root growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that dual effects of defense metabolites such as 3OHPGSL are possibly more general.</p><p>Within this report, we provided evidence that 3OHPGSL, or derived compounds, appears to function as a natural endogenous TORC inhibitor that can work across plant lineages. This creates a link whereby the plant’s endogenous defense metabolism can simultaneously coordinate with growth. Such a built-in signaling capacity would allow coordination between development and defense, as the plant could use the defense compound itself as a measure of the local progress of any defense response and readjust development and defense to optimize against the preeminent threat. Future work is required to identify the specific molecular interaction that allows this communication to occur, this will help to illuminate how and why plants measure their own defense metabolism to coordinate available resources more broadly with growth. Future work might also ascertain whether there is a broader class of plant produced TOR inhibitors. If this is true, they might be highly useful in understanding TOR function across kingdoms of life and possibly to reveal significant aspects of this universally conserved pathway that may have gone unnoticed in other eukaryotic models.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials</title><p>The genetic background for the Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) mutants and transgenic lines described in this study is the Col-0 accession.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John Pickett (Reviewer #1); Reuben Peters (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their comments with one another and with the Reviewing Editor. The individual reviews are following below. As an outcome of the consultation session, the reviewers and the Reviewing Editor concluded that the additional work requested by reviewer #1, and in particular items 1 and 2, should be included in a revised submission. In addition please consider all other comments to improve the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent piece of work by a highly competent team and in essence provides evidence of a newly observed and unexpected interaction with the pathway TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) which is conserved across the living kingdoms of eukaryotes, and in this work studied for plants and fungi. The work included is extensive and represents an extremely conscientious effort logically to develop arguments for the importance of the discovery. However, although the work stands without question, as offered in this paper, some of the conclusions particularly those relating to the evolutionarily recent signalling role of the particular compound, 3-hydroxypropylglucosinolate (3OHPGSL), observed making this novel interaction, there are further considerations requiring more experimental work that I believe are necessary before such conclusions can be made with confidence. First of all it will be noted that I have run together the name of this compound, which is essential in describing the glucosinolates central to this publication. The particular glucosinolate is not a salt of the 3-hydroxypropyl ion nor is it an ester like molecule as in 3-hydroxypropyl acetate but is a glucosinolate substituted by 3-hydroxypropyl.</p><p>Turning now to the evolutionarily related arguments and conclusions, these may well be correct but, in my view, do not stand without the following considerations and related new experimental work. Because the activity of 3OHPGSL is found beyond the plant order Brassicales then the authors are correct in eliminating the potential role of specific catabolitic enzymes acting on the glucosinolates in generating active species. 1) However, they have not proved satisfactorily that it is the intact 3OHPGSL molecule that has the observed activity. 2) If the study was extended to, for example 2-hydroxy-3-butenylglucosinolate then they would have a glucosinolate example more closely related structurally to 3OHPGSL. Also this would provide an example of a compound similar to 3OHPGSL in that it is potentially capable of undergoing related chemical changes which could take place beyond the Brassicales. 3) A further study, though less essential than 1 and 2, would be to investigate cyanogenic glycocides because these are considered to be the evolutionary ancestors of the glucosinolates. This would set in a more clear perspective the assertions regarding the recent evolution of the glucosinolates</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes the intriguing finding that a specific secondary metabolite, 3-hydroxypropyl glucosinolate (3OHP GSL), can inhibit the universal eukaryotic TOR signaling complex, which the producing plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> appears to have adapted to use as a regulatory measure for balancing growth and development with the available energy and nutrients. The evidence for this use is strong, including identification of the target as TOR itself, and the authors have further investigated the downstream signaling pathway and effect, which appear to act on autophagy. However, it is less clear that this is a generalizable regulatory mechanism, which the authors suggest might be the case. Although softened to some extent with appropriate caveats within the Discussion, this is perhaps oversold in the Abstract. One issue that is perhaps not fully discussed is the uncertain means by which <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has adapted to this effect. The generality of the effect of 3OHP GSL on TOR signaling in other, non-producing plants, as well as yeast, demonstrate that TOR itself is conserved. Moreover, given the similar phenotypic effect of 3OHP GSL on other plant species, it is not entirely clear how much adaptation has actually occurred versus selection for (or at least a lack of selection against) the (apparently) serendipitous TOR inhibition exhibited by this natural product. It would be helpful if the authors include some discussion of this point, as well as be a bit more realistic about the use of evolutionary young defense metabolites as regulators, which seems almost certain to require presumably serendipitous activity against already extant signaling pathways (although another possibility is that this activity is related to their defensive role, which would require proof of greater activity against the 'target' versus 'native producer' organism). It seems likely that the controls included application of the carrier solution, but this is not immediately evident in the Materials and methods description, and needs to be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29353.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their comments with one another and with the Reviewing Editor.

As suggested by the reviewers, we have conducted separate experiments with the R and S enantiomers of 2hydroxy-but-3-enylglucosinolate. These showed that neither compound has a similar repressive effect on root elongation and if anything have a stimulatory effect on root elongation. As such, we can conclude that it is not the simple presence of a hydroxyl moiety that leads to the activity.</p><p>We believe that these new experiments help to refine the potential bioactive component but agree that we have not absolutely proven that it is the 3-hydroxybutylglucosinolate that is mediating the final signal transduction. We were very careful not to make this claim. This is especially the case, because the only way to provide this evidence is to identify the RNA or protein with which the metabolite interacts to stimulate the signal transduction. For example, it was not until the COI1/JAZ/JA-ILE structure was identified that it was absolutely clear that JA-Ile and not JA or Me-JA is the signal. Similarly, it was cloning of the TIR1/AFB genes that showed why most short acetic acids produce auxin like activities because the TIR1/AFB receptors appear to have different binding affinity. We agree that it is important to find the receptor molecule but feel that it took decades to find the receptor for JA, SA, Auxin, etc. and that this is beyond the scope of a single paper. To recognize this, we had taken great care in commenting that 3-hydroxybutylglucosinolate can stimulate the response but may not be the bioactive metabolite. We hope that this is acceptable and that the reviewers and editors agree that showing that a glucosinolate leads to altered development via an unknown interaction with the TOR pathway is sufficiently novel to merit inclusion in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is an excellent piece of work by a highly competent team and in essence provides evidence of a newly observed and unexpected interaction with the pathway TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) which is conserved across the living kingdoms of eukaryotes, and in this work studied for plants and fungi. The work included is extensive and represents an extremely conscientious effort logically to develop arguments for the importance of the discovery. However, although the work stands without question, as offered in this paper, some of the conclusions particularly those relating to the evolutionarily recent signalling role of the particular compound, 3-hydroxypropylglucosinolate (3OHPGSL), observed making this novel interaction, there are further considerations requiring more experimental work that I believe are necessary before such conclusions can be made with confidence. First of all it will be noted that I have run together the name of this compound, which is essential in describing the glucosinolates central to this publication. The particular glucosinolate is not a salt of the 3-hydroxypropyl ion nor is it an ester like molecule as in 3-hydroxypropyl acetate but is a glucosinolate substituted by 3-hydroxypropyl.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for having utilized an adaptation of the spelling to try and make the compounds more approachable for non-biochemical specialists. We have previously noticed that molecular/mechanistic audiences have trouble with the name when merged into a single word. We have changed all the spellings back.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Turning now to the evolutionarily related arguments and conclusions, these may well be correct but, in my view, do not stand without the following considerations and related new experimental work. Because the activity of 3OHPGSL is found beyond the plant order Brassicales then the authors are correct in eliminating the potential role of specific catabolitic enzymes acting on the glucosinolates in generating active species. 1) However, they have not proved satisfactorily that it is the intact 3OHPGSL molecule that has the observed activity. 2) If the study was extended to, for example 2-hydroxy-3-butenylglucosinolate then they would have a glucosinolate example more closely related structurally to 3OHPGSL. Also this would provide an example of a compound similar to 3OHPGSL in that it is potentially capable of undergoing related chemical changes which could take place beyond the Brassicales.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response above describing our new experiments that have been conducted per this request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A further study, though less essential than 1 and 2, would be to investigate cyanogenic glycocides because these are considered to be the evolutionary ancestors of the glucosinolates. This would set in a more clear perspective the assertions regarding the recent evolution of the glucosinolates</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the cyanogenic glucoside enzymes are the evolutionary precursors for the enzymes in glucosinolate production. However, as we have shown with the glucosinolates, it is not all glucosinolates that have this property but a limited structure. As cyanogenic glucosides do not have the sulfate, thioglucose or ability to make thio/isothiocyanates, we are unsure of a cyanogenic glucoside that would have similar structural properties or potential to the 3OHP GLS. The commercially available cyanogenic glucosides are structurally very different and as such we do not feel a comparison would be illuminating for this specific mechanism. It would however be very interesting to take all available cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates and feed them to plants to assess how many have potential signaling capacities and what traits they affect. We feel that this is beyond the scope of this manuscript however.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript describes the intriguing finding that a specific secondary metabolite, 3-hydroxypropyl glucosinolate (3OHP GSL), can inhibit the universal eukaryotic TOR signaling complex, which the producing plant Arabidopsis thaliana appears to have adapted to use as a regulatory measure for balancing growth and development with the available energy and nutrients. The evidence for this use is strong, including identification of the target as TOR itself, and the authors have further investigated the downstream signaling pathway and effect, which appear to act on autophagy. However, it is less clear that this is a generalizable regulatory mechanism, which the authors suggest might be the case. Although softened to some extent with appropriate caveats within the Discussion, this is perhaps oversold in the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, we had not meant that the specific mechanism we identified 3OHP/TOR is generalizable but instead what may be generalizable is that secondary metabolites can have unrecognized regulatory properties. We quite agree that 3OHP/TOR is likely not generalizable in its specific context. We apologize for the misleading phrasing and have worked to make it clearer in the revised manuscript that it is the broader concept rather than this specific interaction that we believe is generalizable. This includes removing the idea that these would all be linked to optimization of energy usage. We realized after the reviewer’s comment that this was an over-extension of what we had intended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One issue that is perhaps not fully discussed is the uncertain means by which A. thaliana has adapted to this effect. The generality of the effect of 3OHP GSL on TOR signaling in other, non-producing plants, as well as yeast, demonstrate that TOR itself is conserved. Moreover, given the similar phenotypic effect of 3OHP GSL on other plant species, it is not entirely clear how much adaptation has actually occurred versus selection for (or at least a lack of selection against) the (apparently) serendipitous TOR inhibition exhibited by this natural product. It would be helpful if the authors include some discussion of this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the conservation of the growth to 3OHP effect shows that TOR is conserved but we do feel that this helps to support that a conserved system like TOR is the system mediating this response to this compound (or a derived compound). We agree that it is not presently clear where selection/adaptation in Arabidopsis or any other plant may be in regards to responding to this serendipitous activity. To clarify we have boosted this section of the Discussion by commenting that a closely related Arabidopsis (<italic>A. lyrata</italic>) also has this compound suggesting that the responsible biosynthetic enzyme (AOP3) evolved in the last several million years. Further, in the revised section we now mention that we presently do not have evidence on what may be the benefit/detriment to the plant in having this 3OHP/TOR linkage. To obtain this knowledge will require identification of the putative receptor and conducting field trials to assess the consequences on the wild plant. We do have evidence of natural variation in Arabidopsis for the response to this compound and have noted this in the discussion but feel that including this data is beyond the focused scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As well as be a bit more realistic about the use of evolutionary young defense metabolites as regulators, which seems almost certain to require presumably serendipitous activity against already extant signaling pathways (although another possibility is that this activity is related to their defensive role, which would require proof of greater activity against the 'target' versus 'native producer' organism).</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that serendipity is likely a core requirement of this model. We have therefore worked to improve the text where we were attempting to make this point to enhance the clarity. We are very hesitant to propose any defensive role for this interaction as we have no evidence of the compound being exuded into the rhizosphere. As this is serendipity, there may not have been enough time to evolve a defensive role for this property.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems likely that the controls included application of the carrier solution, but this is not immediately evident in the Materials and methods description, and needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct and we have adjusted the Materials and methods to clarify the treatment plates were created by adding a concentrated sterile solution of 3OHPGSL in water to the agar post-sterilization to create media with the necessary concentration. The same methodology was used for the tests with the other GSLs tested. Control plates were created by adding the water to the control plates to replicate the process.</p></body></sub-article></article>
