Here we consider the potential for RNA-guided gene drives based on the CRISPR nuclease Cas9 to serve as a general method for spreading altered traits through wild populations over many generations. We detail likely capabilities, discuss limitations, and provide novel precautionary strategies to control the spread of gene drives and reverse genomic changes. The ability to edit populations of sexual species would offer substantial benefits to humanity and the environment. For example, RNA-guided gene drives could potentially prevent the spread of disease, support agriculture by reversing pesticide and herbicide resistance in insects and weeds, and control damaging invasive species. However, the possibility of unwanted ecological effects and near-certainty of spread across political borders demand careful assessment of each potential application. We call for thoughtful, inclusive, and well-informed public discussions to explore the responsible use of this currently theoretical technology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03401.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03401.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>gene drive</kwd><kwd>ecological engineering</kwd><kwd>population engineering</kwd><kwd>cas9</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>emerging technology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Technology Development Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esvelt</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Synthetic Biology Platform funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esvelt</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name><name><surname>Smidler</surname><given-names>Andrea L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing with gene drives may enable scientists to reversibly edit the genomes of diverse wild populations, an advance that could help eliminate diseases, support sustainable agriculture, and control invasive species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite numerous advances, the field of molecular biology has often struggled to address key biological problems affecting public health and the environment. Until recently, editing the genomes of even model organisms has been difficult. Moreover, altered traits typically reduce evolutionary fitness and are consequently eliminated by natural selection. This restriction has profoundly limited our ability to alter ecosystems through molecular biology.</p><p>If we could develop a general method of ensuring that engineered traits would instead be favored by natural selection, then those traits could spread to most members of wild populations over many generations. This capability would allow us to address several major world problems, including the spread of insect-borne diseases, the rise of pesticide and herbicide resistance, and the agricultural and environmental damage wrought by invasive species.</p><p>Scientists have long known of naturally occurring selfish genetic elements that can increase the odds that they will be inherited. This advantage allows them to spread through populations even if they reduce the fitness of individual organisms. Many researchers have suggested that these elements might serve as the basis for ‘gene drives’ capable of spreading engineered traits through wild populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Craig et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wood et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sinkins and Gould, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burt and Trivers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alphey, 2014</xref>). Austin Burt was the first to propose gene drives based on site-specific ‘homing’ endonuclease genes over a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burt, 2003</xref>). These genes bias inheritance by cutting the homologous chromosome, inducing the cell to copy them when it repairs the break. Several efforts have focused on the possibility of using gene drives targeting mosquitoes to block malaria transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Scott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Windbichler et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Galizi et al., 2014</xref>). However, development has been hindered by the difficulty of engineering homing endonucleases to cut new target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Thyme et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>). Attempts to build gene drives with more easily retargeted zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs suffered from instability due to the repetitive nature of the genes encoding them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Simoni et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The recent discovery and development of the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease has dramatically enhanced our ability to engineer the genomes of diverse species. Originally isolated from ‘CRISPR’ acquired immune systems in bacteria, Cas9 is a non-repetitive enzyme that can be directed to cut almost any DNA sequence by simply expressing a ‘guide RNA’ containing that same sequence. In little more than a year following the first demonstrations in human cells, it has enabled gene insertion, deletion, and replacement in many different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">DiCarlo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Friedland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gratz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jiang et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Jinek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Li et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mali et al., 2013c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Upadhyay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wang et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>Building RNA-guided gene drives based on the Cas9 nuclease is a logical way to overcome the targeting and stability problems hindering gene drive development. Less obvious is the extent to which the unique properties of Cas9 are well-suited to overcoming other molecular and evolutionary challenges inherent to the construction of safe and functional gene drives.</p><p>We submit that Cas9 is highly likely to enable scientists to construct efficient RNA-guided gene drives not only in mosquitoes, but in many other species. In addition to altering populations of insects to prevent them from spreading disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Curtis, 1968</xref>), this advance would represent an entirely new approach to ecological engineering with many potential applications relevant to human health, agriculture, biodiversity, and ecological science.</p><p>The first technical descriptions of endonuclease gene drives were provided by Austin Burt in his landmark proposal to engineer wild populations more than a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burt, 2003</xref>). Any of the rapidly expanding number of laboratories with expertise in Cas9-mediated genome engineering could attempt to build a gene drive by substituting Cas9 for the homing endonucleases described in his proposal. Indeed, the well-recognized potential for gene drives to combat vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue virtually ensures that this strategy will eventually be attempted in mosquitoes.</p><p>While considerable scholarship has been devoted to the question of how gene drives might be safely utilized in mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Scott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Touré et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedict et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Marshall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">UNEP, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Reeves et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">David et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alphey, 2014</xref>), few if any studies have examined the potential ecological effects of gene drives in other species. After all, constructing a drive to spread a particular genomic alteration in a given species was simply not feasible with earlier genome editing methods. Disconcertingly, several published gene drive architectures could lead to extinction or other hazardous consequences if applied to sensitive species, demonstrating an urgent need for improved methods of controlling these elements. After consulting with experts in many fields as well as concerned environmental organizations, we are confident that the responsible development of RNA-guided gene drive technology is best served by full transparency and early engagement with the public.</p><p>Here we provide brief overviews of gene drives and Cas9-mediated genome engineering, detail the mechanistic reasons that RNA-guided gene drives are likely to be effective in many species, and outline probable capabilities and limitations. We further propose novel gene drive architectures that may substantially improve our control over gene drives and their effects, discuss possible applications, and suggest guidelines for the safe development and evaluation of this promising but as yet unrealized technology.

The copying process is termed ‘homing’, while the endonuclease-containing cassette that is copied is referred to as a ‘gene drive’ or simply a ‘drive’. Because copying causes the fraction of offspring that inherit the cassette to be greater than 1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), these genes can drive through a population even if they reduce the reproductive fitness of the individual organisms that carry them. Over many generations, this self-sustaining process can theoretically allow a gene drive to spread from a small number of individuals until it is present in all members of a population.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03401.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The spread of endonuclease gene drives.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) When an organism carrying an endonuclease gene drive (blue) mates with a wild-type organism (grey), the gene drive is preferentially inherited by all offspring.

(<bold>B</bold>) Endonuclease gene drives are preferentially inherited because the endonuclease cuts the homologous wild-type chromosome. When the cell repairs the break using homologous recombination, it must use the gene drive chromosome as a repair template, thereby copying the drive onto the wild-type chromosome. If the endonuclease fails to cut or the cell uses the competing non-homologous end-joining repair pathway, the drive is not copied, so efficient gene drives must reliably cut when homology-directed repair is most likely.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03401.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03401.002</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03401-fig1-v3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Engineered gene drives</title><p>To build an endonuclease gene drive, an endonuclease transgene must be inserted in place of a natural sequence that it can cut.

Austin Burt outlined an elegant strategy involving the use of gene drives to disrupt genes that cause infertility or lethality only when both copies are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burt, 2003</xref>). These ‘genetic load’ drives would spread rapidly through minimally impaired heterozygotes when rare, and eventually cause the population to crash or even become extinct due to the accumulated load of recessive mutations. A second approach would mimic naturally occurring ‘meiotic’ or ‘gametic’ drives that bias the sex ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Craig et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hickey and Craig, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hamilton, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Newton et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wood and Newton, 1991</xref>). In this model, the Y chromosome (or its equivalent in other sex-determination systems) would encode an endonuclease that cuts and destroys the X chromosome during male meiosis, thereby ensuring that most viable sperm contain a Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Newton et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wood and Newton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Windbichler et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Galizi et al., 2014</xref>).

Most eukaryotic genome engineering over the past decade was accomplished using zinc-finger nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Urnov et al., 2005</xref>) or TALENs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christian et al., 2010</xref>), both of which are modular proteins that can be redesigned or evolved to target new sequences, albeit only by specialist laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Esvelt and Wang, 2013</xref>). Genome editing was democratized by the discovery and adaptation of Cas9, an enzyme that can be programmed to cut target DNA sequences specified by a guiding RNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deltcheva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Jinek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mali et al., 2013c</xref>).</p><p>Cas9 is a component of Type II CRISPR acquired immune systems in bacteria, which allow cells to ‘remember’ the sequences of previously encountered viral genomes and protect themselves by recognizing and cutting those sequences if encountered again. They accomplish this by incorporating DNA fragments into a memory element, transcribing it to produce RNAs with the same sequence, and directing Cas9 to cut any matching DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deltcheva et al., 2011</xref>). The only restriction is that Cas9 will only cut target ‘protospacer’ sequences that are flanked by a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) at the 3′ end. The most commonly used Cas9 ortholog has a PAM with only two required bases (NGG) and therefore can cut protospacers found approximately every 8 base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, it is possible to direct Cas9 to cut a specific protospacer in the genome using only a single guide RNA (sgRNA) less than 100 base pairs in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>). This guide RNA must begin with a 17-20 base pair ‘spacer’ sequence identical to the targeted protospacer sequence in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fu et al., 2014</xref>). The process of editing a target gene involves choosing protospacers within the gene, building one or more guide RNAs with matching spacers, and delivering Cas9, guide RNAs, and an edited repair template lacking those protospacers into the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03401.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>RNA-guided genome editing via Cas9.</title><p>The Cas9 nuclease protein and guide RNA must first be delivered into the target cell. This is often accomplished by transfecting DNA expression plasmids, but delivering RNA is also effective. The guide RNA directs Cas9 to bind target DNA ‘protospacer’ sequences that match the ‘spacer’ sequence within the guide RNA. Protospacers must be flanked by an appropriate protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), which is NGG for the most commonly used Cas9 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>). If the spacer and protospacer are identical or have only a few mismatches at the 5′ end of the spacer, Cas9 will cut both strands of DNA, creating a blunt-ended double-strand break. If supplied with a repair template containing the desired changes and homology to the sequences on either side of the break, the cell may use homologous recombination to repair the break by incorporating the repair template into the chromosome. Otherwise, the break will be repaired by non-homologous end-joining, resulting in gene disruption. Cas9 cutting is efficient enough to alter both chromosomes at the same time and/or to edit multiple genes at once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>).

Learning how to insert a drive into the germline and optimize its function in each new species will likely require months to years depending on generation length, with subsequent drives in the same species taking less time. Because inserting the drive into the germline with Cas9 involves the same molecular copying process as the drive itself will utilize, successful insertion may produce a working if not particularly efficient RNA-guided gene drive. But if population-level engineering is to become a reality, all molecular factors relevant to homing – cutting, specificity, copying, and evolutionary robustness – must be considered. Below, we provide a detailed technical analysis of the extent to which Cas9 can address each of these challenges. Capabilities, limitations, control strategies, and possible applications are discussed in subsequent sections.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cutting</title><p>The first requirement for every endonuclease gene drive is to cut the target sequence. Incomplete cutting was a problem for the homing endonuclease drive constructed in transgenic mosquitoes (72% cutting) and also for the homing endonuclease, zinc-finger nuclease, and TALEN drives in fruit flies (37%, 86%, and 70% cutting) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Windbichler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Simoni et al., 2014</xref>). The simplest way to increase cutting is to target multiple adjacent sequences. However, this is impractical for homing endonucleases and quite difficult for zinc-finger nucleases and TALENs, as each additional sequence requires a new nuclease protein to be engineered or evolved and then co-expressed.</p><p>In contrast, the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease can be readily directed to cleave additional sequences by expressing additional guide RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The sequences of these additional guide RNAs can be altered so as to avoid creating unstable repeats within the drive cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nishimasu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Simoni et al., 2014</xref>). Including more guides has been demonstrated to improve upon already high rates of cutting. For example, fruit flies expressing both Cas9 and guide RNAs in their germline exhibited target cutting rates exceeding 85–99% in males for four out of six tested guide RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kondo and Ueda, 2013</xref>). The two least effective guide RNAs individually cut at rates exceeding 12% and 56%, but exhibited cutting rates above 91% when combined. Using more than two guide RNAs should further enhance cutting. The notable success of Cas9-based genome engineering in many different species, including studies that targeted every gene in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), demonstrates that most sequences can be efficiently targeted independent of species and cell type. Thus, RNA-guided gene drives should be capable of efficiently cutting any given gene.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03401.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Technical advantages of RNA-guided gene drives.</title><p>Clockwise from lower left: The targeting flexibility of Cas9 permits the exclusive selection of target sequences with few potential off-targets in the genome. Targeting multiple sites increases the cutting frequency and hinders the evolution of drive resistant alleles, which must accumulate mutations at all of the sites. The Cas9 nuclease is can be quite specific in the sequences that it targets; fruit flies do not exhibit notable fertility or fitness defects resulting from off-target cutting when both Cas9 nuclease and guide RNAs are expressed in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kondo and Ueda, 2013</xref>). Choosing target sites with few or no close relatives in the genome, using truncated guide RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fu et al., 2014</xref>), employing paired Cas9 nickases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mali et al., 2013a</xref>) instead of nucleases, or utilizing Cas9-FokI fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Guilinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>) can further increase specificity. Several of these strategies can reduce the off-target mutation rate to borderline undetectable levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Guilinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). The frequency at which the drive is correctly copied might be increased by using Cas9 as a transcriptional regulator to activate HR genes and repress NHEJ genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mali et al., 2013a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). By choosing target sites within an essential gene, any non-homologous end-joining event that deletes all of the target sites will cause lethality rather than creating a drive-resistant allele, further increasing the evolutionary robustness of the RNA-guided gene drive.

While the cas9 gene itself has no repeats, recombination between guide RNA cassettes or guide RNA promoters, most commonly the U6 promoter, is a possibility.

Similar alterations could presumably be discovered through experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nishimasu et al., 2014</xref>).

The ideal standard gene drive confers an effective fitness benefit of 100%, as it is transmitted to twice as many progeny with no fitness cost. The fitness of suppression drives is more complicated due to species-specific density and resource-dependence and mating dynamics and must be considered on a case-by-case basis. The most challenging problem at the molecular scale concerns the highly variable rates of homologous recombination (HR) relative to non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) in different species, cell types, and developmental stages. Cas9 cutting should ideally occur during a stage featuring efficient HR and minimal NHEJ to maximize fitness. Within the germline, homologous recombination rates are normally highest in the oocyte because NHEJ is nearly absent in that cell type. As development progresses, the incidence of NHEJ rises sharply even if the HR machinery remains active. For this reason, we anticipate that maternally transmitted drives that both cut and are copied into the paternal chromosome in the zygote will be among the most efficient. Paternally transmitted drives cannot cut the maternal chromosome until they are expressed, which occurs at different times in different species. Those species that initiate transcription comparatively early, such as mice, are likely to be more amenable to gene drives than those that begin late, such as Drosophila. However, this does not necessarily imply that HR occurs at low efficiency in Drosophila embryos; injecting Cas9 and guide RNA-encoding plasmids along with a template to be copied yielded correct insertions in 13/16 embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gratz et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, injecting Cas9 and guide RNAs targeting two genes along with templates for repair into mouse embryos yielded 7/10 pups with the first insertion and 8/10 with the second insertion, with six of those having both; all other mice utilized NHEJ. We suspect that while drive copying rates will be difficult to predict in advance in a given species, any drive constructed with a housekeeping, viral, or strong germline promoter is likely to function reasonably well due to the combination of highly efficient maternal copying and moderate paternal copying in the zygote and early embryo. Germline copying can also occur later in development for standard drives. The difference between achiasmate species with low HR rates during meiosis, at least in males, and chiasmate species is likely to be crucial. The difference is clearly demonstrated by comparing the Anopheles drive, which exhibited 97% HR and a fitness benefit over 50% (25% given its restriction to males) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Windbichler et al., 2011</xref>), to the equivalent Drosophila drive, which exhibited 71% HR and an effective fitness benefit of 32% (54% homing–22% NHEJ; a 16% benefit given its restriction to males) only after extensive optimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2013b</xref>). The latter was improved from an initial construct demonstrating only 35% HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2011</xref>), which is insufficient to generate a fitness benefit if targeting an essential gene and will generate more resistant alleles than copies of the drive if not. Limiting expression to the late germline may be very effective, but early germline or especially oocytic expression may be superior depending on the species. Finally, it may be possible to repress genes required for the competing non-homologous end-joining pathway using Cas9 in order to boost the effective homologous recombination rate in a particular germline stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Genes responsible for homologous recombination might be activated in a similar manner. The main question is whether the resulting changes in protein abundance will occur quickly enough to influence drive copying.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03401.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03401.008</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03401-fig4-figsupp3-v3"/></fig></fig-group></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Specificity</title><p>Because cutting other sites in the genome may seriously compromise the fitness of the organism, the second requirement is to avoid cutting non-targeted sequences.</p><p>While several studies have reported that Cas9 is prone to cutting off-target sequences that are closely related to the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mali et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pattanayak et al., 2013</xref>), more recent developments and strategies designed to improve specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mali et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Guilinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>) have demonstrated that the off-target rate can be reduced to nearly undetectable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Organisms with larger genomes may require more careful target site selection due to the increased number of potential off-target sequences present.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Copying</title><p>The third and most challenging requirement involves ensuring that the cut sequence is repaired using homologous recombination (HR) to copy the drive rather than the competing non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). HR rates are known to vary across cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mali et al., 2013c</xref>), developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fiorenza et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Preston et al., 2006</xref>), species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2013b</xref>), and the phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Saleh-Gohari and Helleday, 2004</xref>). For example, the endonuclease gene drive in mosquitoes was correctly copied following ∼97% of cuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Windbichler et al., 2011</xref>), while a similar drive in fruit flies was initially copied only 2% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2011</xref>) and never rose above 78% even with extensive combinatorial optimization of promoter and 3′ untranslated region. This difference is presumably due to a lower rate of HR in fruit fly spermatocytes relative to mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2013b</xref>). Ideally, drives should be activated only in germline cells at developmental stages with a high rate of HR, but this may be challenging in many species.</p><p>Copying efficiencies may also depend on whether the cut produces 5′-overhangs, 3′-overhangs, or blunt ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kuhar et al., 2014</xref>). Because Cas9 nickases can generate either overhang type while Cas9 nucleases produce blunt ends, the enzyme can be adapted to the needs of the cell type and organism.</p><p>The ability to regulate gene expression with Cas9 might be used to temporarily increase the rate of homologous recombination while the drive is active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For instance, the Cas9 nuclease involved in cutting might simultaneously repress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>) genes involved in NHEJ and therefore increase the frequency of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bozas et al., 2009</xref>) if supplied with a shortened guide RNA that directs it to bind and block transcription but not cut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bikard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, an orthogonal nuclease-null Cas9 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Esvelt et al., 2013</xref>) encoded within the drive cassette could repress NHEJ genes and activate HR genes before activating the Cas9 nuclease. Lastly, Cas9 might be used directly recruit key HR-directing proteins to the cut sites, potentially biasing repair towards that pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Evolutionary stability</title><p>Even a perfectly efficient endonuclease gene drive is vulnerable to the evolution of drive resistance in the population. Whenever a cut is repaired using the NHEJ pathway, the result is typically a drive-resistant allele with insertions or deletions in the target sequence that prevent it from being cut by the endonuclease. Natural sequence polymorphisms in the population could also prevent cutting. These alleles will typically increase in abundance and eventually eliminate the drive because most drives – like most transgenes – are likely to slightly reduce the fitness of the organism. A second path to gene drive resistance would involve the target organism evolving a method of specifically inhibiting the drive endonuclease.</p><p>The best defense against previously existing or recently evolved drive-resistant alleles is to target multiple sites. Because mutations in target sites are evolutionarily favored only when they survive confrontation with the gene drive, using many target sites can render it statistically improbable for any one allele to survive long enough to accumulate mutations at all of the sites so long as cutting rates are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burt, 2003</xref>). However, very large populations – such as those of some insects – might require unfeasibly large numbers of guide RNAs to prevent resistance. In these cases it may be necessary to release several successive gene drives, each targeting multiple sites, to overcome resistant alleles as they emerge. From an evolutionary perspective, the ability to preclude resistance by targeting multiple sites is the single greatest advantage of RNA-guided gene drives.</p><p>We propose to extend this strategy by preferentially targeting multiple sites within the 3′ ends of genes important for fitness such that any repair event that deletes all of the target sites creates a deleterious allele that cannot compete with the spread of the drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Whenever the drive is copied, the cut gene is replaced with a recoded version flanked by the other components of the drive. Recent work has demonstrated that most genes can be substantially recoded with little effect on organism fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lajoie et al., 2013</xref>); the 3′ untranslated region might be replaced with an equivalent sequence from a related gene. Because there would be no homology between the recoded cut site and the drive components, the drive cassette would always be copied as a unit.</p><p>Relative to drive-resistant alleles, inhibitors of Cas9 are less likely to arise given the historical absence of RNA-guided nucleases from eukaryotes. Any inhibitors that do evolve would presumably target a particular Cas9 protein or guide RNA used in an earlier drive and could be evaded by building future drives using a Cas9 ortholog with a different guide RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Esvelt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fonfara et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively and least likely, organisms might evolve higher RNase activity to preferentially degrade all guide RNAs; this may be difficult to accomplish without harming overall fitness.</p><p>A final evolutionary concern relates to the stability of the gene drive cassette itself. The zinc-finger nuclease and TALEN-based gene drives in fruit flies suffered from recombination between repetitive sequences: only 75% and 40% of each respective drive was sufficiently intact after one copying event to catalyze a second round of copying. Because RNA-guided gene drives will not include such highly repetitive elements, they are likely to be more stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Development time</title><p>RNA-guided genome editing is advancing at a historically unprecedented pace. Because it is now much easier to make transgenic organisms and therefore candidate gene drives, the design-build-test cycle for gene drives will often be limited only by the generation time of the organism in the laboratory. Moreover, many advances from genome engineering can be directly applied to RNA-guided gene drives. For example, all of the methods of increasing Cas9 specificity described above were developed for RNA-guided genome editing in the past 2 years. Future methods of increasing the rate of HR relative to NHEJ would be useful for both technologies. These factors suggest that scientists will enjoy an increasing number of tools well-suited to rapidly building and testing gene drives in addition to those we describe above.</p><p>None of this is to gloss over the many practical difficulties that are likely to arise when constructing a particular gene drive in a given species. Early success is as unlikely as ever when engineering complex biological systems. But if half a dozen or even a dozen design-build-test cycles are sufficient to produce moderately efficient gene drives, many molecular biology laboratories around the world will soon be capable of engineering wild populations.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Box 1. Could gene drives alter human populations?</p><p>Not unless we wait for many centuries. Even in a hypothetical future in which human germline editing was considered safe and ethical, a driven alteration would be only four times as abundant as a non-driven alteration a full century after the birth of an edited human. This assumes future generations would not elect to remove the drive. Whole-genome sequencing - a technology that is available in many modern hospitals and is widely expected to be ubiquitous in the near future - is quite capable of detecting the presence of any gene drive if we decide to look.</p></boxed-text></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Gene drive limitations</title><p>Given their potentially widespread availability, it will be essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental limitations of genetic drive systems.</p><p>First and most important, gene drives require many generations to spread through populations. Once transgenic organisms bearing the gene drive are constructed in the laboratory, they must be released into the wild to mate with wild-type individuals in order to begin the process of spreading the drive through the wild population. The total time required to spread to all members depends on the number of drive-carrying individuals that are released, the generation time of the organism, the efficiency of homing, the impact of the drive on individual fitness, and the dynamics of mating and gene flow in the population, but in general it will take several dozen generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deredec et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Marshall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yahara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deredec et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, drives will spread very quickly in fast-reproducing species but only slowly in long-lived organisms.</p><p>Second, gene drives cannot affect species that exclusively practice asexual reproduction through clonal division or self-fertilization. This category includes all viruses and bacteria as well as most unicellular organisms. Highly efficient standard drives might be able to slowly spread through populations that employ a mix of sexual and asexual reproduction, such as certain plants, but drives intended to suppress the population would presumably force target organisms to reproduce asexually in order to avoid suppression.</p><p>Third, drive-mediated genome alterations are not permanent on an evolutionary timescale. While gene drives can spread traits through populations even if they are costly to each individual organism, harmful traits will eventually be outcompeted by more fit alleles after the drive has gone to fixation. Highly deleterious traits may be eliminated even more quickly, with non-functional versions appearing in large numbers even before the drive and its cargo can spread to all members of the population. Even when the trait is perfectly linked to the drive mechanism, the selection pressure favoring the continued function of Cas9 and the guide RNAs will relax once the drive reaches fixation. Maintaining deleterious traits within a population indefinitely is likely to require scheduled releases of new RNA-guided gene drives to periodically overwrite the broken versions in the environment.</p><p>Fourth, our current knowledge of the risk management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Scott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Touré et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">UNEP, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McGraw and O’Neill, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alphey, 2014</xref>) and containment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedict et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Marshall, 2009</xref>) issues associated with gene drives is largely due to the efforts of researchers focused on mosquito-borne illnesses. Frameworks for evaluating ecological consequences are similarly focused on mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">David et al., 2013</xref>) and the few other organisms for which alternative genetic biocontrol methods have been considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dana et al., 2014</xref>). While these examples provide an invaluable starting point for investigations of RNA-guided gene drives targeting other organisms, studies examining the particular drive, population, and associated ecosystem in question will be needed.</p><boxed-text id="box2"><p>Box 2. Could gene drives alter domesticated animals or crops?</p><p>In theory they could, though probably not without the permission of the farmers, scientists and breeders who typically monitor reproduction. For example, genetic records and artificial insemination are so common among cattle and other domesticated animals that it would be exceedingly difficult for a gene drive to spread through any of these species. Seed farms play a similar role for crops. Long generation times will represent a further barrier for many domesticated species. In general, our expectation is that beneficial applications are more likely to involve the alteration of weeds and insect pest populations rather than the crops themselves.</p></boxed-text></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Safeguards and control strategies</title><p>Given the potential for gene drives to alter entire wild populations and therefore ecosystems, the development of this technology must include robust safeguards and methods of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Oye et al., 2014</xref>). Whereas existing gene drive proposals focus on adding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ito et al., 2002</xref>), disrupting existing genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burt, 2003</xref>), or suppressing populations, RNA-guided gene drives will also be capable of replacing existing sequences with altered versions that have been recoded to remove the sites targeted by the drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We hypothesize that the unique ability of RNA-guided gene drives to target any gene may allow them to control the effects of other gene drives or transgenes.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Reversibility</title><p>RNA-guided gene drives could reverse genome alterations that have already spread through populations. Suppose a given gene drive causes unexpected side-effects or is released without public consent. A ‘reversal’ drive released later could overwrite one or all genomic changes spread by the first drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The new sequence spread by the reversal drive must also be recoded relative to the original to keep the first drive from cutting it, but any amino acid changes introduced by the first drive could be undone. If necessary, a third drive could restore the exact wild-type sequence, leaving only the guide RNAs and the gene encoding Cas9 as signatures of past editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03401.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Methods of reversing, preventing, and controlling the spread and effects of gene drives.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Reversal drives</italic> could correct or reverse genomic alterations made by an earlier drive with unexpected side effects.

Reversal drives could also remove conventionally inserted transgenes that entered wild populations by cross-breeding or natural mutations that spread in response to human-induced selective pressures. However, it is important to note that even if a reversal drive were to reach all members of the population, any ecological changes caused in the interim would not necessarily be reversed.</p><sec id="s5-1"><title>Immunization</title><p>RNA-guided gene drives could be used to block the spread of other gene drives. For example, an ‘immunizing’ drive could prevent a specific unwanted drive from being copied by recoding sequences targeted by the unwanted drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This could be done preemptively or reactively and would spread on a timescale comparable to that of the unwanted drive. A combined ‘immunizing reversal’ drive might spread through both wild-type individuals and those affected by an earlier gene drive, converting both types to a recoded version that could not be invaded by the unwanted drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This may represent the fastest method of neutralizing an already-released drive. As with a standard reversal drive, any ecological changes caused in the interim would not necessarily be reversed.</p></sec><sec id="s5-2"><title>Precisely targeting subpopulations</title><p>RNA-guided gene drives might be confined to a single genetically distinct target species or even a subpopulation by targeting unique genes or sequence polymorphisms. Because these ‘precision drives’ will only cut the unique sequence, they will not be able to spread through non-target populations as long as that sequence is sufficiently distinct. We estimate that either the PAM or at least five base pairs of the spacer must differ within each target site in order to prevent the guide RNAs in the drive from evolving to recognize the equivalent non-target sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mali et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pattanayak et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Populations that are not genetically distinct but experience only intermittent gene flow, such as those on islands, might be given a unique sequence permitting them to be specifically targeted by precision drives later on. For example, releasing Drive A into the island population would recode a target gene, but exhibit no other effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Releasing Drive B, a precision drive which would exclusively spread through Drive A but not the wild-type allele, would similarly replace Drive A with a unique sequence. So long as Drive A does not escape the island before being replaced, the unique sequence in the island population would allow it to be targeted with future precision drives that could not spread through mainland populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5-3"><title>Limiting population suppression</title><p>Population suppression may be one of the most powerful applications of gene drives. The previously described genetic load and sex-biasing drives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burt, 2003</xref>) could potentially lead to extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deredec et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2011</xref>). While this outcome may be necessary to achieve compelling goals such as the eradication of malaria, other situations may call for more refined methods. Here we outline a handful of alternative architectures that would provide greater control over the extent of population suppression.</p><p>Chemical approaches to population control might utilize ‘sensitizing drives’ to render target organisms vulnerable to a particular molecule using one of three strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). First, a sensitizing drive might reverse known mutations that confer resistance to existing pesticides or herbicides. Second, it might carry a prodrug-converting enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schellmann et al., 2010</xref>) that would render a prodrug molecule toxic to organisms that express it. Third, it could swap a conserved gene for a version that is strongly inhibited by a particular small molecule. Because sensitizing drives would have no effect in the absence of their associated molecule – and in some cases vice versa – they could grant very fine control over the geography and extent of population suppression with minimal ecological risk.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03401.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Controlling population suppression.</title><p>Previously proposed genetic load and meiotic suppression drives spread without limit and may incur a substantial risk of extinction. Alternative gene drive types might be used to grant finer control over the extent of suppression. ‘Sensitization drives’ would be harmless save for conferring vulnerability to a particular chemical, which could then be used as a population-specific pesticide. Evolutionarily ‘unstable drives’ would place a limit on the average number of drive copying events and thus the extent of population suppression. ‘Interacting drives’ would initiate suppression only upon encountering a specific genetic signature in the population, in this case a different gene drive. The combination would create a sterile-daughter effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) capable of continuing suppression for several generations. Finally, an immunizing drive could protect a subpopulation from a full genetic load or male-biasing suppression drive employed elsewhere. Interacting drive and immunizing drive approaches would be effective on very large populations spread across substantial geographic areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) while suffering from correspondingly reduced geographic resolution and greater ecological risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Stowaway-mediated gene flow, depicted as a border of Y-Drive-SD framing Eurasia, will result in local population suppression due to the sterile-daughter effect that would remain when the drives interacted, limiting the ability of either population to invade the other. This control process would have to be repeated with new drives once recoded stowaways successfully re-invade the rat-free habitats.

In species with poorly understood genetics, more technically challenging drives may not be an option. While all true drives risk spreading into non-target populations with compatible sequences, the ecological risks to those populations vary. For some drives, a single individual escaping to a non-target population could cause widespread population suppression or even extinction, while others would require multiple sequential escapees of particular drive types. Some drives will be quickly eliminated by natural selection if not continually re-released, others would require a reversal drive to restore the wild-type sequence but should not have any phenotypic effects, and the most aggressive would require a suitable immunizing drive to be released within a certain timeframe in order to prevent a population crash. All of these risks could be mitigated by first recoding the target population to create a unique target sequence using successive standard drives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). ‘Sterile-daughter’ refers to a drive cassette that causes female infertility analogous to Drives AB1 and AB2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; because its fitness will be at most 50% of a standard gene, it cannot exhibit true drive.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03401.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03401.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03401-fig6-figsupp3-v3"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>Temporal approaches to controlling populations would deliberately limit the lifetime of a suppression drive by rendering its effects evolutionarily unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). For example, a male-determining or female-specific sterility gene carried by a standard drive on an autosome would suppress the target population, but the effect would be short-lived because any drive that acquired a loss-of-function mutation in the cargo gene would be strongly favored by natural selection due to its ability to produce fertile female offspring. Notably, turning existing female-specific sterility lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Labbe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alphey, 2014</xref>) into unstable drives may increase their effectiveness. Periodically releasing organisms carrying new unstable drives that are capable of replacing earlier broken versions could extend the suppression effect.</p><p>Genetic approaches to population control might initiate suppression only when two distinct ‘interacting drives’ encounter one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). For example, a cross between standard drives A and B might produce sterile females and fertile males that pass on the ‘sterile-daughter’ trait when crossed with females of any type. Scattering A- and B-carrying individuals throughout an existing population would produce many tiny pockets dominated by either A or B and very few organisms in between due to the infertility of AB females. Because each drive would spread from a small number of initially released individuals scattered over a wide area, this strategy may be capable of large-scale population suppression, but its effectiveness and resolution will depend on the average distance between released A and B individuals. Further suppressing the residual A and B populations could be accomplished by releasing only members of the opposite drive type. Modeling studies will be needed to determine whether this possibility is feasible for different species. Interestingly, the use of this drive type would effectively induce speciation in the affected population.</p><p>Finally, immunizing drives might protect specific subpopulations from the effects of full-scale suppression drives released elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Assuming some degree of gene flow, the immunized population will eventually replace the suppressed population, though this might be delayed if crossing the two drives generates a sterile-daughter effect as described above. Due to the comparatively uncontrolled spread of both drive types through the wild-type population, this method would only be suited to large geographic areas or subpopulations with limited gene flow. For example, immunization might be used to protect the native population of a species while suppressing or eradicating populations on other continents.</p><boxed-text id="box3"><p>Box 3. What types of genes can be edited using gene drives?</p><p>Genes can be edited reliably if they are important to fitness. This is because NHEJ events that create drive-resistant alleles by deleting all the protospacer cut sites will only be harmful if they disrupt the function of important genes. NHEJ events in unimportant genes and sequences will produce drive-resistant alleles lacking the targeted sites. These will spread and interfere with propagation of the drive. As a result, unimportant genes can be reliably disrupted or deleted but not edited.</p><p>Genes that are carried as cargo will not be evolutionarily stable unless they directly contribute to the efficient function of the drive. This limits opportunities to spread transgenes unrelated to drive function, although periodically releasing new drives that overwrite earlier broken versions could potentially maintain functional cargo genes in a large fraction of the population.</p></boxed-text></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Applications of RNA-guided gene drives</title><p>RNA-guided gene drives have the potential to merge the fields of genomic and ecological engineering.

Malaria alone kills over 650,000 people each year, most of them children, while afflicting 200 million more with debilitating fevers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">WHO, 2013</xref>). Dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, Chagas, and Lyme disease are also spread by insects. These afflictions could potentially be controlled or even eradicated by altering vector species to block transmission.

It has been assumed that resistant populations will remain resistant unless the relevant alleles impose a substantial fitness cost in the absence of pesticide or herbicide. We propose that RNA-guided sensitizing drives might replace resistant alleles with their ancestral equivalents to restore vulnerability. For example, sensitizing drives could potentially reverse the mutations allowing the western corn rootworm to resist Bt toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gassmann et al., 2014</xref>) or horseweed and pigweed to resist the herbicide glyphosate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gaines et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ge, 2010</xref>), which is currently essential to more sustainable no-till agriculture. Because these three organisms undergo one generation per year, comparatively large numbers of drive-bearing individuals must be released to quickly exert an effect, but fewer than are already released to control pests using the sterile-insect technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gould and Schliekelman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dyck et al., 2005</xref>). Releases would need to occur in local areas not treated with pesticide or herbicide, which would quickly become reservoirs of sensitizing drives that could spread into adjacent fields. Periodically releasing new drives could potentially allow any given pesticide or herbicide to be utilized indefinitely. Modeling experiments will be needed to evaluate feasibility for different target species.</p><p>A second form of sensitizing drive could potentially render pest populations vulnerable to molecules that never previously affected them. For example, a gene important to fitness might be replaced with a version from another species or laboratory isolate whose function is sensitive to a particular compound. In principle, this approach could eventually lead to the development and use of safer and more species-specific pesticides and herbicides.</p></sec><sec id="s6-3"><title>Controlling invasive species</title><p>One of the most environmentally damaging consequences of global economic activity is the introduction of invasive species, which often cause ecological disruption or even the extinction of native species. Isolated ecosystems such as those on small islands are especially vulnerable. RNA-guided suppression drives might be used to promote biodiversity by controlling or even eradicating invasive species from islands or possibly entire continents. The economics of invasive species control are also compelling: the top ten invasives in the United States cause an estimated $42 billion in damages every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pimentel et al., 2005</xref>). Black and brown rats alone cause $19 billion in damages and may be responsible for more extinctions than any other nonhuman species.</p><p>Deploying RNA-guided suppression drives against invasive species will incur two primary risks related to undesired spread. First, rare mating events may allow the drive to affect closely related species. Using precision drives to target sequences unique to the invasive species could mitigate or eliminate this problem. Second, the suppression drive might spread from the invasive population back into the native habitat, perhaps even through intentional human action.</p><p>Native populations might be protected using an immunizing drive, but doing so would risk transferring immunity back into invasive populations. Instead, we might grant the invasive population a unique sequence with a standard drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), verify that these changes have not spread to the native population, and only then release a suppression drive targeting the recoded sequences while holding an immunizing drive in reserve. Another approach might utilize a sensitizing drive to render all populations newly vulnerable to a specific compound, which could then be used as a pesticide for the local control of invasive populations. All of these possibilities will require modeling and experimentation to establish safety and feasibility before use.</p><p>Most importantly, all decisions involving the use of suppression drives must involve extensive deliberations including but not limited to ecologists and citizens of potentially affected communities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Development and release precautions</title><p>Because any consequences of releasing RNA-guided gene drives into the environment would be shared by the local if not global community, research involving gene drives capable of spreading through wild-type populations should occur only after a careful and fully transparent review process. However, basic research into gene drives and methods of controlling their effects can proceed without risking this type of spread so long as appropriate ecological or molecular containment strategies are employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03401.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Containment strategies and ecological risk.</title><p><italic>Ecological containment</italic> involves building and testing gene drives in geographic areas that do not harbor native populations of the target species. For example, most gene drive studies involving tropical malarial mosquitoes have been conducted in temperate regions in which the mosquitoes cannot survive or find mates. <italic>Molecular containment</italic> ensures that the basic requirements for drive are not met when mated with wild-type organisms. True drives must cut the homologous wild-type sequence and copy both the gene encoding Cas9 and the guide RNAs. Experiments that cut transgenic sequences absent from wild populations and copy either the gene encoding Cas9 or the guide RNAs - but not both - should be quite safe. Ecological or molecular containment should allow basic research into gene drive effectiveness and optimization to be pursued with negligible risk. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> categorizes these and many other possible experiments according to estimated risk.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03401.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03401.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03401-fig8-v3"/></fig><fig id="fig8s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03401.017</object-id><label>Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Estimated ecological risk of experiments during RNA-guided gene drive development.</title><p>This should not be considered an exhaustive list, but includes many relevant experiments that might be performed during the development of an RNA-guided gene drive of any type. The assessment of ecological risk is intended to be a guideline only and will vary with the purpose of the drive. For example, releasing a laboratory-tested ‘neutral’ drive that is intended to cause no changes in organism phenotype beyond spreading its cas9 gene, guide RNAs, and recoded essential gene through the population is listed as a moderate risk because it will certainly edit a wild population, but in a way that is comparatively unlikely to affect its interactions with the ecosystem. Contained field trials of drives that do cause phenotypic changes are listed as moderate-high risk due to the very real possibility of a containment breach and subsequent unintentional population engineering; a standard drive with few or no expected phenotypic effects would represent a moderate risk, while a suppression drive would represent a high risk.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03401.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03401.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03401-fig8-figsupp1-v3"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>A great deal of information on probable ecological outcomes can be obtained without testing or even building replication-competent gene drives. For example, early studies might examine possible ecological effects by performing contained field trials with organisms that have been engineered to contain the desired change but do not possess a functional drive to spread it. Because they do involve transgenic organisms, these experiments are not completely without risk, but such transgenes are unlikely to spread in the absence of a drive.</p><p>We recommend that all laboratories seeking to build standard gene drives capable of spreading through wild populations simultaneously create reversal drives able to restore the original phenotype. Similarly, suppression drives should be constructed in tandem with a corresponding immunizing drive. These precautions would allow the effects of an accidental release to be swiftly if partially counteracted. The prevalence of gene drives in the environment could in principle be monitored by targeted amplification or metagenomic sequencing of environmental samples. Further investigation of possible monitoring strategies will be needed.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Transparency, public discussion, and evaluation</title><p>Technologies with the potential to significantly influence the lives of the general public demand societal review and consent. As self-propagating alterations of wild populations, RNA-guided gene drives will be capable of influencing entire ecosystems for good or for ill. As such, it is imperative that all research in this nascent field operate under conditions of full transparency, including independent scientific assessments of probable impacts and thoughtful, informed, and fully inclusive public discussions.</p><p>The decision of whether or not to utilize a gene drive for a given purpose should be based entirely on the probable benefits and risks of that specific drive. That is, each drive should be judged solely by its potential outcomes, such as its ability to accomplish the intended aims, its probable effects on other species, the risk of spreading into closely related species by rare mating events, and impacts on ecosystems and human societies. As scientists developing these technologies, it will be our responsibility to make all empirical data and predictive models freely available to the public in a transparent and understandable format. Above all else, we must openly share our level of confidence in these assessments as we determine how best to proceed.</p></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The potentially widespread implications of RNA-guided gene drives demand a thoughtful and collected response. Numerous practical difficulties must be overcome before gene drives will be in a position to address any of the suggested applications. Many of our proposals and predictions are likely to fall short simply because biological systems are complex and difficult to engineer. Even so, the current rate of scientific advancement related to Cas9 and the many outcomes accessible using the simplest of gene drives suggest that molecular biologists will soon be able to edit the genomes of wild populations, reverse or update those changes in response to field observations, and perhaps even engage in targeted population suppression.</p><p>What criteria might we use to evaluate an RNA-guided gene drive intended to address a given problem? There are compelling arguments in favor of eliminating insect-borne human diseases, developing and supporting more sustainable agricultural models, and controlling environmentally damaging invasive species. At the same time, there are valid concerns regarding our ability to accurately predict the ecological and human consequences of these interventions. By bringing these possibilities before the scientific community and the public prior to their realization in the laboratory, we hope to initiate transparent, inclusive, and well-informed discussions concerning the responsible evaluation and application of these nascent technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Oye et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the participants of the MIT/Woodrow Wilson Center workshop ‘Creating a Research Agenda for the Ecological Implications of Synthetic Biology’ for sharing their thoughts concerning the potential impacts of this technology on various ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Drinkwater et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is another Senior editor.</p><p>The Reviewing editor, the other reviewers, and the editorial leadership discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission:</p><p>We appreciate that the overall purpose of the article is to alert the scientific community to the new capabilities offered by the CRISPR nuclease Cas 9 RNA-guided gene drives in engineering wild populations. You briefly review the concept of gene drives, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and current research driving advancement of gene drive and CRISPR technologies. Most of the manuscript focuses on “likely capabilities” of Cas9 mediated gene drives, including the theoretical uses for “sensitizing”, “unstable”, “interacting”, and “immunizing” drives. You briefly state that these future applications of Cas9 gene drives are associated with environmental, safety, and security concerns that should be considered before any experimentation is conducted. You conclude that Cas9 RNA-guided gene drives offer new capabilities and applications beyond what is currently available, but the implications for the environment and society as a whole should be considered.

[…] You conclude that Cas9 RNA-guided gene drives offer new capabilities and applications beyond what is currently available, but the implications for the environment and society as a whole should be considered. You do not, however, address any issues concerning a possible deliberately harmful use of the technique; since it does not involve complex technology, there is the possibility that it is applied outside the reaches of governmental or societal regulation</italic>.</p><p>We hope to initiate discussion concerning how this potentially powerful technology can be responsibly developed, evaluated, and used to solve major ecological problems in a way that minimizes the risk of harmful consequences. This latter purpose is best served by ensuring that control measures are developed concomitantly. We consequently devote much of the manuscript to detailing reversal and immunization drives intended to undo earlier genomic changes and protect populations against gene drives. To emphasize the importance of these novel drive architectures in this revision, we have combined the earlier figures describing these drives into a single larger and clearer <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We have also included boxes that explicitly address whether gene drives could be used to alter populations of humans, crops, or domesticated animals. The possibility that unauthorized gene drives might be deliberately misused is more relevant to regulators and consequently is discussed in greater detail in our related manuscript on preparedness and risk governance scheduled for simultaneous publication in <italic>Science</italic>.</p><p><italic>To encourage thoughtful review of the Cas9 technology as it continues to develop and be applied in different ways, you should ensure that your manuscript is clear about which technologies have been developed, which are currently under active investigation, and which are yet to be developed.

While the subject of CRISPR systems and Cas9-mediated genome engineering is large enough for entire review articles, we have done our best to provide a concise but thorough explanation in a new section at the end of the Introduction. We briefly detail Type II CRISPR systems as requested, but devote the bulk of the section to RNA-guided genome editing. We have additionally created a new figure detailing the mechanism of genome editing that emphasizes the similarity of this process to the homing observed in endonuclease gene drives.</p><p><italic>This article will be treated as a Feature article, so it will be clear on both the web and pdf versions that it is not a Research article.

We welcome the chance to emphasize in the article format that this technology remains entirely theoretical, as our intent is to initiate discussion prior to development of this technology in the laboratory. We are grateful to <italic>eLife</italic> for establishing a new section on emerging technologies for this purpose.</p><p>While clarifying public perception is in this case an overriding reason to classify this as a Feature article rather than a Research article, we regret the implication that theoretical analysis does not constitute scientific research. Many of the most respected publications in the history of science consisted entirely of conceptual insights – some of them without any mathematical or computational component.</p><p><italic>Supplementary notes cannot be used in the intended article format. Notes 2 and 4 describe important possible limitations of the technology that should be integrated into the text to ensure that it is understood by the general reader that the technology is not immediately ready for use and may even turn out to be not as powerful as it might seem at present.

Material of concern only to specialists has been transferred to new figure supplements: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> specifically details existing technologies that could be applied to optimize RNA-guided gene drives and notes the challenges involved in doing so.</p><p>We have endeavored to clarify that this technology remains theoretical and our predictions are fallible throughout. Most notably, the last sentence of the Abstract describes the technology as “currently theoretical” and the section “Building Functional Gene Drives” has been prominently renamed “Will RNA-Guided Gene Drives Enable Us to Edit the Genomes of Wild Species?” It goes on to explicitly state that we cannot know for certain until we try. Combined with our cautionary statement in the Conclusion noting that, “Numerous practical difficulties must be overcome before gene drives will be in a position to address any of the suggested applications. Many of our proposals and predictions are likely to fall short simply because biological systems are complex and difficult to engineer...”, we think it unlikely that a reader will come away with a mistaken impression.</p><p><italic>To avoid any possibly distracting discussion around this article, you are asked to be particularly careful with citing previous relevant work when discussing specific issues and ideas</italic>.</p><p>We have endeavored to cite relevant works and additionally mention several major contributors to the field of endonuclease gene drives by name.</p></body></sub-article></article>
