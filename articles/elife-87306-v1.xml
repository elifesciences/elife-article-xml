In mice, fate mapping of the anterior neural plate reveals that the eye field is in rostral regions surrounded anteriorly and laterally by the telencephalic field and caudally and medially by the hypothalamic field, indicating the proximity of their embryonic origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inoue et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequent evagination of the eye field generates bilateral optic vesicles and optic stalks, and the optic stalk connects the optic vesicle to the forebrain. The optic vesicle then invaginates ventrally, resulting in the formation of the double-layered optic cup in which the inner and outer layers develop into the neuroretina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), respectively. The posterior pole of the optic cup forms the optic disc (also known as optic nerve head). In the central neuroretina close to the nascent optic disc, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) start to appear as the optic fissure nearly closes. Early RGC axons find their path toward the optic disc and then enter the optic stalk to reach the brain. Concentrically organized growth-promoting and growth-inhibitory guidance cues around the optic disc regulate RGC axon growth and pathfinding through multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erskine and Herrera, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erskine and Herrera, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oster et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, early eye morphogenesis leads to coordinated specification of the telencephalic, optic stalk, optic disc, and retinal tissues along a spatial axis.</p><p>Early telencephalic and eye development is marked and regulated by a group of tissue-specific transcription factors and signal transduction molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson and Rubenstein, 2000</xref>). In mice, Foxg1 is specifically expressed in the presumptive telencephalon and is essential for the development of the cerebral hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xuan et al., 1995</xref>). Pax6 is specifically expressed in the eye field and is essential for the development of multiple ocular tissues, such as the neuroretina, lens, and RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashery-Padan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bäumer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marquardt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zuber et al., 2003</xref>). Vsx2 and Mitf are specifically expressed in the neuroretina and RPE, respectively, and are essential for retinal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bharti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horsford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rowan et al., 2004</xref>). Pax2 is expressed in the optic stalk, optic vesicles, central neuroretina, and optic disc; Pax2 is essential for optic stalk and nerve development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macdonald et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martinez-Morales et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwarz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Torres et al., 1996</xref>). Fgf8 is specifically expressed at the rostral forebrain at early stages, induces Foxg1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shimamura and Rubenstein, 1997</xref>), and regulates telencephalic patterning in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Storm et al., 2006</xref>). Fgf8 also maintains Pax2 expression in the optic stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Soukkarieh et al., 2007</xref>), and Fgf8 and Fgf3 coordinate the initiation of retinal differentiation in chicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez-Morales et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vogel-Höpker et al., 2000</xref>). Despite these findings in vertebrates, it is unclear how telencephalic and ocular tissues are specified in humans.</p><p>Human organoids are transformative since they enable us to study the mechanisms of cell specification and differentiation directly in human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>). Self-organized three-dimensional (3-D) retinal organoids are originally reported by Sasai’s group and further improved in follow-up studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cowan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fligor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lowe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reichman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>). We and others have demonstrated that 3-D retinal organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) display a stratified structure containing all major types of retinal cells. Although RGCs are differentiated in 3-D retinal organoids, there is no proper RGC axon outgrowth toward the optic disc as seen in vivo since the optic disc-like tissue is missing in 3-D retinal organoids. When these organoids are dissociated into single cells or cut into pieces for adherent culture, RGCs generate neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fligor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teotia et al., 2017</xref>). A variety of brain organoids have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kadoshima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mariani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Velasco et al., 2019</xref>). Although rudimentary ocular tissues are occasionally found in some brain organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gabriel et al., 2021</xref>), optic disc- and stalk-like tissues are absent. Collectively, RGC axon outgrowth and pathfinding directed by optic disc- and stalk-like tissues in organoids have not been reported.</p><p>Tissue patterning and coordinated specification are fundamental for body plan formation in vivo. Remarkably, concentric zones of trophectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Minn et al., 2020</xref>), neural plate and neural plate border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xue et al., 2018</xref>), and ectodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>) are self-organized from single pluripotent stem cells, indicating patterning and coordinated specification of these tissues in vitro. Nevertheless, optic disc and stalk tissues are not reported in any of these structures.</p><p>We hypothesize that coordinated specification from the anterior ectodermal epithelium via morphogen gradients leads to self-organization of telencephalic and ocular tissues, including optic disc- and stalk-like tissues that provide guidance cues for RGC axon growth and pathfinding. In support of this hypothesis, we generated self-formed human telencephalon-eye organoids that comprise <italic>conc</italic>entric zones of anterior <italic>e</italic>ctodermal <italic>p</italic>rogeni<italic>t</italic>ors (CONCEPT), including FOXG1+ telencephalic, PAX2+ VSX2- optic stalk, PAX2+ VSX2+ optic disc, and VSX2+ neuroretinal cells along the center-periphery axis. We call this system as an organoid since it displays a spatially organized structure with cell identities mimicking those tissues in vivo. In CONCEPT organoids, early differentiated RGCs grew their axons toward and then along a path defined by adjacent PAX2+ VSX2+ optic disc cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing of CONCEPT organoids not only confirmed telencephalic and ocular identities but also discovered expression signatures of cell clusters. Additionally, CONCEPT organoids and human fetal retinas had similar expression signatures. Furthermore, PAX2+ VSX2+ optic disc cells differentially expressed FGF8 and FGF9; inhibition of FGF signaling with an FGFR inhibitor during early RGC differentiation drastically decreased the number of RGCs somas and nearly ablated directional axon growth. Using the RGC-specific cell-surface marker CNTN2 identified in our single-cell RNA-sequencing, we developed a one-step method for isolating electrophysiologically-excitable RGCs under a native condition. Our studies provide deeper insight into the coordinated specification of telencephalic and ocular tissues in humans and establish resources for studying neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of telencephalon-eye organoids that are composed of <italic>conc</italic>entric zones of anterior <italic>e</italic>ctodermal <italic>p</italic>rogeni<italic>t</italic>ors (CONCEPT)</title><p>The telencephalon and eye in mammals are originated from adjacent fields at the anterior neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inoue et al., 2000</xref>).

Nevertheless, developmental potentials of cysts have not been characterized.</p><p>Using the cysts, here we generate CONCEPT telencephalon-eye organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Cysts were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lowe et al., 2016</xref>). The epithelial structure of cysts was demonstrated by apical localization of the TJP1::GFP reporter at the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lowe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). To assess developmental potentials of cysts, individual cysts were manually picked and then seeded onto the Matrigel-coated surface at low densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After attaching to the culture surface, cysts grew as dome-shaped individual colonies. Subsequent culture of the colonies in a KSR medium (see Materials and methods) led to the self-formation of concentric zones of anterior ectodermal progenitors: an elevated central zone surrounded by multiple zones. This morphology was identifiable under a stereomicroscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or an inverted microscope. If multiple cysts were fused together or cysts for seeding were too big or small, CONCEPT structures were affected or incomplete.

Self-formation of CONCEPT telencephalon-eye organoids establishes an efficient way to pattern early telencephalic and ocular tissues along a spatial axis. In CONCEPT organoids on days 22–26, FOXG1+ telencephalon, PAX2+ VSX2- optic stalk, PAX2+ VSX2+ optic disc, and VSX2+ neuroretinal tissues are positioned along the center-periphery axis, mimicking the sequence of their spatial positions in E13.5 mouse embryos. Our findings indicate that the formation of telencephalic and retinal tissues are highly coordinated, consistent with the prosomere model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martínez-Morales et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Redies and Puelles, 2001</xref>). Collectively, we establish CONCEPT telencephalon-eye organoids for studying the early formation of telencephalic and ocular tissues in humans.</p><p>The tissue patterning in CONCEPT telencephalon-eye organoids is originated from the attachment of a radially-symmetric epithelium to the culture surface for growth as colonies since individual cysts kept in suspensions do not form any apparent tissue patterning. When a floating cyst initially contacted the culture surface, the contact resulted in ECM-cell adhesions. The initial ECM-cell adhesions caused additional ECM-cell contacts in neighboring cells, resulting in the flattening and spreading of a cyst onto the culture surface. Since the cyst is a radially symmetric epithelium, ECM-cell adhesions between the cyst and the culture surface formed sequentially in a concentric manner. Remodeling of cell-cell and ECM-cell adhesions and self-organization underlay the tissue patterning. Molecular events in concentric patterns during the attachment of a cyst onto the culture surface were eventually translated to concentric gradients of morphogens that specify cell fates. The radially symmetric epithelial structure of cysts is important for the formation of a concentric pattern since such pattern would not be generated when amorphous embryoid bodies are attached to the culture surface for growth as colonies. In literature, timed BMP4 treatment is shown to promote neuroretinal differentiation from pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuwahara et al., 2015</xref>), and FGF8 promotes telencephalic and eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez-Morales et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson and Rubenstein, 2000</xref>). In our system, BMP4 and FGF8, along with BMP7 and other FGFs, were highly expressed starting at early stages and gradually formed concentric morphogen gradients, which would dictate tissue patterning, resulting in coordinated specification of telencephalic, optic stalk, optic disc, and neuroretinal tissues along the center-periphery axis in CONCEPT telencephalon-eye organoids. Co-culture of these tissues in the concentric zones provides mutual cues for coordinated tissue specification and growth. Nevertheless, anchorage culture of cell colonies prevents three-dimensional morphogenesis as seen in embryos, impeding proper tissue interactions at more advanced stages. When these cell colonies are detached using dispase for suspension culture, retinal progenitor cells self-organize to form protruding, translucent spheres called retinal organoids, whereas other types of cells form structures with dark appearance; concentric zones no longer exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lowe et al., 2016</xref>). It is conceivable that the simple suspension culture does not have proper physical and chemical supports provided by periocular tissues in vivo and therefore optic-stalk cells do not form a tube-like structure. It is a challenge ahead to reconstruct this three-dimensional environment to mimic the morphogenesis in vivo.</p><p>Concentric patterns of stem cell-derived cultures are also reported in a few other experiments. When dissociated single pluripotent stem cells are grown in micropatterned culture surface at certain cell densities in a medium supplemented with BMP4, concentric zones of progenitors expressing markers for trophectoderm, endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Minn et al., 2020</xref>). Cell density and colony geometry dictate cell fate specification from pluripotent stem cells. A concentric gradient of BMP4 activity regulates the patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Etoc et al., 2016</xref>). When dissociated single pluripotent stem cells are grown in a pre-patterned geometrically-confined culture surface in a medium supplemented with dual inhibitors for TGF-β and BMP4, concentric zones of progenitors expressing the markers for neural plate and neural plate border are observed. Morphogenetic cues – cell shape and cytoskeletal contractile force –dictate the patterning of the neural plate and neural plate border via BMP-SMAD signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xue et al., 2018</xref>). When dissociated single pluripotent stem cells are grown as individual colonies in a medium supplemented with knockout serum replacement, multiple zones of ectodermal cells autonomously form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>). In all three experiments, dissociated single cells are used to generate cell colonies through either cell re-aggregation or proliferation. In our case, adherent culture of a radially symmetric epithelium – the cyst – was used to generate CONCEPT organoids. Among the three previous and our experiments, starting cells differ in their developmental potentials, tissue structures, and treatments. Despite the differences, all these organoids comprise concentric zones of distinct cell populations.

Therefore, efficient isolation of human RGCs in a native condition will have a substantial impact on therapeutic studies of RGC-related diseases such as glaucoma. In literature, cell surface marker Thy1 is used for the isolation of adult mouse RGCs, but it is unsuccessful in the isolation of RGCs from 3D retinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sluch et al., 2017</xref>).

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified cell-surface protein CNTN2 as a specific marker for early RGCs in both human organoids and fetal retinas. We isolated electrophysiologically excitable RGCs from retinal organoids using MACS via CNTN2, and it is conceivable that this method is applicable for human fetal retinas. Therefore, we establish a one-step method for isolating early human RGCs under a native condition, facilitating therapeutic studies for RGC-related retinal diseases such as glaucoma.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

H1 hESCs or iPSCs that were passaged using ReLeSR 2 or 3 days before experiments were detached using Dispase (GIBCO 17105041) and then harvested using centrifugation. After that, the cell pellets were suspended in ice-cold Matrigel. After gelling at 37 °C for 15–20 min, the hESC/Matrigel clump was gently dispersed in a N2B27 Medium (DMEM/F12+GlutaMAX (GIBCO):Neurobasal medium (GIBCO)=1:1, 0.5 x B27 supplement (GIBCO), 0.5 x N2 supplement (GIBCO), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mM L-GlutaMax) for floating culture. With the starting day of cell differentiation designated as day 0, cysts with a single lumen formed on day 1. Cysts with a single lumen constituted over 85% of cultures. On days 4 or 5, individual cysts with a diameter at around 150–200 μm were manually picked using a curved Pasteur pipet under an inverted microscope and then seeded onto Matrigel-coated 24-well plates at a density of 2–6 cysts per well. Cysts spontaneously attached to the culture surface and grew.

For each MACS experiment, 84–140 retinal organoids at stages of days 41–70 were dissociated into single cells using Accutase (GIBCO A1110501). Non-retinal cells were trimmed if there were any. Dissociated single cells were harvested using centrifugation and then incubated for 25 min at room temperature with MagnaBind goat anti-mouse IgG (ThermoScientific 21354) beads that were previously coupled with a CNTN2 antibody (DSHB 4D7) following manufacturer instructions. Cells bound to the beads were isolated using a magnetic rack and then washed one time with the KSR medium supplemented with antibiotic:Antimycotic (GEMINI 400101) while the tube was still against the magnetic rack. After the wash, the cells were released from the beads via Accutase digestion for 30 min and then harvested using centrifugation.

Primary antibodies were visualized using Alexa Fluor 488-, 568-, and 647-conjugated secondary antibodies and imaged using a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 microscope. When the sample did not fit in one image, multiple images were stitched to obtain an overview.

The authors have succeeded in developing a robust model of optic stalk(OS) and optic disc(OD) tissue with innervating retinal ganglion cells. The OS and OD have a robust pattern with distinct developmental and functional borders that allow for a distinct pathway for pathfinding RGC neurites.</p><p>This study falls short on a thorough analysis of their single cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq). From the scRNAseq it is unclear the quality and quantity of the targeted cell types that exist in the model. A comparative analysis of the scRNAseq profiles of their cell-types with existing organoid protocols, to determine a technical improvement, or with fetal tissue, to determine fidelity to target cells, would greatly improve the description of this model and determine its utility. This is especially necessary for the RGCs developed in this protocol as they recommend this as an improved model to study RGCs.</p><p>Future work targeting RGC neurite outgrowth mechanisms will be exciting.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to Reviewer 1 for these constructive comments. We added plots for quality control in Figure 4-figure supplement 2 and quantification of cell clusters in Tab. 1. We compared the transcriptomes between CONCEPT organoids, Gabriel et al.’s brain/optic organoids (Gabriel et al., 2021; PMID: 34407456), and human fetal retinas HGW9 (Lu et al., 2020; PMID: 32386599), which strongly support our findings (Figs. 5, 6; see responses below for details). Besides FGFs/FGFR signaling, scRNA-seq identified additional candidate molecules that may provide axon guidance functions, and these candidate molecules are the focus of our future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations For The Authors</p><p>This study falls short on a thorough analysis of their single cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq).</p><p>The scRNAseq figure needs to be better presented to allow for an adequate assessment of the model. As written the classification of the different clusters is hard to follow. A representative labeling of the suspected identity of the clusters in an infographic would aid the figure. Since it is hard to follow it is difficult to determine how well clusters correlate with designated cell types. PAX2 expression designating optic stalk seems to correlate well with the group 2 and the designation of the Optic disk, however PAX2 expression for the optic stalk is half in group 4 and half in group 9. what are group 4 and 9? It is also not clear how the thresholding for the given clusters was reached.</p></disp-quote><p>To present the scRNA-seq dataset in a clearer way, we added dotted red lines in Fig. 4C to delineate eye (mostly retinal), telencephalic, and mixed cell populations. In Tab. 1, we showed assigned cell types, counts, and percentage for each cluster.</p><p>PAX2+ VSX2- optic stalk cells were at edges of clusters 4, 8, 9 that had dorsal telencephalic identities. Clusters 4, 8, 9 were largely segregated along cell cycle phases (Fig. 4A, B, F), and these clusters differentially expressed gene markers SOX3, FGFR2, PRRX1, EDNRB, and FOXG1 (Figure 4-Figure supplement 4A-4D; Fig. 4C). In E14.5 mouse embryos, mouse orthologs of SOX3,FGFR2, PRRX1, and EDNRB were specifically expressed in dorsal telencephalon (Figure 4-figure supplement 5B-5E); Foxg1 was specifically expressed in both dorsal and ventral telencephalon. Therefore, clusters 4, 8, and 9 have dorsal telencephalic identities, and PAX2+ VSX2- optic stalk cells are at edges of these telencephalic clusters.</p><p>Thresholding of cell clusters were determined by cell clustering parameters, which is described in Materials and Methods: FindVariableFeatures (selection.method = &quot;vst&quot;, nfeatures = 2000), ScaleData, RunPCA, ElbowPlot, FindNeighbors (dims = 1:17), FindClusters (resolution = 0.5), and RunUMAP(dims = 1:17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should make an attempt to calculate which different cell types are present and in what proportions. They should also discuss groups that are confounding. Since this is the first description of this technique it is critical to know how much of the model represents mature welldefined cells of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We assigned cell types to clusters and calculated cell counts and proportions of each cluster (Tab.1). The only undetermined cell cluster was cluster 13, which was the smallest one. We described top DEGs of cluster 13 and discussed the cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerning the focus on RGC isolation. It is interesting that CNTN2 can be used for an effective isolation however, there are many protocols for generating RGCs. Is CNTN2 expression unique to this protocol? If the authors claim that this protocol could be used for studying glaucoma, how does this protocol improve on the quality of RGCs compared to other protocols?</p></disp-quote><p>RGC-specific CNTN2 expression was not unique to CONCEPT organoids. We isolated RGCs via CNTN2 from both CONCEPT organoids and 3-D retinal organoids in suspension. Indeed, isolated RGCs shown in the manuscript were from 3-D retinal organoids (see Materials andMethods for details). Importantly, our single cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that CNTN2 was also differentially expressed in early RGCs from human fetal retinas (Fig. 5L, 5M). Therefore, isolation of human early RGCs via CNTN2 should be applicable widely.</p><p>In CONCEPT organoids, RGC differentiation and directional axon growth were very efficient. Our study supports a model that FGFs from optic disc cells efficiently induce RGC differentiation and directional axon growth in adjacent retinal progenitor cells, as FGFR inhibitions drastically decreased the number of RGC somas and directional axon growth (Fig. 9). Therefore,CONCEPT organoids are useful in studying axon guidance cues in humans, which knowledge is much needed for axon regrowth from RGCs that are damaged in glaucoma. Notably, juvenile glaucoma gene CYP1B1 was found in assigned optic disc cells in both CONCEPT organoids and human fetal retinas (Fig. 4I, 5D), making CONCEPT organoids a testable model in studying the functions of CYP1B1 in human cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A comparative analysis of the scRNAseq profiles of their model with existing organoid protocols, to determine a technical improvement, or with fetal tissue, to determine fidelity to target cells, would greatly improve the description of this model and determine its utility.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we compared the transcriptomes between CONCEPT organoids, Gabriel et al.’s brain/optic organoids (Gabriel et al., 2021; PMID: 34407456), and human fetal retinas HGW9 (Lu et al., 2020; PMID: 32386599). Gabriel et al. (2021) report “axon-like” projections in their “optic vesicle-containing brain organoids”. We found that PAX2+ VSX2+ optic disc, PAX2+ VSX2- optic stalk, FOXG1+ telencephalic, and VSX2+ neuroretinal cell clusters that were found in CONCEPT organoids did not exist in Gabriel et al.’s organoids (Figure 4-Figure supplement S1o), indicating striking differences between Gabriel et al.’s organoids and our CONCEPT telencephalon-eye organoids.</p><p>On the other hand, CONCEPT organoids and human fetal retinas HGW9 had similar expression signatures (Fig. 5). First, we identified a PAX2+ cell cluster in the human retinas HGW9. 64/113DEGs in the PAX2+ cluster from human fetal retinas HGW9 were also DEGs of cluster 2 (assigned PAX2+ optic disc cells) from CONCEPT organoids. Second, CNTN2 was also differentially expressed in early RGCs of human fetal retinas. Third, when cells in cluster 18 and retinal progenitor clusters from the HGW9 dataset were combined with cells in clusters 2, 4, 5, 7 from the CONCEPT dataset for Seurat anchor-based clustering, cells in cluster 18 from HGW9 (H18) were grouped with cluster 2 from CONCEPT organoids (C2, assigned optic disc; N), and these cells expressed both PAX2 and VSX2 (arrowheads in Fig. 5N-5R). A small portion of H18 cells were grouped with cluster 4 from CONCEPT organoids (C4, assigned optic stalk; N), and these cells expressed PAX2 but not VSX2 (arrows in Fig. 5N-5R). Fourth, CONCEPT organoids and human fetal retinas shared many enriched GO terms in DEGs of assigned optic disc cells (Fig. 6).</p><p>Collectively, transcriptomic comparisons support that our CONCEPT organoids are innovative and similar to human fetal retinas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Not clear what reporting on Lens cells in Figure 3 adds to the focus of the manuscript. The figure seems out of place with the flow of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Lens cells were obvious in CONCEPT organoids. The presence of lens cells indicates that cysts have the developmental potential for both neural and non-neural anterior ectodermal cells. For a better flow, we added a transitional sentence at the beginning of the lens section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>Public Review</p><p>The study by Liu et al. reports on the establishment and characterization of telencephalon eye structures that spontaneously form from human pluripotent stem cells. The reported structures are generated from embryonic cysts that self-form concentric zones (centroids) of telencephaliclike cells surrounded by ocular cell types. Interestingly, the cells in the outer zone of these concentric structures give rise to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) based on the expression of several markers, and their neuronal morphology and electrophysiological activity. Single-cell analysis of these brain-eye centroids provides detailed transcriptomic information on the different cell types within them. The single-cell analysis led to the identification of a unique cellsurface marker (CNTN2) for the human ganglion cells. Use of this marker allowed the team to isolate the stem cell-derived RGCs.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript describes a method for generating self-forming structures of brain-eye lineages that mimic some of the early patterning events, possibly including the guidance cues that direct axonal growth of the RGCs. There are previous reports on brain-eye organoids with optic nerve-like connectivity; thus, the novel aspect of this study is the self-formation capacity of the centroids, including neurons with some RGC features. Notably, the manuscript further reports on cell-surface markers and an approach to generating and isolating human RGCs.</p><p>Recommendations For The Authors</p><p>The following significant issues, however, need to be addressed:</p><p>The authors show RGC-like cells that grow axons toward the Pax2+ cells, suggesting that this is a model for RGC axon pathfinding. Is there support from transcriptomic data on the expression of guidance molecules? In addition, the authors need to characterize Pax2+ cells further. Do some give rise to astrocyte-like cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We assessed the expression of known axon guidance genes in CONCEPT organoids. FGF8 and FGF9 trigger axon outgrowth in motor neuron column explants (Shirasaki et al., 2006). In CONCEPT organoids, FGF8 and FGF9 were differentially expressed in assigned optic disc cells; FGFR inhibition drastically decreased the number of RGC soma and directional axon growth (Fig. 9). In addition, SEMA5a and EFNB1 were expressed in both assigned optic disc and stalk cells, EFNB2 was highly expressed in assigned optic disc cells, and NTN1 was mostly expressed in assigned optic cells (Figure 4-figure supplement 9).</p><p>We compared the transcriptomes between CONCEPT organoids, Gabriel et al.’s brain/optic organoids (Gabriel et al., 2021; PMID: 34407456), and human fetal retinas HGW9 (Lu et al., 2020; PMID: 32386599). Gabriel et al. (2021) report “axon-like” projections in their “optic vesicle-containing brain organoids”. We found that PAX2+ optic disc, PAX2+ optic stalk, FOXG1+ telencephalic, and VSX2+ neuroretinal cell clusters that were found in CONCEPT organoids did not exist in Gabriel et al.’s organoids (Figure 4-figure supplement 10), indicating striking differences between Gabriel et al.’s organoids and our CONCEPT telencephalon-eye organoids.</p><p>To authenticate PAX2+ cells in CONCEPT organoids, we analyzed a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of human fetal retinas HGW9 and identified a similar PAX2+ cell population, cluster 18 (Fig. 5). Expression signatures of PAX2+ cells between CONCEPT organoids and human fetal retinas HGW9 were similar. Notably, cluster 18 differentially expressed PAX2, COL9A3, CYP1B1, SEMA5A, and FGF9 (Fig. 5B-5F), which were top DEGs of cluster 2 in CONCEPT organoids (Fig. 4F, 4G, 4I, 4K; SEMA5A was shown in Figure 4-figure supplement 9A). Overall, 64/113 DEGs of cluster 18 in human fetal retinas HGW9 were also DEGs of cluster 2 in CONCEPT organoids. In both HGW9 and CONCEPT organoids, expression of OLIG2, CD44, and GFAP was undetectable (Figure 4-figure supplement 11), indicating that astrocytes had not been generated yet at these stages.</p><p>When cells in cluster 18 and retinal progenitor clusters from the HGW9 dataset were combined with cells in clusters 2, 4, 5, 7 from the CONCEPT dataset for Seurat anchor-based clustering, cells in cluster 18 from HGW9 (H18) were grouped with cluster 2 from CONCEPT organoids (C2, assigned optic disc; N), and these cells expressed both PAX2 and VSX2 (arrowheads inFig. 5N-5R). A small portion of H18 cells were grouped with cluster 4 from CONCEPT organoids (C4, assigned optic stalk; N), and these cells expressed PAX2 but not VSX2 (arrows in Fig. 5N5R).</p><p>We then compared functional annotations of DEGs (top 200 genes) of cluster 2 in CONCEPT organoids and DEGs (113 genes) of cluster 18 in human fetal retinas HGW9. Top GO terms in GO:MF, GO:CC, and GO:BP are shown (Fig. 6). For DEGs of cluster 2 in CONCEPT organoids, top enriched GO terms in GO:MF, GO:CC, and GO:BP were extracellular matrix structural constituent, collagen-containing extracellular matrix, and system development, respectively. Additional interesting GO:BP terms included axon development, astrocyte development, eye development, response to growth factor, cell adhesion, cell motility, neuron projection development, glial cell differentiation, and signal transduction. For DEGs of cluster 18 in human fetal retinas HGW9, top enriched GO terms in GO:MF, GO:CC, and GO:BP were cell adhesion molecule binding, extracellular space, and developmental process, respectively. Many GO terms were enriched in both samples, further indicating transcriptomic similarities in PAX2+ optic disc cells between CONCEPT organoids and human fetal retinas. Notably, GO terms astrocyte differentiation, neuron projection development, and glial cell differentiation were enriched in the DEGs of assigned optic disc cells for both CONCEPT organoids and human fetal retinas, consistent with expectations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Vsx2+Pax2+ population is not typically detected in vivo in the developing mouse eye.

In this dataset, subtypes of RGCs were undetectable. Isolated RGCs via CNTN2 were at more advanced stages. Distinct expression of POU4F2, ISL1, RBPMS, and SNCG indicate multiple subtypes of RGCs (Fig. 7L-7P).</p><p>We did find other early retinal neurons in the scRNA-seq dataset: photoreceptor cells, amacrine/horizontal cells in CONCEPT organoids (Fig. 4U-4X), and these cells were also in cluster 11 in which RGCs were found.</p><p>We performed transcriptomic comparisons between CONCEPT organoids, brain/optic organoids, and human fetal retinas.

On the other hand, we found that expression signatures of CONCEPT organoids and human fetal retinas are similar (Figs. 5, 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 3: where are the &quot;lens like&quot; cells located?

We referred to Li et al.’s (2000) paper (Mech Dev 95, 283-289) for Aldh1a3 expression in the optic stalk. Figure 7K was used to shown Aldh1a3 expression in peripheral retinas on sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 263, Reference 68: The authors claim that col13A1 is specific to the human optic disk. However, col13A1 is expressed in many additional eye lineages (PMID: 10865988).</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry we did not make it clear. We meant that Col13A1 is prominently expressed in the optic disc, which is clearly shown in the referred paper (Figure 3D in the paper PMID: 10865988).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show that inhibiting FgfR results in fewer RGCs and loss of directed axonal growth. The number of cells is drastically reduced; thus, the relevance of the finding directly to axon guidance is not resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>FGFR inhibitions drastically the number of RGC somas (Fig. 9F-9K). Additionally, remaining RGCs nearly did not grow directional axons (arrowheads in Fig. 9K), and a few remaining axons wandered around (arrow in Fig. 9K), indicating the role of FGF/FGFR signaling in early RGC differentiation and directional axon growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 1H and J: Vsx2 is outside the centroid in panels H and I, but inside the centroid in panels J and K. It is not clear what part of the centroid is shown. This needs to be clarified by adding a scheme.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry we did not make it clear. We added separate-channel images showing VSX2 andPAX6 expression (Figure 1-figure supplements 1, 2) and a new diagram (left panel in Fig. 1B). Overall, FOXG1, VSX2, and PAX6 expression at days 15-17 formed three concentric zones spanning from the center to the periphery. At days 22-26, VSX2 expression expanded peripherally, largely overlapping PAX6 expression (Figure 1-figure supplements 1, 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pax6 should be in all cells, also on day 17.

After cysts attached to the culture surface and grew as colonies, distinct levels of PAX6 expression emerged in concentric zones. At days 17 and 26, PAX6 expression at the central zone (which cells expressed FOXG1) became lower, which is obvious in separate-channel images (Figure 1-figure supplements 1, 2). Consistently, PAX6 expression was low in FOXG1+ telencephalic cells in the scRNA-seq (Fig. 4C, 4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 27-30: this is a long and complex sentence which needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We broke it into a few sentences to make it clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 43: fix &quot;Retina&quot; to &quot;Retinal&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We fixed it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 376-377: repeated &quot;mechanisms of&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We fixed it.</p></body></sub-article></article>
