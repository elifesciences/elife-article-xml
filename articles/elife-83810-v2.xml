II (Pol II) is initiated by the hierarchical assembly of the pre-initiation complex onto promoter DNA. Decades of research have shown that the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) is essential for Pol II loading and initiation. Here, we report instead that acute depletion of TBP in mouse embryonic stem cells has no global effect on ongoing Pol II transcription. In contrast, acute TBP depletion severely impairs RNA Polymerase III initiation. Furthermore, Pol II transcriptional induction occurs normally upon TBP depletion. This TBP-independent transcription mechanism is not due to a functional redundancy with the TBP paralog TRF2, though TRF2 also binds to promoters of transcribed genes. Rather, we show that the TFIID complex can form and, despite having reduced TAF4 and TFIIA binding when TBP is depleted, the Pol II machinery is sufficiently robust in sustaining TBP-independent transcription.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>degron</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-162289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teves</surname><given-names>Sheila S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2020-06106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teves</surname><given-names>Sheila S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TATA-box binding protein is not required for RNA Polymerase II transcription in mouse embryonic stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription is the first step in gene expression, and it begins with the stepwise assembly of general transcription factors (GTFs) and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC) at the promoters of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsui et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinberg et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buratowski et al., 1989</xref>). First, the GTF TFIID, composed of the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and 13–14 evolutionarily conserved TBP-associated factors (TAFs), binds onto gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinberg et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buratowski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dynlacht et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cormack and Struhl, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tanese et al., 1991</xref>), which triggers the recruitment of TFIIA and TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinberg et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buratowski et al., 1989</xref>). Pol II is then loaded onto the promoter along with TFIIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinberg et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buratowski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buratowski et al., 1991</xref>). The binding of TFIIE and TFIIH completes the PIC, upon which the enzymatic activity of TFIIH unwinds DNA to form a transcription bubble, allowing for Pol II elongation and the incorporation of nucleotides into the nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinberg et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buratowski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rimel and Taatjes, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Decades of research have revealed a central role for TBP in the transcription initiation process. TBP was first discovered to recognize and bind to the TATA-box (TATAAA consensus sequence) in gene promoters in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakajima et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buratowski et al., 1988</xref>), though subsequent studies show that TBP binds to active gene promoters in vivo regardless of the presence of a TATA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim and Iyer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pugh and Venters, 2016</xref>). Early studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> expressing TBP mutations show that the loss of functional TBP led to decreased GTF and Pol II recruitment and transcription in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klages and Strubin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 1994</xref>). More recently, acute TBP depletion in yeast cells via the anchor-away system led to a rapid, genome-wide loss of Pol II and GTF occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petrenko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petrenko et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to facilitating Pol II transcription, TBP is also involved in at least two other RNA polymerases found in eukaryotes, and conditional inactivation of TBP in yeast led to a global decrease in both RNA Pol I and III transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cormack and Struhl, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwon and Green, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schröder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">White et al., 1992</xref>). In vitro experiments using purified proteins from yeast and human cells also confirm the role of TBP in the three main RNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goodrich and Tjian, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burley and Roeder, 1996</xref>). However, mouse embryos harboring a homozygous TBP knock-out, which were viable up to ~40 cell stage of embryogenesis, still displayed normal levels of Pol II transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martianov et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, acute depletion of TBP in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) showed that global transcription levels remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teves et al., 2018</xref>), raising the question of how Pol II transcription occurs in the absence of TBP in these cases.</p><p>Several potential mechanisms may facilitate TBP-free Pol II transcription. One, TBP may be required only for the initial round of activation, but ongoing transcription may no longer needed for TBP. The impairment of the reactivation of genes following mitosis when TBP is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teves et al., 2018</xref>) would support this mechanism. Two, metazoan-specific TBP paralogs could functionally replace TBP. In some species, TBP paralogs have been found to bind onto genomic loci distinct from TBP and regulate cell type-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Veenstra, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kedmi et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, TBP-related factors TRF1 and TRF2, first discovered in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> are also able to substitute for TBP in TATA transcriptional systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crowley et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rabenstein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holmes and Tjian, 2000</xref>). A third vertebrate-specific paralog, TRF3, mediates transcription of oocyte-specific genes through a non-canonical complex with TFIIA/TFIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Three, a TAF-containing complex could facilitate Pol II transcription without TBP. Indeed, several TAF complexes have been identified, including the TBP-free TAF-containing complex (TFTC) isolated from human cells that can support in vitro Pol II transcription without TBP or TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wieczorek et al., 1998</xref>). TFTC was subsequently shown to correspond to the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex, a conserved eukaryotic co-activator with histone acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheon et al., 2020</xref>), which has been shown to act somewhat redundantly with TFIID in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donczew et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the role of TBP in transcription initiation in mESCs using an acute depletion system. We report that, inconsistent with a requirement for TBP in Pol II-dependent transcription, rapid depletion of TBP has no global effect on nascent RNA levels and Pol II chromatin occupancy. In contrast, tRNA transcription and Pol III chromatin occupancy are severely impaired upon depletion of TBP. We found that gene induction via the heat shock (HS) response and retinoic acid (RA)-mediated differentiation occurs normally upon TBP depletion. We also report that although the TBP paralog TRF2 binds to active gene promoters, it does not functionally replace TBP in Pol II transcription. Lastly, we show that the TFIID complex can form when TBP is depleted, although subunits have altered DNA occupancy. We find that TFIIA also has reduced binding when TBP is depleted. Taken together, these results point to a TBP-independent mechanism for Pol II transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TBP is not required for global Pol II transcription</title><p>We have previously generated homozygous knock-in of the minimal auxin-inducible degron tag at the N-terminus of TBP (mAID-TBP) in mESCs (C64 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teves et al., 2018</xref>), which enables rapid and acute depletion of the tagged protein upon the addition of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holland et al., 2012</xref>). Treatment of C64 cells with 6 hr of IAA (+IAA) resulted in no major effects on cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) with over ~90% depletion of mAID-TBP as detected by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), by western blot of whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and of subcellular fractions, including chromatin-bound fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also detected a large decrease in bound TBP at <italic>Gapdh</italic> and <italic>Hspa1a</italic> as measured by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To further assess the degree of acute depletion of chromatin-bound TBP genome-wide, we performed spike-in controlled Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag), a high-resolution chromatin profiling technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaya-Okur et al., 2019</xref>), in two independent replicates after 6 and 16 hr of TBP depletion. After spike-in normalization, CUT&amp;Tag analysis of TBP under control conditions shows high enrichment of TBP at the transcription start sites of genes (TSSs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>), with high reproducibility across replicates compared to the nonspecific IgG negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). After 6 and 16 hr of IAA treatment, we observed a large depletion of bound TBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and when quantified at the promoters of genes (herein defined as –250 bp to TSS) relative to control conditions, we observed over ~80% decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Pearson correlation confirms the difference between conditions, as control samples correlated more strongly with one another compared to IAA-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Therefore, using orthogonal approaches, we confirm efficient depletion of TBP.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Global Polymerase II (Pol II)-mediated transcription is TATA-box binding protein (TBP)-independent in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-mediated degradation of mAID-TBP.

Prolonged IAA treatment (16 hr) also showed no global effects on Pol II occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Indeed, Pearson correlation analysis using 10 kb bins of all Pol II CUT&amp;Tag replicates show high correlation coefficients (0.85–0.97) across both control and IAA-treated samples regardless of treatment times, showing no global differences in Pol II occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>To directly measure Pol II activity, we performed NET-seq (native elongating transcript sequencing) analysis in control and TBP-depleted C64 mESCs.

We then performed spike-in normalized CUT&amp;Tag for HA-TRF2 using the HA antibody with and without TBP depletion, and confirmed TBP depletion in B8HA cells through TBP CUT&amp;Tag analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The HA signal is also specific, showing no binding in the B8 mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We then displayed the HA-TRF2 CUT&amp;Tag data as a heatmap and average plot for all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Similar to TBP, TRF2 binds to promoters of all active genes, and occupancy levels remain similar upon IAA treatment. Furthermore, B8HA HA-TRF2 occupancy is positively correlated with TBP and Pol II levels from the C64 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Therefore, in contrast to other species, mouse TRF2 has the capacity to bind to the same promoters of active genes as TBP in mESCs.</p><p>To test whether TRF2 can functionally replace TBP, we generated a TRF2 knock-out cell line with the entire coding sequence removed (B8 cells). We validated the knock-out with western blot of whole cell lysates and qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). We then performed qRT-PCR to quantify the intronic and exonic transcripts of <italic>Gapdh</italic> in B8 cells with and without IAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). We observed no differences in both intronic and exonic RNA levels for <italic>Gapdh</italic> despite the combination of TBP knockdown and TRF2 knock-out, suggesting that nascent transcription of <italic>Gapdh</italic> is unaffected. To determine the effects on Pol II upon knocking out TRF2, we performed Pol II CUT&amp;Tag on the B8 cells. We then performed DGE analysis of the Pol II CUT&amp;Tag in the TRF2 knock-out B8 cells versus the control C64 mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). DGE shows only 13 upregulated genes and 8 downregulated genes, suggesting that knock-out of TRF2 has no global consequences. To further investigate if TRF2 and TBP are functionally redundant in mESCs, we performed CUT&amp;Tag for TBP and Pol II on TRF2 knock-out B8 cells with and without TBP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I–J</xref>). We confirmed proper depletion of TBP in the B8 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>), and Pearson correlation analysis using 10 kb bins of Pol II CUT&amp;Tag shows good concordance between replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K</xref>). DGE analysis shows that 100 and 97 genes were downregulated and upregulated, respectively, upon TBP depletion in the B8 cells, confirming that Pol II occupancy is not affected globally upon TBP depletion in the TRF2 knock-out cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Additionally, we performed a cell viability assay under prolonged IAA treatment when either TBP, TRF2, or both are absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1L</xref>). Both B8 and C64 cells displayed a similar death curve when treated with IAA, suggesting that the combinatorial knock-out of TRF2 with TBP depletion does not accelerate cell death. We conclude that TRF2 is not functionally redundant to TBP and that Pol II transcription may be TBP family-independent in mESCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The TFIID complex forms upon TBP depletion</title><p>A third potential mechanism for TBP-independent Pol II transcription is that TAF-containing TFIID complexes could function when TBP is depleted. To examine the composition of TFIID upon TBP depletion, we performed co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) with α-TAF4 in control and IAA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). TAF4 is a member of the core TFIID subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wright et al., 2006</xref>), and is also present in other TAF-containing complexes like TFTC/SAGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wieczorek et al., 1998</xref>). We confirmed TBP depletion, TAF4 expression, and TAF4 IP in control and IAA-treated cells by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). From our TAF4 IP-MS analysis, we observed an 80% decrease of co-precipitated TBP in IAA-treated cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), although we observed a greater decrease by western blot analyses of whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the TAF4 IP-MS of control cells, we identified peptides for all of the TAF subunits of the TFIID complex, as well as some peptides for TAF paralogs like TAF4b and TAF9b. Importantly, in the IAA-treated cells, we detected similar levels of enrichment for the identified TAF subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B and D</xref>). Statistical analyses of replicates show no significant differences in the enrichment levels of TFIID members by TAF4 IP-MS in control vs. IAA-treated cells. These results suggest that the full TFIID complex can form even when TBP is depleted. Furthermore, the nuclear TFIID complex does not dissociate into smaller subcomplexes when TBP is depleted, as gel filtration analysis from control and TBP-depleted nuclear lysates showed no change in TAF4 elution patterns. TAF4 is only detected at the earliest fractions, indicative of the high molecular weight of the full TFIID complex, in both control and TBP-depleted nuclear lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although the gel filtration only provides information on the nuclear complex, we observed no changes in relative stoichiometries of the TAF subunits, as measured by the TAF4 IP-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that TBP depletion has no effect on any TAF4 subcomplexes formed in the cytoplasm. Taken together, these results indicate that, even under TBP-depleted conditions, the full TFIID complex can form, and that any subcomplexes containing TAF4 are unaffected.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The TFIID complex forms upon TATA-box binding protein (TBP) depletion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Western blot analyses for α-TAF4, α-TBP, and α-Tubulin of control and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-treated C64 whole cell extracts used in the TAF4 IP-MS analyses.

We plotted TAF4 occupancy in a 2 kb window surrounding the TSS of all genes in control and TBP-depleted cells as heatmaps and observed a similar decrease in TAF4 occupancy across all genes upon TBP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also plotted the normalized TAF4 read counts on the promoter of all genes with and without IAA treatment as a scatter plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and observed that most points fall below the diagonal with about 65% decrease in signal. Pearson correlation analysis using 10 kb bins or surrounding the TSS (-/+1000 bp) shows that the TAF4 control samples correlate more strongly with one another than with the IAA-treated, confirming that TBP depletion does indeed affect TAF4 occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Scatter plot analysis of TAF4 relative to Pol II shows that genes that experience a decrease in TAF4 occupancy upon TBP depletion do not decrease in Pol II occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Therefore, unlike TAF1, TAF4 binding is affected by TBP depletion.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that TBP mediates the interaction between TFIID and TFIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kraemer et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, in the TAF4 IP-MS, we detected high levels of TFIIA-γ peptides under control conditions that significantly decreased in the IAA-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), confirming that TBP mediates this interaction. The decrease in interaction is not due to altered protein levels, as measured by whole cell lysate western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To determine the effects of TBP depletion on TFIIA binding to promoters, we performed CUT&amp;Tag using an antibody that detects the second subunit of TFIIA, with high concordance between replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). We observe that TFIIA binds to the promoters of <italic>Gapdh</italic> and <italic>Actb</italic> in control conditions, and that this occupancy is decreased upon IAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We then plotted TFIIA occupancy in a 2 kb window surrounding the TSS of all genes in control and IAA-treated cells as a heatmap and observed a global decrease in occupancy upon TBP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Scatter plot analysis of normalized reads on the promoters of all genes in control versus TBP-depleted cells show about 60% decrease in overall signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Pearson correlation analysis using 10 kb bins or surrounding the TSS (-/+1000 bp) show that TFIIA IAA-treated samples correlate more closely with one another than with the control samples and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Additionally, k-means clustering of the TFIIA CUT&amp;Tag data shows a similar trend to that of TAF4, where genes that experience the greatest decrease in TBP depletion (cluster 3) also show the largest reduction in TFIIA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Scatter plot analysis of TFIIA signal relative to Pol II shows that although the occupancy of TFIIA decreases, Pol II occupancy is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>). A similar analysis between TFIIA and TAF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>) shows that genes experiencing a decrease in TAF4 occupancy also decrease in TFIIA binding.</p><p>Lastly, we plotted TBP, Pol II, TAF4, TAF1, TFIIA CUT&amp;Tag, and our NET-seq data as heatmaps (top) and average plots (bottom) arranged by decreasing TBP occupancy and observe that TBP occupancy correlates strongly with transcription levels (Pol II and NET-seq data) and with the other GTFs in control conditions, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Furthermore, highly bound TBP genes show the greatest reduction in TFIIA and TAF4 occupancy when TBP is depleted, but experience no differences in Pol II and TAF1. Taken together, our data suggest that TBP depletion disrupts TFIID-TFIIA association and negatively affects TFIIA and TAF4 binding to promoters. However, despite these effects on TAF4 and TFIIA, the Pol II machinery remains sufficiently robust in supporting Pol II transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we took advantage of a drug-inducible degradation system to deplete TBP rapidly and examined the mechanistic role of TBP in Pol II transcription in mESCs. We found that TBP is largely not required for ongoing Pol II transcription. TBP is, however, required for transcription of tRNA genes by Pol III. We tested several possible mechanisms for TBP-independent Pol II transcription, and found that TBP is not required for gene induction, and that the TBP paralog TRF2 does not functionally replace TBP for Pol II transcription when TBP is depleted. Additionally, the TFIID complex still forms even when TBP is acutely depleted, but that its association with TFIIA is significantly decreased. Although TAF1 binding was unaffected, TAF4 and TFIIA occupancy levels decreased upon TBP depletion. Despite these changes, Pol II activity remains unaffected, suggesting a robustness in the Pol II machinery that compensates for TBP depletion.</p><p>Previous studies have examined the role of individual subunits of the TFIID complex in mammalian systems. For instance, knockdown of the TAF5 subunit in human ESCs led to reduced expression of the pluripotency genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pijnappel et al., 2013</xref>), and in mESCs, acute degradation of TAF12 led to a global decrease in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). These studies are consistent with a more prominent role for TFIID. However, a major limitation inherent to the mAID system is the incomplete degradation of the protein, resulting in ~10–20% remaining TBP protein. A previous study has quantified the absolute number of TBP molecules in mESCs to 99,111±29,125 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cattoglio et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting ~10,000–20,000 remaining TBP molecules after depletion. From the Pol II CUT&amp;Tag and NET-seq data, ~70% of Refseq TSSs have detectable signals, which results in ~27,185 active genes (from 38,837 total). Based on these numbers, even the highest estimated end of remaining TBP is insufficient to account for one molecule per active TSS. These numbers do not consider Pol II expression that occurs at enhancers or the ribosomal genes transcribed by Pol I. Furthermore, the TBP requirement for Pol III activity in mESCs provides confirmation that the acute TBP depletion system in mESCs has the expected consequences, and emphasizes the lack of effect on Pol II transcription when TBP is depleted. However, these results do not provide information on the functional role of TBP when recruited to Pol II promoters. One possibility is that Pol II transcription has evolved to have multiple redundancies such that removal of one factor (TBP) may not fully disrupt the whole system. Another possibility is that the transient nature of the embryonic cell state, with its unique chromatin landscape, enables Pol II transcription without TBP. Regardless, at the level of TBP depletion that we observe, we conclude that in mESCs Pol II transcription can occur independently of TBP.</p><p>We initially hypothesized that the TBP paralog TRF2 could functionally replace TBP in our depletion system. TRF2 is a more distant TBP paralog compared to the other paralogs, sharing only ~40% amino acid identity with the core domain of TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dantonel et al., 1999</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, TRF2 fails to bind to DNA that contains the canonical TATA box. Instead, TRF2 from various species such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, worms, frogs, fish, and flies has been proposed to activate transcription for TATA-less promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhtar and Veenstra, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Isogai et al., 2007</xref>). Previous studies have also shown that mouse TRF2 binds to active promoters in haploid testis cells along with TBP and TAF7l (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martianov et al., 2016</xref>), but the germline may have unique regulatory mechanisms. Our CUT&amp;Tag results show that TRF2 binds to all active promoters in mESCs, and its level of binding correlates strongly to both TBP and Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). One possible explanation for species-specific differences in TRF2 functions is the variability in the TRF2 core domain across species. Unlike TBP, whose core domain is over 80% conserved across species, the core domain of TRF2 only shares 40–45% amino acid conservation between metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhtar and Veenstra, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dantonel et al., 2000</xref>). Although TRF2 has been historically seen to govern specific subsets of genes distinct from TBP, our results show that TRF2 in mESCs may have the potential to substitute for TBP during transcription initiation for mESCs Pol II-transcribed genes. It was thus surprising that depletion of TBP in the TRF2 knock-out mESCs had no global effect on Pol II transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting that Pol II transcription in mESCs may not only be TBP-independent, but TBP family-independent.</p><p>We have shown that the full TFIID complex can form upon TBP depletion and that TFIID does not dissociate into smaller subcomplexes when TBP is depleted, suggesting a resiliency in the TFIID complex. Several studies point to a modular assembly for the full complex, which may allow for such resiliency. For instance, human TAF8 and TAF10 form as a heterodimer in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kamenova et al., 2019</xref>), with TAF2 joining the subcomplex to promote the nuclear import and incorporation into human TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kamenova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soutoglou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trowitzsch et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, human TAF5, TAF6, and TAF9 have also been shown to form in the cytosol as a subcomplex to promote the incorporation of TAF9 into TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonova et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that the modular nature of the assembly of TFIID allows for a robust structure even when TBP molecules are severely limiting. Furthermore, TAF7 has been shown to dissociate from the rest of TFIID after transcription initiation and acts as a regulator of RNA translation by binding onto RNAs and delivering them to polysomes for translation in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gegonne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>). This finding suggests a more dynamic TFIID complex with subunits associating and dissociating in flux, which may allow for built-in redundancy and robustness when a subunit is missing. Such a dynamic TFIID complex would also be consistent with the different effect on TAF1 and TAF4 DNA-binding profiles when TBP is depleted, especially if the absence of TBP leads to changes in TAF-DNA residence times. In contrast, TBP in Pol III initiation forms the TFIIIB complex with only two other factors: Brf2 and Bdp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gouge et al., 2017</xref>). It is intriguing to speculate that the greater number of TAFs in TFIID (13 or more) might allow for more redundancy than the two other subunits of TFIIIB, providing a potential mechanism to the observed requirement for TBP in Pol III but not for Pol II transcription.</p><p>Previous studies have identified the presence of other non-canonical initiation complexes, suggesting a high level of robustness in the machinery to accommodate Pol II transcription. For example, TAF paralogs are often expressed and used in a cell type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freiman, 2009</xref>), including TAF4b in oocytes and TAF9b in motor neuron differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herrera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freiman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pointud et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, knockdown of TBP and the two paralogs showed recruitment of Pol II to the promoter and active transcription for a subset of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gazdag et al., 2016</xref>). In yeast, transcription activation can occur in the absence of TFIIA, and in vitro TFIIA was shown not to be needed for basal transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sayre et al., 1992</xref>). Additionally, gel mobility-shift analysis and fractionated cross-substitution experiments using <italic>Drosophila</italic> and HeLa systems showed that TFIIA was not required for complexes to be transcriptionally competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tyree et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wampler et al., 1990</xref>). Our results provide additional evidence on the robustness of the Pol II machinery. Despite the changes in DNA binding of TAF4 and TFIIA when TBP is depleted, Pol II transcription remains unaffected. Perhaps in the same way that TFIID could behave as a dynamic complex, the entire PIC may also function as a dynamic hub instead of acting as a monolithic complex. Previous studies using single molecule imaging and tracking provide support for this concept. For example, the average residence time of TBP is on the order of minutes whereas TFIIB is on the order of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Teves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Such a dynamic system may provide sufficient robustness to facilitate Pol II transcription when TBP is depleted.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Replicates were merged using the BigWigMerge tool, which sums the reads after normalizing treatment samples to the control samples of each run using <italic>Drosophila</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic> spike-in. ChIPseqSpikeInFree provided its own normalization factors when running the pipeline. Alternate reference alignment was obtained from the UCSC browser tracks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>DGE analysis using edgeR bioconductor</title><p>Scatter plots of differential gene expression (DGE) analysis were performed using the DGE tool from the edgeR bioconductor package. Starting subsampled bam files were used for all Pol II samples. Read counts were obtained using featureCounts command with paired end specificity for the entire gene and pseudogenes were removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). Reads were then imported into R Studio and analyzed using the DGE tool following the Bioconductor manual using default parameters (i.e. 5% FDR). First, DGEList was used to specify reads and gene names, followed by gene annotations (optional) then filtering and normalization by TMM (default option). Read counts below 20 were filtered using filterByExpr (min.count=20). Once reads were normalized, the design matrix was built and dispersion was estimated to determine biological variation. The command glmFit was used to determine DEG and the command topTags was used to show the top genes. Scatter plots were generated using the plotMD function and significant genes were obtained along with the raw values for downstream analyses such as heatmap and table generation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Gene ontology</title><p>GO was done on gene sets identified to be significant from the DGE analysis.

The Pearson correlation coefficients were plotted as a heatmap using the plotCorrelation command with the remove outliers and skip zeros options.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Scatter plot read counts analyses and filtering</title><p>Read counts for scatter plots were obtained from bam files using the bedtools multicov command and plotted to the promoters of genes (–250 bp to TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). Read counts were then normalized to the scaling factor, summed and plotted as is or log transformed before being plotted. Regression analysis was then performed to obtain the slope and R<sup>2</sup> value. Control vs. IAA samples were filtered by taking out genes that did not have any signal in the control (0 reads in the control samples). Fold changes between Pol II and TAF1/TAF4/TFIIA were filtered by genes with moderate to high levels of Pol II in the control (Pol II control summed reads 50 and below were excluded). Fold changes between TFIIA and TAF4 were filtered by moderate to high levels of TFIIA and TAF4 in the control (TFIIA and TAF4 control summed reads 50 and below were excluded).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>qRT-PCR</title><p>Cells were cultured until ~90% confluency on tissue culture-treated plates at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

The whole cell lysates were passed through a 25 G needle five times and incubated on an end-over-end rotator for 30 min at 4°C. Samples were spun at max speed at 4°C for 5 min. Supernatant was transferred to a new tube and the pellet was then digested as much as possible using 2 U of MNase in 1× MNase digestion buffer by nutating at 37°C for 30 min. Digested pellet was centrifuged at max speed and the new supernatant was added to the previous supernatant. Lysates were then pre-cleared using 20 µL/sample of Protein G Dynabeads and incubated on an end-over-end rotator for 2 hr at 4°C. Samples were then placed on a magnetic rack and aliquoted (5% vol/vol for input, 45% vol/vol for α-TAF4 IP, 45% vol/vol for α-IgG IP).

The next day, beads were washed six times with 600 µL Lysis Buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads with 50 µL of 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.5) for 30 min and neutralized with 50 µL 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Elution was repeated two more times and all eluates were combined.

Eluates were reduced using 2.55 µL of 1 M dithiothreitol (DTT, 10 mM final concentration) for 30 min at 37°C, followed by alkylation using 25.5 µL of 500 mM chloroacetamide (CAA, 50 mM final concentration) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and quenched with 14.2 µL of 1 M DTT (50 mM final concentration) for 5 min at room temperature. Sera-Mag Speed Beads were prepared by mixing in equal volume (10 µL hydrophilic and 10 µL hydrophobic per sample), rinsed with water twice, and resuspended in half the volume (total of 10 µL mixed beads per sample) in water. Prepared beads were added to the sample and protein binding was facilitated by adding 100% ethanol (EtOH) to a final concentration of 80%. Samples were incubated for 5 min in a thermomixer at room temperature. Beads were magnetically isolated from the supernatant and proceeded to wash three times with 1 mL 90% EtOH.

One µg of each sample was loaded onto a 50 cm µPAC HPLC Column (Thermo Scientific) maintained at 45°C and separated by a 1 hr gradient with Buffer B ramping from 4% to 27%, at 300 nL/min gradient flow. Buffer A was 2% ACN in 0.1% FA in water and Buffer B was 95% ACN in 0.1% FA in water. MS acquisition was performed with a full-scan MS spectrum between 300 and 1650 m/z, resolution of 120,000, AGC target of 3e6, and maximum IT of 60 ms followed by DIA MS2 acquisition using 24-variable isolation windows at 30,000 resolution, AGC target of 3e6, auto maximum IT, and stepped NCE of 25.5, 27, 30.</p><p>Acquired DIA data was analyzed using directDIA analysis in Spectronaut (version 14.10.201222.47784). The Spectronaut Pulsar search settings were as follows: Enzyme and digest type was Specific Trypsin/P with two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethyl (C) was set as fixed modification; acetyl (N-term) and oxidation (M) were defined as variable modifications. Spectra were matched against the curated mouse proteome fasta from Uniprot (obtained 2021-03-01) with 17,063 entries. False discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 was set for peptide spectra matching, peptide and protein group identification and the precursor PEP cutoff was set at 1E-10. Missing peptides identifications were imputed using the ‘Global Imputing’ strategy with a Qvalue percentile cutoff of 0.2. The ‘minor group quantity’ was calculated as the mean precursor quantity and the ‘major group quantity’ was calculated as the median of 1–6 peptide quantities. Data was normalized across runs using a Qvalue percentile cutoff of 0.8.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Irwin Davidson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your paper has been discussed amongst the referees, the reviewing editor Irwin Davidson and senior editor Kevin Struhl. The general opinion was that this study is of interest to <italic>eLife</italic>, but requires a thorough revision before publication can be considered. The referee's comments are included below. Several issues require particular attention.</p><p>1. The single molecule dynamics experiments are a very indirect way to assess TAF/TFIID association with promoters and since the experiments were performed with ectopically expressed TAFs, the interpretation requires a considerable number of additional controls to show that the proteins are integrated quantitatively into TFIID and not interacting with chromatin individually or in partial TFIID subcomplexes. We suggest that Figure 6 be removed altogether and that the data in Supplementary Figure 9 be moved into the main text. However, there are concerns with the reproducibility of the TAF1 experiments and it is contradictory to claim that a single TBP-free TFIID binds to promoters and at the same time present data showing that TAF1 binding is comparable to the control, whereas that of TAF4 is strongly reduced. All questions in the referee's comments on quantification of replicates require particular attention.</p><p>2. Given the important implications of the study, we request that the Cut&amp;Tag data be consolidated by a TBP ChIP-seq with and without auxin treatment to fully ensure that TBP has been depleted from promoters. Similarly, it is essential to assess promoter recruitment of TFIIA and TFIIB upon TBP depletion.</p><p>3. In addition, assessment of TFIID assembly in absence of TBP by gel filtration would also strengthen the study.</p><p>4. Lastly, the effect of TBP depletion on Pol I transcription should be addressed and the text revised to tone down the interpretation as it is virtually impossible to exclude the idea that residual TBP is sufficient to ensure PIC formation.</p><p>We look forward to a revised version where these issues and those in the referee's reports have been addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Concerning the TBP-independent TFIID complex. The authors show that in absence of TBP other TFIID subunits can coprecipitated with TAF4. The authors should perform gel filtration experiments to determine whether the residual complex is a single TFIID without TBP or whether it has dissociated into diverse TAF4-containing (or without TAF4 that are not taken into account by the MS experiments) subcomplexes of lower molecular mass. None of the experiments in the manuscript address the nature of the TFIID that is recruited to promoters in absence of TBP.</p><p>2. A second major issue is the TBP-independent recruitment of TFIIA and TFIIB to promoters. It is believed that both these proteins interact with TBP and that TBP-induced DNA bending aides in their promoter recruitment. How is their occupancy affected in the absence of TBP? Also, TFIIA shows a strong interaction with TRF2, what happens to TFIIA recruitment in the TBP-depleted TRF2 KO cells?</p><p>3. The authors argue that TFIID is recruited to promoters in absence of TBP and they show data for TAF1 and TAF4. Can the authors test whether Pol II transcription in general or at specific promoters is more sensitive to loss (siRNA knockdown) of certain TAFs in absence of TBP that in its presence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(lines 30-32) The conformational changes induced by TBP within TFIID trigger</p><p>the binding of TFIIA and TFIIB (3), followed by TFIIF and Pol II, which further stabilizes the partial PIC (3). These statements are incorrect and the citation inappropriate.</p><p>This is reference (3):Tolić-Nørrelykke, S. F., Rasmussen, M. B., Pavone, F. S., Berg-Sørensen, K., and Oddershede, L. B. (2006) Stepwise Bending of DNA by a Single TATA-Box Binding Protein.830, Biophysical Journal. 90, 3694-3703</p><p>The authors may be referring to Roeder, R. G. 1996: The role of general initiation factors in transcription by RNA polymerase II. Trends Biochem. Sci. 21:327-335., which is what the (3) authors are mentioning in their introduction. But even in that case, the first statement is incorrect!</p><p>Also reference (4) does not seem at all the most appropriate. Roeder 1996 would be better.</p><p>Reference (5) is also totally inappropriate!!</p><p>In general, I would ask the authors to double check their citations!!</p><p>Concerning TFTC , also known as STAGA, now they are considered to both correspond to the SAGA complex.</p><p>(line 267 and beyond) The visualization of overexpressed halo-tagged TAFs does not seem the most appropriate way to look at the dynamics of the TAF-containing complexes. The proper experiment would have been to tag the chromosomal copies.</p><p>(lines 277-81) By bound TAF7 molecules, do they mean bound to TFIID or bound to DNA, or both or a mixture? Same for TAF4. If they refer to DNA bound, do they know if they are bound to DNA as part of TFIID or by themselves? With the overexpression, this is a little more difficult to deconvolute and to interpret cleanly.</p><p>For the residency time on DNA, how can the authors distinguish if the complex is bound to core promoter DNA or tethered to the +1 nucleosome via reader domains? And, again, is this occurring as individual subunits or in the context of the complex or a mixture? While the two different values for the two subunits make it less likely that both of them are binding as part of a full TFIID, the different possibilities should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.</p><p>On that note, TAF4 has activator binding domains, so part of its dynamics can be affected by that, and this has to also be seen in the context of the overexpression</p><p>That fewer TAF7 binds to chromatin when TBP is depleted, but those bound stay longer, again needs to be put in the context of the overexpression and of the partial depletion of TBP</p><p>If the authors are assuming that TAF7 and TAF4 somehow act differently because they are present in different TFIID complexes, should the immuno-purification via TAF4 show substochiometric amounts of some of the other components? Can they check that?</p><p>Can the authors add a statement about how the CUT&amp;Tag experiments and the single particle experiments relate to each other quantitatively?</p><p>(316) &quot;based on the crystal structure of the TFIID complex&quot; – should be &quot;cryo-EM structure&quot;. On that note, there are two copies of TAF4, and based on structural studies, each of them can be close or far from TBP depending on whether TBP has or not bound the core promoter. By the way, TAF1 is even closer (directly interacting with TBP through its N-terminus) in free TFIID, but further that at least one copy of TAF4, once TBP engages the core promoter.</p><p>(327-8) &quot;In contrast to TAF4, the largest subunit maintains its binding to</p><p>promoters in the absence of TBP depletion.&quot; This does not make sense. Do they mean &quot;in the case of TBP depletion&quot;?</p><p>Finally, I am not an expert on the genomic analyses included, so I cannot judge the quality of the data or its interpretation beyond what the authors propose. So, I look forward to discussing the paper with the rest of the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The authors should show and quantify the depletion of TBP in all cellular compartments, cytoplasm, nuclear soluble and the chromatin associated fractions after 6 and 16 hours of auxin treatment. In the Result section and in the legend of Figure 1A the authors should indicate which type of extract they are analysing on the western blot.</p><p>– As the authors state that after the used auxin treatment about 10-20% TBP is remaining, the numerous statements giving the impression that TBP has no role in Pol II transcription should be tuned down throughout the whole manuscript. What if the remaining 10000-20000 TBP molecules can still work in Pol II transcription because they are very dynamic?</p><p>– How many TBP molecules work in Pol I, Pol II and Pol III GTF complexes? If there are many more TFIIIB complexes (containing TBP) than TFIID or SL1 complexes, it is logical that the first effect one will see after TBP depletion is the decrease of Pol III transcription. Can the authors quantify the number of TBP-containing TFIIIB complexes versus TFIID and SL1 complexes?</p><p>– Along the same lines, the authors should also test the effect of TBP depletion on Pol I transcription.</p><p>– How dynamic is TBP in comparison to Pol I, Pol II and Pol III TAFs and/or Brf1? What are the corresponding DNA residency times of these factors?</p><p>– From Figure S2A it is evident that the most highly depleted genes for TBP binding are the most highly transcribed (high Pol II and NET-seq signals). Could TBP be more dynamic there? The same correlation is visible with TAFs (Figure 7D-F). Could TAFs favor TBP dynamics at promoters (making it more &quot;depletable&quot;, maybe through TAF1 TAND)? Authors should show, side-by-side, the CUT&amp;Tag occupancy heatmaps for TBP, TAF1, TAF4, Pol II and NET-seq with genes ordered by TBP occupancy (+/- IAA).</p><p>– Figure Supp. 5G (not cited in the text) shows that under TBP and TBPL1 (TRF2) co-depletion Pol II occupancy increases about 5 fold (in replicate 2). How do the authors explain this increase? Could this be a normalization artefact? How is it possible that authors conclude from these conflicting replicate experiments that Pol II occupancy is not affected globally (lines 242-243)?</p><p>– Experiments described in Figure 6 are lacking several key controls before they can be interpreted. First the authors would need to demonstrate that ALL the &quot;overexpressed&quot; Halo-tagged TAF4 or Halo-TAF7 incorporate into endogenous TFIID complexes. Otherwise the presented Spot-On measurements are meaningless, because the authors may simply measure the behavior of free TAFs. What is the sense of deriving/showing the % of free/complexed/bound states in an overexpressed system (Figure 6)? No comparison can be made among different subunits (TAF7 vs TAF4) as attempted by the authors in the discussion (line 403, &quot;our SPT results indeed show that TAF7 is much less DNA-bound..&quot;)</p><p>– To normalize their CUT&amp;Tag data, the authors used a spike-free normalization method. This method has only been validated for very abundant histone mark ChIPs, not for Pol II. It is not clear why the authors think that spike-free normalization method is needed for Pol II CUT&amp;Tag normalization. In Supp. Fig1F, the authors show two Pol II CUT&amp;Tag replicates with <italic>E. coli</italic> spike-in and the replicates are quite different. Why do the authors think that the normalized data showing Pol II decrease in IAA condition is not correct?</p><p>– How do authors interpret the widespread CUT&amp;Tag signals they obtain on gene bodies for TAFs (especially TAF1) and partially also for TBP. Do these correspond to non-specific, transient binding events? If yes one would expect that a portion of the signal localized around promoter regions would also be of the same nature.</p><p>– Heat-shock &amp; RA induction might not be the best systems to test for the &quot;reinitiation&quot; hypothesis since TBP might already be promoter bound prior to activation. Indeed, there is a TBP peak even in non-treated condition in the tracks shown in Figure 3 and S3.</p><p>– The RA treatment experiment has to be repeated similarly to the HS experiment, first 6h auxin treatment to degrade TBP and then RA treatment. At the beginning of the RA treatment TBP is still present in the cells making the interpretation of these experiments impossible.</p><p>– In several endogenous TAF IPs TBP has been found to be sub-stoichiometric, could this mean that TBP is not a stable component of mammalian TFIID complexes? TBP dynamics are also regulated by NC2 and BTAF1 complexes (PMID: 20627952), that could influence the interpretation of the obtained result.</p><p>– The discussion sentence &quot;The IP-MS data showing that the TFIID complex forms upon TBP depletion is surprising&quot; is misleading, since at structural level TBP depletion is not expected to deeply affect any TFIID subunit or complex integrity.</p><p>– &quot;The altered dynamics of TAF4 upon TBP depletion may be due to its close proximity to TBP, based on the crystal structure of the TFIID complex&quot;. There is no crystal structure of TFIID. TAF4 is instead involved in the interaction with TFIIA and, quite indirectly, with DNA-bound TBP.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83810.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

All questions in the referee's comments on quantification of replicates require particular attention.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the over-expression Halo-TAF SPT analyses may be too preliminary at this time. We have removed the original Figure 6 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We also agree that the replicates for TAF1 CUT&amp;Tag are not as concordant as other experiments. To address this, we have performed two more replicates of TAF1 CUT&amp;Tag in control and TBP-depleted conditions, for a total of 4 replicates. Plots for each replicate are now shown in new Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B. All four replicates are consistent with each other, confirming that TAF1 binding is largely unchanged when TBP is depleted.</p><p>Based on the TAF4 IP-MS and TAF1 and TAF4 CUT&amp;Tag, we conclude that the complex can form even upon TBP depletion, and that some subunits can bind to promoters after TBP depletion. We wish to clarify that we do not conclude that “a single TBP-free TFIID binds to promoters”. Indeed, in the original manuscript, we speculated in the Discussion section that TFIID may not behave as a single monolithic complex. Rather, it could behave as a dynamic hub such that subunits would come and leave the ‘complex’ with different dynamics. This speculative model of a dynamic complex would be consistent with Halo-TAFs having different residence times as measured by SPT. Also, it would also be consistent with TAF1 and TAF4 having different CUT&amp;Tag profiles after TBP depletion if they have different residence times on DNA.</p><p>In the revised version, we have removed references to the TAF dynamics since we have removed the SPT data. Instead, we include references to previous studies showing that TAFs form subcomplexes and may assemble into TFIID in a modular fashion. We also include new gel filtration data showing that TAF4 does not form other complexes when TBP is depleted, and new analysis of the TAF4 IP-MS data showing no change in the relative stoichiometries of the TAF subunits when TBP is depleted (see response to consensus comment 3). These new data and analyses are consistent with our conclusion that the full TFIID complex forms when TBP is depleted. However, biochemical detection of the full complex does not necessarily provide clear information on how the subunits bind to DNA. The behavior of individual subunits would be a combination of the dynamics of its association with the full complex, and the rate of dissociation from the DNA. Techniques such as CUT&amp;Tag would be heavily influenced by how long TFs bind to DNA (residence time), which is inversely proportional to the rate of dissociation. Therefore, we argue that the IP-MS and CUT&amp;Tag data do not provide contradictory information. Rather, they provide information on different aspects of TAF behaviors.</p><p>We also note that new studies using live cell imaging are beginning to show that biochemically isolated complexes can have very dynamic behaviors in live cells. These new studies are leading to a revised concept of a ‘complex’ in cellular context, including the CTCF/Cohesin complex in mESCs (Hansen et al. 2019 <italic>eLife</italic>; Gabriele et al. 2022 <italic>Science</italic>). With this new framework in mind, it is possible for a biochemical complex to form (TFIID as measured by IP-MS) while also having distinct subunit dynamics that manifests as different binding profiles measured by CUT&amp;Tag.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Given the important implications of the study, we request that the Cut&amp;Tag data be consolidated by a TBP ChIP-seq with and without auxin treatment to fully ensure that TBP has been depleted from promoters. Similarly, it is essential to assess promoter recruitment of TFIIA and TFIIB upon TBP depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we have performed ChIP-qPCR on select promoters to assess TBP occupancy after depletion. We observed decreases in ChIP levels down to IgG background levels, and this data is now included in the revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and is referenced in the main text. Importantly, the ChIP-qPCR results are consistent with the CUT&amp;Tag data, which shows over 90% depletion at promoter regions genome-wide. Taken together, we have provided five orthogonal experiments to validate the TBP depletion system – Western, IF, ChIP-qPCR, CUT&amp;Tag, and IP-MS.</p><p>We also agree that assessing TFIIA and TFIIB promoter occupancy after TBP depletion would be informative. Towards addressing this comment, we have performed spike-in normalized CUT&amp;Tag using anti-TFIIA and TFIIB. The TFIIA CUT&amp;Tag was successful, but the TFIIB antibodies did not produce signal above IgG background (we tried both Santa Cruz Biotechnology α-TFIIB (C-18) sc-225 and Cell Signaling Technology α-TFIIB 2F6A3H4). We aim to examine TFIIB through other means and other PIC members in the future. For now, we have included the results for TFIIA CUT&amp;Tag in control and TBP-depleted conditions in revised Figure 6, with replicate information now shown in new Figure 6—figure supplement 2. A summary of the findings are now included in the main manuscript. Briefly, we found that TFIIA binding to promoters is decreased by ~50-60% relative to control conditions when TBP is depleted. We also performed a reanalysis of the TAF4 IP-MS data, which shows that the interaction between TFIIA and TAF4 is decreased when TBP is depleted (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A), even though we observed no change in TFIIA protein levels (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A). Consistent with the lack of effect on Pol II occupancy and activity, however, the genes that experience loss of TFIIA binding show no change in Pol II binding (Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,C). Therefore, we conclude that TBP depletion affects distinct members of the PIC, but that the system remains sufficiently robust to allow for Pol II transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In addition, assessment of TFIID assembly in absence of TBP by gel filtration would also strengthen the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that determining the nature of TFIID without TBP would be informative. As we discussed in our response to consensus comment #1, we have performed a gel filtration experiment on nuclear lysates in control and TBP depleted cells. We detected no changes in TAF4 elution patterns between control and TBP depleted conditions, and this data is now presented in revised Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We chose to analyze the nuclear fraction to specifically focus on the complex that could form on promoters, which means that we are blind to the existence of subcomplexes found in the cytoplasm. However, by analyzing the IP-MS data, we observe that the relative stoichiometries of TAF subunits do not change when TBP is depleted. Therefore, regardless of the nature of any subcomplexes forming in the cytoplasm, we show that their interactions do not change when TBP is depleted. We have now included this analysis in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Lastly, the effect of TBP depletion on Pol I transcription should be addressed and the text revised to tone down the interpretation as it is virtually impossible to exclude the idea that residual TBP is sufficient to ensure PIC formation.</p><p>We look forward to a revised version where these issues and those in the referee's reports have been addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>To determine the effects of TBP depletion on Pol I transcription, we examined two orthogonal data sets: (1) NET-seq data; and (2) previously published chromatin-associated RNA-seq on control and TBP-depleted mESCs (PMID: 29939130). For both data sets, we quantified the signal for all rRNA genes in the mm10 genome in control and TBP-depleted conditions, and plotted the data as a scatter plot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In both data sets, the data for all rRNA genes fall mostly on the diagonal. These results suggest that, like Pol II, Pol I transcription may not be affected by acute TBP depletion. However, a more stringent examination is needed, much like we have done for Pol II, but this is beyond the scope of this manuscript and we look forward to pursuing this new direction in future studies.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83810-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We agree with the reviewers that the interpretation of our results need to be restricted. Throughout the manuscript, we have revised the text to adhere strictly to the conclusion that acute TBP depletion does not affect Pol II transcription. Furthermore, in the Discussion section, we have provided a thorough discussion on the inherent limitations of the mAID system and what it could mean for our study. We also added that although TBP depletion does not affect Pol II transcription, our system does not provide information on what TBP is doing when bound to promoters. Specifically, we state: “However, these results do not provide information on the functional role of TBP when recruited to Pol II promoters. One possibility is that Pol II transcription has evolved to have multiple redundancies such that removal of one factor (TBP) may not fully disrupt the whole system. Another possibility is that the transient nature of the embryonic cell state, with its unique chromatin landscape, enables Pol II transcription without TBP.” (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Unfortunately, the TFIIB antibody was not successful in the assay, but the TFIIA CUT&amp;Tag shows strong signal at the TSS of all active genes (revised Figure 6) in control conditions. TBP-depletion led to a decrease in TFIIA binding by 50-60%, as measured by the genome-wide average profile. Consistent with the TAF4 results, the decrease in TFIIA binding when TBP is depleted suggests that: (1) Pol II is robust enough that a decrease in binding of some of the GTFs does not disrupt its activity; and (2) although Pol II transcription is unaffected, the PIC may undergo major changes in dynamics and/or DNA-binding kinetics. These findings are now summarized in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, a reanalysis of the TAF4 IP-MS data shows that the interaction between TAF4(TFIID) with TFIIA is significantly reduced when TBP is depleted.

We assessed mAID-TBP levels +/- IAA through Western blot analysis for each fraction.

We have now included this cell fractionation experiment as a new panel in Figure1—figure supplement 1, and have referenced it in the main Results section.

What if the remaining 10000-20000 TBP molecules can still work in Pol II transcription because they are very dynamic?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous biochemical studies, especially in vitro transcription experiments, have shown numerous evidence that TBP is necessary and sufficient for Pol II transcription. We agree that our system can only test if TBP is required/necessary for Pol II transcription in mESCs. We have revised the manuscript to specifically adhere to the conclusion that acute TBP depletion does not affect Pol II transcription, which we believe is justified by several orthogonal lines of evidence in our study. We agree that we cannot say that TBP has no role/function in Pol II transcription. Towards clarifying this in our manuscript, we also add in our Discussion section the following: “However, these results do not provide information on the functional role of TBP when recruited to Pol II promoters. One possibility is that Pol II transcription has evolved to have multiple redundancies such that removal of one factor (TBP) may not fully disrupt the whole system. Another possibility is that the transient nature of the embryonic cell state, with its unique chromatin landscape, enables Pol II transcription without TBP. Regardless, at the level of TBP depletion that we observe, we conclude that in mESCs Pol II transcription can occur independently of TBP” (pg 14-15).</p><p>Although it is possible, we currently have no evidence to suggest that the decreased levels of TBP after depletion would alter TBP-DNA binding dynamics. SPT analysis for endogenously tagged Halo-TBP has been published (PMID: 29939130) shows that TBP is one of the more stable-binding TFs imaged thus far, with average residence times on the order of minutes (~60-90 seconds). In contrast, most other TFs have residence times of seconds or less. Indeed, as this reviewer noted below, TBP dynamics is regulated by NC2 and BTAF1 complexes (Mot1 in yeast). These enzymes have been shown to be required to remove TBP from DNA, which is consistent with the long residence times of TBP. It is unclear how these enzymes would act under severely decreased TBP molecules. However, the Martianov 2002 paper (PMID: 12411709) has shown that TBP knockout embryos were still capable of generating newly transcribed RNA. Our molecular/genomics analyses using TBP depletion are consistent with this previous study, which we cited in our manuscript, and significantly advance the field by considering three potential mechanisms for TBP-independent Pol II transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How many TBP molecules work in Pol I, Pol II and Pol III GTF complexes? If there are many more TFIIIB complexes (containing TBP) than TFIID or SL1 complexes, it is logical that the first effect one will see after TBP depletion is the decrease of Pol III transcription. Can the authors quantify the number of TBP-containing TFIIIB complexes versus TFIID and SL1 complexes?</p></disp-quote><p>Absolute quantification of the number of molecules for TBP (and CTCF in the cited research article) was performed using rigorous Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy of endogenously tagged factors. To our knowledge, no similar study has been performed for Pol I, Pol II, or Pol III GTFs. Furthermore, this FCS approach quantifies molecules and cannot distinguish between different complex-bound molecules. Unfortunately, with the current limitations of the technology, we are unable to address this comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Along the same lines, the authors should also test the effect of TBP depletion on Pol I transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to consensus comment #4 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How dynamic is TBP in comparison to Pol I, Pol II and Pol III TAFs and/or Brf1? What are the corresponding DNA residency times of these factors?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, SPT analysis for endogenously tagged Halo-TBP has been published (PMID: 29939130), revealing long residence times compared to most other TFs. TAF4 and TAF7 have much shorter residence times compared to TBP, as measured by over-expression constructs. For a more rigorous approach, we would need to endogenously tag all factors the reviewer requested and perform the SPT analysis. This is currently not feasible in the time frame, but we are excited to pursue this line of research in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– From Figure S2A it is evident that the most highly depleted genes for TBP binding are the most highly transcribed (high Pol II and NET-seq signals). Could TBP be more dynamic there? The same correlation is visible with TAFs (Figure 7D-F). Could TAFs favor TBP dynamics at promoters (making it more &quot;depletable&quot;, maybe through TAF1 TAND)? Authors should show, side-by-side, the CUT&amp;Tag occupancy heatmaps for TBP, TAF1, TAF4, Pol II and NET-seq with genes ordered by TBP occupancy (+/- IAA).</p></disp-quote><p>Genomics-based analyses such as our CUT&amp;Tag and NET-seq data do not provide information on TBP dynamics. The higher genomics signal is only indicative of binding at the population level, which is correlated to the level of transcription. This observation is generally believed to be one of two reasons: (1) genes that are highly expressed have these factors bound for more time instances compared to less transcribed genes (bursting mechanism); or (2) at a population level, more cells are transcribing these genes while other cells are not (cell-to-cell variability). Therefore, it’s expected that highly expressed genes would have high Pol II signal, and high GTFs (TBP and TAFs) signal because their occupancy are highly correlated to transcription level.</p><p>It is also not surprising that the largest TBP depletion is most evident on promoters with high TBP occupancy, but the relative level of depletion is the same for promoters with high vs low occupancy, about 80-90% depletion. If highly expressed genes are “more depletable”, then the scatter plot in Figure 1E (TBP Ctl vs IAA) would look more exponential than a linear correlation. Instead, the r<sup>2</sup> value for the linear regression analysis is very high, which means that highly expressed genes are experiencing similar levels of TBP depletion as middle/lowly expressed genes.</p><p>Furthermore, as we discussed in previous comments, the previously published residence time of TBP is a description of the average molecule and is independent of locus-specificity. That is, this data lacks information on whether TBP binding dynamics would change depending on which promoter it binds to. It is possible that highly expressed genes would also have more binding of NC2/BTAF1 but this data would still be correlational and would not provide direct evidence of differential TBP binding dynamics.</p><p>In the revised Figure 6—figure supplement 3D, we now include the side-by-side heatmaps for TBP, TAF1, TAF4, TFIIA, Pol II, and NET-seq as ordered by TBP occupancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure Supp. 5G (not cited in the text) shows that under TBP and TBPL1 (TRF2) co-depletion Pol II occupancy increases about 5 fold (in replicate 2). How do the authors explain this increase? Could this be a normalization artefact? How is it possible that authors conclude from these conflicting replicate experiments that Pol II occupancy is not affected globally (lines 242-243)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed two additional replicates of Pol II CUT&amp;Tag in TBP-depletion + TRF2 KO cells (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1I-K). For three of the four replicates, we find that Pol II signal is very similar between the TRF2 knockout and the double TBP-depletion + TRF2 KO. Therefore, we believe that the increase seen in replicate 2 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1J) is likely an artifact of normalization. We have included a citation to (now new) Figure 4—figure supplement 1J in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Experiments described in Figure 6 are lacking several key controls before they can be interpreted. First the authors would need to demonstrate that ALL the &quot;overexpressed&quot; Halo-tagged TAF4 or Halo-TAF7 incorporate into endogenous TFIID complexes. Otherwise the presented Spot-On measurements are meaningless, because the authors may simply measure the behavior of free TAFs. What is the sense of deriving/showing the % of free/complexed/bound states in an overexpressed system (Figure 6)?

We now include the heatmaps for these replicates normalized to S2 reads in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and are referenced in the main text.

Do these correspond to non-specific, transient binding events? If yes one would expect that a portion of the signal localized around promoter regions would also be of the same nature.</p></disp-quote><p>CUT&amp;Tag uses pA-Tn5, which has an intrinsic preference for accessible DNA when integrating the adapters. Although the CUT&amp;Tag protocol is designed to minimize this intrinsic preference, some of the background signals on our IgG CUT&amp;Tag controls are located on accessible DNA (See new Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). The highest expressed genes have been shown to have lower nucleosome occupancy than mid-level expressed genes (PMID: 22085965 and others), and heat shock genes have been shown to be massively depleted of nucleosomes upon activation (PMID: 18614012). We speculate that the CUT&amp;Tag signal that we observe within gene bodies could be a product of the pA-Tn5 integration spreading away from the TSS when the surrounding nucleosomes are disrupted.</p><p>Non-specific transient binding events could contribute to the CUT&amp;Tag signal, but presumably, other genomics-based methods like ChIP-seq would also have a percentage of the signal corresponding to non-specific binding. Our IgG CUT&amp;Tag controls would represent a measure of such non-specific/background binding levels. We have now included the heatmaps for the IgG controls in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1F. With this control, it is evident how strong the specific binding is for our GTFs to the TSS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Heat-shock &amp; RA induction might not be the best systems to test for the &quot;reinitiation&quot; hypothesis since TBP might already be promoter bound prior to activation. Indeed, there is a TBP peak even in non-treated condition in the tracks shown in Figure 3 and S3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the HS response may not be ideal to test for reinitiation because it is well known to be regulated at the paused Pol II stage. We have added this statement in the text to reflect this change:</p><p>“The heat shock response is a classical gene induction system regulated at the level of paused Pol II elongation (ref), and HS genes may retain a scaffold of PIC components following promoter pausing release. Therefore, we also examined the role of TBP in an orthogonal gene activation system through retinoic acid (RA)-mediated differentiation of C64 mESCs, which leads to the silencing of pluripotency markers and activation of ectoderm-specific genes” (pg 8).</p><p>It is unclear in the literature whether the RA-induced genes are regulated through Pol II pausing, but at least some of the genes only have background level TBP CUT&amp;Tag signal at the promoter region, including Cdx1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). We have also examined the change in Pol II CUT&amp;Tag levels relative to TBP CUT&amp;Tag levels in control conditions (see scatter plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83810-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>For each gene, we calculated the total number of normalized Pol II or TBP reads +/- 1 Kb of the TSS.

We highlighted several genes in red whose expression increased upon RA treatment but had very low TBP levels under control conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The RA treatment experiment has to be repeated similarly to the HS experiment, first 6h auxin treatment to degrade TBP and then RA treatment. At the beginning of the RA treatment TBP is still present in the cells making the interpretation of these experiments impossible.</p></disp-quote><p>We had originally planned to do this treatment (6 hours of IAA, then overnight IAA+RA). However, we found that 16-18 hours of IAA treatment is as much as we can do without significant cell death. At 24 hours of TBP depletion, we observe over 50% cell death. So we are limited with our IAA treatment timing to avoid secondary effects due to cell death. Unfortunately, RA treatment does not result in gene expression changes prior to overnight (16-18 hours) of treatment. Most published studies perform 24-48 hours before assessing changes in gene expression. We had done a preliminary test by performing RT-qPCR on two early RA-induced genes and observed no changes after 6 hours of RA treatment, but induction occurred after 16 hours. We believe we are at the cusp of the initial RA effects at 16 hours, and likely this is why we observe only about ~100 differentially expressed genes. Although IAA treatment started concurrently with RA treatment, we believe that the TBP degradation is near complete before the early RA genes are induced. We acknowledge that our compromise of simultaneous IAA+RA 16 hr treatment is not ideal, but we are also limited by the restrictions of the system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In several endogenous TAF IPs TBP has been found to be sub-stoichiometric, could this mean that TBP is not a stable component of mammalian TFIID complexes?

If so, we do not believe that our interpretation would be affected by the DNA/chromatin binding dynamics of TBP as regulated by NC2/BTAF1. Given that previous literature showing TBP is a stable component of TFIID through biochemical purification, and more recently that TBP forms stable ternary complex with TAF11 and TAF13 (PMID: 29111974), our initial prediction was that TFIID would not form when TBP is depleted, but the IP-MS data shows otherwise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The discussion sentence &quot;The IP-MS data showing that the TFIID complex forms upon TBP depletion is surprising&quot; is misleading, since at structural level TBP depletion is not expected to deeply affect any TFIID subunit or complex integrity.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reanalyses and new experiments recommended by all three reviewers, we have revised our Discussion section regarding TFIID.
