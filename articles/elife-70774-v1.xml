appropriate Golgi compartments. Some of the cytosolic machinery required for the steady-state localization of some Golgi enzymes are known but existing models do not explain how many of these enzymes are localized. Here, we uncover the role of an integral membrane protein in yeast, Erd1, as a key facilitator of Golgi glycosyltransferase recycling by directly interacting with both the Golgi enzymes and the cytosolic receptor, Vps74. Loss of Erd1 function results in mislocalization of Golgi enzymes to the vacuole/lysosome. We present evidence that Erd1 forms an integral part of the recycling machinery and ensures productive recycling of several early Golgi enzymes. Our work provides new insights on how the localization of Golgi glycosyltransferases is spatially and temporally regulated, and is finely tuned to the cues of Golgi maturation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Golgi recycling</kwd><kwd>Glycosylation</kwd><kwd>Erd1</kwd><kwd>Vps74</kwd><kwd>glycosyl transferase</kwd><kwd>COG complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Golgi</kwd><kwd>Recycling</kwd><kwd>Glycosylation</kwd><kwd>Erd1</kwd><kwd>Vps74</kwd><kwd>GOLPH3</kwd><kwd>Glycosyltransferase</kwd><kwd>COPI</kwd><kwd>COG complex</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cornell University Research Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CU3704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emr</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM136258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fromme</surname><given-names>J Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transmembrane protein Erd1 and the cytosolic receptor Vps74 cooperate to mediate early Golgi glycosyltransferase recycling in budding yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glycosylation is the most abundant and diverse post-translational protein modification and plays a critical role in modulating protein interactions, stability, and physiological functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stanley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schjoldager et al., 2020</xref>.

However, how these domains contribute collectively to the steady-state localization of these Golgi enzymes is not clear.</p><p>Cisternal maturation is the most established model for Golgi organization and protein recycling, and proposes that Golgi resident proteins are specifically segregated away from anterograde and secretory cargos in the maturing cisternae and packaged into recycling vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pantazopoulou and Glick, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glick and Nakano, 2009</xref>.

The recycling of several Golgi glycosylation and glycosphingolipid synthesis enzymes requires the activity of a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] binding protein, Vps74 (human GOLPH3), that binds to the COPI coat complex and to the cytosolic tails of its client Golgi enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rizzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Welch et al., 2021</xref>. The binding affinities between Vps74 and the cytosolic tails of glycosyltransferases are reported to be weak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmitz et al., 2008</xref>, suggesting that successful retrieval in vivo may require more than binding to Vps74 alone. Considering the TMD and lumenal domains of glycosyltransferases have also been shown to affect recycling, an integral membrane protein capable of extended engagement with the glycosyltransferases, as well as of stabilizing the interactions with cytosolic recycling machinery can provide a key missing mechanistic link in this process.</p><p><italic>erd1</italic> and <italic>erd2</italic> (ER Retention Defective) mutants were isolated three decades ago in a screen for mutants that secrete HDEL-invertase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pelham et al., 1988</xref>.

Despite a strong defect in ER retention of HDEL-invertase and Kar2, as well as defects in Golgi-dependent modification of glycoproteins observed in the <italic>erd1</italic> mutant, the function of Erd1 remains uncharacterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hardwick et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Copic et al., 2009</xref>. Here, we provide evidence that Erd1 chaperones early Golgi glycosylation enzymes throughout their trafficking in the Golgi, and facilitates stable interaction with the cytosolic receptor Vps74, thus acting as a key component of the glycosyltransferase recycling pathway. Membrane-embedded Erd1 and cytosolic Vps74 are together required for successful recycling of a subset of enzymes from late Golgi to early Golgi compartments via COPI vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Golgi localization of glycosyltransferases requires Erd1</title><p>We examined the genome-wide genetic interactions networks for several glycosyltransferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>, and observed significant profile similarity with Erd1.

In wild-type cells, Erd1-GFP exhibited punctate distribution similar to cis-Golgi markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Strikingly, Erd1-GFP was missorted to the vacuole lumen in the <italic>vps74</italic><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> mutant, as indicated by the co-localization with the vacuole lumen stained with the fluorescent dye, CMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This suggests that in the absence of Vps74, Erd1 itself is not incorporated into COPI recycling vesicles and is instead delivered to the vacuole. On the other hand, endogenously tagged mNG-Vps74 co-localized predominantly with the medial-Golgi marker, Gea2, in both WT and <italic>erd1</italic><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf61"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F and 1G</xref>). Thus, whereas Erd1 is not required for recruitment of Vps74, it appears to be required for the function of Vps74 at the Golgi. Even though Vps74 is recruited to the Golgi via its interaction with PI4P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wood et al., 2009</xref>, it is unable to mediate recycling in the <italic>erd1Δ</italic><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf62"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> mutant. These observations also indicate that the Vps74-dependent pathway recycles single pass type II membrane proteins such as glycosyltransferases as well as multi-pass transmembrane proteins such as Erd1.</p><p>If Erd1 and Vps74 cooperate to facilitate recycling, we asked if overexpression of Erd1 and Vps74 can compensate for each other in functional assays. Overexpression of Erd1 in the <italic>vps74</italic>Δ mutant partially suppressed the hygromycin and temperature sensitivity of the <italic>vps74</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of Vps74 in the <italic>erd1</italic>Δ mutant, severely inhibited its growth fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). This toxicity was specifically due to maintenance of Vps74 expressing plasmid, as the growth was normal on rich media with no selection for the plasmid. Mutations in Vps74 that disrupt COPI binding (<italic>vps74 R6-8A</italic>) or oligomerization (<italic>vps74</italic>Δ<italic>201–204</italic>) alleviated the toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). One interpretation of these results is that overexpression of Vps74 in the <italic>erd1</italic>Δ mutant resulted in futile Vps74-COPI complexes that reduced the level of free COPI available for Golgi function. Consistent with this, the <italic>erd1Δsec21-1</italic> mutant, defective in Erd1 and COPI function, exhibited a similar synthetic growth defect even at permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicate significant interdependence between Erd1 and Vps74 in the COPI-mediated intra-Golgi recycling of specific Golgi cargos.</p><p>Erd1 has previously been proposed to play a role in Golgi ion homeostasis by transporting phosphate from the Golgi lumen to the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Snyder et al., 2017</xref>. The <italic>erd1</italic>Δ mutant led to loss of phosphate (Pi) via exocytosis, and required 1.5-fold higher concentration of Pi in the media for 50% maximal growth as compared to wild type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Snyder et al., 2017</xref>. To test if the effect of Erd1 on glycosyltransferase recycling is distinct from effects on ionic balance, we compared the <italic>erd1</italic>Δ phenotypes with that of <italic>pmr1</italic>Δ mutant. Pmr1 pumps Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions into the Golgi lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dürr et al., 1998</xref>. As expected, deletion of Pmr1 results in a similar Gas1 glycosylation defect as loss of Erd1 or Vps74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, while supplementing the media with Ca2+ or Mn2+ rescued the glycosylation defect observed in <italic>pmr1</italic>Δ mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), supplementing the media with even 50-fold higher Pi did not rescue the glycosylation defect in the <italic>erd1</italic>Δ mutant. Importantly, despite the glycosylation defect, <italic>pmr1</italic>Δ mutant had no defect in the localization and recycling of Kre2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Therefore, while it is possible that Erd1 plays a role in phosphate homeostasis at the early Golgi, our data support a distinct role of Erd1 in also being required for glycosyltransferase recycling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Erd1 directly interacts with glycosyltransferases and Vps74 to facilitate recycling</title><p>Based on our observations, we predicted that Erd1 directly interacts with Vps74 as well as glycosyltransferases.

These observations are consistent with sequential association of Erd1 and Vps74 with their client cargos and packaging into COPI vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Our data support a model where engagement of Erd1 with the membrane bound cargos allows stable interaction with Vps74, and commits them for recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). By chaperoning the early Golgi enzymes throughout the recycling process, Erd1 allows productive coordination of Vps74 binding with the timing of cargo recycling in the spatio-temporal context of Golgi cisternal maturation. Erd1 itself is also a cargo of the Vps74 pathway, and it is possible that Erd1’s role in Golgi recycling could be more complex and it may be involved in distinct steps for Golgi to ER Vps74-independent and intra-Golgi Vps74-dependent recycling steps.</p><p>Overall, our work demonstrates a role of Erd1 in Golgi protein recycling, and provides a mechanistic basis for the observed glycosylation defects. This work also provides new insight on how cooperative, yet hierarchical engagement of transmembrane (Erd1) and cytosolic receptors (Vps74), likely with different domains of their transmembrane cargos, is important for productive recycling. By extended engagement with the cargos, and with the cytosolic recycling machinery, Erd1 might serve as an important quality assurance sensor at multiple steps in the pathway. Other such transmembrane adaptors are also likely to exist. Recent screens in mammalian cells have identified transmembrane proteins TMEM165 and TM9SF2 that may serve similar roles in bridging the Golgi Gb3 synthase A4GALT to cytosolic recycling machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamaji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 2017</xref>. Similarly, transmembrane Erv proteins can serve as receptors for COPII dependent ER to Golgi protein trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barlowe and Miller, 2013</xref>. A lot remains to be discovered to understand the role and the interplay of different components at multiple steps of Golgi enzyme recycling- vesicle tethering complexes such as the COG and GARP complexes, as well as Golgi matrix proteins such as GRASP55 are also required for recycling Golgi glycosylation enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khakurel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pokrovskaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pothukuchi et al., 2021</xref>.

PHO1 localizes to the Golgi and trans-Golgi network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arpat et al., 2012</xref>, and it is possible that the intracellular pools of PHO1 and XPR1 also play roles in protein trafficking. Since glycosylation reactions in the Golgi produce inorganic phosphate (Pi) and protons (H+) as byproducts, these proteins could also help maintain glycosylation homeostasis more broadly. Future analysis will examine how Erd1 engages with only a subset of client glycosyltransferases and with Vps74. A systematic comparison of Erd1 and Vps74 cargo repertoire will also be important to determine the extent of overlap between their clients. Finally, it remains to be determined whether transmembrane proteins in recycling vesicles, such as Erd1, play a role in decisions that allow some COPI retrograde vesicles to be recycled within the Golgi, while others are trafficked to the ER. These and other exciting questions remain to be addressed as we move forward.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>All yeast deletion or chromosomal tagged strains were constructed in the strain background SEY6210 using iterative markerless CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, or using PCR-based amplification and homologous recombination as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>.

Puncta in both channels were defined by thresholding using the Otsu method. Object based co-localization was used to calculate the ratio of overlap between the two channels for ∼250 puncta for each set. The quantification data of each puncta was plotted, and the median and confidence intervals were annotated in violin plots. For generation of time lapse imaging traces, individual Golgi compartments that remained in the same focal plane throughout their lifetimes were used for analysis. Fluorescence intensities for the identified puncta were measured over time and intensity values were normalized to values between 0 and 1 for each channel. Peak-to-peak time values denote the time between maximum intensities of green and red fluorescence signals at individual maturing Golgi puncta.

The mechanism of Golgi enzyme recycling is incompletely understood, but it seems to involve retrograde COPI coated vesicles. In yeast, a subset of Golgi enzymes interact with the peripheral membrane protein Vps74, which is thought to serve as an adaptor for capturing Golgi enzymes in COPI vesicles. The current manuscript identifies the integral membrane protein Erd1 as a facilitator of Golgi enzyme recycling. Evidence is presented that Erd1 interacts with Golgi enzymes as well as Vps74, and that Erd1 is needed for normal Golgi enzyme localization. Therefore, Erd1 is an important new player in the maintenance of Golgi organization.</p><p>This study is of high quality. The data are generally strong, the experiments are logical, and multiple complementary approaches are used to answer the questions. A persuasive case is made that Erd1 plays a role in recycling Golgi enzymes.</p><p>Less persuasive is the interpretation that Erd1 directly activates Vps74 to drive recycling. Much of the evidence is circumstantial--e.g., loss of Erd1 and loss of Vps74 confer similar phenotypes. Skepticism about the authors' interpretation centers around timing during the maturation process:</p><p>– Two of the authors (Highland and Fromme) recently published an analysis of PI4P dynamics, and they concluded that PI4P is a hallmark of the late Golgi, sharing &quot;little overlap with markers of less mature Golgi compartments&quot;.</p><p>– Vps74 has been found to require PI4P for its recruitment, so Vps74 would be expected to reside at the late Golgi. Indeed, even though Vps74 peaks earlier than the late Golgi marker Sec7, it seems to arrive at about the same time as Sec7.</p><p>– By contrast, Erd1 clearly overlaps with early Golgi enzymes, which have mostly departed by the time that Sec7 arrives. It is therefore unclear whether Erd1 and Vps74 overlap for long enough to engage in a direct physical interaction that would drive Golgi enzyme recycling.</p><p>The major recommendation, intended to address the concern raised above is to visualize the maturation kinetics of Erd1 and Vps74 simultaneously.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Based on bioinformatic, biochemical, morphological and genetic data, the authors propose a model of the mechanism of action of ERD1 according to which enzymes belonging to a selected group of glycosyltransferases are retained in the Golgi by recycling via COPI vesicles. According to this model the incorporation of enzymes in vesicles requires a sequential interaction of these enzymes first with ERD1 in the cis golgi and then with GOLPH3 in the medial trans Golgi. The first interaction has, in the proposed model, a preparatory or facilitating role for the second interaction, with GOLPH3, which mediates entry into COPI -dependent retrograde transport vesicles, and therefore the recycling, of the enzymes.</p><p>This is an interesting study in the rapidly developing area of the recycling mechanisms of glycosylation enzymes in Golgi. However, there are some weaknesses, which are outlined below.</p><p>The biochemical data on the binding between ERD1, VPS74 and Golgi enzymes are incomplete and should be completed with the demonstration that ERD1 and client enzymes interact directly, by means of the Y2H technique. This interaction is so far only demonstrated by co-precipitation of ERD1 with GOLPH3 and the enzymes, but these experiments do not exclude that ERD1 which interacts directly with GOLPH3, might interact indirectly with the enzymes, through its direct interaction with GOLPH3. Since the interaction between ERD1 and the client enzymes is at the heart of this study, it should be demonstrated with dedicated experiments.</p><p>On the technical plane, in the experiment in Figure 3C the efficiencies of co-ip in WT cells and in deltaERD1, once corrected for the inputs, do not seem very different. It would be useful to show inputs and IPs in the very same blot and to provide a quantification graph.</p><p>The localization of ERD1, GOLPH3 and enzymes are interpreted by the authors in the context of the ERD1/GOLPH3 synergy model briefly outlined above, and presented in figure 4. However, not all of the data are easily reconcilable with this model.</p><p>The main difficulty is that both ERD1 and its client enzymes appear and recycle in the cis cisterna while GOLPH3 resides in the medial and partly in the trans cisternae, but not in the cis cisterna. Moreover, the scheme presented by the authors in Figure 4 indicates that the recycling of the cis enzymes (eg, Mann9) begins before the appearance of GOLPH3 in the cis cisterna. This is in principle not compatible with the model, unless the authors propose that non-detectable traces of GOLPH3 might be present in the cis cisterna and activate the recycling mechanism there. If the authors show that this is the case, it might be acceptable to present their model in this study. However, given that our understanding of Golgi enzyme recycling is actually in its infancy, the underlying mechanism might be more complex. For example, ERD1 could mediate the recycling of client enzymes in the cis cisterna in synergy with a hitherto unknown adapter other than GOLPH3 (perhaps COPI itself?), and might also mediate the recycling of enzymes in synergy with GOLPH3 in the medial cisterna. This is possible because according to the scheme in figure 4 ERD1 shows a peak in the cis cisterna but is clearly present also in the medial cisterna. Furthermore, all ERD1-dependent enzymes should also be indirectly dependent on GOLPH3 since GOLPH3 depletion causes ERD1 loss and lysosomal degradation. ERD1 might thus be an adapter capable of acting at various levels of the transport system: in Golgi to ER recycling and in glycoenzyme recycling at both the cis and the medial cisterna. This model can explain the data probably better than that presented by the authors in Figure 4, but is more complicated and requires some more assumptions. It is up to the authors to decide whether they want to consider this hypothesis as an alternative model.</p><p>A question that would need to be addressed in this context is whether all the enzymes found by the authors to depend on ERD1 are also GOLPH3 customers and in particular whether they all contain the recognition motif (F / L) – (L / I / V ) -xx- (R / K) for GOLPH3 described by Banfield.</p><p>My recommendations to the authors have already been outlined above. In short, I think that the authors should:</p><p>Characterize the interaction between GOLPH3 and client enzymes by Y2H.</p><p>Discuss the weaknesses of their model as presented in figure 4 and, if they wish, mention the possibility of a more complex mechanism,</p><p>Clarify whether all ERD1 client enzymes contain the motif (F / L) – (L / I / V) -x-x- (R / K),</p><p>Discuss the earlier paper by Okamoto et al., (2008) that is not cited in this study.</p><p>In my opinion the authors should also discuss two recent papers (Rizzo et al; Parashurama et al., both in EMBO J), that are based on the concepts of recycling adapter and retention adapter and propose a model for the localization of GOLPH3-dependent enzymes in Golgi compartments in the context of cisternal maturation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors investigate the role of the yeast protein Erd1 in Golgi-dependent glycosylation. They conclude that Erd1 acts with Vps74, a known retention factor for Golgi glycosyltransferases, to direct the recycling of these enzymes in COPI-coated vesicles in the Golgi stack. The data are well presented and quantified, and the paper is clearly written. Addressing the role of Erd1, and insight into how glycosyltransferases are retained in the Golgi, are both interesting questions, but the authors data do not preclude alternative interpretations, and one or two aspects require resolution. These issues are summarized below:</p><p>1) A role for Erd1 in acting as a coreceptor with Vps74 to recycle glycosyltransferases is interesting but also raises some questions. Firstly, Erd1 is only found in fungi and not in metazoans, whereas Vps74 has metazoan orthologs that are known to play a role in glycosyltransferase recycling raising the question of why Erd1 is only needed in yeast. Secondly, there is published evidence for Erd1 acting as a channel/transporter for the movement of phosphate out of the Golgi lumen, and indeed the entire protein comprises a domain (the EXS domain) that is present in known phosphate transporters in plants and metazoans. Thus, careful dissection is required to determine if the effects seen are direct via an interaction with glycosylation enzymes, or if they are an indirect consequence of a perturbation of the Golgi lumen due to accumulation of inorganic phosphate. The fact that Erd1 was originally identified as having a defect in the retrieval of soluble ER residents from the Golgi suggests that the Golgi lumen may well be perturbed, possibly by a change in pH or cation content, and it is known that alterations in these features of the Golgi can affect glycosylation.</p><p>2) Perhaps the most striking finding is that Erd1 co-precipitates with Vps74 and that the presence of Erd1 is required for Vps74 to efficiently co-precipitate with the glycosyltransfereases that it is known to bind. However, the authors also show that the glycosyltransferases are destabilized by the loss of Erd1, and so the loss of apparent interaction may simply reflect the fact that there is less protein present to co-precipitate. Secondly, the authors show that Erd1 and Vps74 do not substantially co-localize, and so any tripartite complex would have to reflect a small sub-population of the proteins that briefly come together later in the Golgi stack during formation of COPI coated vesicles that are to be recycled. Finally, Vps74 is known to bind to COPI, and so if Erd1 also bound to COPI, then Vps74 and Erd1 may co-precipitate because they are held together via COPI, with Vps74 then bringing some glycosyltransferases into the complex.</p><p>3) Some aspects of the data may need resolving. Firstly, the authors provide clear images showing degradation of Och1p-GFP and Kre2-GFP in the vacuole in the absence of Erd1 (Figure 1F). However, the immunoblots in Figure 3D indicate that the levels of the intact proteins are unchanged in the absence of Erd1 which suggests that they are not destabilized and degraded. Secondly, the authors use the split ubiquitin system to provide evidence for an interaction between Erd1 and Vps74. As a control they remove the &quot;cytoplasmic-tail&quot; from Erd1, but they do not state how many residues were removed. The structural prediction for the EXS domain in Pfam suggests that the last membrane spanning helix of Erd1 would be very close to the C-terminus (Pfam entry PF03124), and the location of the truncation is not tested. Finally, the authors show some nice live cell imaging data to follow Golgi maturation. However, they do not directly compare Vps74 and Erd1. Such a comparison would be very helpful, especially as it seems from the other graphs that Erd1 is significantly depleted from the maturing cisterna before the time when there are substantial amounts of Vps74 present.</p><p>The prior publications on Erd1, the absence of an orthologue in mammals even though they have a Vps74 ortholog, and the potential role of COPI as a bridge between the two proteins, really necessitate a much more in depth and substantial analysis for a broad readership journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>. Ideally, in vitro reconstitution of binding with purified proteins would resolve many issues, but I appreciate that this may be technically challenging. Below I have suggested some things that could be done to strengthen the paper's conclusions, and at the very least these may be helpful to the authors to consider before resubmitting elsewhere:</p><p>1) Examination of the effect of other gene deletions that affect the ionic content of the Golgi such as deletion of Gdt1, Pmr1 or Stv1, on Och1p-GFP and Ktr2p-GFP levels and on glycosylation.</p><p>2) Resolution of the apparent contradiction of the effects of Erd1 deletion on Och1 and Ktr2 by microscopy and blotting assays. If available, antibodies to the endogenous proteins could be used to test their levels in wild type and mutants.</p><p>3) Does the mutation in the COPI binding site of Vps74 affect its Golgi localization? If not, the authors should check if this prevents the co-ip with Erd1.</p><p>4) It would be very valuable to add videos and graphs to follow the Golgi localization of Erd1 vs Vps74 to better reveal their spatial relationship over time.</p><p>5) Substantial new insight would be provided by determining what part of at least of the Erd1-dependent glycosyltransferases interacts with Erd1. This could be addressed by making chimeric proteins that contain only either the cytoplasmic tail, or the TMD, or the lumenal domain of a Erd1-dependent glycosyltransferase in the context of an Erd1-indepenent glycosyltransferase. The localization and co-ip of these chimeras could be then be tested.</p><p>6) The authors argue that the cytoplasmic tail of Erd1 interacts with Vps74. This could be tested biochemically as has been done for the tails of glycosyltransferases. If the authors keep the split-ubiquitin experiments they should confirm that the constructs are localized to the Golgi.</p><p>7) Are their glycosyltransferases that do no rely on Vps74? It would be useful to test if these are affected by loss of Erd1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70774.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reason for these revisions is that the evidence about the role of Erd1 could be consistent with mechanisms different from the one presented in the manuscript.

Kinetic analysis of Erd1 and Vps74 suggests a temporal overlap between the two, consistent with our model that arrival of Vps74 coincides with the packaging and departure of the cargos in COPI vesicles. Erd1 kinetics resemble earlyGolgi proteins, some of which have been previously reported to be Vps74 clients and have a similar overlap time with Vps74 as Erd1. The temporal overlap is also consistent with our kinetic analysis of Erd1 and Vps74 with early (Mnn9), medial (Gea2) and late (Sec7) Golgi markers (see Figure 4 A-F and Figure 4-supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A related issue is that Erd1 seems to resemble glycosyltransferases in being a cargo of Vps74-mediated recycling.

The nature of the Y2H assay requires the tag to be present on the cytosolic facing end of the proteins being tested for interaction. All glycosyltransferases are Type II single TM proteins, with the N terminus in the cytosol, and the C terminus in the lumen. To make sure the tagged constructs localized as expected, we tested the localization of N- and C-terminally GFP tagged glycosyltransferases, Kre2 and Och1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, while C-terminal tagged Kre2-GFP exhibits a punctate Golgi localization (right), N-terminal tagged GFP-Kre2 (left) is significantly retained in the ER (likely by interfering with COPII packaging). These observations clarified why the Y2H assay was unable to score the interaction between Erd1 and the glycosyltransferases.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70774-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We also attempted to purify GST tagged full length Erd1 from yeast cells for in vitro binding experiments but were unable to obtain enough protein needed for the analysis. Finally, as an alternative strategy, we employed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to test interaction between Erd1 and glycosyltransferases with tags fused to the termini facing the lumen. This assay has been employed to score interactions between Vps74-Vps74 and Vps74Sac1 previously (Cai et al., JCB 2014, Wood et al., MBoC 2012). We observed reconstitution of fluorescence signal in the BiFC assay in strains expressing Och1-mNG<sup>1-10</sup> and Erd1-mNG<sup>11</sup>. As expected, the BiFC signal co-localized with the cis-Golgi marker Mnn9-mCherry. We have included this data in Figure 3A. While we cannot rule out the possibility of an indirect interaction, these results in combination with other data presented in the manuscript, make a compelling case for a close interaction between Erd1 and its client glycosyltransferases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Carefully evaluate the earlier work implicating Erd1 in fungal phosphate transport, especially in light of the statement by Reviewer #3 that the entire Erd1 protein is an EXS domain.

We completely agree with the reviewers that the ionic environment of the Golgi is expected to affect normal glycosylation. We have now included multiple controls, that demonstrate that our observations on the role in Golgi glycosyltransferase recycling is distinct from just an effect on the ionic environment.</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we compared the effects of Erd1 and Pmr1 (Golgi Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> transporter) on glycosylation and glycosyltransferase recycling. We observed that both erd1∆ and pmr1∆ mutants exhibit defects in glycosylation of Gas1 reporter (see Figure 2- supplement 2A). However, unlike erd1∆ mutant, the pmr1∆ mutant shows no defect in the localization and recycling of Kre2 (see Figure 2- supplement 2D). If the primary defect is an ionic imbalance, then supplementing the media with the key ion will be expected to rescue the observed glycosylation defects. Synder et al., had reported that erd1∆ mutant requires 1.5fold higher phosphate concentration in the media for 50% maximal growth as compared to wild type, and that Erd1 likely limits the export of Pi from wild type cells via exocytosis. However, supplementing the media with higher concentration of Pi (even at concentrations needed to support the growth of erd1∆ pho∆-5 mutant reported in Synder et al.,) did not rescue the glycosylation defects observed in erd1∆ (see Figure 2- supplement 2B). On the other hand, supplementing the media with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (complete rescue) or Mn<sup>2+</sup> (partial rescue) suppressed the glycosylation defect observed in pmr1∆ mutant (see Figure 2- supplement 2C). Therefore, while it is possible that Erd1 plays a role in phosphate homeostasis at the early Golgi, our data support an additional role of Erd1 (distinct from other ion transporters at the Golgi) in also being required for glycosyltransferase recycling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Cite and discuss the earlier paper by Okamoto et al.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and apologize for the oversight.

The mechanism of Golgi enzyme recycling is incompletely understood, but it seems to involve retrograde COPI coated vesicles. In yeast, a subset of Golgi enzymes interact with the peripheral membrane protein Vps74, which is thought to serve as an adaptor for capturing Golgi enzymes in COPI vesicles. The current manuscript identifies the integral membrane protein Erd1 as a facilitator of Golgi enzyme recycling. Evidence is presented that Erd1 interacts with Golgi enzymes as well as Vps74, and that Erd1 is needed for normal Golgi enzyme localization. Therefore, Erd1 is an important new player in the maintenance of Golgi organization.</p><p>This study is of high quality. The data are generally strong, the experiments are logical, and multiple complementary approaches are used to answer the questions. A persuasive case is made that Erd1 plays a role in recycling Golgi enzymes.</p><p>Less persuasive is the interpretation that Erd1 directly activates Vps74 to drive recycling. Much of the evidence is circumstantial--e.g., loss of Erd1 and loss of Vps74 confer similar phenotypes. Skepticism about the authors' interpretation centers around timing during the maturation process:</p><p>– Two of the authors (Highland and Fromme) recently published an analysis of PI4P dynamics, and they concluded that PI4P is a hallmark of the late Golgi, sharing &quot;little overlap with markers of less mature Golgi compartments&quot;.</p><p>– Vps74 has been found to require PI4P for its recruitment, so Vps74 would be expected to reside at the late Golgi. Indeed, even though Vps74 peaks earlier than the late Golgi marker Sec7, it seems to arrive at about the same time as Sec7.</p><p>– By contrast, Erd1 clearly overlaps with early Golgi enzymes, which have mostly departed by the time that Sec7 arrives. It is therefore unclear whether Erd1 and Vps74 overlap for long enough to engage in a direct physical interaction that would drive Golgi enzyme recycling.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing our work and the importance of our findings.</p><p>We find it quite interesting how Erd1, an integral membrane protein that localizes with its client early Golgi enzymes, and Vps74, a peripheral membrane protein that is recruited to medial Golgi compartments can cooperatively facilitate recycling. As reported in Highland et al., PI4P is indeed a hallmark of the late Golgi compartments. Additionally, previous work from Wood et al., has shown the important of PI4P binding for stable association of Vps74 with the Golgi, and the co-localization of Vps74 with medial Golgi markers. Our kinetic analysis of Vps74 association with the Golgi in the context of Golgi maturation agree with these previous findings and suggest more complex dynamics than just PI4P association. We find that Vps74 arrives at the Golgi after the medial Golgi marker, Gea2 when the PI4P levels are low, but perhaps enough to recruit Vps74. Vps74 peaks and leaves before peak Sec7 or PI4P signal. These observations suggest that in addition to PI4P, protein-protein interactions likely also play a role in regulating Vps74 recruitment and departure at the medial-late Golgi transition. Simultaneous analysis of Erd1 and Vps74 indicates a temporal overlap, and arrival of Vps74 marks the beginning of departure of Erd1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major recommendation, intended to address the concern raised above is to visualize the maturation kinetics of Erd1 and Vps74 simultaneously.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now included simultaneous kinetic analysis of Erd1 and Vps74. This data is included in Figure 4G. As mentioned above, these results are consistent with our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Based on bioinformatic, biochemical, morphological and genetic data, the authors propose a model of the mechanism of action of ERD1 according to which enzymes belonging to a selected group of glycosyltransferases are retained in the Golgi by recycling via COPI vesicles. According to this model the incorporation of enzymes in vesicles requires a sequential interaction of these enzymes first with ERD1 in the cis golgi and then with GOLPH3 in the medial trans Golgi. The first interaction has, in the proposed model, a preparatory or facilitating role for the second interaction, with GOLPH3, which mediates entry into COPI -dependent retrograde transport vesicles, and therefore the recycling, of the enzymes.</p><p>This is an interesting study in the rapidly developing area of the recycling mechanisms of glycosylation enzymes in Golgi. However, there are some weaknesses, which are outlined below.</p><p>The biochemical data on the binding between ERD1, VPS74 and Golgi enzymes are incomplete and should be completed with the demonstration that ERD1 and client enzymes interact directly, by means of the Y2H technique. This interaction is so far only demonstrated by co-precipitation of ERD1 with GOLPH3 and the enzymes, but these experiments do not exclude that ERD1 which interacts directly with GOLPH3, might interact indirectly with the enzymes, through its direct interaction with GOLPH3. Since the interaction between ERD1 and the client enzymes is at the heart of this study, it should be demonstrated with dedicated experiments.</p><p>On the technical plane, in the experiment in Figure 3C the efficiencies of co-ip in WT cells and in deltaERD1, once corrected for the inputs, do not seem very different. It would be useful to show inputs and Ips in the very same blot and to provide a quantification graph.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestions.</p><p>As mentioned in the response to essential revisions above, we were unable to utilize the Y2H assay to score interaction between Erd1 and glycosyltransferases due to interference of the Nterminal Y2H tag with the Golgi localization of glycosyltransferases. By tagging the uminal ends, we were able to successfully employ a BiFC based approach to monitor interaction between Erd1 and Och1, as well as that between Erd1 and Vps74. These data are included in Figure 3A. We have also included the inputs and Ips from WT and erd1∆ mutant on the same blot and added a quantitation graph from multiple repeats of the experiment. These data are included in Figure 3D, 3E, Figure 3- supplement 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The localization of ERD1, GOLPH3 and enzymes are interpreted by the authors in the context of the ERD1/GOLPH3 synergy model briefly outlined above, and presented in figure 4. However, not all of the data are easily reconcilable with this model.</p><p>The main difficulty is that both ERD1 and its client enzymes appear and recycle in the cis cisterna while GOLPH3 resides in the medial and partly in the trans cisternae, but not in the cis cisterna. Moreover, the scheme presented by the authors in Figure 4 indicates that the recycling of the cis enzymes (eg, Mann9) begins before the appearance of GOLPH3 in the cis cisterna. This is in principle not compatible with the model, unless the authors propose that non-detectable traces of GOLPH3 might be present in the cis cisterna and activate the recycling mechanism there. If the authors show that this is the case, it might be acceptable to present their model in this study. However, given that our understanding of Golgi enzyme recycling is actually in its infancy, the underlying mechanism might be more complex. For example, ERD1 could mediate the recycling of client enzymes in the cis cisterna in synergy with a hitherto unknown adapter other than GOLPH3 (perhaps COPI itself?), and might also mediate the recycling of enzymes in synergy with GOLPH3 in the medial cisterna. This is possible because according to the scheme in figure 4 ERD1 shows a peak in the cis cisterna but is clearly present also in the medial cisterna. Furthermore, all ERD1-dependent enzymes should also be indirectly dependent on GOLPH3 since GOLPH3 depletion causes ERD1 loss and lysosomal degradation. ERD1 might thus be an adapter capable of acting at various levels of the transport system: in Golgi to ER recycling and in glycoenzyme recycling at both the cis and the medial cisterna. This model can explain the data probably better than that presented by the authors in Figure 4, but is more complicated and requires some more assumptions. It is up to the authors to decide whether they want to consider this hypothesis as an alternative model.</p><p>A question that would need to be addressed in this context is whether all the enzymes found by the authors to depend on ERD1 are also GOLPH3 customers and in particular whether they all contain the recognition motif (F / L) – (L / I / V ) -xx- (R / K) for GOLPH3 described by Banfield.</p></disp-quote><p>While we present a simpler model, we agree with the reviewer that it is possible that the mechanism of protein recycling in the Golgi may be more complex for different cargos- with Erd1 assisting in Vps74-independent (for Golgi to ER recycling) and Vps74-dependent (for intra- Golgi recycling) steps. Indeed, Erd1 was identified in a screen for mutants defective in recycling of ER residents. Exploring these roles of Erd1 would require a more systematic approach in the future.</p><p>Using simultaneous kinetic analysis, we find that Erd1 and Vps74 do overlap (figure 4G). This interaction can also be captured by the BiFC and immunoprecipitation (figure 3A, 3B). Erd1 kinetics resemble early-Golgi proteins, some of which have been previously reported to be Vps74 clients and have a similar overlap time with Vps74 as Erd1. We think that these observations support a synergy model, but we agree with the reviewer about the possibility of a dual step role for Erd1.</p><p>As the reviewer correctly noted, since Erd1 itself requires Vps74 for its recycling, it is difficult to tease apart Erd1-only from Vps74 dependent clients. Indeed, all the glycosyltransferases that we tested and found to be dependent on Erd1, were also dependent on Vps74 for their recycling. This subset of glycoenzymes do appear to contain (F/L)-(I/L/V)-x-x-(R/K) sequence in their cytosolic tails previously proposed to bind Vps74 (figure 2- supplement 2E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My recommendations to the authors have already been outlined above. In short, I think that the authors should:</p><p>Characterize the interaction between GOLPH3 and client enzymes by Y2H.</p><p>Discuss the weaknesses of their model as presented in figure 4 and, if they wish, mention the possibility of a more complex mechanism,</p><p>Clarify whether all ERD1 client enzymes contain the motif (F / L) – (L / I / V) -x-x- (R / K),</p><p>Discuss the earlier paper by Okamoto et al., (2008) that is not cited in this study.</p><p>In my opinion the authors should also discuss two recent papers (Rizzo et al; Parashurama et al., both in EMBO J), that are based on the concepts of recycling adapter and retention adapter and propose a model for the localization of GOLPH3-dependent enzymes in Golgi compartments in the context of cisternal maturation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the feedback.

They conclude that Erd1 acts with Vps74, a known retention factor for Golgi glycosyltransferases, to direct the recycling of these enzymes in COPI-coated vesicles in the Golgi stack. The data are well presented and quantified, and the paper is clearly written. Addressing the role of Erd1, and insight into how glycosyltransferases are retained in the Golgi, are both interesting questions, but the authors data do not preclude alternative interpretations, and one or two aspects require resolution. These issues are summarized below:</p><p>1) A role for Erd1 in acting as a coreceptor with Vps74 to recycle glycosyltransferases is interesting but also raises some questions. Firstly, Erd1 is only found in fungi and not in metazoans, whereas Vps74 has metazoan orthologs that are known to play a role in glycosyltransferase recycling raising the question of why Erd1 is only needed in yeast. Secondly, there is published evidence for Erd1 acting as a channel/transporter for the movement of phosphate out of the Golgi lumen, and indeed the entire protein comprises a domain (the EXS domain) that is present in known phosphate transporters in plants and metazoans. Thus, careful dissection is required to determine if the effects seen are direct via an interaction with glycosylation enzymes, or if they are an indirect consequence of a perturbation of the Golgi lumen due to accumulation of inorganic phosphate. The fact that Erd1 was originally identified as having a defect in the retrieval of soluble ER residents from the Golgi suggests that the Golgi lumen may well be perturbed, possibly by a change in pH or cation content, and it is known that alterations in these features of the Golgi can affect glycosylation.</p><p>2) Perhaps the most striking finding is that Erd1 co-precipitates with Vps74 and that the presence of Erd1 is required for Vps74 to efficiently co-precipitate with the glycosyltransfereases that it is known to bind. However, the authors also show that the glycosyltransferases are destabilized by the loss of Erd1, and so the loss of apparent interaction may simply reflect the fact that there is less protein present to co-precipitate. Secondly, the authors show that Erd1 and Vps74 do not substantially co-localize, and so any tripartite complex would have to reflect a small sub-population of the proteins that briefly come together later in the Golgi stack during formation of COPI coated vesicles that are to be recycled. Finally, Vps74 is known to bind to COPI, and so if Erd1 also bound to COPI, then Vps74 and Erd1 may co-precipitate because they are held together via COPI, with Vps74 then bringing some glycosyltransferases into the complex.</p><p>3) Some aspects of the data may need resolving. Firstly, the authors provide clear images showing degradation of Och1p-GFP and Kre2-GFP in the vacuole in the absence of Erd1 (Figure 1F). However, the immunoblots in Figure 3D indicate that the levels of the intact proteins are unchanged in the absence of Erd1 which suggests that they are not destabilized and degraded. Secondly, the authors use the split ubiquitin system to provide evidence for an interaction between Erd1 and Vps74. As a control they remove the &quot;cytoplasmic-tail&quot; from Erd1, but they do not state how many residues were removed. The structural prediction for the EXS domain in Pfam suggests that the last membrane spanning helix of Erd1 would be very close to the C-terminus (Pfam entry PF03124), and the location of the truncation is not tested. Finally, the authors show some nice live cell imaging data to follow Golgi maturation. However, they do not directly compare Vps74 and Erd1. Such a comparison would be very helpful, especially as it seems from the other graphs that Erd1 is significantly depleted from the maturing cisterna before the time when there are substantial amounts of Vps74 present.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. We acknowledge that the role of Erd1 in phosphate transport is likely an important function. However, as mentioned above in our response to essential revision, we have now included data to show the effect on protein recycling upon the loss of Erd1 cannot be reconciled by just changes in the Golgi ionic environment, and this effect is distinct from that due to the loss of Pmr1 (Figure 2- supplement 2). Our observations also suggest that like Erd1 in yeast, other transmembrane proteins may play similar roles in GOLPH3 dependent recycling in metazoans. We were also surprised to observe that despite the recycling defect observed in erd1∆ and vps74∆ mutants, we saw a modest reduction in steady state levels of tagged Kre2 or Och1 on western blots. This may be reflective of upregulated biosynthesis or slower degradation of these constructs in the vacuolar lumen. We also confirmed that tagged Och1 can complement the temperature sensitivity of och1∆ mutant and is functional (Figure 4- supplement 1D). Reduced co-immunoprecipitation of Vps74 and Och1/Kre2 in the absence of Erd1 may be exacerbated by the fact that a significant fraction of Och1/Kre2 are sequestered away from the Golgi. However, this is in part mediated because of a defect in productive recycling complex formation required to maintain these enzymes at the Golgi, highlighting the importance of Erd1’s role in the pathway.</p><p>We have now included a simultaneous kinetic analysis of Vps74 and Erd1 and show that there is overlap between the two (figure 4G). Additionally, using split-fluorescent protein complementation to monitor protein-protein interactions, we show that Erd1 interacts with wild type Vps74, as well as Vps74 R6-8A COPI binding mutant, suggesting the interaction between Erd1 and Vps74 is not bridged via COPI binding (figure 3A).</p><p>The C-terminal truncation of Erd1 employed in the Y2H assay, was initially generated based on the original truncation mutation identified in the ‘erd’ screen by Hardwick et al., along with the cytosolic region prediction on the Uniprot database and lacks the last 100 aa. Based on structural modeling of Erd1 using AlphaFold, we agree that truncation likely disrupts the intramembrane helices of the EXS domain. We subsequently also generated truncations of Cterminal 10 and 50 aa to test Y2H interaction with Vps74, but they all affected protein stability. It is unclear if they are degraded because of loss of interaction with Vps74 or structural instability and cannot be conclusively used to inform of the interaction region with Vps74 and have not been included in the revised manuscript. How Erd1 interacts with Vps74 will require more in-depth analysis in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The prior publications on Erd1, the absence of an orthologue in mammals even though they have a Vps74 ortholog, and the potential role of COPI as a bridge between the two proteins, really necessitate a much more in depth and substantial analysis for a broad readership journal such as eLife. Ideally, in vitro reconstitution of binding with purified proteins would resolve many issues, but I appreciate that this may be technically challenging. Below I have suggested some things that could be done to strengthen the paper's conclusions, and at the very least these may be helpful to the authors to consider before resubmitting elsewhere:</p><p>1) Examination of the effect of other gene deletions that affect the ionic content of the Golgi such as deletion of Gdt1, Pmr1 or Stv1, on Och1p-GFP and Ktr2p-GFP levels and on glycosylation.</p><p>2) Resolution of the apparent contradiction of the effects of Erd1 deletion on Och1 and Ktr2 by microscopy and blotting assays. If available, antibodies to the endogenous proteins could be used to test their levels in wild type and mutants.</p><p>3) Does the mutation in the COPI binding site of Vps74 affect its Golgi localization? If not, the authors should check if this prevents the co-ip with Erd1.</p><p>4) It would be very valuable to add videos and graphs to follow the Golgi localization of Erd1 vs Vps74 to better reveal their spatial relationship over time.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our detailed response above that addresses these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Substantial new insight would be provided by determining what part of at least of the Erd1-dependent glycosyltransferases interacts with Erd1. This could be addressed by making chimeric proteins that contain only either the cytoplasmic tail, or the TMD, or the lumenal domain of a Erd1-dependent glycosyltransferase in the context of an Erd1-indepenent glycosyltransferase. The localization and co-ip of these chimeras could be then be tested.</p><p>6) The authors argue that the cytoplasmic tail of Erd1 interacts with Vps74. This could be tested biochemically as has been done for the tails of glycosyltransferases. If the authors keep the split-ubiquitin experiments they should confirm that the constructs are localized to the Golgi.</p><p>7) Are their glycosyltransferases that do no rely on Vps74? It would be useful to test if these are affected by loss of Erd1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to generate chimeric proteins by swapping the cytoplasmic or transmembrane domain of an Erd1-dependent and independent glycosyltransferase. However, the chimeric protein was unstable and degraded even in wild type cells. While we cannot address the comments about binding determinants with our current toolset, this will be the focus our investigations in the future. All the glycosyltransferases that we have tested that rely on Erd1, also rely on Vps74, so we are currently unable to test the effect of Erd1 or Vps74 alone.</p></body></sub-article></article>
