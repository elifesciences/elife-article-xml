research concern when later experiences strengthen or weaken initial memories and when the two memories become linked or remain independent. A promising candidate for explaining these issues is semantic relatedness. Here, across five paired-associate learning experiments (N=1000), we systematically varied the semantic relatedness between initial and later cues, initial and later targets, or both. We found that learning retroactively benefited long-term memory performance for semantically related words (vs. unshown control words), and these benefits increased as a function of relatedness. Critically, memory dependence between initial and later pairs also increased with relatedness, suggesting that pre-existing semantic relationships promote interdependence for memories formed across episodes. We also found that modest retroactive benefits, but not interdependencies, emerged when subjects learned via studying rather than practice testing. These findings demonstrate that semantic relatedness during new learning retroactively strengthens old associations while scaffolding new ones into well-fortified memory traces.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>memory reactivation</kwd><kwd>semantic memory</kwd><kwd>retroactive interference</kwd><kwd>retroactive facilitation</kwd><kwd>memory integration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Princeton University CV Starr Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antony</surname><given-names>James W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The more semantically related a later experience is to an earlier one (along multiple dimensions), the more likely humans are to think back to and strengthen the memory of the earlier experience and mentally link the two experiences.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When a novice bartender is first learning to make cocktails, they are faced with an intimidating repertoire of closely related recipes. For example, they may begin by learning that a ‘Manhattan’ is made with <italic>sweet vermouth</italic>. Later, they may learn that a ‘martini’ is made with <italic>dry vermouth</italic>. These memories are not necessarily independent: the bartender may find that learning to make the martini has retroactively affected their memory of the Manhattan, either by weakening it, a phenomenon known as retroactive interference (<italic>RI),</italic> or by strengthening it, a phenomenon known as retroactive facilitation (<italic>RF</italic>). What properties of the earlier and later memories determine this relationship?</p><p>Here, we evaluate an over 70-year-old proposal by Osgood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Osgood, 1949</xref>) that this relationship depends on <italic>semantic relatedness</italic>. In building up to this proposal, we will consider three broad possibilities. The first possibility is that relatedness has no effect on episodic memory. A second possibility is that relatedness across experiences introduces interference between memories. Third, relatedness could trigger reminders of prior information during new learning, causing the rehearsal and strengthening of prior memories.</p><p>In order for the first (null) account to be correct, memories must be formed distinctly, and processes operating during both encoding and retrieval must be able to accurately pinpoint and isolate memories without any residual effects or dependence on semantics. We consider this account helpful to consider because these processes clearly <italic>are</italic> affected by semantic relatedness, as many decades of research have shown. For instance, semantic relatedness improves memory when both items of a paired-associate are related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lyon, 1914</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Nelson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bein, 2015</xref>), it provides an organizational scaffold for clustering responses during free recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bousfield, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lohnas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Talmi and Moscovitch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Irish and Piguet, 2013</xref>), and it can create false memories for highly related associate words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Deese, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Roediger and McDermott, 1995</xref>). In favor of the second (interference) account, pairing a single retrieval cue with multiple target responses could benefit from greater semantic differences between the targets, allowing for easier dissociation between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Underwood, 1969</xref>). Indeed, increasing relatedness between tasks in some paradigms can increase interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bower et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McGeoch and McGeoch, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">McGeoch and McDonald, 1931</xref>) and/or the rate of intruding material from one task to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Postman, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Osgood, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Underwood, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dallett, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dallett, 1964</xref>). Finally, in favor of the third (strengthening) account, there is evidence that we are not always passive during new learning: sometimes we ‘think back’ to, and thereby reactivate, prior experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hintzman, 2011</xref>). These events, called recursive reminders, can occur when subjects are given explicit instructions or cues as reminders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chanales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Negley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lustig et al., 2004</xref>), or—more relevantly here—they can occur spontaneously when information is related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hintzman et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Garlitch and Wahlheim, 2020</xref>). Moreover, recursive reminders seem to create interdependence between old and new information, with preserved information about the temporal order of learning rather than source confusion and negative competition between the traces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hintzman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Wahlheim and Zacks, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jacoby et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ngo et al., 2021</xref>). The recursive reminders account therefore predicts that semantic relatedness would promote RF and interdependence among memory traces. Altogether, the first account is clearly incorrect, but when and how strongly the countervailing forces of RI and RF from the latter accounts operate remains a central puzzle.</p><p>In examining these accounts more deeply, we will focus on a range of findings from experimental paradigms featuring associations between cues (A) and targets (B). In these paradigms, simply practicing the associations (i.e., seeing the cues paired with the same targets) ubiquitously (and obviously) produces RF of the original A-B association. One of the most studied deviations from this involves linking identical cues (A) with new targets (D) after A-B learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Briggs, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barnes and Underwood, 1959</xref>). This paradigm is canonically referred to as A-B, A-D learning, and we will call it ΔTarget learning because it involves a change in the target. ΔTarget learning typically causes RI for the original A-B memory, likely due to competition between the target responses during retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bower et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Caplan et al., 2014</xref>). However, this RI effect is known to be sensitive to the relationship between the old target (B) and new target (D), as RI generally decreases from substantial to near-absent when B and D are semantically related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Osgood, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dallett, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barnes and Underwood, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Osgood, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Morgan and Underwood, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mehler and Miller, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kanungo, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Young, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Postman, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Postman and Parker, 1970</xref>). In other paradigms, interference can become reduced by encouraging subjects to integrate the two interfering pieces of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and McCulloch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Moeser, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carroll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Reder and Anderson, 1980</xref>), suggesting that high semantic relatedness may reduce RI by making the related memories interdependent. These findings suggest that RI generally occurs when a cue is linked with competing target responses, but that increasing relatedness can reduce or overcome these effects, likely due to recursive reminders.</p><p>The idea is that competition between targets at retrieval causes RI makes a different prediction for lists with identical targets but new cues. Under such A-B, C-B learning conditions, which we call ΔCue learning, little to no RI occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Twedt and Underwood, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Keppel and Underwood, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Houston, 1966</xref>). In fact, when targets are identical and old and new cues are semantically related, RF occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hamilton, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bugelski and Cadwallader, 1956</xref>). However, the level of relatedness may be more modest in this case, exposing a contrast between the role of cues and targets. Finally, changing both cues and targets at once, canonically referred to as A-B, C-D learning that we will call ΔBoth learning, generally results in a completely different learning event (i.e., neither RI nor RF). Studies in which both cues and targets bear some level of relationship to the original A-B pair are scant. However, there have been cases where <italic>either</italic> the new cue was semantically related to the old cue but the targets were unrelated, the new target was semantically related to the old target but the cues were unrelated, or both new cues and targets shared some modest level of relatedness with the old ones; in each of these cases, RI for the original A-B association has been observed when testing occurred after short retention intervals (on the order of minutes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McGeoch and McGeoch, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bugelski and Cadwallader, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baddeley and Dale, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Saltz and Hamilton, 1967</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated longer-term memory in cases where the new cues and targets were both highly related to the old ones.</p><p>To conceptualize this complex array of RI/RF effects, Osgood proposed three continuous directions along which relatedness influences memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Eich, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Mensink and Raaijmakers, 1988</xref>). First, when cue identity is held constant, he reasoned that there must be some point along the ΔTarget line between an unrelated target and an identical target (i.e., from A-B, A-D to A-B, A-B) at which RI shifts to RF. Second, holding the unrelated target constant and manipulating the cue from an identical cue to an unrelated cue (i.e., from A-B, A-D to A-B, C-D), he reasoned that RI should disappear: the pair becomes an entirely new relation. Third, when the target is identical, Osgood noted that RI generally does not occur and drew a ΔCue line from unrelated, which produced no memory change, to maximum RF at identity (i.e., from A-B, C-B to A-B, A-B). From these three predictions, Osgood interpolated a full three-dimensional surface depicting how changes in cues, targets, or both should be expected to affect memory performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of conditions, stimuli, experiments, variables, and Osgood’s predictions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) After base pair learning, pairs were divided into five experimental conditions for secondary pair learning.

To the extent that prior studies have examined subregions of this space, they have relied upon differing methodological approaches, making it challenging to compare findings within a unified framework. Adequately testing these predictions requires a suite of associative learning studies that estimate retroactive and interdependence effects across a wide range of stimuli varying the semantic relatedness of cues, targets, or both. Such a study presents two primary challenges. First, it requires the ability to obtain reliable measures of semantic relatedness for arbitrary pairs of stimuli, which have become increasingly accessible given rapid progress in models of distributional semantics and large-scale data sets collecting associative norms. Second, obtaining adequate coverage over the full relatedness space requires a lot of data: each point in this space must be estimated from measurements of memory performance across multiple participants.</p><p>We addressed these challenges across five large experiments (N=1000). Subjects were initially given a list of 45 unrelated word pairs (e.g., sick-push), which we will call <italic>base pairs</italic>. Later, during the learning of what we will call <italic>secondary pairs</italic>, we included four within-participant experimental conditions: pairs in the No Δ condition appeared unchanged (sick-push), while other pairs appeared in the ΔTarget (sick-shove), ΔCue (ill-push), or ΔBoth (ill-shove) conditions. A final subset of pairs in a control condition remained unshown in this phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Subjects were trained until each pair was correctly retrieved once, after which the pair dropped out from later rounds of learning. Condition assignments were counterbalanced, such that the same base pair was rotated across these five secondary pair conditions across every five subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In our initial experiments, we used a stimulus set with a narrow range of relatedness values, corresponding to the direct associative pair strength. In later experiments, to address how these initial results generalized beyond local semantic neighborhoods of direct associations, we used a stimulus set with a wider range of relatedness that included truly unrelated associations. Additionally, interference often differs depending on the delay between learning interfering material and test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lustig et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ortega et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu and Ranganath, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wixted, 2004</xref>), and we therefore fully crossed the narrower and wider stimulus sets with two different test delays occurring 5 min and 48 hr after secondary pair learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, it has been extensively found that engaging in retrieval strongly benefits long-term memory relative to only restudying information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Roediger and Karpicke, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antony et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carpenter and Yeung, 2017</xref>). We therefore conducted a final experiment exploring whether the results changed if subjects only studied during learning (while controlling for overall exposure to the pairs).</p><p>Our large sample sizes allowed us to test the memorability of each base pair in each condition across subjects, eliminating the incidental effects of the individual base pairs. We measured retroactive effects using each of the following conditions as a difference from the control condition: No Δ at the cue and identity point, ΔTarget as a line of values at cue identity spanning target relatedness, ΔCue as a line of values at target identity spanning cue relatedness, and ΔBoth as a surface spanning bivariate cue and target relatedness (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> for illustration using the narrower stimulus set and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> using the wider set). Putting these different conditions together, we show how our paradigm could produce Osgood’s proposed surface in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, which we test empirically below. Note that if increasing relatedness among word pairs along one or more dimensions increased RI, it would run contrary to Osgood’s predictions. Conversely, if increasing relatedness increased RF, it would support his predictions. Such results would also support recursive reminder theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jacoby et al., 2015</xref>), which we believe offers a mechanistic explanation of Osgood’s proposed surface because it predicts that retroactive benefits increase as reminders become more likely (such as with greater semantic relatedness). A further prediction of this theory is that relatedness would promote interdependence between associated memory traces.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High semantic relatedness produced profound retroactive facilitation, especially at long delays</title><p>We began by establishing the pattern of retroactive memory effects across our five main conditions in a regime of high overall semantic relatedness. In our first experiment, we operationalized semantic relatedness in terms of associative strength (AS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nelson et al., 1998a</xref>), the (empirical) probability that a second word is freely generated as a response to a given word, as estimated from a large independent population. We chose words for the secondary pair learning phase that predicted their corresponding base words with AS values that were quasi-evenly spaced from the lowest values (pious→holy, which was only generated with probability 0.03) to the highest (moo→cow, which was only generated with probability 0.96). We also imposed a 48-hr delay before testing. We measured base pair memory performance, or accuracy in providing the correct target word at test, across conditions using a one-way (No Δ, ΔTarget, ΔCue, ΔBoth, and control) ANOVA, collapsing across all levels of semantic relatedness. We found that condition significantly affected overall memory [<italic>F</italic>(3.9,775.3)=126.2, p&lt;0.001].

These results were especially surprising in the ΔTarget condition, as RI is ubiquitous in these paradigms, especially after short delays. The primary deviation in our variant was that cue and target associations were strongly related. We therefore considered that these effects arose because even the least-related cue and target associations (e.g., pious→holy) were highly similar in the overall semantic space of words because they were all identified from a local semantic neighborhood: all words used in the secondary phase were produced in a single step of free association from the base word. To test this possibility, we expanded the distribution of relatedness to pairs that spanned the full range of semantic relatedness. To quantify relatedness in this stimulus set, we used the cosine similarity [cos(<italic>θ</italic>)] between GloVe vector embeddings. These high-dimensional semantic representations were trained on word-word co-occurrence in large text corpora and strongly align with human similarity judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Pennington et al., 2014</xref>). We chose GloVe values distributed quasi-evenly from –0.14 to 0.95, which encompassed a wide range of associations from those that would be considered unrelated (e.g., sap→laugh) to those which appear as one-step semantic relationships according to our earlier measure of association strength (e.g., blue→red). Aside from the wider stimulus set, the learning procedure was identical.</p><p>We tested these new stimuli under both long and short delay conditions for comparison with our earlier results. In the 48-hr delay experiment, we again found that base pair memory differed strongly across conditions [<italic>F</italic>(4,796)=128.3, p&lt;0.001], with pairwise t-tests indicating that No Δ&gt;ΔCue&gt;ΔTarget&gt;control=ΔBoth (all adjusted p&lt;0.002; ‘=’ indicates p=0.056), again showing facilitation overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lower right). In the 5-min delay experiment, however, the results were strikingly different. Base pair memory differed across conditions [<italic>F</italic>(3.7,742.4)=59.7, p&lt;0.001], but we found evidence of RI in the ΔTarget condition, such that No Δ&gt;ΔCue=control=ΔBoth&gt;ΔTarget (ΔCue vs. control p=0.38; control vs. ΔBoth p=0.29; ΔCue and ΔBoth did differ, p=0.04; all others, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lower left). We therefore successfully replicated the classical RI effects, but only under the conditions of low average relatedness and a short delay. Additionally, the finding that the ΔBoth condition did not significantly differ from control in both experiments suggests that subjects may mentally categorize these pairs as novel pairs (resembling classical C-D pairs) when overall relatedness was low.

In the first of these analyses, we focused on word pairs in the ΔTarget condition. We subtracted the proportion of subjects successfully recalling each pair in the control condition from the proportion in the ΔTarget condition, yielding a measure for each individual word pair that is positive for evidence of RF and negative for evidence of RI. We then performed linear regression analyses between this retroactive measure and the semantic relatedness of the pair, using AS or GloVe values depending on the stimulus set. These analyses allowed us to ask whether word pair memorability was directly correlated with relatedness at the item level.</p><p>We found that higher semantic relatedness between targets produced greater facilitation in all experiments (all p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) except for the narrower stimulus set, 5-min experiment, where we found near-ceiling memory performance (p=0.75). Intriguingly, the results from the 5-min and 48-hr delay experiments with the wider stimulus set further clarified how both delay and semantic relatedness additively determined RI or RF. In the 5-min experiment, we found RI for pairs with very low relatedness, which would be conventionally categorized as ‘unrelated,’ as indicated by the significantly negative y-intercept in the regression (lower left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As relatedness increased, however, items entered a region that did not differ from the control condition. In the 48-hr experiment, there was no difference from the control condition for pairs with very low relatedness, as indicated by the insignificant y-intercept in the regression, but with increasing relatedness, we found significant RF (lower right of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, in the experiment using the narrower stimulus set and shorter 5-min delay, the ΔTarget condition still produced facilitation compared to the control, suggesting that with high enough overall relatedness, temporary RI effects can fully cross over into RF (upper left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Target relatedness retroactively benefited memory and created interdependence between base and secondary pairs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Across-subject memorability for each base pair was plotted against the target semantic relatedness, with AS and GloVe values in the top and bottom rows, respectively.

It also predicts that reminders should increase with relatedness. Therefore, we next asked whether relatedness promoted interdependence between initial and later-learned pairs. We defined interdependence as the proportion of base pair target-secondary pair target duos that were both correct or both incorrect across subjects. For example, if subjects tended to recall ‘peace-razor’ during base pair testing and ‘peace-shave’ during secondary pair testing, or failed to recall both of them, these would be interdependent, whereas if only one of the two memories was recalled as often as both or neither of the words, these would be independent. We then correlated this interdependence measure with semantic relatedness. We found memory dependence increased with higher relatedness (p&lt;0.01), except in the narrower stimulus set, 5-min experiment that previously showed near-ceiling memory performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, target relatedness simultaneously resulted in strengthened base pairs and enhanced interdependence between base and secondary pairs.</p><p>We also asked whether target relatedness would increase intrusions, or errors from the secondary pair list into the base pair list. That is, we wanted to contrast two accounts. Under one account, the targets may merge or compete, leading to confusion about the list contexts (e.g., peace-razorshave). Theoretically, this account could produce some intrusions in addition to RF; indeed, lack of interference in RI studies wherein targets are related has been posited to stem from a ‘loss of differentiation’ between semantically related sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Postman, 1961</xref>), and other studies have found greater intrusion errors with increasing relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Osgood, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Underwood, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dallett, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dallett, 1964</xref>). Under the recursive reminders account, highly related new targets would simultaneously strengthen old memories due to reminders of the base pair list and would be scaffolded to the cue as part of the secondary pair list, meaning the list contexts remained interdependent, yet distinguishable (e.g., peace-razor-base list/peace-shave-secondary list). We therefore asked whether relatedness increased across-list intrusions of the new target response into the base pair list by correlating the across-subject intrusion rate with target relatedness. In fact, intrusions significantly decreased in the wider stimulus set, 5-min experiment (p&lt;0.001) and otherwise did not increase with target relatedness in any experiment (all p&gt;0.08; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting the recursive reminders account.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cue relatedness had no significant linear effect on base pair memory</title><p>Overall, performance in the ΔCue condition showed consistent RF across experiments. We next asked whether memorability differed as a function of cue relatedness, as it did for target relatedness.

We next asked whether these retroactive effects differed as bivariate values of cue and target relatedness in all experiments, with particular interest in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment. To do this, we computed base pair memorability in the ΔBoth and control conditions for each word pair, and then we computed locally smoothed surfaces based on memorability at each bivariate cue and target relatedness value (see Materials and methods). To assess statistical significance, we first looked for clusters of values whereby the true values exceeded those expected by chance by randomly scrambling the conditions. We then used 1000 permutation tests to assess the size of clusters exceeding this threshold that we might expect due to chance, and we asked whether any observed true clusters exceeded this threshold. We found a significant cluster with high levels of both cue and target relatedness in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment (p=0.001) and not the others (all p&gt;0.41), demonstrating that long-term RF occurs with high bivariate levels of relatedness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Therefore, results from the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment concur with findings in the ΔTarget condition whereby relatedness simultaneously strengthens base pair memory and increases dependence between base and secondary pair memory.

Consider that after base pair learning, the strength of any given association sits along the x-y plane, where target and cue relatedness of a putative secondary pair lie along the x- and y-axes, respectively. If no related pairs occur during secondary pair learning (control condition), it remains along this axis (orange). If during secondary pair learning, the same pair is learned again (No Δ condition), it sits at the target identity, cue identity point (red). If cues remain and targets change (ΔTarget condition), it varies by target relatedness along the cue identity line (blue).

However, we wanted to address two remaining points. First, the two stimulus sets span variable ranges of relatedness. We kept analyses for these experiments separate because sensitivity to the overall distribution of relatedness within a particular session could affect subject performance; nevertheless, we acknowledge that using different ranges could result in the effects disappearing when the data become combined under a unified metric. To address this concern, we combined across-subject memorability and dependence across stimulus sets in each experimental condition within a particular test delay (e.g., the narrower and wider stimulus sets within the 5-min delay experiments). Next, we correlated these with measures with GloVe values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, none of the prior significant effects disappeared under this analysis. Rather, retroactive and memory dependence effects in the ΔCue condition actually became significant under this common metric (likely due to increased power), yet they remained weaker than in the ΔTarget condition, consistent with our prior results.</p><p>The second remaining point is that many other relatedness metrics exist (besides AS and GloVe), which can be broadly categorized into ‘internal’ models relying on relationships within associative semantic networks and ‘external,’ vector-based models based on recently developed algorithms trained on large amounts of text that can measure word-word relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">De Deyne et al., 2017</xref>). In some cases, internal models outperform external models at capturing paired-associate memory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Steyvers et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, semantic network relationships can predict paired-associate memory beyond single steps to nearby neighbors, with significant benefits shown up to two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Nelson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Nelson and Zhang, 2000</xref>) or three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kenett et al., 2017</xref>) semantic steps. We therefore included the following relatedness factors based on semantic networks: forward AS, or cue→Δcue and target→Δtarget AS rather than the backward (e.g., cue←Δcue) AS measure used in our analyses above; backward mediator strength, which calculates the cumulative strength of all secondary associations (e.g., mane-tiger via the mediator, lion, or cue←[mediator]←Δcue) and has been shown to predict memory independently from direct AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Nelson and Zhang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Nelson et al., 2003</xref>); weighted path length, whereby we find the shortest path in a semantic network generated by free association norms and add up their summed weights between each node; and spreading activation strength, wherein we start from the target word and follow all edges to nearby nodes (words) up to three steps and add up activation values weighted by their association norms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">De Deyne et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hills et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">De Deyne et al., 2016</xref> for similar approaches). In addition to GloVe, we also used the following external models: word2vec cos(<italic>θ</italic>), wherein words are represented by vectorized representations based on training a neural network on a large text corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mikolov et al., 2013</xref>); and latent semantic analysis (LSA) cos(<italic>θ</italic>), which captures contextual similarity between words/documents via projections into a high-dimensional semantic vector space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Landauer and Dumais, 1997</xref>).

Although the results differed somewhat by experiment and condition, the backward AS and GloVe measures we used in our analyses above captured the same general effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>When subjects learned by studying, relatedness retroactively benefited memory in the ΔTarget condition but did not increase dependence</title><p>The prior experiments required one successful retrieval per word pair during learning. Prior research suggests that retrieval produces profound long-term memory benefits relative to a different learning strategy of studying (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Roediger and Karpicke, 2006b</xref>) and may also differ in ways relevant to our effects. For instance, subjects may engage in more mental elaboration during retrieval than study, which may help form semantic mediators that can aid in retrieving a memory trace (e.g., retrieving ‘mother-child’ may activate the mediator, ‘father’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carpenter and Yeung, 2017</xref>) and can have benefits for related material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chan et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, our final experiment used the narrower stimulus set and a 48-hr delay, but subjects only studied the associations during learning. To control for overall exposure to the pairs, we yoked each of 200 subjects to the exact learning order of subjects in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment. We chose this stimulus set and delay because we were especially interested if the results in the ΔBoth experiment from the otherwise equivalent retrieval-to-criterion experiment would generalize to study-only conditions. Condition affected base pair memory [<italic>F</italic>(4,796)=48.9, p&lt;0.001], but here t-tests indicated memory followed a ΔTarget=No Δ=ΔCue&gt;ΔBoth&gt;control pattern (ΔTarget vs. No Δ, p=0.94; ΔTarget vs. ΔCue, p=0.25; No Δ vs. ΔCue, p=0.25; all others, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Therefore, the presence of related associates again aids base pair memory, but in this case, there was very little continued benefit for encountering identical associates while practicing repeated study alone in the No Δ condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Karpicke and Roediger, 2008</xref>). In all correlations between retroactive effects and base-secondary pair dependence with relatedness, only ΔTarget retroactive memory correlated with target relatedness (p=0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Correlations in the ΔCue condition were not significant (p=0.85), nor were any clusters along the ΔBoth surface (p=1.0).

Therefore, we also examined the overall effects of condition and relatedness levels on secondary pair learning in all experiments employing retrieval-to-criterion learning (the study-only experiment had no learning measure). Accordingly, in the narrower stimulus set experiments, the number of trials to criterion followed a No Δ&lt;ΔCue&lt;ΔTarget&lt;ΔBoth pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The wider stimulus set experiments produced a somewhat similar pattern of No Δ&lt;ΔTarget&lt;ΔBoth=ΔCue, where instead ΔTarget and ΔCue flipped from the narrower stimulus set. We next investigated learning across subjects (average trials to criterion per secondary pair) as a function of relatedness in the ΔCue, ΔTarget, and ΔBoth conditions. Higher cue relatedness produced faster secondary pair learning in every experiment (all p&lt;0.005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Similarly, higher target relatedness produced faster secondary pair learning in every experiment except the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr experiment (p=0.17; all others p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

These results suggest again that secondary pairs in the ΔBoth condition in the wider stimulus set are largely treated as new pairs due to the extent of change, as they do not strengthen, nor are they strengthened by, base pairs. Overall, these results suggest that previously learned base pairs scaffold and speed learning of secondary pairs as a function of their relatedness.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Secondary pair learning differed by stimulus set and condition and generally benefitted from semantic relatedness.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Learning time (mean trials to criterion) followed this pattern for the narrower stimulus set: No Δ ‘ns’ (p&gt;0.1) or † (0.05&lt;p&lt; 0.1).

Secondary pairs with high relatedness were learned more efficiently, meaning that they had fewer exposures. If the number of exposures increased RI, this would suggest our RF effects could stem in part from lesser interference. We conducted two analyses to address this possibility. First, we correlated new learning efficiency with memorability across pairs in each condition. We found generally weak evidence in favor of this idea, with significant (p&lt;0.05) results in only the ΔTarget condition in the wider stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment (r=0.30, p=0.02). Second, we ran partial correlations between relatedness and memorability across pairs while controlling for new learning efficiency. These partial correlations remained significant in all of the main analyses above, including in the ΔTarget condition in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr experiment (r=0.34, p=0.026), wider stimulus set, 5-min delay experiment (r=0.45, p=0.002), and wider stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment (r=0.36, p=0.016) and for cue+target relatedness in the ΔBoth condition in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr experiment (r=0.41, p=0.005). Full results from these partial correlations can also be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>. Therefore, it appears our RF effects did not rely on the amount of pair exposure during secondary pair learning. We also calculated correlations between base-secondary pair dependence and secondary pair learning efficiency and between dependence and relatedness while controlling for secondary pair learning efficiency. These correlations can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We showed that semantic relatedness during learning profoundly benefited memory by retroactively strengthening old associations while scaffolding new ones. We largely found long-term RF across experimental conditions (vs. control), which increased linearly with relatedness in the ΔTarget and ΔBoth conditions. In the stimulus set experiments featuring a wider range of semantic relationships, we found a typical RI effect when relatedness was low and there were short delays after new learning, but both the relatedness of the individual word pairs and the longer delay additively reversed these RI effects into RF. Furthermore, memory dependence (between base and secondary pairs) increased with relatedness in the ΔTarget and ΔBoth conditions. In the paragraphs that follow, we will argue that these results strongly support the theory on recursive reminders, and we next interpret our effects in each learning condition in light of this theory. We follow these interpretations with a possible neurobiological mechanism and a discussion of Osgood’s proposal.</p><p>Theory on recursive reminders posits that remembering past events during new learning can benefit memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hintzman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hintzman et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Otero and Kintsch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jacoby and Wahlheim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wahlheim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Tullis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benjamin and Tullis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Begg and Green, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Smirnov, 1973</xref>). The recursive reminders account has three notable aspects here. First, providing explicit reminders or encouraging subjects to recall or integrate past events just before new learning seems to reduce RI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chanales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Negley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lustig et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Huang and Li, 2022</xref>) (and reduce interference in other paradigms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and McCulloch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Moeser, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carroll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Reder and Anderson, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Smith et al., 1978</xref>) or even produce RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wahlheim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Burton et al., 2017</xref>). Crucially, subjects must both <italic>notice</italic> a change and <italic>recollect</italic> the changed material for these benefits to arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jacoby et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wahlheim and Jacoby, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Wahlheim, 2014a</xref>). Second, although these reminders can be directed via instructions, they can also occur spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hintzman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hintzman et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Begg and Green, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Loftus, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Putnam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Tousignant et al., 1986</xref>). Relatedly, either strong pre-experimental associations or new episodes linking a target and competitor—which could cause subjects to recollect linked information even when uninstructed—can lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Goodmon and Anderson, 2011</xref>) or reverse memory impairment effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bäuml and Hartinger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Rowland and DeLosh, 2014</xref>). Third, recursive reminders create interdependence between initial and later-learned information that preserves memory for individual temporal contexts. Interdependence—as measured by whether memories are remembered or forgotten together—can develop for pre-existing or newly learned associations and generally aids memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Garlitch and Wahlheim, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ngo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Horner and Burgess, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Horner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ngo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermane et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wahlheim, 2014b</xref>). Moreover, reminders also scaffold new learning, such that recollecting changes during the formation of new memories aids their retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jacoby et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jacoby and Wahlheim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Burton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wahlheim and Jacoby, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Wahlheim, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wahlheim, 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Broadly, in accord with the recursive reminders account, we propose that strong pre-existing associations between base and secondary pairs produce retroactive benefits by increasing the likelihood of subjects recollecting base pairs and relating them to secondary pairs, thereby increasing both base pair memory and dependence. Critically, the absence of greater intrusions with higher relatedness suggests that temporal order information regarding the learning list of each pair was preserved rather than the two contexts becoming confused. That is, with high relatedness, recursive reminder-induced memory benefits outweighed the possible countervailing force of competition at retrieval. With weaker pre-existing associations, we speculate that subjects noticed changes while learning new secondary pairs but may have been less likely to recall and integrate them with corresponding base pairs.</p><p>We now discuss our results and how they support the recursive reminders account in each condition. The ΔTarget condition showed clear retroactive effects except in the presence of ceiling performance: target relatedness linearly increased RF, including when subjects only studied the information; RI/RF depended on the delay, such that, under the wider stimulus set experiments, RI occurred with a short delay, whereas higher relatedness rescued individual pairs from RI to no effect, and with a longer delay, relatedness increased benefits from no effect to RF; and base pair target-secondary pair target duo dependence increased with target relatedness (except this also did not occur in the study-only experiment). As introduced above, these effects likely stem from two competing processes: a temporary retrieval impairment due to high competition with the more recently learned target word, and a long-term strengthening and interdependence effect that increases linearly with relatedness. High relatedness between base and secondary pairs means that during secondary pair learning, base pairs are reactivated via recursive reminders and secondary pairs become scaffolded to them. These results mirror other phenomena that differentially affect short-term and long-term memory performance, such as the benefits of testing (characterized as the testing effect) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Roediger and Karpicke, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bjork and Bjork, 1992</xref>). Although we have largely avoided comparing 5 min and 48 hr delay results directly because they were part of different experiments (and therefore subjects were not randomly assigned to different delays), it appears that conditions in which we expect recursive reminders tend to slow the rate of forgetting (relative to the amount of forgetting in the control condition). This pattern suggests recursive reminders act as effective retrieval processes, similar to findings on the testing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hintzman, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the ΔTarget condition, RF tended to occur overall in the ΔCue condition, with null effects in the restudy experiment and the wider stimulus set, 5-min experiment, and featured a weaker relationship with cue relatedness. It is less clear whether and how effectively recursive reminders occur in this condition. In one sense, the absence of a relationship between relatedness and memorability (or the presence of a very weak benefit that remained insignificant in our main analyses) could suggest less recursive reminding and that most benefits occur due to a combination of increased availability of target responses (in the absence of competition at retrieval). Indeed, increasing response availability has been proposed to occur independent of associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Martin, 1965</xref>), and rehearsing B responses alone can improve A-B memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Estes, 1979</xref>). However, weak relatedness benefits in this condition across all experiments indicate that subjects may perform a mental ‘Δcue→cue→target’ operation during secondary pair learning that would require recollecting the original association as a recursive reminder. Altogether, the retroactive benefits are clear in the ΔCue condition, but the mechanism seems to differ from the ΔTarget condition and the extent to which recursive reminders are specifically involved versus other processes such as increased target availability is unclear.</p><p>Strikingly, in the ΔBoth condition, RF occurred overall (vs. control) and at high values of cue and target relatedness in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment. Moreover, base-secondary pair dependence similarly occurred at high cue and target relatedness in this experiment. These results suggest that, as in the ΔTarget condition, there was an increased likelihood of recursive reminders supported by pre-existing associations. These effects occurred when cue and target relatedness were high, possibly because changing both causes subjects to fail to recollect both pre-existing links and/or attribute the secondary pair to a new memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Shin and DuBrow, 2020</xref>). Additionally, null effects in the wider stimulus set experiments—even for pairs with high cue and target relatedness—suggest that relatedness across pairs may also need to be high on average for subjects to start noticing and recollecting changes rather than attributing the pairs to entirely new associations. We do note that, in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment, cue and target relatedness had somewhat dissociable effects in the ΔBoth condition, such that target relatedness predicted memorability while cue relatedness predicted dependence. We find these results intriguing and worthy of further investigation in future work.</p><p>Overall, we propose that relatedness increases the likelihood of recursive reminders, which create well-fortified and interdependent sets of associations that maintain and even strengthen memories while preserving information such as their temporal and contextual order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hintzman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Wahlheim and Zacks, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jacoby et al., 2015</xref>). These explanations rely heavily on the importance of interdependencies among base and secondary pairs, a concept elucidated by paradigms featuring multi-element ‘closed-loop’ learning configurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Horner and Burgess, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Horner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ngo et al., 2019</xref>) like A-B, B-C, and A-C. These configurations enhance memory and the interdependence between associated elements more than similar, ‘open-loop’ configurations like A-B, B-C, and C-D. In this framework, our high relatedness ΔTarget and ΔBoth conditions resemble a closed loop, except that rather than having to learn the final link in the loop de novo, unrelated associations are closed by the pre-existing target relationship in the ΔTarget condition and by both pre-existing cue and target relationships in the ΔBoth condition. These results demonstrate a clear interplay between semantic and episodic representations, whereby semantic representations scaffold the formation and retention of episodic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Irish and Piguet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Renoult et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, under ΔTarget learning, testing causes subjects to recollect stimulus changes more often than restudying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Wahlheim, 2014a</xref>). Therefore, in our study-only experiment, interdependencies may not have emerged because subjects were not forced to incorporate changes occurring between base and secondary pairs into an integrated memory trace, suggesting that testing during learning is critical for forming these interdependencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carpenter and Yeung, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Neural results also support the idea that retrieving earlier memories during new learning aids memory and interdependence. Generally, the neocortex supports networks of semantic information, whereas the hippocampus binds together elements specific to episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Horner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McClelland, 1995</xref>). Retrieval cues often elicit reactivation of incidental (non-target) information in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Miller, 2013</xref>) or neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jonker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Horner et al., 2015</xref>) (which in turn coincides with greater hippocampal activity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Horner et al., 2015</xref>). Reactivation in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chanales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Koen and Rugg, 2016</xref>) or hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kuhl et al., 2010</xref>) during new learning predicts resistance to interference and inference for information linked by a common element (e.g., A-C after A-B and B-C learning) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Zeithamova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Shohamy and Wagner, 2008</xref>). Moreover, instructions to integrate cause subjects to form neural patterns distinct from ordinary encoding, which predict behavioral measures of integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chanales et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Richter et al., 2016</xref>). These results all suggest that recollection during new learning reactivates and strengthens old memory traces, promoting resistance to interference and interdependence. Finally, evidence from rodents suggests that neurons encoding prior memories are reactivated upon learning-related experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McKenzie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">McKenzie et al., 2014</xref>), offering a plausible way in which integration can occur. Furthermore, blocking hippocampal plasticity during new, overlapping events prevents transfer between the two memories, suggesting a <italic>causal</italic> role for the hippocampus in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Iordanova et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given these findings, we now speculate on how our effects fit within a neurobiological framework extending the recursive reminders account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In our study, pre-existing semantic relationships existed primarily within the neocortex, while previously unrelated pairs were bound by the hippocampus along with their episodic list context and novel, related episodes could also have been interdependently linked within the hippocampus. The No Δ condition generally produced maximum strengthening for both base and secondary pairs. In line with a theory suggesting that even repetitions of the same learning material create multiple traces within the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997</xref>), these context memories were formed individually yet, as shown by their strong interdependence (red, leftmost point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), they were strongly bound within the hippocampus. In the ΔTarget and ΔBoth conditions (and to a lesser extent in the ΔCue condition), high relatedness between base and secondary pairs—represented by pre-existing cortical links—facilitated base pair reactivation via recursive reminders, thus creating an inter-hippocampal association and behavioral dependence. Such benefits were far more limited with no or low relatedness. Additionally, though we propose that these interdependencies initially rely on the hippocampus, the novel associations may eventually become linked within the cortex with more repetitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antony et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McClelland, 1995</xref>). Altogether, the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> provides a simplified, speculative explanation for our collected results and a testable mechanism for future studies.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed neurobiological schematic of long-term memory fates across conditions and two levels of semantic relatedness.</title><p>Initially, unrelated base pair associations are bound in the hippocampus along with base list (BL) contexts (e.g., ‘plaza-doze-base list’ and ‘beer-late-base list’; left column), followed by new associations in secondary list (SL) contexts. Subjects can thereby retrieve target words given a cue and list context. Cortical associations are absent for words without pre-experimental relatedness (top) and strong for words with high pre-experimental relatedness (bottom). Relearning A-B (No Δ condition; second from left column) under either level of relatedness results in strengthened base pair and robust secondary pair associations (e.g., ‘plaza-doze-secondary list’), likely as linked episodes within the hippocampus. The consequences for learning a pair with a new target (ΔTarget condition; middle column) differs based on pre-experimental relatedness: with no relatedness (top), little to no long-term change occurs to the base pairs and secondary pairs are independently formed (e.g., ‘plaza-plus-secondary list’), whereas with high relatedness (bottom), the original memory is strengthened as the new memory is formed (keg-late-secondary list). Moreover, the episodes become bound within the hippocampus, forming an interdependent memory trace. Note that RI effects shown in the narrower stimulus set, 5-min delay experiment are not represented by this long-term schematic and likely stem from more temporary retrieval impairments. Learning a pair with a new cue (ΔCue condition; second column from right) generally strengthens the original memory (perhaps due to better target accessibility) in a manner only weakly reliant on cue relatedness. The consequences for learning a pair with two new words (ΔBoth condition; rightmost column) differ markedly based on pre-experimental relatedness: with no relatedness (top), the new association memory is formed independently, whereas with high relatedness (bottom), the base pair memory becomes strengthened, and the base and secondary pair associations become interdependent. RI, retroactive interference.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72519-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>How do our results support or refute the key ideas in Osgood’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Osgood, 1949</xref>) proposal? The presence of retroactive benefits that increase along the cue identity line strongly support his proposal that RI becomes RF with high target relatedness. However, note that we only found the full crossover from RI to RF across experiments—such as across delays by contrasting both wider stimulus set experiments or across overall levels of relatedness by contrasting the narrower and wider 5-min experiments—rather than finding the crossover within the same experiment. RF (and the total absence of RI) along the target identity line supports his proposal, but conversely, the absent (or very weak) positive relationship with cue relatedness in all experiments does not. Finally, along the bivariate surface, we found benefits when the relatedness among both dimensions was very high, but no reliable effects otherwise; such an effect is present visually on Osgood’s proposed surface, but it had lacked empirical support. We also assert that there is no <italic>one</italic> surface, as we produced surfaces that varied both by overall relatedness and delay. Note that we explored a wide range of semantic relatedness in later experiments, but one could consider even further notions of relatedness. When later-learned information differs in even more substantial ways, such as when numbers, letters, or famous people are presented when trying to recall one of the other categories, RI tends to decrease again because the different categories reduce competition during retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bower et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Smirnov, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Skaggs, 1925</xref>). Therefore, if one took the wider stimulus set, 5-min delay surface and expanded stimulus relatedness into domains beyond words, RI may decrease again, producing a nonlinear effect reminiscent of those found across early studies employing a wide variety of stimulus types, including with numbers, number-letter combinations, nonsense syllables, abstract visual symbols, poetry, and prose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Britt, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Robinson, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gibson, 1941</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Parducci and Knopf, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cheng, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lund, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dreis, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Harden, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gibson and Gibson, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Rothkopf, 1957</xref>). Additionally, future studies could explore how surfaces differ based on less nameable stimuli types, such as stimulus spaces with continuous, quantifiable changes in visual stimuli (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Wammes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Molitor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Iordan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Natu et al., 2016</xref>), or other domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dennis, 1976</xref>).</p><p>A notable limitation of our study is that we did not dissociate between semantic representations based on distributed representational models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Pennington et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Plaut, 1995</xref>) and associative relations based on association strength and spreading activation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Nelson et al., 1998b</xref>), instead relying on the broad term, semantic relatedness, to capture both constructs. Analyses in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref> did not indicate any clear distinction in correlations with memorability and interdependence between measures of semantic and contextual similarity such as LSA and word2vec versus AS. Nevertheless, we did not aim to directly contrast these two constructs by selecting stimuli that dissociate them, and given that the two types of relations show different effects on cognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Thompson-Schill et al., 1998</xref>), this will be important in future work. Another limitation to our interpreting these results within a recursive reminders framework is that we did not directly manipulate instructions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jacoby et al., 2015</xref>) or collect in-the-moment responses regarding whether subjects engaged in recursive reminders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wahlheim et al., 2019</xref>). Such manipulations constitute important future directions.</p><p>We began this investigation by asking two fundamental questions about learning: when does a new memory facilitate versus interfere with an older one, and when do their fates become linked? Inspired by a never-fully-tested, seven-decade-old proposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Osgood, 1949</xref>), we produced a consolidated account suggesting that semantic relatedness between old and new memories facilitates old memory strength and promotes their interdependence. When a new memory bears high relatedness to an old one, subjects can readily notice the change and recollect the old memory, fortifying the old memory and scaffolding the new one to it, providing mutual reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Floyd and Goldberg, 2021</xref>). To return to our opening example, if after learning about sweet vermouth, the bartender notices and recollects the change when learning about dry vermouth, the sweet vermouth memory becomes strengthened, and the vermouth memories become linked. Ultimately, these findings highlight and strongly reinforce the importance of building on prior knowledge in educational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">van Kesteren et al., 2012</xref>) and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badham et al., 2012</xref>) domains and clarify when and how complex networks of knowledge can be accumulated and retained.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>For each experiment, we chose a sample size of 200—large relative to most memory studies—to ensure that memorability measures from each condition would have reliable data given the fivefold counterbalance (200 subjects/5 counterbalances=40 measurements for each independent word pair contrast). All subjects across the five experiments were undergraduate students with normal or corrected-to-normal vision who received psychology course credit for participating. In each experiment, subjects with overall memory performance less than 4 standard deviations below the mean were excluded and subjects were run until 200 remained. In the study-only experiment, we additionally dropped subjects with no correct responses in the base pair condition, even though it was within 4 standard deviations of the mean. Additionally, numerous subjects did not return or complete the final test. The final breakdowns were as follows: narrower stimulus set, 5-min delay: N=201, 0 no test, 136 females (135 post-exclusions); narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay: N=208, 6 no test, 114 females (108 post-exclusions); wider stimulus set, 5-min delay: N=206, 0 no test, 101 females (99 post-exclusions); wider stimulus set, 48-hr delay: N=212, 7 no test, 149 females (139 post-exclusions); study-only: N=226, 6 no test, 177 females (156 post-exclusions). In the original (retrieval-to-criterion) narrower stimulus set, 48-hr experiment, subjects took the experiment on lab computers. Later experiments were conducted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Timing in the online experiments was identical, and subjects took the experiment while in virtual sessions with research assistants to enhance attentiveness to the task. All subjects were recruited via an online scheduling software. Subjects provided informed consent, and all procedures were in accordance with the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stimuli</title><p>Since there are numerous word attributes (e.g., word frequency) by which verbal memorability differs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Rubin and Friendly, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Madan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Greene and Tussing, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">DeLosh and McDaniel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Xie et al., 2020</xref>), we designed our experiments so that the main measure of interest (base pair memory) used the same 45 word pairs, with the only manipulations being the condition of secondary pair learning and the semantic relatedness between base and secondary pairs.</p><p>Stimuli selection proceeded in two stages: first, we found paired words of varying relatedness that would later become a cue-Δcue unit or target-Δtarget unit, and second, we created pairs of pairs (comprising a cue, Δcue, target, and Δtarget word). In the first step in the stimulus set with a narrower range of semantic relationships, we aligned 3–5 letter words by free AS from an open database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nelson et al., 1998a</xref>) and selected 90 unique pairs ranging approximately evenly from 0.03 (pious→holy) to 0.96 (moo→cow). Note that AS relationships are directed and can affect cued recall memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Caplan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Popov et al., 2019</xref>), so we controlled for these asymmetries by always designing the cue word from the database (e.g., moo) to the secondary pair (Δcue or Δtarget) and the target word (e.g., cow) to the base pair (cue or target). Our logic was that secondary pair learning would thereby retroactively ‘act upon’ base pair learning in a predictable way (based on the AS value) rather than vice versa. In the first step in the stimulus set with a full range of semantic relationships, we derived pairwise Global Vector (GloVe) cosine similarity [cos(<italic>θ</italic>)] values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Pennington et al., 2014</xref>) for all 3–5 letter words from the same free association database. The GloVe training set involved 840 billion web tokens and was imported using the gensim Python toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim">https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Rehurek and Sojka, 2010</xref>). We then chose words to quasi-evenly span the full interval of cos(<italic>θ</italic>) values ranging from –0.14 to 0.95. These relationships are undirected and therefore the base versus secondary pair decisions were somewhat arbitrary but remained consistent for all subjects after initial determination.</p><p>Within each experiment, we aimed for each subject to experience similar overall levels of semantic relatedness across pairs. Therefore, in the second step of creating the stimuli, we separated all 90 chosen pairs into thirds by semantic relatedness (30 pairs each) and randomly assigned 30 pairs from each split into 15 cue pairs (cue and Δcue) and 15 target pairs (target and Δtarget). Then we randomly assigned the 15 cue pairs from each relatedness level to one of three target pair levels and vice versa, meaning that all pairs were essentially assigned to ninths of a 2-D grid (with 5 cue and 5 target pairs in each ninth). Effectively, these ninths could be classified by low-moderate-high (l/m/h) semantic similarity for cues and targets, respectively, as l/l, l/m, l/h, m/l, m/m, m/h, h/l, h/m, and h/h. Next, we randomly paired the pairs within each ninth so that each had five pairs of pairs consisting of cue, Δcue, target, and Δtarget words that could be assigned to any experimental condition. Our counterbalance separated one item from each ninth into each of the five experimental conditions and therefore multiples of five subjects were required to maintain counterbalances across stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Other relatedness metrics</title><p>Forward (cue→Δcue and target→Δtarget) AS and backward mediator strength values (e.g., cue←[other word]←Δcue) were taken from the same repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nelson et al., 1998a</xref>) from which we found cue←Δcue and target←Δtarget AS values used in the main analyses. Weighted path length was determined by first finding the shortest path in a network composed of all words within the repository from target to cue word and then adding up the weights. For example, if the Δcue word was ‘stripe’ and cue word, ‘king,’ the shortest path may be ‘stripe→tiger (0.034 AS)→lion (0.308 AS)→king (0.021).’ Each weight was computed as 1–AS, so the previous example would have a weighted path length of [(1–0.034)+(1–0.308)+(1–0.021)]=2.637. Note that with all single-step associations in the narrower stimulus set, weighted path lengths were all simply 1–AS. Despite the vast size of semantic networks, they possess small-world architecture with generally small path lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005</xref>), and indeed all but six pairs had lengths of less than 6. These remaining path lengths had infinite length according to our algorithm and were set to 6. For the spreading activation analysis, we performed the following, starting with the target node: (1) at each node, find all edges (to nearby words in free association space) and norm all AS to 1, (2) find activation (if any) of the cue word and log it by its weight, (3) advance along all edges iteratively, and (4) repeat up to three steps, logging as weights the multiplied values of each edge en route to the cue word. Then we added up the total activation of the cue across these three steps. For word2vec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mikolov et al., 2013</xref>), we used a version of the model trained on Google News with 3 million 300-dimension word vectors. We imported the vectors and calculated similarity using the gensim Python toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Rehurek and Sojka, 2010</xref>). For latent semantic analysis, we found pairwise cosine similarity values via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lsa.colorado.edu">http://lsa.colorado.edu</ext-link> using term-to-term comparisons trained on general reading lists up to the college level with 300 orthogonal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Landauer and Dumais, 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Procedure</title><p>All experiments followed this order: base pair learning, secondary pair learning, a 5-min or 48-hr delay, base pair testing, and secondary pair testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For base pair learning, subjects first viewed the 45 pairs in a round of encoding followed by retrieval to criterion or, in the case of the study-only experiment, repeated study. During encoding, subjects attended to a fixation cross for 1 s before pairs appeared for 4 s. Cue and target words were shown just above and below the vertical center of the screen, respectively, and both were centered horizontally. During retrieval in the main retrieval-to-criterion experiments, subjects attended to a fixation cross for 1 s before the cue word was shown. After 1 s, a blank prompt was shown where subjects could type in their answer. Subjects were given unlimited time to respond, after which both cue and target words were shown as feedback whether correct or not. Correct pairs were dropped from this phase so that the only remaining trials on successive rounds were previously incorrect responses. In the study-only experiment, subjects were given 4 s to restudy the words rather than testing.</p><p>Before secondary pair learning, we told subjects they would next learn a new list of pairs and that the stimuli may or may not change between lists. Secondary pair learning then proceeded with the same retrieval criterion and timing as base pair learning, except that only 36 pairs were learned (corresponding to pairs in the No Δ, ΔTarget, ΔCue, and ΔBoth conditions).</p><p>In the study-only experiment, the yoking procedure for each subject was matched to the learning order of a subject from the retrieval-to-criterion, narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment. For example, subject #1 from the retrieval-to-criterion experiment was matched with subject #1 from the study-only experiment. We copied the learning order precisely in both base and secondary pair learning phases from each retrieval-to-criterion subject to the study-only subject, so if subject #1 in the former saw ‘sick-push’ first, so did subject #1 in the latter experiment, and so on. In later rounds of learning, when many word pairs had dropped out for a subject in the retrieval-to-criterion experiment, those same items dropped out for the yoked subject in the study-only experiment. We acknowledge that this procedure cannot control for individual differences in memorability; for instance, subject #1 in the retrieval-to-criterion experiment and subject #1 in the study-only experiment could require different exposures to achieve the same criterion, so the pairs remaining at the end of each learning phase may not be the ones the study-only subject would have struggled to learn. Such differences cannot be addressed without an additional test assessment in the study-only experiment. We believe that matching the objective amount of exposure was the best way to match restudy to retrieval-to-criterion learning conditions, but another experiment using a fixed number of repetitions for each pair in restudy and test conditions or an experiment that randomly assigns the number of repetitions across pairs in restudy and test conditions would address the role of individual differences more precisely.</p><p>After returning for the test, subjects were first asked to recall all words from the base list (which we described as the first list they learned). During the test, subjects attended to a fixation cross for 1 s before the cue word was shown. They were allowed unlimited typing time and were given no feedback after submitting their response. Following one test of each pair, they were then asked to recall all words from the secondary list (which we described as the second list they learned), which followed an identical format. Subjects were then debriefed and allowed to leave.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistics</title><p>Across-condition comparisons within each experiment were conducted using one-way (condition: No Δ, ΔTarget, ΔCue, ΔBoth, and control), repeated-measures ANOVAs. For comparisons in which the sphericity was violated, we corrected the degrees of freedom in the F-ratio test using Huynh-Feldt correction. Significant ANOVAs were followed with pairwise, FDR-corrected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>), within-subject t-tests.</p><p>Across-base pair memorability analyses were conducted first by finding the proportion of subjects who recalled each base pair in each condition. For instance, if subjects #2, 7, 12, and 17 had ‘copy-angel’ in the ΔTarget condition and 3/4 recalled it, while subjects #5, 10, 15, and 20 had ‘copy-angel’ in the control condition and 2/4 recalled it, the ΔTarget – control memorability for that pair would be 0.25. Next, we ran ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression analyses between the memorability of that pair and its specific AS or GloVe cos(<italic>θ</italic>) value. For the ΔBoth condition, we added cue+target relatedness values before conducting the regression. In some cases, the y-intercept of the OLS line may be theoretically meaningful (e.g., 0 AS means 0 subjects might endorse a word in a free association task). In all cases, the slope was of interest, indicating whether and how relatedness affected condition-based memorability. Significance for both slope and intercept results were reported in each plot based on p values from ‘fitlm’ in MATLAB, and best-fit lines were plotted with the confidence error output from ‘polypredci’ in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Strider, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Memory dependence was calculated by first examining memory for each base pair target-secondary pair target duo within a condition across subjects. Consider the following example in the ΔTarget condition, where 1=correct and 0=incorrect memory and values are represented respectively across subjects. If answers for subjects #2, 7, 12, and 17 when given ‘peace’ as the cue during the base pair test (correct answer: ‘razor’) were 1, 1, 1, and 0 and their answers when given ‘peace’ as the cue during the secondary pair test (correct answer: ‘shave’) were 1, 1, 0, and 0, the across-subject dependence would be 0.75. Conversely, if the base pair test across the same subjects for the same pair was 1, 1, 1, and 0 and the secondary test was 0, 1, 0, and 1, the across-subject correlation would be 0.25. It is important to note that, between the extremes of ceiling and floor performance, dependence and performance are dissociable. A target duo could potentially have a higher rate of dependence than raw memory performance if it regularly became forgotten together. Conversely, a target duo could have a lower rate of dependence than memory performance if one of the two pairs are regularly recalled and the other not. Following this calculation, we performed similar regression analyses with these values plotted against semantic relatedness in each experiment. Additionally, we determined thresholds for each word pair by finding the dependence of each cue-target pair versus all other mismatched, cue-Δtarget pairs. Since there were 44 other pairs, our upper threshold was whether the true pair was higher than 43/44=0.977 of the other pairs, which corresponds to a significance threshold of α=0.046. We plotted the average of these thresholds within each experiment as a dotted line on each dependence graph.</p><p>To create the memorability surfaces in the ΔBoth condition, we first examined the ΔBoth – control condition memorability across subjects for each base pair (as above). Next, we found the bivariate cue and target relatedness for each base pair. From this, each pair had three coordinates: a cue relatedness value (which would become the y-coordinate on the surface), a target relatedness value (the x-coordinate), and a ΔBoth – control memorability value (the z-coordinate). To obtain a smoothed surface from these data, we used robust spline smoothing of the z values over the x-y surface with a smoothing factor of approximately 40% of the input space (e.g., 0.37 for data spanning 0.93 of AS values and 0.43 for 1.09 of cosine similarity values) (using the ‘smoothn’ function in MATLAB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Garcia, 2010</xref>). This smoothing factor was used to cover inevitable gaps in the surface space (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> for illustration of this point). Above- and below-zero thresholds in the surface space were calculated like the above using bootstrapped permutation tests, and we similarly smoothed over these surfaces using the same smoothing factor. To assess significance, we found the sizes of 2-D clusters where the true values exceeded the above-zero thresholds. Because a noisy signal could exceed this threshold simply by chance, we next computed the likelihood of finding a cluster of the observed size. To do this, we used 1000 permutation tests, whereby we randomly scrambled whether an across-subject memorability value fell in the ΔBoth or control condition, and we found the size of each of these clusters exceeding the above-zero permutation threshold. Finally, we obtained a p value by examining the proportion of permutation tests that our observed cluster exceeded.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Informed consent was obtained from each subject based on a form authorized by the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo Institutional Review Board: #2020-068-CP, &quot;Memory for Emotional and/or Neutral Information&quot;.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Cue-Δcue and target-Δtarget pairs and their relatedness factors for the narrower stimulus set.</title><p>AS: associative strength; MS: mediator strength; Spath: weighted shortest path; SpAct: spreading activation strength; GloVe: global vector cos(<italic>θ</italic>); w2v: word2vec cos(<italic>θ</italic>); LSA: latent semantic analysis cos(<italic>θ</italic>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Brice Kuhl (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide a clear, coherent theoretical framework to clarify the design motivation, results, interpretation, and conceptual advances being made. While all reviewers were highly positive about the empirical rigor, they all had reservations about the theoretical framing. R1 and R2 commented on the confusion of the multiple theoretical accounts throughout and that it is not clear how your results support or refute or distinguish among theoretical alternatives; R2 raised specific, excellent point about the problem of recursive reminder to explain some data points; R3 also commented the lack of significant conceptual advances and the limited influence outside human episodic memory. The paper needs to be substantially revised to improve on the theoretical framework to address these major concerns.</p><p>2) The motivation of the specific, central, manipulation choices (narrow vs. wide; measuring semantic relatedness using &quot;strength of association&quot;) are currently unclear. Addressing this point may rely on having a clear theoretical framework and may also help address the concern of limited influence raised in Point 1 above. That is, at least those who are interested in the dynamics of semantic memory and the interface between semantic and episodic memory (or learning in general) may also find your results relevant once the semantic manipulations are clearly explained.</p><p>3) Some methodological details need to be addressed by additional analyses and/or clarification: the confound of the repetition time differences, how yoking subjects to the same learning orders were done, and how dependence scores were computed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study tackles the memory dynamics by behaviorally examining what happens to the old (associative) memory when new (associative) memories are formed, and how it is affected by semantic relatedness (prior, long term, semantic memory). Through a grand experiment with 1000 participants and systematic manipulations of semantic relatedness across cue and target, broader semantic context, and delay between old and new associative learning, they provided a rich and robust empirical dataset showing how semantic relatedness between old and new learning in general strengthen the old memories and the old-new relatedness. A cognitive framework memory dynamic is presented to account for the data.</p><p>Clearly depicting the behavioral profiles of the dynamic relationships among long term (semantic/associative) memory and the new memory is much desired for the understanding of the complex memory formation and storage. The careful experimental manipulation, the impressive sample size (both subject and stimuli) and the data analyses and visualization, are laudable. The consideration of multiple types of semantic distance measures (internal vs. external) also helps establish the robustness of the effect. The value of the empirical results aside, I have concerns about several aspects of the current manuscript.</p><p>The paper is hard to read, not only because of the richness of the conditions, but mostly because of the lack of a clear and coherent theoretical framework to guide the design and interpretation. The Introduction states that it tests the classical Osgood proposal and predictions were made on that model. But no clear alternatives are analyzed, and it is difficult to appreciate the implications of the results consistent or inconsistent with the proposal. The discussion presented several additional accounts/explanations (e.g., recursive reminders, neural models), but they do not seem to constituent explanations but rather descriptions of the data. What is the relationship between these proposals? What specific assumptions about the memory system is supported/refuted by the data? More specifically, while the different effects of cue- and target- relatedness, semantic context (wide/narrow), and temporal delay are certainly intriguing, they are not clearly motivated or explained. Thus, how exactly memory models are constrained by these empirical findings are not easily appreciated.</p><p>A further concern regards the treatment of &quot;semantic effects/semantic relations&quot;. The study distinguishes old and new memory, the &quot;semantic effects&quot; they observed are part of an &quot;older&quot; memory. The way the authors use &quot;semantic relatedness&quot; to describe the effect of &quot;prior knowledge&quot; does not make distinctions between potentially different types of long-term relations in the memory representations such as semantic vs. associative -- in the main analyses the semantic distance were operationalized using association strength. It's okay to be parsimonious and show that the distinction is not necessary, and they affect memory dynamics in the same way. But this needs to be explicitly discussed, given the psycholinguistic literature in the past decades that these two kinds of relations show different effects in comprehension (priming) and production (e.g., picture-word interference) tasks. More generally, the mechanisms underlying associative and semantic memory/learning, and between episodic and semantic memory are expected to be discussed in greater depth and clarity (e.g., see Renoult et a., 2019 TICS). It is also not clear what the psychological reality of one step or multiple steps of semantic relations.</p><p>In summary, I appreciate the empirical rigor of the study and find the results potentially very important. But they need to be situated in clearer theoretical framework to show their implications for how memory works and to guide further cognitive/neural studies of memory.</p><p>L69 &quot;. In studies in which new and old cues and targets were 70 semantically related, or new cues were related to old cues while new targets were not related to 71 old targets, RI for the original A-B association has been found on the order of minutes (31-34). 72 However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated long-term effects when both new and old 73 cues and targets are related, or with very high levels of semantic relatedness.&quot;</p><p>- I find this sentence very hard to follow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study has several strengths. It did a comprehensive, vigorous hypothesis test, by examining multiple experimental conditions under the same paradigm and with a large sample size. These results could help to reconcile the mixed findings in the literature. Their treatment of semantic relatedness is also thorough and appropriate. The conclusion is mostly accurate and justified. There are some methodological details that I think should be considered. Finally, the lack of neural evidence somewhat limits its conceptual advances.</p><p>My main suggestions are related to the methodological details, which I will detail below.</p><p>First, the current study used a retrieval-to-criterion learning paradigm, which is very efficient in achieving the desired learning outcome. Although I think this is appropriate for the initial learning of base pairs, it might introduce additional variances during the learning of second pairs that may complicate the explanations. As depicted in Figure S7, semantic relatedness facelifted new learning, resulting in fewer repetitions for strongly related pairs than weakly related pairs. Since this new learning also influences old memory, it is unclear whether the different repetitions also matter, in addition to semantic relatedness itself.</p><p>Second, the comparison between restudy and retrieval practice is very interesting and informative. The authors also made a good effort to match the exposure, by yoking each of 200 subjects to the exact learning order of subjects in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment. However, it is not clear how this was achieved, given the individual differences in the overall memory performance. This could be more complicated considering the memorability of a given pair also differs across subjects.</p><p>Third, the examination of memory dependence is also very interesting. I am curious how the dependence score is dissociated with the memory score? Still, one can imagine that this index might be less meaningful for subjects who performed very badly or very well in both tests, as their high dependence score might not reflect the true memory integration.</p><p>Fourth, the motivation of some experimental manipulations needs more justifications. For example, why did the author manipulate a narrower vs. a wider range of semantic relatedness? For the restudy vs. retrieval comparison, why the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay condition was selected?</p><p>My final comment is related to the theoretic account of the results. It seems that the interpretation of the results primarily relies on the recursive reminders account. Although I agree this is a reasonable choice, there are some issues that are worth mentioning. For example, this account might not explain the results under the ΔCue condition very well, and it is unclear whether these effects were mainly driven by the ΔTarget under the ΔBoth condition. It is also not readily transparent to me how it could account for the effect of study-test interval on the overall RI vs. RF patterns. Still, the authors did not discuss how it could account for the restudy vs. retrieval differences. Moreover, since there is no neural evidence to actually examine the reactivation during learning, it is my opinion that the current study did not provide direct evidence to support or refute this account, which somehow limits the conceptual advances of the current study. For the same reason, I am not sure if the neural model proposed in the discussion (Figure 7) is justified by the data.</p><p>Although this study used a large sample, some of the effects seem to be unreliable. For example, in figure S8, when both the narrow and wide conditions were merged, the effect of semantic relatedness show different trends, i.e., the regression line did not overlap. Did the authors also examine the strength of semantic association between the two words in each pair, and whether this could be a confounding factor that should be controlled in the analyses?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this is a very solid and rigorous paper. The main contribution is to understanding the factors that determine behavioral measures of retroactive interference versus facilitation. In particular, when cue-target associations change (e.g., A-B to A-D), the question is how the degree of similarity between original and new cues and original and old targets will influence the relative interference vs. facilitation effects. This issue has a very long history in experimental psychology. The paper takes particular inspiration from a very influential idea from Osgood that interference/facilitation effects can be described along a continuous surface where cue similarity and target similarity are independent dimensions. The paper generally supports the ideas proposed by Osgood, but represents what is likely the most thorough empirical test of these ideas. Notably, whereas Osgood's original ideas were inspired by combining findings from many different experiments/papers/researchers, the current study packs all of the key experimental variables into a single, cohesive set of experiments.</p><p>Other strengths of the paper include relatively large sample sizes, consideration of the effects of delay (5 min vs. 48 hours) and consideration of the effects of retrieval practice vs. study. Additionally, although not a major point of emphasis in the paper, one of the interesting findings is that similarity between original and new items can protect older memories without increasing confusability (intrusions). This perhaps represents the most surprising result in the paper as the alternative prediction would be very reasonable (that semantic relatedness would increase intrusions). It seems difficult to pin down exactly why relatedness was protective against intrusions, but it is an intriguing result.</p><p>The biggest limitation in the paper is the amount of conceptual advance. As the authors note, Osgood's original ideas anticipated (most of) the key results in the current study-namely, the idea that facilitation and interference are a function of the similarity between original and new information. While the current paper provides a much more definitive investigation of this than is currently available in the literature, there have also been many papers since Osgood (nicely reviewed by the authors) that anticipate aspects of the current results. In particular, studies looking at integration or recursive reminders have clearly established that processes following initial encoding (of the base pairs) will impact the degree of interference and can even promote facilitation. In the current study, there is no direct evidence that integration or reminders occurred, but it is inferred that relatedness triggered reminders.</p><p>Taken together, the paper is likely to be of interest to those that study episodic memory in humans (and, in particular, those interested in memory interference). Given the influence of Osgood's original paper in the field of human learning and memory, this paper may also have substantial influence as a definitive test of Osgood's ideas. However, it is less clear whether the paper will have substantial influence outside this field.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Semantic relatedness retroactively benefits memory and promotes memory interdependence across episodes&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Chris Baker (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be considered, as Reviewer 2 explains carefully below, along with specific suggestions for revision. Please revise and respond carefully to these thoughtful comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed my previous concerns. I have no more questions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed some of my comments, but not the others. In particular, they should have a more rigorous control of the effect of repetition time, and come up with a better theoretical framework.</p><p>Regarding comment #1, the authors did additional analyses to examine the effect of learning efficiency (as measured by the No. of repetitions) and memory. They found no significant linear correlations, and the relationship between semantic relatedness and RF/RI effect remained significant after controlling the learning efficiency.</p><p>According to the recursive reminder hypothesis the authors are trying to argue, each time new learning would reactivate the old association, which then affects the strength of old memory and its relationship with the new memory. The number of repetitions thus should have some effect, although it might not necessarily be in a linear fashion. We all know that repetitions do not linearly increase memory strength. Still, this effect should also be modulated by semantic relatedness, which determines the degree of reactivation of old memory. That said, I am not sure if there is a simple statistic method to control the effect of repetition time.</p><p>In addition, this confounding factor should also be considered when examining the effect of semantic relatedness on memory interdependency. It should also be considered when comparing the restudy and test conditions, which I will describe below.</p><p>Regarding comment #2, the authors acknowledged that the yoke between the repetition time between restudy and test was not perfect due to individual differences, but argued that this was sufficient to match the two conditions. To make this argument, I think the authors should show that the number of repetitions did not affect the overall results for both the test and restudy conditions. They have two choices to prove this. The first option is to randomly assign the number of repetitions to each pair and each subject, or use the group averaged repetitions for each pair (to account for the effect of semantic relatedness on subsequent learning) on every subject. The second option is to use a fixed number of repetitions for all subjects and pairs. I think the second option would be better, considering my comment #1.</p><p>Regarding my comment #3, the authors strongly argued that memorability and interdependence should theoretically be dissociated, with which I agree entirely. Nevertheless, with higher memorability, the chance of both items being remembered was also higher. I think a straightforward way to convince the readers is to calculate the correlation between memorability and interdependence and use memorability as a covariate while examining the result of interdependence.</p><p>For the Δboth condition, the authors found that Δcue and Δtarget relatedness have a different effect on interdependency and memorability. I agree with the authors that this result did complicate the result and the interpretation. Nevertheless, I think the result is interesting thus should be included and briefly discussed.</p><p>My last comment concerns the theoretical framework, which the first reviewer has also raised. In this revision, the authors briefly mentioned the recursive reminder hypothesis in the introduction but did not describe the hypothesis or the predictions. This introduces extra confusion about the relationship between the recursive reminder hypothesis and Osgood's predictions. What are the mechanisms underlying Osgood's predictions? Would the recursive reminder hypothesis support Osgood's predictions?</p><p>Moreover, both the recursive reminder hypothesis and Osgood's predictions deal with semantic relatedness. It is thus surprising that at the end of the Introduction, they were to examine several effects, such as the broad and narrow semantic association, the delay effect, the testing effect, and the effect of semantic relatedness on memory interdependency. Would the inclusion of these conditions help to falsify the hypothesis or predictions? The authors examined the semantic relatedness in different conditions separately but did not directly compare these conditions. They argued that this was because they were from different experiments. I am not sure if this argument is valid.</p><p>The authors introduce the testing effect to explain the delay effect and the difference between restudy and testing conditions. The testing effect, in my view, is mainly an observation, not an interpretation. Many possible mechanisms have been proposed and they are still under debate.</p><p>That said, I should note that this study examined a broad range of essential issues in RF and RI effects, and it is thus a challenge to come up with a simple theoretic framework to cover all of them. Meanwhile, I still think this study has provided critical empirical data for understanding the RF/RI effect.

While all reviewers were highly positive about the empirical rigor, they all had reservations about the theoretical framing. R1 and R2 commented on the confusion of the multiple theoretical accounts throughout and that it is not clear how your results support or refute or distinguish among theoretical alternatives; R2 raised specific, excellent point about the problem of recursive reminder to explain some data points; R3 also commented the lack of significant conceptual advances and the limited influence outside human episodic memory. The paper needs to be substantially revised to improve on the theoretical framework to address these major concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to these thoughtful criticisms, we have extensively revised the introduction to provide a clearer theoretical framework with opposing predictions that we refer back to when interpreting our results throughout the paper. Rather than directly motivating our study from Osgood’s (1949) conjecture about semantic relatedness, we now trace the theoretical motivation for this conjecture back to a still-outstanding question about different mechanisms that may give rise to retroactive facilitation or inhibition. On one hand, we may expect semantic relatedness to primarily increase competition between episodic memories, leading to interference across the board. This account has some empirical support in other paradigms. On the other hand, recursive reminders predict facilitation, if related cues trigger rehearsal of prior memories. We suggest that the patterns observed here (and Osgood’s predictions) support this latter account.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The motivation of the specific, central, manipulation choices (narrow vs. wide; measuring semantic relatedness using &quot;strength of association&quot;) are currently unclear. Addressing this point may rely on having a clear theoretical framework and may also help address the concern of limited influence raised in Point 1 above. That is, at least those who are interested in the dynamics of semantic memory and the interface between semantic and episodic memory (or learning in general) may also find your results relevant once the semantic manipulations are clearly explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided more information about these design choices in the introduction and results of the paper. In particular, we have clarified that the condition presenting a wider range of semantic relatedness (from highly similar to completely unrelated) was introduced to address concerns that our original condition only included items that were highly similar in absolute terms and therefore did not have sufficient coverage over the full spectrum of relatedness to observe what happens when relatedness approaches the limit of unrelated items. We also now discuss at greater length the tradeoffs of different measures of semantic relatedness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some methodological details need to be addressed by additional analyses and/or clarification: the confound of the repetition time differences, how yoking subjects to the same learning orders were done, and how dependence scores were computed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified these additional concepts and analyses more thoroughly in the appropriate places, and we address them more thoroughly in response to reviewers below. In response to the first point, we have included additional partial correlation analyses that we believe rules out this alternative interpretation of our results. In response to the latter points, we have expanded our explanations of these concepts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study tackles the memory dynamics by behaviorally examining what happens to the old (associative) memory when new (associative) memories are formed, and how it is affected by semantic relatedness (prior, long term, semantic memory). Through a grand experiment with 1000 participants and systematic manipulations of semantic relatedness across cue and target, broader semantic context, and delay between old and new associative learning, they provided a rich and robust empirical dataset showing how semantic relatedness between old and new learning in general strengthen the old memories and the old-new relatedness. A cognitive framework memory dynamic is presented to account for the data.</p><p>Clearly depicting the behavioral profiles of the dynamic relationships among long term (semantic/associative) memory and the new memory is much desired for the understanding of the complex memory formation and storage. The careful experimental manipulation, the impressive sample size (both subject and stimuli) and the data analyses and visualization, are laudable. The consideration of multiple types of semantic distance measures (internal vs. external) also helps establish the robustness of the effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this accurate and kind evaluation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The value of the empirical results aside, I have concerns about several aspects of the current manuscript.</p><p>The paper is hard to read, not only because of the richness of the conditions, but mostly because of the lack of a clear and coherent theoretical framework to guide the design and interpretation. The Introduction states that it tests the classical Osgood proposal and predictions were made on that model. But no clear alternatives are analyzed, and it is difficult to appreciate the implications of the results consistent or inconsistent with the proposal. The discussion presented several additional accounts/explanations (e.g., recursive reminders, neural models), but they do not seem to constituent explanations but rather descriptions of the data. What is the relationship between these proposals? What specific assumptions about the memory system is supported/refuted by the data? More specifically, while the different effects of cue- and target- relatedness, semantic context (wide/narrow), and temporal delay are certainly intriguing, they are not clearly motivated or explained. Thus, how exactly memory models are constrained by these empirical findings are not easily appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the constructive criticism about readability. We now further explain the conditions and alternative theoretical frameworks at play earlier in the Introduction rather than in the Results or Discussion. We also take the opportunity to expand the paper in parts to unpack some of our densest ideas and sentences.</p><p>We now bring up the most salient opposing theoretical accounts in the Introduction (p. 3):</p><p>“Here, we evaluate an over 70-year-old proposal by Osgood (1) that this relationship depends on <italic>semantic relatedness</italic>. In building up to this proposal, we will consider three broad possibilities. The first possibility is that relatedness has no effect on episodic memory. A second possibility is that relatedness across experiences introduces interference between memories. Third, relatedness could trigger reminders of prior information during new learning, causing the rehearsal and strengthening of prior memories.</p><p>In order for the first (null) account to be correct, memories must be formed distinctly, and processes operating during both encoding and retrieval must be able to accurately pinpoint and isolate memories without any residual effects or dependence on semantics. We consider this account helpful to consider because these processes clearly <italic>are</italic> affected by semantic relatedness, as many decades of research have shown. For instance, semantic relatedness improves memory when both items of a paired associate are related (2–4), it provides an organizational scaffold for clustering responses during free recall (5–8), and it can create false memories for highly related associate words (9, 10). In favor of the second (interference) account, pairing a single retrieval cue with multiple target responses could benefit from greater semantic differences between the targets, allowing for easier dissociation between them (11). Indeed, increasing relatedness between tasks in some paradigms can increase interference (12–14) and/or the rate of intruding material from one task to the other (15–19). Finally, in favor of the third (strengthening) account, there is evidence that we are not always passive during new learning: sometimes we “think back” to, and thereby reactivate, prior experiences (20). These events, called recursive reminders, can occur when subjects are given explicit instructions or cues as reminders (21–23), or – more relevantly here – they can occur spontaneously when information is related (24, 25). Moreover, recursive reminders seem to create interdependence between old and new information, with preserved information about the temporal order of learning rather than source confusion and negative competition between the traces (20, 26–28). The recursive reminders account therefore predicts that semantic relatedness would promote RF and interdependence among memory traces. Altogether, the first account is clearly incorrect, but when and how strongly the countervailing forces of RI and RF from the latter accounts operate remains a central puzzle.”</p><p>Following this, we refer back to these countervailing processes throughout the paper, such as in the Results (p. 11):</p><p>“We also asked whether target relatedness would increase intrusions, or errors from the secondary pair list into the base pair list. That is, we wanted to contrast two accounts. Under an RI-based account, the targets may merge or compete, leading to confusion about the list contexts (e.g., peace-razorshave). Theoretically, this account could produce some intrusions in addition to RF; indeed, lack of interference in RI studies wherein targets are related has been posited to stem from a “loss of differentiation” between semantically related sources (15), and other studies have found greater intrusion errors with increasing relatedness (16–19). Under the recursive reminders account, highly related new targets would simultaneously strengthen old memories due to reminders of the base pair list and would be scaffolded to the cue as part of the secondary pair list, meaning the list contexts remained interdependent, yet distinguishable (e.g., peace-razor-base list/peace-shave-secondary list). We therefore asked whether relatedness increased across-list intrusions of the new target response into the base pair list by correlating the across-subject intrusion rate with target relatedness. In fact, intrusions significantly decreased in the wider stimulus set, 5-min experiment (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and otherwise did not increase with target relatedness in any experiment (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.08; Figure 3-Supp 1), supporting the recursive reminders account.”</p><p>and in the Discussion (p. 21):</p><p>“Critically, the absence of greater intrusions with higher relatedness suggests that temporal order information regarding the learning list of each pair was preserved rather than the two contexts becoming confused. That is, with high relatedness, recursive reminder-induced memory benefits outweighed the possible countervailing force of competition at retrieval. With weaker pre-existing associations, we speculate that subjects noticed changes while learning new secondary pairs but may have been less likely to recall and integrate them with corresponding base pairs.”</p><p>We have now added motivation regarding the two retention intervals to the Introduction (p. 5):</p><p>“Additionally, interference often differs depending on the delay between learning interfering material and test (23, 51–55), and we therefore fully crossed the narrower and wider stimulus sets with two different test delays occurring 5-min and 48-hr after secondary pair learning (Figure 1C).”</p><p>Regarding the two ranges of relatedness: our initial set of experiments featured the stimulus set with a narrower range of relatedness. As detailed in the paper, we initially found intriguing results regarding the influence of relatedness on memory, but we did not find any semblance of retroactive interference. We reasoned that perhaps a wider range of relatedness would both generalize the results more broadly beyond local semantic neighbors of direct associations and also potentially demonstrate that retroactive interference still occurs in this paradigm (which we indeed found under low relatedness in the 5-minute delay experiment). We also have now added more motivation regarding the two ranges of relatedness to the Introduction (p. 5):</p><p>“In our initial experiments, we used a stimulus set with a narrow range of relatedness values, corresponding to the direct associative pair strength. In later experiments, to address how these initial results generalized beyond local semantic neighborhoods of direct associations, we used a stimulus set with a wider range of relatedness that included truly unrelated associations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A further concern regards the treatment of &quot;semantic effects/semantic relations&quot;. The study distinguishes old and new memory, the &quot;semantic effects&quot; they observed are part of an &quot;older&quot; memory. The way the authors use &quot;semantic relatedness&quot; to describe the effect of &quot;prior knowledge&quot; does not make distinctions between potentially different types of long-term relations in the memory representations such as semantic vs. associative -- in the main analyses the semantic distance were operationalized using association strength. It's okay to be parsimonious and show that the distinction is not necessary, and they affect memory dynamics in the same way. But this needs to be explicitly discussed, given the psycholinguistic literature in the past decades that these two kinds of relations show different effects in comprehension (priming) and production (e.g., picture-word interference) tasks. More generally, the mechanisms underlying associative and semantic memory/learning, and between episodic and semantic memory are expected to be discussed in greater depth and clarity (e.g., see Renoult et a., 2019 TICS). It is also not clear what the psychological reality of one step or multiple steps of semantic relations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. Indeed, semantic and associative relations are dissociable and affect cognition in different ways (e.g., Thompson-Schill et al., 1998). We have not made it an explicit point to dissociate them in this study. However, as the reviewer notes, our analyses detailed in Supp File 6 do not show clear differences between measures of semantic and contextual similarity (e.g. using LSA and word2vec) versus associative strength (e.g. based on free recall networks). We have added the following as a limitation to the discussion (p. 25):</p><p>“A notable limitation of our study is that we did not dissociate between semantic representations based on distributed representational models [e.g., (61, 131)] and associative relations based on association strength and spreading activation [e.g., (132)], instead relying on the broad term, semantic relatedness, to capture both constructs. Analyses in Supp File 6 did not indicate any clear distinction in correlations with memorability and interdependence between measures of semantic and contextual similarity such as LSA and word2vec versus associative strength. Nevertheless, we did not aim to directly contrast these two constructs by selecting stimuli that dissociate them, and given that the two types of relations show different effects on cognition [e.g., (133)], this will be important in future work.”</p><p>The reviewer refers to the literature on interactions between episodic and semantic memories as well as the blurry boundary between them (Renoult et al., 2019). We agree with the general sentiment in this literature that the distinction is impure and that subjects likely use mental strategies involving semantic memory here. In addition to other ways this is mentioned in the Discussion section, we have added the following second sentence (first sentence included for context) (p. 22):</p><p>“In this framework, our high relatedness ΔTarget and ΔBoth conditions resemble a closed loop, except that rather than having to learn the final link in the loop de novo, unrelated associations are closed by the pre-existing target relationship in the ΔTarget condition and by both pre-existing cue and target relationships in the ΔBoth condition. These results demonstrate a clear interplay between semantic and episodic representations, whereby semantic representations scaffold the formation and retention of episodic memories (8, 104).”</p><p>The psychological reality of one versus multi-step relationships is an interesting topic that has been addressed in at least a few studies. Nelson et al. (1997), Nelson &amp; Zhang (2000), and Kenett et al. (2017) showed that recall can be facilitated by two-step relationships, while De Deyne et al. (2019) showed that multi-step relationships could successfully predict human similarity in a word association game. These findings are mentioned in the Results (p. 16):</p><p>“Additionally, semantic network relationships can predict paired associate memory beyond single steps to nearby neighbors, with significant benefits shown up to two (3, 64) or three (65) semantic steps.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, I appreciate the empirical rigor of the study and find the results potentially very important. But they need to be situated in clearer theoretical framework to show their implications for how memory works and to guide further cognitive/neural studies of memory.</p><p>L69 &quot;. In studies in which new and old cues and targets were 70 semantically related, or new cues were related to old cues while new targets were not related to 71 old targets, RI for the original A-B association has been found on the order of minutes (31-34). 72 However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated long-term effects when both new and old 73 cues and targets are related, or with very high levels of semantic relatedness.&quot;</p><p>- I find this sentence very hard to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The sentence now reads (p. 4):</p><p>“Studies in which both cues and targets bear some level of relationship to the original A-B pair are scant. However, there have been cases where <italic>either</italic> the new cue was semantically related to the old cue but the targets were unrelated, the new target was semantically related to the old target but the cues were unrelated, or both new cues and targets shared some modest level of relatedness with the old ones; in each of these cases, RI for the original A-B association has been observed when testing occurred after short retention intervals (on the order of minutes) (13, 46–48). However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated longer-term memory in cases where the new cues and targets were both highly related to the old ones.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study has several strengths. It did a comprehensive, vigorous hypothesis test, by examining multiple experimental conditions under the same paradigm and with a large sample size. These results could help to reconcile the mixed findings in the literature. Their treatment of semantic relatedness is also thorough and appropriate. The conclusion is mostly accurate and justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some methodological details that I think should be considered. Finally, the lack of neural evidence somewhat limits its conceptual advances.</p><p>My main suggestions are related to the methodological details, which I will detail below.</p><p>First, the current study used a retrieval-to-criterion learning paradigm, which is very efficient in achieving the desired learning outcome. Although I think this is appropriate for the initial learning of base pairs, it might introduce additional variances during the learning of second pairs that may complicate the explanations. As depicted in Figure S7, semantic relatedness facelifted new learning, resulting in fewer repetitions for strongly related pairs than weakly related pairs. Since this new learning also influences old memory, it is unclear whether the different repetitions also matter, in addition to semantic relatedness itself.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an astute point that the efficiency of new learning in the secondary pair condition could theoretically predict retroactive memory benefits. We address this concern with new analyses and the following text in the Results section (p. 19):</p><p>“Next, we wanted to rule out an alternative possibility raised by these results. Secondary pairs with high relatedness were learned more efficiently, meaning that they had fewer exposures. If the number of exposures increased RI, this would suggest our RF effects could stem in part from lesser interference. We conducted two analyses to address this possibility. First, we correlated new learning efficiency with memorability across pairs in each condition. We found generally weak evidence in favor of this idea, with significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) results in only the ΔTarget condition in the wider stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment (<italic>r</italic> = 0.30, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). Second, we ran partial correlations between relatedness and memorability across pairs while controlling for new learning efficiency. These partial correlations remained significant in all of the main analyses above, including in the ΔTarget condition in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr experiment (<italic>r</italic> = 0.34, <italic>p</italic> = 0.026), wider stimulus set, 5-min delay experiment (<italic>r</italic> = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002), and wider stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment (<italic>r</italic> = 0.36, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016) and for cue+target relatedness in the ΔBoth condition in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr experiment (<italic>r</italic> = 0.41, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Full results from these partial correlations can also be seen in Supp File 7. Therefore, it appears our RF effects did not rely on the amount of pair exposure during secondary pair learning.”</p><p>Given the interest in this point and in other reviewer comments, we also now feature these learning results more prominently as Figure 8 in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the comparison between restudy and retrieval practice is very interesting and informative. The authors also made a good effort to match the exposure, by yoking each of 200 subjects to the exact learning order of subjects in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment. However, it is not clear how this was achieved, given the individual differences in the overall memory performance. This could be more complicated considering the memorability of a given pair also differs across subjects.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this point. We have now added the following to the Methods section (p. 28):</p><p>“In the study-only experiment, the yoking procedure for each subject was matched to the learning order of a subject from the retrieval-to-criterion, narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment. For example, subject #1 from the retrieval-to-criterion experiment was matched with subject #1 from the study-only experiment. We copied the learning order precisely in both base and secondary pair learning phases from each retrieval-to-criterion subject to the study-only subject, so if subject #1 in the former saw ‘sick-push’ first, so did subject #1 in the latter experiment, and so on. In later rounds of learning, when many word pairs had dropped out for a subject in the retrieval-to-criterion experiment, those same items dropped out for the yoked subject in the study-only experiment. We acknowledge that this procedure cannot control for individual differences in memorability; for instance, subject #1 in the retrieval-to-criterion experiment and subject #1 in the study-only experiment could require different exposures to achieve the same criterion, so the pairs remaining at the end of each learning phase may not be the ones the study-only subject would have struggled to learn. Such differences cannot be addressed without an additional test assessment in the study-only experiment, but we believe that matching the objective amount of exposure serves as a sufficient control for our purposes.”</p><p>We also thank the reviewer for their enthusiasm regarding the restudy (study-only) experiment, and we have now made those results more prominent in the paper by including them as Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the examination of memory dependence is also very interesting. I am curious how the dependence score is dissociated with the memory score? Still, one can imagine that this index might be less meaningful for subjects who performed very badly or very well in both tests, as their high dependence score might not reflect the true memory integration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. Memory recall and dependence are indeed dissociable measures. We calculated dependence by considering, for a given ‘duo’ within a particular condition (e.g., base pair memory for ‘razor’ and then secondary memory for ‘shave’, given the pairs ‘peace-razor’ and ‘peace-shave’, in the ΔTarget condition), how often the duo was either both remembered, or both forgotten. So, a duo could potentially have a higher rate of dependence than raw memory performance if duos were also regularly forgotten together (e.g., dependence could be 0.9 if they ‘moved together’ for 90% of participants, even if the raw base pair memory recall rate was 0.7 and the secondary pair rate 0.6). Conversely, the duo could have a lower rate of dependence than memory performance if one of the two pairs are regularly recalled and the other not. Therefore, the measures are dissociable. To assess whether dependence could be high simply because of overall ceiling (or floor) performance, we also calculated, as a baseline, how often ‘razor’ was remembered against all other words in the secondary condition. This was plotted as the dotted line in each of the dependence graphs. Therefore, while we agree that integration performance is difficult to assess for individuals with extremely high or extremely low performance, we would argue that such subjects would simply add noise to our measure, and we have many subjects between these extremes. We have clarified these points by modifying the Methods section (p. 28-29):</p><p>“Memory dependence was calculated by first examining memory for each base pair target-secondary pair target duo within a condition across subjects. Consider the following example in the ΔTarget condition, where 1 = correct and 0 = incorrect memory and values are represented respectively across subjects. If answers for subjects #2, 7, 12, and 17 when given “peace” as the cue during the base pair test (correct answer: “razor”) were 1,1,1,0 and their answers when given “peace” as the cue during the secondary pair test (correct answer: “shave”) were 1,1,0,0, the across-subject dependence would be 0.75. Conversely, if the base pair test across the same subjects for the same pair was 1,1,1,0 and the secondary test was 0,1,0,1, the across-subject correlation would be 0.25. It is important to note that, between the extremes of ceiling and floor performance, dependence and performance are dissociable. A target duo could potentially have a higher rate of dependence than raw memory performance if it regularly became forgotten together. Conversely, a target duo could have a lower rate of dependence than memory performance if one of the two pairs are regularly recalled and the other not.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fourth, the motivation of some experimental manipulations needs more justifications. For example, why did the author manipulate a narrower vs. a wider range of semantic relatedness? For the restudy vs. retrieval comparison, why the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay condition was selected?</p></disp-quote><p>[Regarding the range of relatedness, we have copied part of this justification from our response to a similar inquiry to R1 above.] Our initial set of experiments featured the stimulus set with a narrower range of relatedness. As detailed in the paper, we initially found intriguing results regarding the influence of relatedness on memory, but we did not find any semblance of retroactive interference. We reasoned that perhaps a wider range of relatedness would both generalize the results more broadly beyond local semantic neighbors of direct associations and also potentially demonstrate that retroactive interference still occurs in this paradigm (which we indeed found under low relatedness in the 5-minute delay experiment). We have now clarified this in the Introduction (p. 5):</p><p>“In our initial experiments, we used a stimulus set with a narrow range of relatedness values, corresponding to the direct associative pair strength. In later experiments, to address how these initial results generalized beyond local semantic neighborhoods of direct associations, we used a stimulus set with a wider range of relatedness that included truly unrelated associations.”</p><p>Regarding the restudy vs. retrieval experiment, this is a worthy question of why we selected the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay condition. While the wider range stimulus set could have potentially allowed us to show semantic relatedness effects across a broader range of the semantic space, the narrower set offered the opportunity to test whether the benefits we demonstrated in the ΔBoth condition in the prior, retrieval-to-criterion experiments extended to the study-only condition. If we had used the wider stimulus set and found null results in the ΔBoth condition, it would have been unclear whether it was because of the stimulus set or learning strategy. We have clarified this point in the Results section (p. 17):</p><p>“We chose this stimulus set and delay because we were especially interested if the results in the ΔBoth experiment from the otherwise equivalent retrieval-to-criterion experiment would generalize to study-only conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My final comment is related to the theoretic account of the results. It seems that the interpretation of the results primarily relies on the recursive reminders account. Although I agree this is a reasonable choice, there are some issues that are worth mentioning. For example, this account might not explain the results under the ΔCue condition very well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these insightful points. Regarding the extent to which recursive reminders accounts for the ΔCue condition, we note in the Discussion that the recursive reminders account could be relevant for the ΔCue condition given the weakly positive correlation with relatedness (meaning reminders are more likely as relatedness increases). However, we also note the alternative possibility of increasing the availability of the target item. Even if target availability turns out to capture more of the retroactive benefits in this condition, it does not necessarily negate the relevance of the recursive reminders account for the other conditions – it simply means there are multiple possible memory mechanisms at play. We have changed the Discussion slightly to acknowledge this extra ambiguity as follows (p. 22):</p><p>“Altogether, the retroactive benefits are clear in the ΔCue condition, but the mechanism seems to differ from the ΔTarget condition and the extent to which recursive reminders are specifically involved versus other processes such as increased target availability is unclear.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear whether these effects were mainly driven by the ΔTarget under the ΔBoth condition.</p></disp-quote><p>Contrasting the relatedness of the new target word versus the new cue word within the ΔBoth condition is a fantastic idea. First, we performed additional analyses on memorability in the ΔBoth – control condition that would separately correlate with ΔCue or ΔTarget relatedness in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment (where we observed ΔBoth RF). As a reminder, correlating memorability against the summed ΔCue + ΔTarget relatedness value produced a significant correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.40, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007). Looking separately, we found that ΔTarget relatedness correlated with ΔBoth memorability (<italic>r</italic> = 0.38, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), whereas ΔCue relatedness did not (<italic>r</italic> = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> = 0.26). Furthermore, the ΔTarget relatedness correlation survived significance when performing partial correlations controlling for ΔCue relatedness (<italic>r</italic> = 0.39, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009).</p><p>We next performed the same analyses on base pair-secondary dependence in the ΔBoth condition. As a reminder, correlating dependence against the summed ΔCue + ΔTarget relatedness value produced a significant correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.31, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). Looking separately, we found that ΔCue relatedness correlated with ΔBoth dependence (<italic>r</italic> = 0.30, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04), whereas ΔTarget relatedness did not (<italic>r</italic> = 0.12, <italic>p</italic> = 0.42). Furthermore, the ΔCue relatedness correlation survived significance when performing partial correlations controlling for ΔTarget relatedness (<italic>r</italic> = 0.31, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04).</p><p>These are potentially important effects. However, there is inconsistent importance of cue versus target for dependence and memorability correlations, respectively, and there is (to us) no obvious, clear connection between these differing findings and those in the ΔCue and ΔTarget conditions. Therefore, we believe including them in the manuscript would risk further complicating the paper and also risk our over-interpreting these results before this unclear relationship is replicated. We propose retaining the previous analyses using bivariate cue/target relatedness and summed cue+target relatedness, which require fewer assumptions. While they may be underspecified, we do not believe they are incorrect. Nevertheless, we appreciate that there could be interesting nuances here, and we would be happy to include these analyses if the reviewer disagrees. Finally, we note that the data and code have been released and can be re-analyzed if this becomes a focus point of future investigations. As a result of this ambiguity about what exactly is driving the ΔBoth effects, we have softened the language that cue and target relatedness must be both high in the Discussion section, of which the new text reads as follows (p. 22):</p><p>“Strikingly, in the ΔBoth condition, RF occurred overall (versus control) and at high values of cue and target relatedness in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment. Moreover, base pair-secondary pair dependence similarly occurred at high cue and target relatedness in this experiment. These results suggest that, as in the ΔTarget condition, there was an increased likelihood of recursive reminders supported by pre-existing associations. These effects occurred when cue and target relatedness were high, possibly because changing both causes subjects to fail to recollect both pre-existing links and/or attribute the secondary pair to a new memory (103).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also not readily transparent to me how it could account for the effect of study-test interval on the overall RI vs. RF patterns. Still, the authors did not discuss how it could account for the restudy vs. retrieval differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding how recursive reminding could have different effects at different retention intervals: if recursive reminders act as a form of memory retrieval, this part of the effect could function like testing effects (Karpicke &amp; Roediger, 2008), which have preferential benefits at longer delays. Therefore, as recursive reminders become more likely, the benefits (relative to the control condition) should be more reliable after 48 hours than immediately, and this supports our general pattern of results. This explanation would also account for the long-term benefits of retrieval relative to re-study. (We do not directly compare them in the paper because they were part of different experiments, but this trend is readily apparent in examining the results and the general finding is highly consistent with the literature). To clarify this point, we have added the following to the Discussion section (p. 21):</p><p>“Although we have largely avoided comparing 5-min and 48-hr delay results directly because they were part of different experiments, it appears visually that conditions in which we expect recursive reminders tend to slow the rate of forgetting (relative to the amount of forgetting in the control condition). This pattern suggests recursive reminders act as effective retrieval processes, similar to the testing effect (20).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, since there is no neural evidence to actually examine the reactivation during learning, it is my opinion that the current study did not provide direct evidence to support or refute this account, which somehow limits the conceptual advances of the current study. For the same reason, I am not sure if the neural model proposed in the discussion (Figure 7) is justified by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding neural evidence and the neural model (now in Figure 9) – we acknowledge that we do not have direct evidence showing reactivation of prior memory traces. It has been shown numerous times that reactivation of old information during new learning occurs and supports memory for the old information (e.g., Kuhl et al., 2010; Chanales et al., 2019), and we effectively built upon those findings to discuss how our effects may arise neurally. We do believe the integration of semantic relatedness and recursive reminders into a unified model has some benefit for the literature. However, this model is still speculative, and we further acknowledge this point in the Discussion section (p. 23):</p><p>“Given these findings, we now speculate on how our effects fit within a neurobiological framework extending the recursive reminders account (Figure 9). In our study, pre-existing semantic relationships existed primarily within the neocortex, while previously unrelated pairs were bound by the hippocampus along with their episodic list context and novel, related episodes could also have been interdependently linked within the hippocampus. The No Δ condition generally produced maximum strengthening for both base and secondary pairs. In line with a theory suggesting that even repetitions of the same learning material creates multiple traces within the hippocampus (115), these context memories were formed individually yet, as shown by their strong interdependence (red, leftmost point in Figure 6B), they were strongly bound within the hippocampus. In the ΔTarget and ΔBoth conditions (and to a lesser extent in the ΔCue condition), high relatedness between base and secondary pairs – represented by pre-existing cortical links – facilitated base pair reactivation via recursive reminders, thus creating an inter-hippocampal association and behavioral dependence. Such benefits were far more limited with no or low relatedness. Additionally, though we propose that these interdependencies initially rely on the hippocampus, the novel associations may eventually become linked within the cortex with more repetitions (57, 105). Altogether, the model in Figure 9 provides a simplified, speculative explanation for our collected results and a testable mechanism for future studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although this study used a large sample, some of the effects seem to be unreliable. For example, in figure S8, when both the narrow and wide conditions were merged, the effect of semantic relatedness show different trends, i.e., the regression line did not overlap.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the effects are not always the same between the narrower and wider stimulus sets. In some cases (notably, the ΔBoth condition) we attribute to possible differences in overall relatedness and the likelihood of engaging in recursive reminders, such as in the Discussion (p. 22):</p><p>“Additionally, null effects in the wider stimulus set experiments – even for pairs with high cue and target relatedness – suggest that relatedness across pairs may also need to be high on average for subjects to start noticing and recollecting changes rather than attributing the pairs to entirely new associations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors also examine the strength of semantic association between the two words in each pair, and whether this could be a confounding factor that should be controlled in the analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We note that we specifically designed the experiment to rule out these types of confounds. That is, the memorability analysis allows us to subtract memory from the <italic>same exact pairs</italic> between one condition and the other, indicating that any incidental relationships due to the stimuli would not affect our results. Nevertheless, given that semantic relationships often benefit word pair learning and memory in countless other studies [e.g., Lyon, 1914; Noble, 1952; Underwood &amp; Schultz, 1960; Bahrick, 1970; Hall, 1972; Nelson et al., 1992; Naveh-Benjamin, 2000; Payne et al., 2012], we explicitly performed these analyses by investigating memory in the control condition versus the GloVe values between cues and targets. Here we did not find any significantly positive relationships, and in one case, we found a negative relationship [narrower set, 5-min experiment: <italic>r</italic> = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> = 0.14; narrower set, 48-hr experiment: <italic>r</italic> = 0.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.37; wider set, 5-min experiment: <italic>r</italic> = -0.41, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003; wider set, 48-hr experiment: <italic>r</italic> = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> = 0.30; study-only experiment: <italic>r</italic> = 0.15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.79]. It is unclear why the negative relationship emerged in only one study, but we highlight that these results may differ from the positive relationships in the literature because there was very little meaningful variance along the semantic relatedness dimension between cues and targets. That is, cues and targets were <italic>intentionally</italic> unrelated, so most of the variance in GloVe values was restricted to the low range of possible values (the mean±stdev GloVe value for combined stimulus sets was 0.19±0.11 on a scale that could be as high as 0.95). This was by design, as we intended the relevant semantic relationships in the study to be between old and new cues and old and new targets rather than between cues and targets themselves. Furthermore, we note that because our main memorability analyses involved contrasting memory for each pair in the experimental condition with the same pair in the control condition, we account for the influence of incidental differences in cue-target semantic relationships. Here again we opt not to include this in the paper to avoid complicating the message, but we could do so if the reviewer disagrees.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, this is a very solid and rigorous paper. The main contribution is to understanding the factors that determine behavioral measures of retroactive interference versus facilitation. In particular, when cue-target associations change (e.g., A-B to A-D), the question is how the degree of similarity between original and new cues and original and old targets will influence the relative interference vs. facilitation effects. This issue has a very long history in experimental psychology. The paper takes particular inspiration from a very influential idea from Osgood that interference/facilitation effects can be described along a continuous surface where cue similarity and target similarity are independent dimensions. The paper generally supports the ideas proposed by Osgood, but represents what is likely the most thorough empirical test of these ideas. Notably, whereas Osgood's original ideas were inspired by combining findings from many different experiments/papers/researchers, the current study packs all of the key experimental variables into a single, cohesive set of experiments.</p><p>Other strengths of the paper include relatively large sample sizes, consideration of the effects of delay (5 min vs. 48 hours) and consideration of the effects of retrieval practice vs. study. Additionally, although not a major point of emphasis in the paper, one of the interesting findings is that similarity between original and new items can protect older memories without increasing confusability (intrusions). This perhaps represents the most surprising result in the paper as the alternative prediction would be very reasonable (that semantic relatedness would increase intrusions). It seems difficult to pin down exactly why relatedness was protective against intrusions, but it is an intriguing result.</p><p>The biggest limitation in the paper is the amount of conceptual advance. As the authors note, Osgood's original ideas anticipated (most of) the key results in the current study-namely, the idea that facilitation and interference are a function of the similarity between original and new information. While the current paper provides a much more definitive investigation of this than is currently available in the literature, there have also been many papers since Osgood (nicely reviewed by the authors) that anticipate aspects of the current results. In particular, studies looking at integration or recursive reminders have clearly established that processes following initial encoding (of the base pairs) will impact the degree of interference and can even promote facilitation. In the current study, there is no direct evidence that integration or reminders occurred, but it is inferred that relatedness triggered reminders.</p><p>Taken together, the paper is likely to be of interest to those that study episodic memory in humans (and, in particular, those interested in memory interference). Given the influence of Osgood's original paper in the field of human learning and memory, this paper may also have substantial influence as a definitive test of Osgood's ideas. However, it is less clear whether the paper will have substantial influence outside this field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Dr. Kuhl for his kind words. We took note to try to clarify the advance in our revised version in response to this critique and the critiques offered by the other reviewers. Due to his and the other reviewers’ suggestions, we have also set up the alternative prediction of increased intrusions / confusability as a major alternative account in the Introduction and throughout the paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have addressed some of my comments, but not the others. In particular, they should have a more rigorous control of the effect of repetition time, and come up with a better theoretical framework.</p><p>Regarding comment #1, the authors did additional analyses to examine the effect of learning efficiency (as measured by the No. of repetitions) and memory. They found no significant linear correlations, and the relationship between semantic relatedness and RF/RI effect remained significant after controlling the learning efficiency.</p><p>According to the recursive reminder hypothesis the authors are trying to argue, each time new learning would reactivate the old association, which then affects the strength of old memory and its relationship with the new memory. The number of repetitions thus should have some effect, although it might not necessarily be in a linear fashion. We all know that repetitions do not linearly increase memory strength. Still, this effect should also be modulated by semantic relatedness, which determines the degree of reactivation of old memory. That said, I am not sure if there is a simple statistic method to control the effect of repetition time.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for questioning why we did not find a repetition effect. We agree in theory with the reviewer's logic that additional repetitions should retroactively benefit memory under a recursive reminder account, if participants thought back to an equal extent on each trial. However, we believe there are other possible factors at play that complicate the relationship.</p><p>First, successful reactivation might improve the likelihood of success on the current trial, leading that word pair to be repeated less in the future (given the adaptive design). Since greater relatedness leads pairs to be learned more efficiently, there may be approximate parity between a small number of highly effective recursive reminders (i.e. high relatedness pairs) and a greater number of less effective recursive reminders (i.e. low relatedness pairs) that required more repetitions. In other words, all pairs could eventually end up with an effectively similar number of recursive reminders over the course of the experiment.</p><p>Second, thinking back could cause momentary blocking of the current (secondary pair target) on some trials, perhaps making the subject think back to the prior phase less (or even mentally suppress the memory) on subsequent repetitions. There are likely differences in these factors across individuals and even across trials within the same individual.</p><p>This is a fascinating set of hypotheses, but we believe that resolving the dynamics of how and when subjects may think back, depending on current goals and current trial success requires a more targeted effort (e.g. explicitly manipulating the number of repetitions, as the reviewer suggests below) that falls beyond the scope of this paper. We believe our new analysis — a partial correlation that controls for learning efficiency —- is sufficient for the present claim: that the existence of retroactive memorability benefits does not necessarily rely on learning efficiency during secondary pair learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, this confounding factor should also be considered when examining the effect of semantic relatedness on memory interdependency. It should also be considered when comparing the restudy and test conditions, which I will describe below.</p></disp-quote><p>To account for possible confounds of learning efficiency in our interdependence analysis, we have now calculated (a) correlations between efficiency and interdependence and (b) partial correlations between semantic relatedness and interdependence while covarying out efficiency. These forms the new supplementary file 10.</p><p>Regarding (a), correlations between learning efficiency and interdependence were negative (just as the ones we previously observed between efficiency and semantic relatedness).</p><p>Regarding (b), the partial correlations between relatedness and interdependence survive in the ΔTarget condition and in the retrieval-to-criterion, wider stimulus set, 48-hr experiment in the ΔCue condition. In the case of the ΔBoth condition in the retrieval-to-criterion, narrow stimulus set, 48-hr experiment, the correlation was now only marginally significant. Our findings are largely robust to controlling for secondary pair learning efficiency, so it is unlikely that it can account for our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding comment #2, the authors acknowledged that the yoke between the repetition time between restudy and test was not perfect due to individual differences, but argued that this was sufficient to match the two conditions. To make this argument, I think the authors should show that the number of repetitions did not affect the overall results for both the test and restudy conditions. They have two choices to prove this. The first option is to randomly assign the number of repetitions to each pair and each subject, or use the group averaged repetitions for each pair (to account for the effect of semantic relatedness on subsequent learning) on every subject. The second option is to use a fixed number of repetitions for all subjects and pairs. I think the second option would be better, considering my comment #1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for encouraging us to think more critically about this point. We agree that collecting additional data using one of the suggested designs would provide the strongest evidence for this argument, but we are hesitant to collect more data to iron down this point, especially as the two groups, in keeping with our prior sample sizes, would require 400 subjects and an entire year of sampling our subject pool (since we do not have an Intro Psychology pool in the Spring term).</p><p>However, the reviewer’s point is well taken, and we now explicitly acknowledge this limitation. Specifically, we have changed the following passage on p. (28) from:</p><p>“Such differences cannot be addressed without an additional test assessment in the study-only experiment, but we believe that matching the objective amount of exposure serves as a sufficient control for our purposes.”</p><p>to:</p><p>“Such differences cannot be addressed without an additional test assessment in the study-only experiment. We believe that matching the objective amount of exposure was the best way to match restudy to retrieval-to-criterion learning conditions, but another study using a fixed number of repetitions for each pair in restudy and test conditions or a study which randomly assigns the number of repetitions across pairs in restudy and test conditions would address the role of individual differences more precisely.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding my comment #3, the authors strongly argued that memorability and interdependence should theoretically be dissociated, with which I agree entirely. Nevertheless, with higher memorability, the chance of both items being remembered was also higher.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and offer a more extensive argument in our revision. Our claim is that semantic relatedness drives both memorability and dependence, so we believe that the fact that memorability and dependence are both correlated with semantic relatedness is not an issue for the measurement. This relationship is expected if the memorability of the secondary pair (in addition to memorability of the base pair) is higher when relatedness is higher. Base pair memorability does not <italic>necessarily</italic> positively predict secondary pair memorability (and therefore also dependence); in fact, we have another dataset where subjects learn two rounds of unrelated word pairs which have no relationships between target words (i.e., a more classic A-B, A-D task). In this dataset, greater memorability in A-B pairs does not predict greater memorability for the A-D pairs and thereby does not predict greater dependence. (In fact, in that unpublished study, greater A-B memorability <italic>negatively</italic> predicts A-D memorability, in line with classic inhibitory effects like blocking, or a competitive process.)</p><p>In this unpublished study, we were more interested in the effects of temporal context and RI/RF. Subjects learned 44 unrelated word pairs (A-B) before learning 22 potentially interfering A-D pairs. (Note that in the terms of the present paper under revision, A-B pair learning = base pair learning and A-D pair learning = secondary pair learning in the ΔTarget learning). To reiterate, there was no semantic relationship between B and D words. A final test was administered 48 hours later for A-B and then A-D pairs. For this unpublished study, subjects were randomly assigned to have A-D learning occur either immediately after A-B learning (5 min), 3 hr after learning, halfway between learning and test (24 hours later), 3 hr before the test, or immediately before test (5 min). The critical finding for the present purposes is that, collapsing across all A-D learning time conditions, A-B memorability in this study was <italic>negatively</italic> (rather than positively) correlated with A-D memorability (<italic>r</italic> = -0.34, <italic>p</italic> = 0.025). One could presumably also create conditions in which the two measures are uncorrelated; the point here is that base pair-secondary pair positive dependence is not simply an artifact of base pair memorability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think a straightforward way to convince the readers is to calculate the correlation between memorability and interdependence and use memorability as a covariate while examining the result of interdependence.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding this point, we have calculated correlations between across-word pair memorability and dependence. Additionally, we believe that, in the last sentence, the reviewer meant to suggest that we calculate correlations between <italic>relatedness</italic> and dependence while partialling out base pair memorability, so we have also calculated that. (We do apologize if we misinterpreted this suggestion, and we would be happy to run a different calculation if we have done so!) We have also computed the converse correlations between relatedness and memorability while partialling out dependence. These correlations have been placed in the new Supplementary Files 7 and 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the Δboth condition, the authors found that Δcue and Δtarget relatedness have a different effect on interdependency and memorability. I agree with the authors that this result did complicate the result and the interpretation. Nevertheless, I think the result is interesting thus should be included and briefly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback. We have now added a short presentation of these relationships to the paper in the Results section (p. 14):</p><p>“We next explored whether cue or target relatedness differentially affected memorability and base pair-secondary pair dependence within the ΔBoth condition. We found that target relatedness correlated with ΔBoth memorability (<italic>r</italic> = 0.38, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), whereas cue relatedness did not (<italic>r</italic> = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> = 0.26). Furthermore, the target relatedness correlation survived significance when performing partial correlations controlling for cue relatedness (<italic>r</italic> = 0.39, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009). Conversely, we found that cue relatedness correlated with base pair-secondary pair dependence in the ΔBoth condition (<italic>r</italic> = 0.30, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04), whereas target relatedness did not (<italic>r</italic> = 0.12, <italic>p</italic> = 0.42), and the cue relatedness correlation survived significance when performing partial correlations controlling for target relatedness (<italic>r</italic> = 0.31, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). Therefore, although our primary analyses in the ΔBoth condition focused on the bivariate effects of cue and target relatedness, the two measures have dissociable impacts on memorability and dependence.”</p><p>We also briefly mention these effects in the Discussion (p. 22):</p><p>“We do note that, in the narrower stimulus set, 48-hr delay experiment, cue and target relatedness had somewhat dissociable effects in the ΔBoth condition, such that target relatedness predicted memorability while cue relatedness predicted dependence. We find these results intriguing and worthy of further investigation in future work.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My last comment concerns the theoretical framework, which the first reviewer has also raised. In this revision, the authors briefly mentioned the recursive reminder hypothesis in the introduction but did not describe the hypothesis or the predictions. This introduces extra confusion about the relationship between the recursive reminder hypothesis and Osgood's predictions. What are the mechanisms underlying Osgood's predictions? Would the recursive reminder hypothesis support Osgood's predictions?</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent questions. First, Osgood’s paper mostly characterized the budding literature (before 1949) and offered no mechanisms by which these effects would arise. This is perhaps surprising, but also perhaps not, as it was published during the behaviorist period before the “cognitive revolution”. (Indeed, even word pair associations were referred to as “stimulus” and “response” in the paper.) Therefore, there were no original mechanisms proposed for <italic>how</italic> these effects would arise, but we do indeed believe the recursive reminders could be the mechanism underlying the effects outlined in Osgood’s proposal. We have modified the introduction in the following way (p. 5):</p><p>“Note that if increasing relatedness among word pairs along one or more dimensions increased RI, it would run contrary to Osgood’s predictions. Conversely, if increasing relatedness increased RF, it would support his predictions. Such results would also support recursive reminder theory (27), which we believe offers a mechanistic explanation of Osgood’s proposed surface because it predicts that retroactive benefits increase as reminders become more likely (such as with greater semantic relatedness). A further prediction of this theory is that relatedness would promote interdependence between associated memory traces.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, both the recursive reminder hypothesis and Osgood's predictions deal with semantic relatedness. It is thus surprising that at the end of the Introduction, they were to examine several effects, such as the broad and narrow semantic association, the delay effect, the testing effect, and the effect of semantic relatedness on memory interdependency. Would the inclusion of these conditions help to falsify the hypothesis or predictions? The authors examined the semantic relatedness in different conditions separately but did not directly compare these conditions. They argued that this was because they were from different experiments. I am not sure if this argument is valid.</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct to note that manipulating the other parameters (delays, restudy vs. test, semantic associations) was not done to directly test the recursive reminders hypothesis. Rather, it was important for characterizing retroactive effects in the context of other known memory findings. That is, we manipulated delay because of its known importance for determining RF/RI (e.g., Chan, 2009); we manipulated restudy vs testing because of its prominence as a memory effect and the interesting interactions that semantics play in [such as the role of semantic mediators (e.g., Carpenter &amp; Yeung, 2017)]; and we manipulated semantic associations to show that our initial effects using the narrower stimulus set were not solely due to high semantic relatedness in general.</p><p>It seemed very plausible that manipulating these factors would affect the shape of the surface (and indeed they did!). However, we believe the reviewer is pointing out that we did not directly manipulate recursive reminders, such as by altering instructions to think back in certain conditions like in Jacoby et al. (2015), and we agree. We have clarified this limitation and characterized it as a future direction in the Discussion (p. 25):</p><p>“Another limitation to our interpreting these results within a recursive reminders framework is that we did not directly manipulate instructions [e.g., (27)] or collect in-the-moment responses regarding whether subjects engaged in recursive reminders [e.g., (81)]. Such manipulations constitute important future directions.”</p><p>Regarding the last point, we avoided directly comparing results across experiments because we did not conduct random assignments to the different experiments. For example, we collected all 200 subjects for the retrieval-to-criterion, 48-hr, broad semantic association experiment before moving to the retrieval-to-criterion, 48-hr, narrow semantic association experiment. As a result, although we used the same subject population, we wanted to take a conservative approach to the statistics, just as experimenters often do when they discuss Experiment 1, Experiment 2, etc. without directly comparing their results via inferential statistics. However, we do note important qualitative differences in the results from the various experiments throughout the paper. We have clarified this point where we mention avoiding direct comparisons across experiments in the Discussion (p. 21):</p><p>“Although we have largely avoided comparing 5-min and 48-hr delay results directly because they were part of different experiments (and therefore subjects were not randomly assigned to different delays), it appears that conditions in which we expect recursive reminders tend to slow the rate of forgetting (relative to the amount of forgetting in the control condition).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors introduce the testing effect to explain the delay effect and the difference between restudy and testing conditions. The testing effect, in my view, is mainly an observation, not an interpretation. Many possible mechanisms have been proposed and they are still under debate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree there are many possible mechanisms for the testing effect. One of the most general observations is that testing benefits long-term memory relative to restudying, so we do think it is a relevant effect to discuss. We have changed the text to reflect the reviewer’s point about it being more of an observation and to reflect more openness to the testing effect debate (p. 21):</p><p>“These results mirror other phenomena that differentially affect short-term and long-term memory performance, such as the benefits of testing (characterized as the testing effect) (72, 103).”</p><p>and</p><p>“This pattern suggests recursive reminders act as effective retrieval processes, similar to findings on the testing effect (20). “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>That said, I should note that this study examined a broad range of essential issues in RF and RI effects, and it is thus a challenge to come up with a simple theoretic framework to cover all of them. Meanwhile, I still think this study has provided critical empirical data for understanding the RF/RI effect. It is also laudable that they make the data open so that other researchers interested in this question could further examine it.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these acknowledgements and for their excellent questions and critiques. Their efforts have substantially improved the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
