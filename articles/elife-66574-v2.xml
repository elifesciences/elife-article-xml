Previously, we showed that apically directed cortical movements that polarize the Par complex require F-actin (Oon and Prehoda, 2019). Here, we report the discovery of cortical actomyosin dynamics that begin in interphase when the Par complex is cytoplasmic but ultimately become tightly coupled to cortical Par dynamics. Interphase cortical actomyosin dynamics are unoriented and pulsatile but rapidly become sustained and apically-directed in early mitosis when the Par protein aPKC accumulates on the cortex. Apical actomyosin flows drive the coalescence of aPKC into an apical cap that depolarizes in anaphase when the flow reverses direction. Together with the previously characterized role of anaphase flows in specifying daughter cell size asymmetry, our results indicate that multiple phases of cortical actomyosin dynamics regulate asymmetric cell division.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>actomyosin</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM127092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prehoda</surname><given-names>Kenneth E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oon and Prehoda discover cortical actomyosin dynamics that polarize asymmetrically dividing neural stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Par complex polarizes animal cells by excluding specific factors from the Par cortical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lang and Munro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Venkei and Yamashita, 2018</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, for example, the Par domain forms at the apical cortex during mitosis where it prevents the accumulation of neuronal fate determinants, effectively restricting them to the basal cortex. The resulting cortical domains are bisected by the cleavage furrow leading to fate determinant segregation into the basal daughter cell where they promote differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>). It was recently discovered that apical Par polarization in the neuroblast is a multistep process in which the complex is initially targeted to the apical hemisphere early in mitosis where it forms a discontinuous meshwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kono et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oon and Prehoda, 2019</xref>). Cortical Par proteins then move along the cortex toward the apical pole, ultimately leading to formation of an apical cap that is maintained until shortly after anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oon and Prehoda, 2019</xref>). Here, we examine how the cortical movements that initiate and potentially maintain neuroblast Par polarity are generated.</p><p>An intact actin cytoskeleton is required for the movements that polarize Par proteins to the neuroblast apical cortex, but its role in the polarization process has been unclear.

How the actin cytoskeleton participates in polarizing the Par complex in neuroblasts has been unclear, but actomyosin plays a central role in generating the anterior Par cortical domain in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote. Contractions oriented toward the anterior pole transport the Par complex from an evenly distributed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Illukkumbura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lang and Munro, 2017</xref>). Bulk transport is mediated by advective flows generated by highly dynamic, transient actomyosin accumulations on the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goehring et al., 2011</xref>). While cortical movements of actomyosin drive formation of the Par domain in the worm zygote and F-actin is required for neuroblast apical Par polarity, no apically directed cortical actomyosin dynamics have been observed during the neuroblast polarization process, despite extensive examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barros et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabernard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Connell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Koe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Roth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Roubinet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tsankova et al., 2017</xref>).

Pulsatile movements consisted of irregular patches of actin forming on the cortex and rapidly moving across the surface before disappearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>). Concentrated actin patches were relatively static, but sometimes changed size over the course of several minutes. Static patches were mostly unaffected by the pulsatile waves that occasionally passed over them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Pulses were sporadic in early interphase but became more regular near mitosis, with a new pulse appearing immediately following the completion of the prior one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The direction of the pulses during interphase was highly variable, but often along the cell’s equator (i.e. orthogonal to the polarity/division axis). In general, actin in the interphase cortex was highly discontinuous and included large areas with little to no detectable actin in addition to the patches and dynamic pulses described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Interphase pulses were correlated with cellular scale morphological deformations in which these areas of low actin signal were displaced away from the cell center while the cortex containing the actin pulse was compressed toward the center of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><p>Near nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB), the static cortical actin patches began disappearing from the cortex while dynamic cortical actin reoriented toward the apical pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In contrast to the sporadic and relatively unoriented interphase pulses observed earlier in the cell cycle, the apically directed cortical actin dynamics that began near NEB were highly regular and were apically-directed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This phase of cortical actin dynamics continued until anaphase–consistent with previous descriptions of actin accumulation at the apical cortex throughout metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barros et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tsankova et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, while the interphase cortex had areas with very little actin, actin was more evenly-distributed following the transition, as was apparent in medial sections (e.g. comparing –15:00 and 3:00 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><p>Another transition in cortical actin dynamics occurred shortly after anaphase onset when the apically directed cortical actin movements rapidly reversed direction such that the F-actin that had accumulated in the apical hemisphere began to move basally toward the emerging cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The basally directed phase of movement that begins shortly after anaphase onset and includes both actin and myosin II was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barros et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Roubinet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tsankova et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cortical actin and aPKC dynamics are coupled</title><p>Previously, we showed that Par polarity proteins undergo complex cortical dynamics during neuroblast asymmetric cell division and that polarity cycle movements require an intact actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oon and Prehoda, 2019</xref>).

Furthermore, the transitions in cortical actin dynamic phases appeared to occur when similar transitions take place in the polarity cycle. We examined the extent to which cortical actin and aPKC dynamics are correlated by simultaneously imaging GFP-aPKC expressed from its endogenous promoter with mRuby-Lifeact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Apical targeting of aPKC began approximately ten minutes before NEB, when small, discontinuous aPKC foci began to appear, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oon and Prehoda, 2019</xref>). The interphase pulses of actin had no noticeable effect on these aPKC enrichments, suggesting that at this stage of the cell cycle, cortical actin dynamics are not coupled to aPKC movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Coordinated actin and aPKC dynamics during the neuroblast polarity cycle.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66574-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><media id="fig2video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-66574-fig2-video1.mp4"><label>Figure 2—video 1.</label><caption><title>Videos used to calculate when apically directed aPKC and actin movements begin.</title><p>aPKC-GFP expressed from its endogenous promoter (left panel) and mRuby-LifeAct expressed via insc-GAL4/UAS (middle panel) and merge (right panel with aPKC green and LifeAct magenta) are shown via a maximum intensity projection (MIP) constructed from optical sections through the front hemisphere of the cell.

When cortical actin began flowing apically, the sparsely distributed aPKC patches that had accumulated on the cortex also began moving toward the apical pole. The transition to apically directed movement was nearly simultaneous for both proteins, although actin’s apical movement began slightly before aPKC’s (actin: 1.9 ± 1.0 min prior to NEB; aPKC: 1.3 ± 1.1 min; n = 13 neuroblasts with movies in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Furthermore, while aPKC and actin both moved toward the apical cortex, actin dynamics occurred over the entire cortex whereas aPKC movements were limited to the apical hemisphere consistent with its specific targeting to this area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The continuous apical movements resulted in the concentration of both aPKC and actin at the apical pole. Interestingly, however, once aPKC was collected near the pole into an apical cap, it appeared to be static while cortical actin continued flowing apically. This phase of dynamic, apically directed actin with an apparently static aPKC apical cap continued for several minutes (e.g. until approximately 7:10 in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). At this point actin and aPKC movements reversed, moving simultaneously toward the basal pole and the emerging cleavage furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). We conclude that cortical actin and aPKC dynamics become highly correlated after interphase actin pulses transition to sustained, apically directed movements.</p><p>The correlation between actin and aPKC dynamics is consistent with our previous finding that depolymerization of actin with LatrunculinA (LatA) inhibits aPKC’s apically directed cortical movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oon and Prehoda, 2019</xref>). We further examined the relationship between F-actin dynamics and aPKC using low doses of Cytochalasin D (CytoD) that inhibit actin dynamics but maintain cortical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mason et al., 2013</xref>). The apically directed movements of actin during early mitosis were inhibited by CytoD with the cortex rapidly becoming relatively static (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and A’</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). The loss of actin dynamics was immediately followed by cessation of apically directed aPKC movement such that it failed to form an apical cap (n = 11; neuroblasts shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). While both LatA and CytoD inhibited aPKC coalescence into an apical cap, we noticed that aPKC was maintained in the apical hemisphere for a longer period in CytoD-treated neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">Figure 3—video 4</xref>, and neuroblasts used for measurements in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video5">Figure 3—video 5</xref>). Some localized enrichments remained in the apical hemisphere in neuroblasts treated with either drug, possibly due to their association with localized membrane enrichments, as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">LaFoya and Prehoda, 2021</xref>). However, aPKC signal entered the basal hemisphere more rapidly in LatA- versus CytoD-treated neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, aPKC appears to be better maintained in its polarized state when the cortical actin cytoskeleton remains intact (CytoD) compared to when it is completely depolymerized (LatA). We conclude that the cortical dynamics that drive the formation of the aPKC apical cap require the apically directed phase of actin dynamics that occurs during late prophase and metaphase. Furthermore, cortical actin structure may prolong the aPKC polarized state by slowing its diffusion into the basal hemisphere.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cortical F-actin is required for aPKC coalescence and polarity maintenance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Disruption of cortical F-actin dynamics using a low dosage (50 µM) of cytochalasin D (CytoD) causes immediate cessation of aPKC cortical movement.

While actin can generate force directly through polymerization, contractile forces are generated by the combined activity of F-actin and myosin II (i.e. actomyosin), and cortical pulsatile contractions of actomyosin have been observed in many other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Vicker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Munro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Michaux et al., 2018</xref>).

We used rapid imaging of the full cell volume, simultaneously following a GFP fusion of the myosin II regulatory light chain Spaghetti squash (GFP-Sqh) with mRuby-Lifeact, to determine if myosin II dynamics share any of the cortical dynamic phases we observed for actin. For each phase of actin dynamics, we found that myosin II is localized to the cortex in a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>), including during the apically directed continuous movements that polarize aPKC. Interestingly, however, the localization between the two was not absolute and there were often large cortical regions where the two did not colocalize in addition to the region where they overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

During interphase, transient cortical patches of actomyosin undergo highly dynamic movements in which they rapidly traverse the cell cortex, predominantly along the cell’s equator, before dissipating and beginning a new cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Shortly after mitotic entry the movements become more continuous and aligned with the polarity axis (orthogonal to the equatorial interphase pulses). The transition to apically directed cortical actin movements occurs shortly before the establishment of apical Par polarity, when discrete cortical patches of aPKC undergo coordinated movements toward the apical pole to form an apical cap. Importantly, cortical actin dynamics are required for aPKC to coalesce into an apical cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). Apically directed actin dynamics continue beyond metaphase when apical aPKC cap assembly is completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that actomyosin dynamics may also be involved in cap maintenance. A role for actomyosin in aPKC cap assembly and maintenance is supported by the lack of coalescence when the actin cytoskeleton is completely depolymerized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oon and Prehoda, 2019</xref>), or when actin dynamics are inhibited but the cytoskeleton is left intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and B’</xref>). The cycle of cortical actomyosin dynamics is completed when the movement abruptly changes direction at anaphase leading to the cleavage furrow-directed flows that have been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barros et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Roubinet et al., 2017</xref>). While we have examined the relationship between actomyosin dynamics and cortical protein polarity, we note that a neuroblast membrane polarity cycle was recently discovered and found to require the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">LaFoya and Prehoda, 2021</xref>). The mechanical phases of the membrane polarity cycle may be related to the phases of cortical actomyosin dynamics we report here.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model for role of actomyosin in neuroblast Par polarity.</title><p>During interphase when aPKC is cytoplasmic, actomyosin pulsatile contractions are predominantly equatorial. During apical polarity initiation in prophase and shortly before when discrete aPKC cortical patches begin to coalesce, actomyosin transitions to more continuous movements directed toward the apical cortex. At anaphase apical actomyosin is cleared as it flows toward the cleavage furrow while the aPKC cap is disassembled.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66574-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>While cortical actomyosin dynamics had not been reported during neuroblast polarization, myosin II pulses have been observed in delaminating neuroblasts from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Simões et al., 2017</xref>). The actomyosin dynamics reported here may be related to those that occur during delamination and provide a framework for understanding how actomyosin participates in neuroblast apical polarity. First, apically directed movements of actomyosin are consistent with the requirement for F-actin in the coalescence of discrete aPKC patches into an apical cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oon and Prehoda, 2019</xref>). How might cortical actomyosin dynamics induce aPKC coalescence and maintenance? In the worm zygote, pulsatile contractions generate bulk cortical flows (i.e. advection) that lead to non-specific transport of cortically localized components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goehring et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Illukkumbura et al., 2020</xref>). Whether the cortical motions of polarity proteins that occur during the neuroblast polarity cycle are also driven by advection will require further study.</p><p>The more rapid depolarization of aPKC in Lat- compared to CytoD-treated neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>), is also consistent with a potentially passive role for the actin cytoskeleton in polarity maintenance. Complete loss of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (LatA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) leads to more rapid entry of aPKC into the basal neuroblast membrane compared to when cortical actin dynamics is inhibited but the structure maintained (CytoD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The difference could arise simply from an increase in cortical diffusion constant when the cortical actin mesh is removed. In this case, the actin cytoskeleton would participate in Par polarity via at least two mechanisms: by generating non-diffusive movements of polarity proteins through actomyosin-generated cortical flows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), and by maintaining the polarized state by slowing the rate of diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lifeact-Ruby</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC:35545; FLYB:FBti0143328; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC_35545">BDSC_35545</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase symbol: P{UAS-Lifeact-Ruby}VIE-19A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">insc-Gal4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chris Doe Lab; Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC:8751; FLYB:FBti0148948; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC_8751">BDSC_8751</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase symbol: P{GawB}insc<sup>Mz1407</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">aPKC-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">François Schweisguth Lab; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besson et al., 2015</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BAC encoded aPKC-GFP</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">wor-Gal4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chris Doe Lab; Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC:56553; FLYB:FBti0161165; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC_56553">BDSC_56553</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase symbol: P{wor.GAL4.A}2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sqh-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Royou et al., 2002</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expressed by natural <italic>sqh</italic> promoter</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Latrunculin A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich: L5163</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(50 µM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cytochalasin D</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Enzo Life Sciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Enzo Life Sciences: BML-T109-0001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(50 µM)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fly strains and genetics</title><p>UAS-Lifeact-Ruby (Bloomington stock 35545), BAC-encoded aPKC-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besson et al., 2015</xref>) and Sqh-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Royou et al., 2002</xref>) transgenes were used to assess F-actin, aPKC and myosin II dynamics, respectively.

To quantify transitions between cortical actin dynamic phases, we identified the frame when actin or aPKC began moving toward the apical pole persistently (for at least several minutes, unlike the interphase, pulsatile motions). Likewise, the start of basally directed actin flow was indicated by the initial frame when apical actin or aPKC moved persistently toward the basal hemisphere. To investigate the effects of LatA and CytoD on neuroblast cortical dynamics, we examined aPKC and actin signals in early prophase to first determine if actin dynamics had ceased (i.e. the drug had taken effect), which typically occurred within five minutes of treatment for both drugs. To measure the degree to which aPKC polarity was maintained, we quantified the basal intensity of aPKC (via a 3-µm-thick line scan) across the basal membrane of a single medial section at NEB and at 7.5 min after NEB.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Yukiko M Yamashita as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Although <italic>eLife</italic> encourages recent updates to previous work, our reviewers did not feel that the additional data constitutes the essential increment to justify publication.</p><p>This manuscript by Oon and Prehoda follows up on their previous work on how <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts may be polarized in preparation of asymmetric cell division. Now, by analyzing a probe for myosin, they show that neuroblasts undergo pulsatile contraction to achieve cell polarization. Although the reviewers appreciated the progress, they also felt that the study would require more in-depth analysis to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Even for Research Advance format, of which contribution is expected to build upon a previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper, the reviewers felt that need of deeper, mechanistic analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Oon and Prehoda follows up on their previous work on how <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts may be polarized in preparation of asymmetric cell division. Now, by improving their live imaging conditions, they show that neuroblasts undergo pulsatile contraction to achieve cell polarization. This is reminiscent of <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygotes, unifying the known requirement of the same/similar set of genes between these two systems and the cell biological processes. Overall, this is a well-conceived, and well-executed work providing important insights into how Par system regulates cell polarity through the regulation of Myosin-dependent contractile system.</p><p>Their description about Myosin II's dynamic localization/ pulsatile movement is convincing. Unfortunately, due to photosensitivity, the were not able to image aPKC. I understand that this is a technical limitation difficult to overcome but drawing a conclusion about a relationship between Myosin II and aPKC purely based on previous studies, which had missed interesting aspects of Myosin movement, seems to be go beyond what can/should be extrapolated.

This seems to suggest that LatA treatment delays the depolarization of aPKC, which contradicts the conclusion that &quot;aPKC is recruited to the apical cortex but rapidly depolarizes (Figure 3A and A')&quot;. Similarly, aPKC patch was still seen at 15:00 (Figure 3C), whereas apical aPKC should be completely gone in wild type condition at this time point (Figure 1). Also, in line 134-136, &quot;we see aPKC begins diffusing away from the apical immediately following the disappearance of the cortical actin signal (Figure 3C,C' and Figure 3-video 3)&quot; is an overstatement.

This explains how/why actin filament was required to localize/polarize Par complex. Specifically, using spinning disc confocal microscopy with high temporal resolution, they found the directed actin movement toward the apical pole, which nicely correlates with concentration of aPKC. They also show that myosin II is involved in this pulsatile movement of actin filament. This very much resembles the observation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, and nicely unifies observations across systems. Although descriptive in nature, I think this is an important observation and indicates a universal mechanism by which cells are polarized. I think this is a well-executed study and warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as research advance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Previously, Oon and Prehoda showed apically directed movement of aPKC clusters during polarization of the neuroblast prior to asymmetric cell division. They found that these movements required F-actin, but the distribution of F-actin has only been reported for later stages of neuroblast polarization and division. Here, the authors report pulses of cortical F-actin during interphase, followed by an apically directed flow at the onset of mitosis, a strong apical accumulation of F-actin at metaphase and anaphase, followed by fragmentation and basally directed flow of the fragments. aPKC clusters are shown to colocalize with the F-actin networks as they flow apically. The F-actin networks are also shown have partial colocalization with non-muscle myosin II, suggesting a possible mechanism for their movement. Finally, the authors solidify the results of actin inhibitor studies from their 2019 study by showing that reported effects on aPKC localization are preceded by F-actin loss as would be expected but was not previously shown. Overall, the Research Advance extends the past study by more directly showing the involvement of F-actin and myosin in the apical localization mechanism of aPKC, and by describing F-actin and myosin dynamics prior to this transition. The following concerns should be addressed.</p><p>1. The pulsatile nature of broad F-actin networks is evident during interphase, but these pulsations substantially subside upon entry into mitosis, and at this stage an apically directed flow of F-actin is the main behavior evident. This transition from pulses to flow is evident in both the movies and the kymographs of the F-actin probe. However, the authors state that the pulsations continue at the onset of mitosis and as the apical cap of aPKC matures. It is unclear whether the apical flow of aPKC and F-actin is associated with small-scale defined F-actin pulses, or small-scale random fluctuations of F-actin. The F-actin flow alone is an informative finding. The authors should consider revising their descriptions of these data (including in the manuscript title), or provide clearer examples of defined F-actin pulsations during the stage when aPKC polarizes.</p><p>2. I checked the main text, methods, figures and figure legends, but could not find listings of sample sizes. Thus, the reproducibility of the findings has not been reported.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this revised manuscript (Oon and Prehoda), the authors performed additional live-imaging experiments and recorded aPKC and actin dynamics simultaneously in larval neuroblasts. They also provide evidence that aPKC polarization is lost upon F-actin disruption by Latrunculin A treatment. These are great improvements. The pulsatile dynamics of actin and myosin II showed in the manuscript are compelling. Images presented in this manuscript are of high-quality and impressive.</p><p>However, the pulsatile apical myosin network in delaminating neuroblasts in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos was reported previously (An Y. et al., Development, 2017). This important and relevant paper should be cited in the introduction of the current manuscript. Therefore, the finding on the pulsatile actomyosin in larval brain neuroblasts reported in this manuscript is not a total novel discovery. Another major concern is that Lat-A did not specifically disrupt actomyosin pulsatile movements, as it generally disrupts the F-actin network. So these experiments only strengthened the link between the F-actin network and Par polarity (which was already demonstrated in Kono et al., 2019; Oon 22 and Prehoda, 2019). Low doses of Cytochalasin D are known to disrupt myosin pulses still allowing the assembly of the actomyosin network (Mason et al., Nature Cell Biology 2014). The author should treat neuroblasts with low doses of CytoD to only disrupt actomyosin pulses, not the entire F-actin network, and examine the effect on Par polarity. It is also worthwhile to knockdown sqh to disrupt apical pulsatile actin dynamics. Besides, most of the concerns previously raised by the reviewer were not addressed in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66574.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

First, a focus on actin is most relevant to our original paper (which this Research Advance builds on) as that paper showed that the actin cytoskeleton is required for aPKC dynamics. Second, using the Lifeact actin sensor allowed us to obtain simultaneous imaging for aPKC and the actin cytoskeleton (Video 2) which shows the highly correlated dynamics of the two. Thus, the mechanistic connection to the first paper is very clear – the actin cytoskeleton is required for aPKC dynamics (both our original paper and the current Research Advance), and actin and Par dynamics are highly correlated (the current Research Advance).

As the authors of the original paper, we were certainly surprised when we first observed pulsatile contractions of actomyosin in neuroblasts. For one thing, there are numerous reports of actin and myosin II dynamics in neuroblasts dating back to 2003 without any mention of these dynamics. Additionally, a very recent model for actomyosin’s role in neuroblast polarity (Hannaford et al. 2018 <italic>eLife)</italic> posits that it forms a static scaffold at the <italic>basal</italic> cortex.

While we do describe a previously unreported phenomenon, we disagree that this detracts from the impact of our work. This description provides mechanistic insight into the polarization process – we knew previously that the actin cytoskeleton was required but had no idea why. The current work fills this mechanistic gap. Since there is little to no explanation in the neuroblast literature for how the actin cytoskeleton contributes to apical polarity, we respectfully disagree that our results are confirmatory.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>– The pulsatile nature of broad F-actin networks is evident during interphase, but these pulsations substantially subside upon entry into mitosis, and at this stage an apically directed flow of F-actin is the main behavior evident.

We determined the concentration of cytochalasin D that inhibited F-actin dynamics but did not ablate cortical F-actin (unlike our latrunculin A experiments in which cortical F-actin signal was undetectable following treatment). In neuroblasts treated with this concentration of the drug (50 µM CytoD), apically directed cortical flows of aPKC did not occur. In contrast to LatA treated neuroblasts, however, in which asymmetrically targeted aPKC rapidly depolarized (i.e. was not maintained), aPKC in cytoD-treated neuroblasts did not enter the basal hemisphere as rapidly (Figure 3D). These results support a model in which F-actin plays two roles in neuroblast polarization – an active role where actin dynamics are essential for apically directed cortical flows, and a more passive one in which the presence of cortical F-actin prevents depolarization (perhaps by slowing the rate of cortical diffusion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There are two papers that described pulsatile behavior during apical constriction in the process of neuroblast delamination in embryonic development.
