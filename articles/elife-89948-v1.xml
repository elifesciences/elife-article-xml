In amniote gastrulation, particularly in avian gastrula, a bilateral vortex-like counter-rotating cell flow, called ‘polonaise movements’, appears along the midline. Here, through experimental manipulations, we addressed relationships between the polonaise movements and morphogenesis of the primitive streak, the earliest midline structure in amniotes. Suppression of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway maintains the polonaise movements along a deformed primitive streak. Mitotic arrest leads to diminished extension and development of the primitive streak and maintains the early phase of the polonaise movements. Ectopically induced Vg1, an axis-inducing morphogen, generates the polonaise movements, aligned to the induced midline, but disturbs the stereotypical cell flow pattern at the authentic midline. Despite the altered cell flow, induction and extension of the primitive streak are preserved along both authentic and induced midlines. Finally, we show that ectopic axis-inducing morphogen, Vg1, is capable of initiating the polonaise movements without concomitant PS extension under mitotic arrest conditions. These results are consistent with a model wherein primitive streak morphogenesis is required for the maintenance of the polonaise movements, but the polonaise movements are not necessarily responsible for primitive streak morphogenesis. Our data describe a previously undefined relationship between the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis in gastrulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group

During this period, animals with bilateral symmetry, called bilaterians, initiate development of three germ layers (i.e. the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) and midline structures (e.g. the notochord and primitive streak) along the midline axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solnica-Krezel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller and Davidson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mikawa et al., 2004</xref>). The large-scale cell flow has been linked to early embryonic morphogenesis, including axial structures, through rearrangement of cells and/or transportation of signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Solnica-Krezel and Sepich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leptin, 2005</xref>). Coupling of the large-scale cell flow and body axis morphogenesis has been extensively studied in invertebrate bilaterians, particularly insect models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gehrels et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertet et al., 2004</xref>). However, in vertebrates, our understanding of whether and how the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis are coupled is limited.</p><p>Vertebrates are classified into two groups: non-amniotes (e.g. fish and amphibians) and amniotes (e.g. birds and mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilbert and Barresi, 2017</xref>). In non-amniotes, particularly amphibians, the large-scale cell flow is coupled with formation of the notochord through Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway-regulated convergent extension, which does not depend on mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tada et al., 2002</xref>). In amniotes, particularly in avian gastrula (i.e. embryonic disc), a bilateral vortex-like counter-rotating cell flow, termed ‘polonaise movements’, occurs within the epiblast along the midline axis, prior to and during primitive streak (PS) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wetzel, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gräper, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stern, 2004</xref>). The PS is an evolutionarily unique embryonic structure in amniotes, which is not only an organizing center for gastrulation but also the earliest midline structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoenwolf, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Raffaelli and Stern, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheng et al., 2021</xref>). During amniote gastrulation, widespread mitosis has been identified throughout the embryo, including the PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanders et al., 1993</xref>), and previous studies showed that mitotic arrest leads to morphologically diminishing PS extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saadaoui et al., 2020</xref>). Further, the Wnt/PCP pathway also plays an important role for proper PS extension and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>). Since the chick embryo is readily accessible and closely represents the human gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O’Rahilly and Müller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asai et al., 2021</xref>), much of what is known about the cell flow and PS development has come from studies using this model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stern, 2004</xref>). The PS is first visible as a cell cluster at the posterior embryonic disc at the initial streak stage [HH2; staging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992</xref>)] formed through the influence of several axis inducing factors [e.g. Vg1 and Chordin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seleiro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Streit et al., 1998</xref>)]; it then extends anteriorly along the midline axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stern, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schoenwolf, 2000</xref>). During PS development, displacement of cells and/or tissue tension potentially generates biomechanical forces, which lead to cell flows and/or PS morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saadaoui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rozbicki et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies discuss that cell intercalation and ingression underlying PS formation, leading to the polonaise movements through altering the neighbor tissue tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rozbicki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Voiculescu et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that the polonaise movements are likely a consequence of PS morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Raffaelli and Stern, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voiculescu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang and White, 2021</xref>). Other studies demonstrate that the polonaise movements, generated by the myosin-cable-mediated tissue tension with cell intercalation and ingression, lead to PS morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saadaoui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang and White, 2021</xref>). Thus, the relationship between the polonaise movements and PS morphogenesis remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang and White, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we characterize previously undefined relationships between the polonaise movements and PS morphogenesis. Suppression of the Wnt/PCP pathway generates a wider and shorter PS while maintaining the polonaise movements. Mitotic arrest diminishes PS extension and maintains the early phase of the polonaise movements. Moreover, experimentally manipulating the large-scale cell flow by inducing a secondary midline axis indicates that the authentic PS forms despite altered cell flows. Ultimately, a single axis-inducing morphogen, Vg1, is capable of initiating the polonaise movements despite defective PS morphogenesis. These results suggest that PS morphogenesis is not responsible for the initiation and early phase of the polonaise movements. Further, the polonaise movements are not necessarily responsible for PS morphogenesis. This study suggests that amniote gastrulation may be evolutionarily distinct from non-amniote gastrulation in the mechanisms coupling large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Suppression of the Wnt/PCP pathway maintains the bilateral vortex-like counter-rotating cell flow along a deformed PS</title><p>Throughout this work, the cell flows were recorded by tagging individual epiblast cells with electroporated fluorescent tracers at the pre-streak stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eyal-Giladi and Kochav, 1976</xref>).

To reconstruct trajectories of the tagged cells and quantitatively analyze the cell flow pattern, the recorded images were processed using tracking analysis tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilpin et al., 2017</xref>), Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thielicke and Stamhuis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stamhuis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Raffel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batchelor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aris, 2012</xref>), and subsequent visualization techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenshields and Christopher, 2022</xref>).</p><p>To address the relationship between the polonaise movements and PS morphogenesis, we experimentally manipulated the shape of the PS while maintaining the population of PS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The DEP domain of Dishevelled (Dsh; a transducer protein of Wnt signaling) is responsible for the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rothbächer et al., 2000</xref>), and misexpression of dominant-negative Dsh lacking DEP [dnDsh(ΔDEP)] leads to deformation of the midline structures, including the PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>). Further, the Wnt/PCP pathway is involved in cellular polarity and migration, while the canonical Wnt pathway regulates cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>). We refer the dnDsh(ΔDEP)-GFP construct that we generated, as ΔDEP-GFP, and tested its ability to alter cellular polarity, resulting in PS deformation’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). In the control-GFP-introduced PS and epiblast cells, Pk1 (a PCP core component) exhibited a polarized localization at the E-cadherin-based adherens junctions, particularly cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, n=3). In contrast, this Pk1-localization pattern was not identified in the ΔDEP-GFP-misexpressing PS and epiblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>, n=3), implying that the construct efficiently disrupted the cellular polarity within the misexpressing cells. The expression of <italic>Brachyury</italic> indicated that ΔDEP-GFP-PS cells maintained their identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) but displayed a shorter and wider morphogenesis than the control PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, n≥4 for each). The number of PS cells was not significantly different from the control- and ΔDEP-GFP-PS (control 8.5±0.4 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells vs ΔDEP 8.8±1.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells, p=0.68, n=3 for each, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results indicated that ΔDEP-misexpression was capable of suppressing the Wnt/PCP pathway through disrupting the localization pattern of the PCP core component while maintaining the number of the PS cells. Having confirmed the function of the ΔDEP-GFP construct, we applied it as a molecular tool for manipulating the shape of the PS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>‘Polonaise movements’ persist under suppression of Wnt/PCP pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Testing model of relationships between the polonaise movements, primitive streak (PS) morphogenesis, and the Wnt/PCP pathway.

If the bilateral rotating cell flow is required for PS formation, both the authentic and induced PSs should each be accompanied by polonaise movements during the extension.

Conversely, the experimental manipulation of the cell flow demonstrated that the authentic PS extends regardless of aberrant flow patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

In this study, our live-imaging system combined with the quantitative analyses, molecular tools for manipulating PS formation, and the gene expression analyses allowed us to clarify the relationships among PS morphogenesis, the polonaise movements, mitosis, and the Wnt/PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>). Our data demonstrated that the shape of the PS as a midline structure is not necessarily responsible for initiation of the polonaise movements while the population of the PS cells, expanded by mitosis, is required for sustained polonaise movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Mesendoderm specification is required for large-scale cell flows associated with later stage ingression and intercalation at the PS during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serrano Nájera and Weijer, 2023</xref>). Here, we have described the distinctive set of cell flows that precede gastrulation in the chick embryo, and the relationship between early and late cell flow has yet to be examined.</p><p>The Wnt/PCP pathway has been assumed to be coupled with the polonaise movements, as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roszko et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, another study showed that misexpression of dnWnt11 or dnDsh-ΔPDZ [suppressing both the Wnt canonical and non-canonical pathway, including the Wnt/PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>)] maintained the bilateral counter-rotating cell flow along a defective PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chuai et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the role of the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway for the polonaise movements has remained unresolved. In this study, our loss-of-function technique, introducing ΔDEP to PS cells, demonstrated that the polonaise movements were preserved along the deformed PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Our electroporation-mediated gene-transfection allowed us to restrict gene transduction in area and number of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishii and Mikawa, 2005</xref>). Despite the technical limitations, the suppression level of the Wnt/PCP pathway through the ΔDEP-misexpression was sufficient to lead to the PS deformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The Wnt/PCP pathway potentially works both cell-autonomously and non-cell autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davey and Moens, 2017</xref>). In the PS and non-PS epiblast cells, the disruption of the Pk1-localization was identified not only in the ΔDEP-misexpressing cells, but also in neighbors; however, this study is not designed to provide insight into questions of cell autonomy. Further, the Wnt/PCP pathway is a major regulator of cell intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roszko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tada and Heisenberg, 2012</xref>). Recent studies have shown that cell intercalation plays an important role in PS morphogenesis and the initiation of the polonaise movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saadaoui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voiculescu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rozbicki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Voiculescu et al., 2014</xref>). Our data demonstrates that suppression of the Wnt/PCP pathway preserves the initiation and maintenance of the polonaise movements, but the lateral positioning of the rotations is enlarged when the PS is deformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that the Wnt/PCP pathway may not be associated with directional cell intercalation for driving the polonaise movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of the polonaise movements for PS morphogenesis, a technical challenge/limitation is how to stop or disrupt the cell flow while preserving the cellular process intact. For example, previous loss-of-function studies, using knockdown techniques (such as siRNA and inhibitor treatments), identified the necessity of myosins, including pMyosin and actomyosin, for both the large-scale cell flow and PS morphogenesis, through regulation of tissue tension/biomechanical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rozbicki et al., 2015</xref>). Myosins are fundamental cellular components and involved in several cell biological processes, such as tissue tension, cell division, and intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartman and Spudich, 2012</xref>). Therefore, it remains a possibility that myosin-related mechanisms could be involved in the cell flow and PS morphogenesis. Recent studies using injury and pressure models further demonstrated that the cell flow pattern can be altered by a physical cut to an embryonic disc or removal of a large portion of an embryo disc through change of the tissue tension or ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saadaoui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caldarelli et al., 2021</xref>). While these models suggest that the cell flow pattern is dependent on an intact embryonic architecture, it remains unclear as to involvement of other elements such as signaling pathways and gene expression, which can be also molecularly and cell-biologically changed as a result of surgeries. Thus, we developed an experimentally manipulation of the cell flow system, using a Vg1-induced two-midline axis model, disturbing the stereotypical cell flow pattern while maintaining embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Our two-midline axis model provided an important insight into the axis-inducing morphogen for induction and patterning of the polonaise movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Our data demonstrated that the ectopic Vg1, mimicking the inducing activity of the posterior marginal zone, generated the bilateral rotating cell flow aligned to the induced midline axis but disrupted the cell flows at the authentic midline axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Despite the disturbed cell flow, PS extension was preserved along both authentic and induced midline axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). While this model ultimately disturbed the stereotypical cell flow pattern at the authentic midline axis, cell flow was initiated there. Therefore, our study does not rule out potential roles of the cell flow in the initiating steps of PS extension.</p><p>It remains unclear how the induced polonaise movements along with the secondary axis overcame the authentic cell flows despite mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As for axis-induction by other axis-inducing morphogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green, 2002</xref>), Vg1 may work dose-dependently for induction and patterning of the polonaise movements, and ectopic application may have over-ridden endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Further studies will clarify the relationship between the large-scale cell flows and the concentration of the morphogen; this will add new insight to the regulation mechanisms that connect axis-induction and the cell flow patterning.</p><p>This study further suggests evolutional distinctions underlying cell biological mechanisms of the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis, between amniotes and non-amniotes. The first distinction is the necessity of the Wnt/PCP pathway to the large-scale cell flow. Whereas the Wnt/PCP pathway is coupled with both the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis in non-amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tada and Heisenberg, 2012</xref>), our data revealed that the signaling pathway is required for proper PS morphogenesis, but contributes little to the polonaise movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The second distinction is mitosis-dependency/independency comparisons between model systems of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Non-amniotes, in particular amphibians, utilize a blastopore-mediated gastrulation and undergo notochord formation with the large-scale cell flow, all independent of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keller et al., 2000</xref>). In amniotes, mitosis is required for PS morphogenesis, and expanding the mass of the PS cells contributes to the maintenance of the polonaise movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the large-scale cell flow and midline morphogenesis in amniote gastrulation is not tightly coupled, which may be evolutionarily distinct from non-amniote gastrulation.</p><p>In summary, our study illustrates the relationships between midline morphogenesis, the large-scale cell flow, and an axis-inducing factor in amniote gastrulation. These findings will add another layer of our understanding to how the bilateral body plan is initiated and patterned along the midline axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Embryo isolation and culture conditions</title><p>Fertilized eggs of White Leghorn (<italic>Gallus Gallus domesticus</italic>) were obtained from Petaluma Farms (Petaluma, CA) and were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator to the appropriate embryonic stages.

PIV analysis technique [PIVlab package in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thielicke and Stamhuis, 2014</xref>)], which is a common technique for mapping displacement of particles (e.g. tagged cells) over a short time interval measured from a series of consecutive images to obtain the velocity vector field is employed to quantify the cell flows in the experimental time-lapse datasets. PIV is a standard technique used in the Fluid Physics and Engineering community to quantitatively measure and characterize fluid flows in different systems. This analysis provides comprehensive and quantitative information of a whole flow as a velocity vector field. The PIV analysis involves several steps that are carried out on image sequences over time intervals of 3 min, which is also the imaging acquisition speed in the experiments. First, we apply a high-pass filter during the image preprocessing step to highlight the bright particles (fluorescently tagged cell) and minimize the background. Then the PIV analysis was carried out by partitioning the image into smaller interrogation windows, typically of size 64x64 pixels with 50% overlap on the first pass, and a window size of 32x32 pixels with 50% overlap on the second pass. After this, raw velocity vector fields over time were obtained, and then these vectors were post-processed and validated by setting threshold limits, data smoothing and interpolation. A calibration was applied to convert pixel/frame units into μm/s units.</p><p>The generated velocity vector field through PIV were provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>. These plots displayed the averaged cell pattern of the whole-flow-field in the certain time period in this study. To highlight the more specific rotating cell flows, mathematical/physical information (such as topology and vorticity) was extracted from these velocity vector fields via computational visualization techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thielicke and Stamhuis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batchelor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenshields and Christopher, 2022</xref>). Topology of the cell flow was determined by streamlines, which are a group of curves that approximate to contours of the vectors in the velocity vector field at a particular moment in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batchelor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenshields and Christopher, 2022</xref>). Flowtrace visualized the trajectories of the cell flow, whereas the streamlines illustrated the averaged flow pattern in the time period. Therefore, the trajectories and streamlines show similar pattern when the cell flow is in stable-state; however, they are not completely consistent with each other when the cell flow is unstable and time-dependently changing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batchelor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenshields and Christopher, 2022</xref>). Vorticity, also termed as ‘curl of vorticity’, is a measure of a local rotation in the larger flow and its magnitude is twice that of the local angular velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batchelor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenshields and Christopher, 2022</xref>). The vorticity plot further displays directionality of the rotation. Since vorticity arises from any rotational movements, including both a full- and partial rotation, the vorticity plot displayed the vorticities in both the vortex-like rotating and curves of the cell flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thielicke and Stamhuis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batchelor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenshields and Christopher, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Measurement of the distance between the left-right rotations of the polonaise movements in control-GFP and ΔDEP-embryos</title><p>The vector fields in control- and ΔDEP-GFP-embryos were generated from the recorded videos by using PIVlab and averaged the flow pattern of the polonaise movements for 6 hr.

Rather, it is the focus of ongoing studies, in which we are investigating how Vg1 works in this concentration context and resulting dose-dependent effect on downstream gene expression, in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of this interesting dual role of Vg1. The relationship between the intensity of Vg1 signaling and the polonaise movements can be tested by modifying the size of the Vg1/COS, as the reviewer pointed out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that chicken embryo development is representative of &quot;amniotes,&quot; but it does not hold for all groups. Avian and mammal species are exceptional among amniotes in the sense they develop a PS (e.g., Coolen et al. 2008). Moreover, in certain mammalian embryos like mouse embryos, cells laterally to the PS do not move much (Williams et al. 2012). The authors should avoid the generalization that chicken embryos unequivocally represent amniotes as opposed to the observed in non-amniote embryos. The observations in chicken embryos as they stand are significant enough.</p><p>References:</p><p>Coolen M, et al. (2008).

Further, the Wnt/PCP pathway is involved in cellular polarity and migration, while the canonical Wnt pathway regulates cell proliferation (45).
