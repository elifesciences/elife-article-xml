brain controls nutrient storage is pivotal. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are conserved from insects to humans. They serve in detecting environmental shifts and in acting as internal sensors. Previously, we demonstrated the role of TRPγ in nutrient-sensing behavior (Dhakal et al., 2022). Here, we found that a TRPγ mutant exhibited in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is required for maintaining normal lipid and protein levels. In animals, lipogenesis and lipolysis control lipid levels in response to food availability. Lipids are mostly stored as triacylglycerol in the fat bodies (FBs) of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>trpγ</italic> deficient mutants exhibited elevated TAG levels and our genetic data indicated that <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons are indispensable for normal lipid storage but not protein storage. The <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants also exhibited reduced starvation resistance, which was attributed to insufficient lipolysis in the FBs. This could be mitigated by administering lipase or metformin orally, indicating a potential treatment pathway. Gene expression analysis indicated that <italic>trpγ</italic> knockout downregulated <italic>brummer</italic>, a key lipolytic gene, resulting in chronic lipolytic deficits in the gut and other fat tissues. The study also highlighted the role of specific proteins, including neuropeptide DH44 and its receptor DH44R2 in lipid regulation. Our findings provide insight into the broader question of how the brain and gut regulate nutrient storage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRP channel</kwd><kwd>Dh44</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>lipid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RS-2021-NR058319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Youngseok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002512</institution-id><institution>Kookmin University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Global Scholarship Program for Foreign Graduate Students</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nath</surname><given-names>Dharmendra Kumar</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhakal</surname><given-names>Subash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003654</institution-id><institution>Korea Environmental Industry and Technology Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Biomaterials Specialized Graduate Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Youngseok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TRPγ is essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, linking neuronal regulation to fat metabolism and suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for metabolic disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nutrient storage is not a simple matter of accumulation but involves a sophisticated network of signals and receptors, feedback loops, and hormonal influences, all choreographed by the brain. The mechanisms involve various tissues and organs, including the liver, muscles, and adipose tissue, each playing a distinct role in the storage and release of vital nutrients like glucose, fats, and proteins in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Efeyan et al., 2015</xref>). Key to this regulation are specialized cells and molecular pathways that respond to dietary intake, energy expenditure, and changes in the internal and external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tran et al., 2022</xref>). For instance, the brain receives and interprets signals about the body’s energy status through hormones such as insulin and leptin, and nutrients themselves, which inform decisions on whether to store or mobilize energy reserves in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jais and Brüning, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roh and Kim, 2016</xref>). Moreover, the role of TRP channels as molecular sensors that detect changes in the environment and internal metabolic status highlights the level of molecular sophistication involved in nutrient storage and energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clapham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dhakal and Lee, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fowler and Montell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turner et al., 2016</xref>). These channels bridge external stimuli with internal responses, ensuring the body adapts efficiently to maintain homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dhakal and Lee, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Venkatachalam and Montell, 2007</xref>). This concert of mechanisms, from the molecular to the systemic level, exemplifies the elegance with which the brain ensures our energy needs are met in a changing environment, highlighting the intricate interplay of biological process that sustains life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Picard et al., 2018</xref>). Understanding these process opens up new vistas in our approach to diet, disease management, and overall health optimization.</p><p>The use of a genetically tractable model organism such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> could provide fundamental insights into the potential relationship between TRP channels and metabolic syndrome. This study delves into the function of TRPγ channels, specifically their role in managing lipid and protein levels. Through genetic manipulation, we explored the consequences of TRPγ mutations on the metabolic processes, revealing critical insights into the regulation of lipid storage and breakdown. We found that TRPγ expression in <italic>Dh44</italic> neuroendocrine cells in the brain is critical for maintaining normal carbohydrate levels in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhakal et al., 2022</xref>). Building on this, we hypothesized that TRPγ in <italic>Dh44</italic> cells also regulates lipid and protein homeostasis. Our investigation sheds light on the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis, processes that, respectively, synthesize and degrade lipids based on the availability of food, and how these processes are affected by TRPγ activity. By examining the metabolic anomalies in <italic>trpγ</italic> deficient mutants, including alterations in lipid storage and the consequent impact on starvation resistance, this study advances our understanding of metabolic regulation. Furthermore, we uncover the potential therapeutic benefits of lipase and metformin in counteracting the metabolic deficiencies caused by TRPγ mutations. Through detailed gene expression analysis, we identify the downregulation of crucial genes involved in lipid metabolism, offering new perspectives on the genetic underpinnings of nutrient storage regulation. The implications of this research are far-reaching, not only enhancing our comprehension of basic biological functions but also providing avenues for therapeutic interventions in metabolic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Trpγ mutants exhibit reduced sugar levels alongside elevated lipid and protein levels</title><p>In order to understand how <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> regulates the maintenance of major nutrient levels, including carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, TRP channel mutants were examined as potential candidates. A recent study revealed that among TRP channel mutants, only <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant displayed only reduced carbohydrate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhakal et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting the involvement of additional TRP channels in regulating major nutrients. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> possesses 13 members of the TRP channel family. Flies with mutations in <italic>trpM</italic>, <italic>trpML</italic>, and <italic>nompC</italic> showed high mortality rates with minimal survival, whereas those with mutations in the remaining 10 TRP superfamily genes were viable and healthy when homozygous. Investigation into the lipid and protein levels of other available TRP superfamily mutants under sated conditions revealed that, apart from the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant, all tested mutants exhibited normal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Specifically, the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant showed 1.3 times higher triacylglycerol (TAG) levels and 1.5 times higher protein levels compared to the control. These metabolic changes were unique and specific to the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants among the evaluated TRP superfamily mutants. Previous observations indicated that <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants had lower cellular sugar levels and stored glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhakal et al., 2022</xref>). Consistently, <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants exhibited reduced levels of cellular sugars (glucose and trehalose), stored glycogen, and sugar levels in the hemolymph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). In conclusion, it was found that <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants displayed lower carbohydrate levels but higher lipid and protein levels compared to the control. Importantly, the increased TAG and protein levels observed in <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant were confirmed with a second <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> allele (<italic>trpγ<sup>G4</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>).

Our findings indicated that the increased lipid levels in the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant background decreased to normal levels via the expression of the <italic>trpγ</italic> transgene in the DH44 neuroendocrine cells but not in its parent strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Again, the expression of the <italic>trpγ</italic> transgene in the dILP2 neurons had no appreciable effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the expression of the <italic>trpγ</italic> transgene did not decrease the protein levels in either the DH44 or the dILP2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This indicates that TRPγ expressed in Dh44 cells is sufficient for the regulation of lipid levels. Next, RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments were conducted to further examine the role of <italic>trpγ</italic> in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons. Interestingly, <italic>trpγ</italic> knockdown in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons significantly increased lipid levels, whereas flies harboring only the <italic>Dh44-GAL4</italic> or the <italic>UAS-trpγ<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgenes displayed normal lipid levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This indicated that TRPγ in Dh44 cells is needed for the regulation of lipid levels. Furthermore, the total TAG level in the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies was higher in both males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), meaning that the functions of <italic>trpγ</italic> are not sex-specific.</p><p>In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, lipids are mainly stored in the form of TAG and cholesterol ester in the adipose tissue [i.e., fat bodies (FBs)] as lipid droplets (LDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu and Huang, 2013</xref>).

Furthermore, the elevated whole-body TAG levels in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant flies might suggest that they were unable to break down stored lipids even under starving conditions. Metazoans must coordinate the metabolism of glycogen, lipid, and protein to maintain metabolic homeostasis during fasting periods, thus providing an appropriate energy supply across tissues. Therefore, the total TAG levels of the control and <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant flies were assessed under sated and starved (starvation for 24 hr) conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). When the control flies were deprived of food for 24 hr, their TAG levels decreased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

To further confirm that lipolysis was restricted in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants under starvation conditions, LDs were stained, after which we measured the sizes of individual LDs accumulated throughout the whole fat bodies of the flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>).

Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as the master controller for maintaining energy balance in cells, and coordinating metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardie et al., 2003</xref>). It regulates the balance between building up and breaking down substances to ensure cellular stability during metabolic stress. AMPK is a key target for treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and obesity, as its activation increases fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).

First, we measured TAG levels at 0, 7, and 14 d after dietary administration of 1 mM or 5 mM of metformin (the treatments were prepared by mixing the appropriate metformin concentrations into standard cornmeal diets) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The high TAG levels in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant (41.91± 4.56) were decreased to levels similar to those of the control at 7 and 14 d (30.03± 4.34 and 33.79± 3.20, respectively) after treatment with 1 mM metformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

TAG is composed of glycerol and three fatty acids. Therefore, we first fed the flies with 1% glycerol only. Glycerol extended the survival of the control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies by 3–4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Next, the flies were fed with 0.2% and 0.5% hexanoic acid (HA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>; 0.2% HA, LT<sub>50</sub> of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>: 65.44±1.94 hr and 52.32±2.05 hr, respectively; 0.5% HA, LT<sub>50</sub> of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>: 56.27±1.30 hr and 46.27±1.47 hr, respectively). Additionally, we also tested the effects of 0.2% and 0.5% concentrations of a TAG mixture (combination of mono-, di-, and tri- acylglycerol) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>; 0.2% TAG, LT<sub>50</sub> of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>: 52.93±5.12 hr and 50.1±3.74 hr, respectively; 0.5% TAG, LT<sub>50</sub> of control and <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>: 65.1±2.6 hr and 57.75±3.32 hr, respectively). The HA and mixed TAG treatments significantly extended the survival of the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants, albeit not to levels similar to those of the control. This indicated that the TRPγ mutant could not fully absorb and burn the digested lipid. Furthermore, lipid-only dietary supplementation markedly limited the LT<sub>50</sub> of the control. Importantly, supplementation with lipolytic drugs, lipase, TAG, and free fatty acids effectively rescued the survival of <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants under starvation conditions. This observation was consistent with our finding that <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants are unable to degrade lipid stores under starvation conditions. The dietary rescue of <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants suggests that although the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutation increases the levels of stored lipids, the flies were not able to utilize them when starved. We next sought to determine whether <italic>trpγ</italic> mutation reduces lipase production in the abdomen by comparing lipid accumulation in the intestine. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut is divided into R1–R5 regions, each with distinct functions in nutrient processing and absorption. Notably, the R2 region serves as a critical interface between the fly’s diet and metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Capo et al., 2019</xref>). To assess lipid distribution, we conducted Nile red staining in control and mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>). Mutant flies displayed elevated lipid deposits on the intestinal wall of the R2 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), a phenotype restored to normal levels by expressing <italic>trpγ</italic> in its own cells or <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>). Consequently, we quantified lipid droplets specifically within the intestinal wall of the R2 region in <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> flies, with no such accumulation observed in control or rescued flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). These findings indicate that TRPγ plays a crucial role in the brain-gut axis, specifically in controlling lipid metabolism in the intestine, as evidenced by the lipid accumulation observed in the gut region of <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>. Taken together, these observations indicate that TRPγ plays an important role in maintaining systemic lipid levels through proper expression of triglyceride lipase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Assessment of the role of DH44 and its receptors (DH44R1 and DH44R2) in relation to the utilization of fat</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, two receptors have been identified for DH44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hector et al., 2009</xref>).

In conclusion, our findings suggested that the DH44 system has an important role in regulating the metabolic homeostasis of carbohydrates and lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic model representing the roles of <italic>trpγ</italic> in metabolic regualtion of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99258-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The metabolic dysregulation of carbohydrates and lipids observed in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants was phenocopied by the cellular inactivation of DH44 cells. Compared to the controls, the <italic>Dh44-GAL4</italic>/<italic>UAS-Kir2.1</italic> flies exhibited lower carbohydrate levels and increased lipid levels. We previously proposed that TRPγ holds DH44 neurons in a state of afterdepolarization, thus reducing firing rates by inactivating voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhakal et al., 2022</xref>). At the physiological level, this induces the consistent release of DH44 and depletion of DH44 stores, resulting in nutrient utilization and storage malfunctions. Likewise, our findings revealed that <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant and its receptor mutant, <italic>Dh44R2</italic>, displayed defects analogous to those observed in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant. The <italic>trpγ</italic> mutant phenotype in lipid regulation can be restored by the expression of <italic>trpγ</italic> in the <italic>Dh44-GAL4</italic> as well as <italic>Dh44R2-GAL4</italic>. This indicates that TRPγ functions in the brain and gut independently for lipid homeostasis. The mode of action for TRPγ in the gut should be further investigated. Finally, it would also be interesting to investigate the potential roles of TRPC members in humans, especially the involvement of TRPC4 and TRPC5 in metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence have suggested that DH44 neurons communicate with the intestine. First, DH44 at the PI in the brain is an incretin-like hormone that acts as a hemolymph nutrient sensor. The secretion of DH44 is highly dependent on the calorie value of a given diet, as DH44 secretion is only mediated by nutritional sugars but not non-nutritional sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhakal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oh et al., 2021</xref>). Second, the expression of TRPγ in the PI is sufficient to recover any metabolic defects such as reduced carbohydrate and increased lipid levels, as well as related phenomena such as starvation resistance. DH44 and kinin neuropeptides influence desiccation and starvation tolerance in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cannell et al., 2016</xref>). There is an inconsistency between total TAG levels and the LD size observed in the <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant. This inconsistency raises a possibility that the signaling pathway from DH44 release to its receptor DH44R2 only accounts for part of the lipid metabolic process under starvation. While <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant flies displayed normal internal TAG levels, <italic>Dh44R2</italic> mutant flies exhibited elevated TAG levels. This suggested that the lipolysis phenotype could be facilitated by a neuropeptide other than DH44. Alternatively, a DH44 neuropeptide-independent pathway could mediate the lipolysis. Although <italic>Dh44<sup>Mi</sup></italic> exhibited normal TAG levels, the presence of larger LDs indicated that DH44 plays a regulatory role in lipid metabolism. LDs consist of a hydrophobic core of neutral storage fats, such as triglycerides or cholesterol esters, encased by a protein-coated phospholipid monolayer. From our findings, it is suggested that DH44 and its receptor DH44R2, but not DH44R1, are involved in the control of lipid storage, indicating a specific pathway through which DH44 influences lipid metabolism distinct from its role in carbohydrate metabolism and overall energy homeostasis. TRPγ in DH44 neurons may influence the release of metabolic signals or hormones that act on postsynaptic DH44R2 cells. These postsynaptic cells could, in turn, modulate lipid storage and metabolism in a non-cell autonomous manner. However, the mechanism by which TRPγ functions in DH44R2 cells remains unclear. One possible explanation is that TRPγ in the gut may be activated by stretch or osmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akitake et al., 2015</xref>). Third, <italic>trpγ</italic> gene knockdown through RNAi in the DH44 neurons is enough to phenocopy all of the metabolic defects observed in the <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants. Fourth, <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants exhibit low expression of <italic>brummer</italic> lipase, which results in the accumulation of LDs in the body, which is a reciprocal process regulated by DH44 neurons. Brummer lipase is essential for regulating lipid levels in the insect fat body by mediating lipid mobilization and energy homeostasis. In <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>, it facilitates triglyceride breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2018</xref>), while studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> show that reduced Brummer lipase expression decreases fatty acids and increases diacylglycerol levels, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nazario-Yepiz et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we additionally demonstrate that <italic>bmm</italic> expression in DH44 neurons within the PI region can systemically regulate TAG levels. Cell signaling or energy status in DH44 neurons may contribute to hormonal release that targets organs such as the fat body. Fifth, the activation of AMPK in the DH44 neurons can recover the defects of the lipid level of <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>. Sixth, the reduced starvation resistance can be significantly recovered through dietary lipase supplementation. These findings support the assertion that the sugar-sensing DH44 neurons send downward signals to the intestine by absorbing the carbohydrates and lipids derived from dietary intake. However, DH44 neurons do not regulate protein levels in the body because the increased protein levels of <italic>trpγ</italic> mutants were not recovered by the expression of <italic>trpγ</italic> in the DH44 neurons. These findings confirm that <italic>trpγ</italic> regulates <italic>bmm</italic> expression in the adult bowel, enabling dietary lipid digestion and maintaining systemic lipid homeostasis.</p><p>Treatment with metformin, a lipolytic agent, at two different concentrations (1 mM and 5 mM) decreased the total TAG levels and reduced the size of the LDs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Similarly, metformin increased the starvation resistance of the <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant but not the controls. These findings were consistent with the widely acknowledged anti-obesity properties of metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sang et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, our results were in agreement with the evidence that metformin helps to reduce lipid accumulation caused by diets rich in saturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Although the exact target of metformin is not known, its lipolytic effect is significant and widely documented. Oral administration of 5 mM of metformin reduced normal TAG levels of wild-type flies, whereas the 1 mM dose had no significant effect. Therefore, low metformin doses were effective at decreasing stored lipid levels in flies. The accumulation of intracellular LDs is regulated by autophagy. Metformin improves autophagic flux through AMPKα-mediated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> context, we propose a mechanism involving AMPK activation within DH44 neurons as a rescue mechanism for starvation resistance in <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic>, highlighting its crucial role in this process. AMPK activation is known to enhance an organism’s ability to endure environmental stresses by facilitating autophagy-mediated cellular cleanup, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis for increased energy production, and optimizing metabolic pathways for enhanced energy efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). While the precise nature of the connection between TRPγ, DH44 neuronal activity, and AMPK activation remains unspecified, it is conceivable that TRPγ influences AMPK activation or regulation within DH44 neurons, contributing to stress responses, ATP supply, and metabolic adaptations. Metformin can influence lipid metabolism through various mechanisms, one of which is the promotion of lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szkudelski et al., 2022</xref>). This effect results in a gradual reduction of stored lipid levels over time. Orally administering metformin to flies led to a significant reduction in lipid levels, accompanied by an increase in survival. Subsequent qPCR analysis post-metformin feeding revealed a significant upregulation in the expression level of the lipolytic gene (<italic>bmm</italic>). These results strongly support our hypothesis that metformin induces lipolysis when orally administered.</p><p>The exact mechanism through which orally administered lipase leads to gastric lipolysis remains unclear. However, our experimental data indicated that 0.1% lipase increased the survival time of <italic>trpγ<sup>1</sup></italic> under starvation. Lipase exhibits a high degree of chemical selectivity and has the ability to catalyze triglyceride into glycerol ester, monoglycerides, glycerol, and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).

The glycogen level was quantified by comparing it with a standard curve plotted from standard glycogen samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Survival assay</title><p>Survival experiments were conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2018b</xref>). Normal cornmeal diets were used to conduct the normal survival assays. To measure survival under starvation conditions, twenty 3–4 d-old male flies were fed with 1% agar food supplemented with or without various concentrations of lipase (0.1%; active or denatured), glycerol (1%), hexanoic acid (0.2%, 0.5%), glycerol (1%), TAG mix (0.2%, 0.5%), or metformin (1 mM, 5 mM). Every 12 hr, the flies were monitored/counted and then transferred to fresh vials with the same food supply. The experiments were conducted until the food vials had been cleared.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>We performed immunohistochemistry as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhakal et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, to fix and block the specimens, we placed freshly dissected tissues (brain and intestine) into a well of 24-well tissue culture plate (Costar Corp.) placed on ice, which contained 940 μL of fixing buffer (1 mM EGTA, 0.1 M Pipes pH 6.9, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1% TritonX-100, 150 mM NaCl). 60 μL formaldehyde (37%) was added to the wells and mixed instantly before the tissues were added. As many as tissues that were dissected within 15 min were fixed and then the samples were incubated for 30 min more. Samples were washed with wash buffer (1 X PBS, 0.1% saponin) three times (15 min. for each washing), and blocked with 1 mL blocking buffer (1 X PBS, 0.1% saponin, and 5 mg/mL BSA) at 4 °C for 4–8 hr.</p><p>To perform immunostaining, primary antibodies were inserted into the sample at 4 °C for 18 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jais and Brüning, 2022</xref>). Samples were washed with wash buffer three times (15 min each) and added secondary antibodies {(1:200) goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (cat. # A11029), goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (cat. # A11004), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (cat. # A11034), and goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568 (cat. # A11036) at 4 °C for 4 hr. Finally, samples were washed three times and stored into 1.25 X PDA (187.5 mM NaCl, 37.5% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris pH 8.8), and kept at 4 °C for more than 1 hr. Samples were mounted and examined using a Leica Stellaris 5 Confocal Microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Nile red staining</title><p>Nile Red is a dark purplish-red powder (Sigma N-3013), the stock solution must be prepared in acetone (1000 µg/mL) and kept in a tightly sealed, lightproof container at 4 °C. Briefly, 5–10 d-old male flies were fixed in a sagittal position on a glass slide and submerged in a 1 X PBS solution. FBs were gently dissected from a dorsal abdominal region along with a thorax or the gut under a stereomicroscope. The dissected tissues were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed tissues were gently washed three times with 1 X PBS (5 min for each wash). Nile Red (1:1000 dilution) was added to the tissue samples for 5 min. Finally, the stained tissues were washed with 1 mL 1 X PBS and mounted in 50% glycerol on a glass slide. LD deposition exhibits greater density in the upper abdominal region compared to the lower abdominal area. This comparison was meticulously conducted within the identical segments 2–3 of the abdomen to ensure accuracy.</p><p>For intestinal lipid staining, 5–10 d-old male flies were fixed on a glass slide and submerged in 1 X PBS solution. Full intestine was dissected very carefully. The dissected intestine was fixed with a 4% formaldehyde solution for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed intestine was washed 3 times with 1 X PBS. Nile red was added to the sample for 5 min. The stained samples were washed with 1 mL 1 X PBS and mounted in 50% glycerol on a glass slide.

Briefly, ten 6–10 d-old male flies (control and mutant) were selected for the whole body and 15 flies were selected for fat body samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>. The experiments were conducted under sated (0 hr starvation) and starved (24 hr starvation) conditions. Total RNA was extracted using the TRizol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by DNase (Promega) treatment. cDNA was synthesized using the AMV reverse transcriptase system (Promega). RT-qPCR experiments were carried out using a Bio-rad CFX system. The Takara TB Green Premix was used to assess the mRNA expression level of each gene according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2<sup>–∆∆Ct</sup> method.

For the experiments, male flies were mostly used unless we did not mention the sex. All of the experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions. The appropriate number of replicates was established based on previous research. A large enough sample size was used in all of our assays to ensure that our results were representative and repeatable. No data points were left out of the analysis. For each genotype, the data points indicate the values of individual replicates. The error bars in all of the figures represent the standard error of the mean (SEM). The analysis of the RT-qPCR data was conducted using the C<sub>T</sub> values. Comparisons between multiple experimental groups were conducted via single-factor ANOVA and Scheffe’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test. Pair-wise comparisons were conducted via Student’s t-test. Survival curves were estimated for each group, using a Kaplan-Meier method and compared statistically using the log-rank tests. The asterisks in the figures indicate statistical significance (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01). All statistical analyses were conducted using the Origin Pro 8 software for Windows (ver. 8.0932; Origin Lab Corporation, USA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-99258-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source data for all figures contained in the manuscript have been deposited in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28029974">figshare</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nath</surname><given-names>DK</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhakal</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>TRPγ regulates lipid metabolism through Dh44 neuroendocrine cells</data-title><source>figshare</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.6084/m9.figshare.28029974</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants to Youngseok Lee from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korea government (MIST) (RS-2021-NR058319) and the Biomaterials Specialized Graduate Program through the Korea Environmental Industry &amp; Technology Institute (KEITI) funded by the Ministry of Environment (MOE).

If the authors could improve the writing to address their findings and connect their findings with conclusions, the research would be much more appreciated and have a higher impact in the field.</p><p>Here, I listed the major issues and suggestions for the authors to improve their manuscript:</p><p>(1) Are the increased lipid droplet size and the upregulated total TAG level measured in the starved or sated mutant in Figure 1? This information might be crucial for readers to understand the physiological function of TRP in lipid metabolism. In other words, clarifying whether the upregulated lipid storage is observed only in the starved trp mutant will advance our knowledge of TRPγ. If the increase of total TAG level is only observed in the starved animals, TRP in the Dh44 neurons might serve as a sensor for the starvation state required to promote lipolysis in starvation conditions. On the other hand, if the total TAG level increases in both starved and sated animals, activation of Dh44 through TRPγ might be involved in the lipid metabolism process after food ingestion.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured total TAG level in Figure 1 and LD sizes in Figure 2 under sated condition. We inserted “under sated condition” to clarify it. lines 97 and 147-148.</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is unclear how AMPK activation in Dh44 neurons reduces the total triacylglycerol (TAG) levels in the animals (Figure 3G). As AMPK is activated in response to metabolic stress, the result in Figure 3G might suggest that Dh44 neurons sense metabolic stress through AMPK activation to promote lipolysis in other tissues. Do Dh44 neurons become more active during starvation? Is activation of Dh44 neurons sufficient to activate AMPK in the Dh44 neurons without starvation? Is activation of AMPK in the Dh44 neurons required for Dh44 release and lipolysis during starvation? These answers would provide more insights into the conclusion in Lines 192-193.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study, we demonstrated that trpγ mutants exhibited lower levels of glucose, trehalose and glycogen level (Dhakal et al. 2022), and in the current study, we observed excessive lipid storage in the trpγ mutant, indicating imbalanced energy homeostasis. Given the established role of AMPK in maintaining energy balance (Marzano et. al., 2021, Lin et al 2021), we employed the activated form of AMPK (<italic>UAS-AMPKTD</italic>) in our experiments. Our result showed that expression of activated AMPK in <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons led to a reduction in total TAG levels, suggesting that AMPK activation in these neurons can promote lipolysis even in the absence of starvation. Regarding the activation of <italic>Dh44</italic> neurons, Dus et al in 2015 reported that <italic>Dh44</italic> cells in the brain are activated by nutritive sugars especially in starvation conditions. In addition, another report showed a role of Dh44 neuron in regulating starvation induced sleep suppression (Oh et. al., 2023) which may imply that these neurons become more active under starved conditions. We did not directly assess whether Dh44 neuron activity increases during starvation or whether AMPK activation in these neurons is required for DH44 release and subsequent lipolysis, our finding support the notion that AMPK activation in Dh44 neuron is sufficient to reduce TAG levels, potentially by metabolic stress response typically observed during starvation. We explained it like the following: “<italic>Dh44</italic> neurons regulate starvation-induced sleep suppression (Oh et. al., 2023), which implies that these neurons become more active under starved conditions.” lines 190-191.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is unclear how the lipolytic gene brummer is further downregulated in the trpγ mutant during starvation while brummer is upregulated in the control group (Figure 6A). This result implies that the trpγ mutant was able to sense the starvation state but responded abnormally by inhibiting the lipolytic process rather than promoting lipolysis, which makes it more susceptible to starvation (Figure 3B).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestions. We explained it like the following: “The data indicates that the <italic>trpg</italic> mutant can sense the starvation state but responds abnormally by suppressing lipolysis instead of activating it. This dysregulated lipolytic response likely increases the mutant's vulnerability to starvation, as it cannot effectively mobilize lipid stores for energy during periods of nutrient deprivation.” lines 251-254.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) There is an inconsistency of total TAG levels and the lipid droplet size observed in the Dh44 mutant but not in the Dh44-R2 mutant (Figures 7A and 7F). This inconsistency raises a possibility that the signaling pathway from Dh44 release to its receptor Dh44-R2 only accounts for part of the lipid metabolic process under starvation. Adding discussion to address this inconsistency may be helpful for readers to appreciate the finding.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We included the following in the Discussion: “There is an inconsistency of total TAG levels and the LD size observed in the <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant. This inconsistency raises a possibility that the signaling pathway from DH44 release to its receptor DH44R2 only accounts for part of the lipid metabolic process under starvation. While <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant flies displayed normal internal TAG levels, <italic>Dh44R2</italic> mutant flies exhibited elevated TAG levels. This suggested that the lipolysis phenotype could be facilitated by a neuropeptide other than DH44. Alternatively, a DH44 neuropeptide-independent pathway could mediate the lipolysis.” lines 429-436.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, the function of trpγ in lipid metabolism was investigated.

At the physiological level, this induces the consistent release of DH44 and depletion of DH44 stores, resulting in nutrient utilization and storage malfunctions.”</p><p>We also included the following: “TRPg in DH44 neurons may influence the release of metabolic signals or hormones that act on postsynaptic DH44R2 cells. These postsynaptic cells could, in turn, modulate lipid storage and metabolism in a non-cell autonomous manner. However, the mechanism by which TRPg functions in DH44R2 cells remains unclear. One possible explanation is that TRPg in the gut may be activated by stretch or osmolarity (Akitake et al. 2015).” lines 439-440.</p><p>This interaction between presynaptic and postsynaptic cells may ensure a coordinated response to metabolic changes and maintain lipid homeostasis. Thus, both Dh44-expressing and Dh44-R2-expressing cells are crucial for the proper functioning of TRPγ in regulating internal TAG levels and lipid storage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The expression of TRPγ solely in DH44 R2 neurons of TRPγ mutant flies restored the TAG phenotype, suggesting an important function mediated by TRPγ in DH44 R2 neurons.

To address this, we performed immunostaining to examine the expression of TRPγ in the DH44R2+ gut cells. Our results, as shown in Figure 7 O and P, confirm that TRPγ is co-expressed in the Dh44R2+ cells in the gut. We also found that Dh44R2 is expressed in the brain as well. We documented this part like the following: “Given that <italic>Dh44R2</italic> is predominantly expressed in the intestine, we performed immunostaining to examine whether <italic>Dh44R2</italic> co-localizes with <italic>trpg</italic> in gut cells. Our results confirmed that <italic>Dh44R2</italic> and <italic>trpg</italic> are co-expressed in intestinal cells (Figure 7O and P). Additionally, we analyzed <italic>Dh44R2</italic> expression in the brain and found that two <italic>Dh44R2</italic>-expressing cells are co-localized with <italic>Dh44</italic>-expressing cells in the PI region (Figure 7Q). To further delineate whether <italic>Dh44R2</italic>-mediated fat utilization is specific to the brain, gut, or fat body, we knocked down <italic>Dh44R2RNAi</italic> using <italic>Dh44-GAL4</italic>, <italic>myo1A-GAL4</italic>, and <italic>cg-GAL4</italic>, respectively (Figure 7–figure supplement 1E). Notably, knockdown of <italic>Dh44R2</italic> with <italic>Myo1A-GAL4</italic> resulted in elevated TAG levels, indicating that DH44R2 activity in lipid metabolism is specific to the gut.” lines 375-384.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While Dh44 mutant flies displayed normal internal TAG levels, Dh44R2 mutant flies exhibited elevated TAG levels (Figure 7A). This suggested that the lipolysis phenotype could be facilitated by a neuropeptide other than Dh44. Alternatively, a Dh44 neuropeptide-independent pathway could mediate the lipolysis. In either case, an additional result is needed to substantiate either one of the hypotheses.</p></disp-quote><p>The Dh44 mutant flies exhibited normal TAG levels, whereas Dh44R2 mutant flies showed elevated TAG levels. However, when we examined the lipid droplets in the fat body, both Dh44 mutant and Dh44R2 mutant flies displayed larger lipid droplets, indicating a disruption in lipid metabolism. Additionally, we assessed starvation survival time and found that both Dh44 and Dh44R2 mutant flies exhibited reduced survival under starvation conditions compared to controls. Supplementation with lipase (Figure 7–figure supplement 1A), glycerol (Figure 7–figure supplement 1B), hexanoic acid (Figure 7–figure supplement 1C), and mixed TAGs (Figure 7–figure supplement 1D) improved starvation survival time, further supporting that the lipid metabolism pathway was impaired in both mutants. These observations highlight the role of Dh44 in regulating lipolysis. We included related Discussion: “There is an inconsistency of total TAG levels and the LD size observed in the <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant. This inconsistency raises a possibility that the signaling pathway from DH44 release to its receptor DH44R2 only accounts for part of the lipid metabolic process under starvation. While <italic>Dh44</italic> mutant flies displayed normal internal TAG levels, <italic>Dh44R2</italic> mutant flies exhibited elevated TAG levels. This suggested that the lipolysis phenotype could be facilitated by a neuropeptide other than DH44.

The authors applied a series of lipolytic genetic manipulation and lipid/lipid metabolism supplements to rescue the trpγ deficits in lipolysis: the expression of active AMPK in the DH44-expressing PI neurons or brummer, a lipolytic gene, in the trpγ-expressing cells, and oral administration of the anti-diabetic drug metformin, lipase, TAG and free fatty acids. Despite this exhaustive characterization of the defective lipolysis in the trpγ mutants, there remain puzzles in inconsistent defects of Dh44 and DH44R2 in the total TAG levels and in the expression and functions of the receptor in the gut. Clarification of these points and other issues raised by the reviewers should improve the mechanisms of lipid metabolism through Dh44 signalling.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) It might be worth introducing Dh44 in the introduction section as it is unclear to readers how the authors hypothesized the site-of-action of TRPγ in Dh44 neurons for lipid metabolism after reading the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We introduced the following: “We found that TRPg expression in <italic>Dh44</italic> neuroendocrine cells in the brain is critical for maintaining normal carbohydrate levels in tissues (Dhakal et al. 2022).
