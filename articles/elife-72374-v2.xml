mature spermatozoa. Whereas hundreds of genes are known to be essential for male germline proliferation and differentiation, the contribution of several genes remains uncharacterized. The predominant expression of the latest globin family member, androglobin (Adgb), in mammalian testis tissue prompted us to assess its physiological function in spermatogenesis. Adgb knockout mice display male infertility, reduced testis weight, impaired maturation of elongating spermatids, abnormal sperm shape, and ultrastructural defects in microtubule and mitochondrial organization. Epididymal sperm from Adgb knockout animals display multiple flagellar malformations including coiled, bifid or shortened flagella, and erratic acrosomal development. Following immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we could identify septin 10 (Sept10) as interactor of Adgb. The Sept10-Adgb interaction was confirmed both <italic>in vivo</italic> using testis lysates and <italic>in vitro</italic> by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, the absence of Adgb leads to mislocalization of Sept10 in sperm, indicating defective manchette and sperm annulus formation. Finally, <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest that Adgb contributes to Sept10 proteolysis in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Collectively, our results provide evidence that Adgb is essential for murine spermatogenesis and further suggest that Adgb is required for sperm head shaping via the manchette and proper flagellum formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>globin</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>oxygen</kwd><kwd>calmodulin</kwd><kwd>infertility</kwd><kwd>heme</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_173000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoogewijs</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_207460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoogewijs</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HO 5837/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoogewijs</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA 2103/9-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hankeln</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Androglobin, a newly identified mammalian globin with a unique modular structure including a protease and calmodulin binding IQ domain within a circularly permuted globin domain, is implicated in murine spermatogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spermatogenesis is a complex and dynamic differentiation process ending by the production of mature haploid spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hermo et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermo et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hermo et al., 2010c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hermo et al., 2010d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hermo et al., 2010e</xref>). While type A spermatogonia undergo mitosis, one of the daughter cells serves to replenish the stem cell population, and the other daughter cell further divides mitotically, differentiates, and eventually forms type B spermatogonia. Following another mitotic division, type B spermatogonia engender primary spermatocytes, which complete their first meiotic division and form two secondary spermatocytes. Each secondary spermatocyte completes a second meiotic division, leading to the production of two haploid round spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mecklenburg and Hermann, 2016</xref>). During the final differentiation phase of spermatogenesis, known as spermiogenesis, the spermatids undergo profound morphological changes to differentiate and elongate into spermatozoa. These changes include condensation of the nucleus and compaction of the genetic material, the formation of the acrosome (the sperm head) from the Golgi apparatus before migration of the latter to the cytoplasmic droplet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khawar et al., 2019</xref>), the formation of the sperm flagellum from the centriole, around which mitochondria will migrate to form the midpiece, the sperm annulus, and the mobile tail, and cytoplasmic reduction, whereby all unnecessary cytoplasmic remnants are eliminated. At the end of the elongation process, the spermatozoa are released into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule to migrate into the rete testis and epididymis for final maturation. Dysfunctions in any of these tightly orchestrated steps could lead to impaired spermatogenesis, meiotic arrest, or abnormal sperm formation with direct consequences on male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neto et al., 2016</xref>). It is currently estimated that sperm defects and abnormalities remain idiopathic in about 30% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fainberg and Kashanian, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tüttelmann et al., 2018</xref>), and unraveling their molecular basis appears challenging since it is believed that over 4000 genes are possibly implicated in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Globins are small globular metallo-proteins, which have the capacity to reversibly bind gaseous ligands via a typical 8 alpha-helical structure in which a heme prosthetic group can be embedded. In mammals, five globin types exist: the well-established hemoglobin and myoglobin, neuroglobin in neuronal cells, cytoglobin ubiquitously expressed in fibroblasts, and the more recently identified androglobin (Adgb), predominantly expressed in mammalian testis tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keppner et al., 2020</xref>). Adgb is a chimeric protein containing an N-terminal calpain-like cysteine protease domain, followed by an uncharacterized 300 amino acid long region, a central permuted functional globin domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bracke et al., 2018</xref>), interrupted by a potential calmodulin (CaM)-binding IQ motif, and a large 700 amino acid long C-terminal tail of unknown identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoogewijs et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, the chimeric nature of this globin resembles the domain structure of globin-coupled sensors found in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thijs et al., 2007</xref>). CaM is one of the most conserved proteins in eukaryotes and serves as a secondary messenger following intracellular binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and interaction with one of the more than 300 identified downstream target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2020</xref>). CaM is the main intracellular receptor for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thereby participating in almost every biological process, including spermatogenesis and sperm maturation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darszon et al., 2011</xref>). Decreased mRNA expression levels in infertile vs. fertile men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Platts et al., 2007</xref>) suggest a potential role of Adgb in spermatogenesis. Gene regulation and expression studies further suggest an association of Adgb with ciliogenesis including flagellum formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koay et al., 2021</xref>). However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of Adgb remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the physiological function of Adgb during murine spermatogenesis by generating and analyzing Adgb knockout mice. We show that Adgb is mainly expressed in late steps of spermiogenesis, that it locates to the sperm flagellum, the annulus, and the midpiece, and that it is crucial for male fertility and sperm formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Adgb interacts with septin 10 (Sept10) and that co-localization is detectable within the sperm neck in stage 12 and stage 15 spermatids and within the annulus of stage 15 spermatids and mature sperm. Finally, <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest that Adgb contributes to Sept10 proteolysis in a CaM-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adgb knockout mice display male infertility</title><p>A gene-trap strategy, provided by the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Skarnes et al., 2011</xref>), was applied to target exons 13 and 14 of the <italic>Adgb</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The correct targeting of ESCs was verified first by long-range PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and second by Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The targeted <italic>Adgb</italic><sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup> allele (Adgb tm1a mice), generated on a C57BL/6N background, displays a gene-trap DNA cassette, which was inserted into the 12<sup>th</sup> intron of the <italic>Adgb</italic> gene. The gene trap consists of a splice acceptor site, an internal ribosome entry site, a β-galactosidase reporter sequence, and a neomycin resistance sequence. Breeding of Adgb tm1a mice with ubiquitously expressed CMV Cre-deleter mice allowed generation of mice deficient for exons 13 and 14 but still expressing the β-galactosidase reporter (Adgb tm1b mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, mating of Adgb tm1a mice with Flp-deleter mice enabled the generation of conditional floxed mice (Adgb tm1c) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These mice were further crossed with CMV Cre-deleter mice to generate the full knockout animals (Adgb tm1d) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that were used for all downstream applications if not otherwise stated. Genotyping was performed by regular PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and revealed no significant differences in the Mendelian distribution of offspring for Adgb tm1d animals following interbreeding of heterozygous parents (380 pups: +/+, n=101; +/-, n=168; -/-, n=111; Χ<sup>2</sup>=5.62, p&gt;0.05, ns). The genetic ablation of Adgb expression was further verified by reverse transcription (RT)-quantitative (q)PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). While female knockout mice displayed no fertility issues, male knockout mice never generated offspring, indicative for infertility. Full penetrance male infertility was also observed in homozygous tm1a and tm1b male mice, whereas homozygous tm1c animals showed normal fertility (data not shown). Accordingly, the testis weight was significantly reduced in knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Intratesticular testosterone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) as well as serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) remained comparable between wild type and knockouts. Stage-specific histological examination of seminiferous tubules of control animals revealed normal architecture, normal spermatogenic maturation steps, and the presence of mature sperm with flagella extending into the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, in knockout animals, despite the presence of meiotic events (stages X–XII, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), no flagella could be observed during the spermiation stage (stages VII–VIII, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The absence of mature sperm was accompanied by abnormally shaped heads, trapped stage 16 spermatids within the epithelium, and the presence of cytoplasmic material filling the lumen of the tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Within the cauda epididymis, knockout animals displayed accumulations of residual bodies, cytoplasmic material, shed germ cells, and occasional abnormally shaped sperm heads but an overall absence of mature sperm as compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). No differences were detected in knockout testes at mRNA levels of nitric oxide synthases 1–3 (<italic>Nos1-3</italic>) or superoxide dismutases 1–3 (<italic>Sod1-3</italic>), the ratio of <italic>Bax</italic>/<italic>Bcl2</italic> was unchanged compared to wild-type testes, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays on testis sections revealed no differences, suggesting no increase in oxidative stress or apoptotic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Validation of the knockout model and testicular phenotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative mRNA expression levels of <italic>Adgb</italic> in testes of wild-type (+/+) and knockout mice (-/-) (n=6 per genotype; p=0.000008).

Intriguingly, apart from the intact form of overexpressed SEPT10 at 60 kDa, increased levels of a lower band of 37 kDa were consistently detected in the presence of co-overexpressed ADGB in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Immunoblotting with a V5-antibody upon co-overexpression of a C-terminal V5-tagged SEPT10 with ADGB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) as well as the presence of this band upon SEPT10/ADGB co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) further supports its origin as proteolytic SEPT10 product. To investigate a potential oxygen-dependent influence of the globin domain, this experiment was repeated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (0.2% O<sub>2</sub>) but no differences were observed upon exposure to hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To determine a potential role of CaM, we constructed a deletion mutant lacking the IQ domain. Notably, transient overexpression of IQ-mutant ADGB resulted in considerably reduced appearance of the 37 kDa SEPT10 band relative to wild-type ADGB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and the same was observed with an ADGB protease domain deletion mutant, further supporting a CaM-dependent proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These findings prompted us to experimentally validate the suspected CaM-ADGB interaction. Whereas co-IP experiments following overexpression of full-length ADGB did not interact with CaM under basal experimental conditions in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), a truncated construct covering the globin and IQ domains displayed robust ADGB-CaM interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Consistently, MS analysis of proteins that were present in the IP of the overexpressed, isolated globin domain revealed a prominent enrichment of endogenous CaM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata5">Figure 6—source data 5</xref>). Importantly, individual or double mutation of the proximal histidine (HisF8) or distal glutamine (GlnE7), critical residues in the globin domain for heme coordination, did not alter the interaction, suggesting that the ADGB-CaM interaction occurs independently of heme incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). To fully exclude that the mutant globin domain might still be hemylated, we repeated these experiments under medium heme depletion and heme synthesis blocking conditions. Consistently, upon heme deprivation, robust interaction was observed between CaM and the isolated intact as well as double mutated (HisF8/GlnE7) globin domain. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). As an additional layer of support for the ADGB-CaM interaction, chimeric Gal4 DNA-binding domain and VP16 transactivation domain-based fusion constructs were generated for mammalian 2-hybrid (M2H) luciferase reporter gene assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). These M2H assays were performed in two different cell lines, HEK293 and A375, and revealed up to 7.5-fold increase in luciferase activity upon co-transfection of both chimeric proteins compared to single construct transfections, providing independent evidence that ADGB interacts with CaM. However, when full-length ADGB was employed in M2H assays with interchanged Gal4 and VP16 domains, no interaction with CaM was observed, corroborating the co-IP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To further assess the potential O<sub>2</sub>-dependency of the CaM-ADGB interaction, we repeated the M2H assays in A375 cells under hypoxic conditions. Exposure to hypoxic conditions (0.2% O<sub>2</sub>) did not alter luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, left panel), while luciferase activity of a 5’/3’-hypoxia response element-dependent <italic>EPO</italic> promoter-driven reporter gene increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, right panel), suggesting that the ADGB-CaM interaction is O<sub>2</sub> independent. Of note, while maintaining the O<sub>2</sub>-independent interaction between Gal4-CaM and VP16-globin, the single Gal4-CaM construct control was increased under hypoxic conditions, albeit to a much lesser extent than the <italic>EPO</italic> control, possibly related to increases of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilized from intracellular stores or by extracellular influx under hypoxic conditions and according activation of CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yuan et al., 2005</xref>). This result is consistent with the maintained ADGB-CaM interaction following mutation of critical residues in the globin domain in co-IP experiments and unchanged ADGB-dependent cleavage of SEPT10 under hypoxic conditions. Collectively, these <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest a scenario in which overexpressed ADGB proteolytically contributes to cleavage of overexpressed SEPT10 in an O<sub>2</sub>-independent but CaM-dependent manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>ADGB contributes to <italic>in vitro</italic> CaM-dependent SEPT10 cleavage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative immunoblots of ADGB and SEPT10 in protein lysates of HEK293 cells co-transfected with plasmids encoding SEPT10 and two dose-dependent amounts of full-length ADGB.

Our results demonstrate that Adgb is indispensable for proper sperm formation and male fertility. The absence of Adgb has profound deleterious effects on the elongation of spermatids, leading to multiple malformations of the sperm flagellum and head, as evidenced by the presence of various ultrastructural defects, including aberrant microtubule formation, misshaped heads with nuclear inclusions, defective manchette formation, and abnormal acrosomes. Notably, Adgb could be localized not only to the midpiece and sperm flagellum but also in the neck region (likely the centriole) and within the sperm annulus.</p><p>In principle, the observed male infertility could be the result of defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Unchanged LSH and LH levels indicate an intact HPG signaling and suggest the phenotypes represent direct (primary) effects of Adgb deficiency in testis. However, indirect effects cannot be entirely excluded despite normal serum levels of gonadotropins. Unchanged testicular testosterone levels are consistent with the total absence of Adgb expression in Leydig cells of wild-type mice.</p><p>Strikingly, upon LC-MS/MS interactome analysis after Adgb immunoprecipitation in testicular lysates, several members of the septin family of proteins ranked among the top hits. Septins are conserved GTPases that have the ability to form large oligomers and filamentous polymers and which associate with cell membranes and with the cytoskeleton. They serve as scaffolds for the proper localization of intracellular proteins via their diffusion barrier-forming characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dolat et al., 2014</xref>). In sperm, various septins (including Sept1, Sept4, Sept6, Sept7, and Sept12) have been localized to the sperm annulus, where they polymerize to a filamentous structure called the septin ring, forming a barrier between the midpiece and the principal piece of the spermatozoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Toure et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, despite several members of the septin family being present in the interactome, only Sept10 was found to interact with Adgb in co-IP experiments. Furthermore, the interaction of the two proteins could also be localized within the connecting piece and within the annulus in wild-type sperm, whereas in knockout sperm, only one signal was detected, suggesting the absence of the annulus. Indeed, when staining against Sept7 which interacts with Sept10, the annulus was either missing or failed to migrate properly in knockout sperm, supporting a defect in the annulus formation and migration, thereby also leading to misalignment of the mitochondria in knockout sperm. In accordance with this observation, two main functions have been proposed for the annulus: (1) a diffusion barrier function to compartmentalize different proteins to various locations in the sperm tail and (2) a growth guide function for the sperm flagellum and for aligning the mitochondria along the axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avidor-Reiss et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avidor-Reiss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Toure et al., 2011</xref>). Supportive of this function, <italic>Sept4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Sept12</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice are infertile and display disorganized sperm mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ihara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kissel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Sept4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice display a bent sperm tail and absence of annulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ihara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kissel et al., 2005</xref>), whereas <italic>Sept12</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice exhibit broken acrosomes, misshaped nuclei, and increased apoptosis of germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). Correspondingly, SEPT12 mutations have been described in infertile men displaying abnormal sperm including defective annulus with a bent tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, defective sperm head morphology and DNA integrity have recently been reported for two different SEPT14 missense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, another ring-like septin structure was recently described at the sperm neck, composed of Sept12 which complexes together with Sept1, Sept2, Sept10, and Sept11. Two mutations of Sept12 identified in patients disrupted the complex, leading to unstable head-tail junctions and defective connecting piece formation. Strikingly, the mutation of Sept12 and the subsequent disruption of the complex led to loss of Sept10 signal in the annulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shen et al., 2020</xref>) as also observed in Adgb-deficient mice. Accordingly, our data suggest an interdependence between Adgb and Sept10, which is required for the maintenance of the annulus, head shaping, and proper mitochondrial localization.</p><p>Sperm flagella and motile cilia, which are hair-like microtubular protrusions at the surface of various cell types, share numerous characteristics, not only in their structure but also in their regulation and growth, whereby septins have also been identified as components of cilia. Sept2 forms a diffusion barrier at the base of the cilium, impeding ciliary formation through loss of Sonic Hedgehog signaling when depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). Sept2/7/9 form a complex that associates with the ciliary axoneme, thereby regulating ciliary length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghossoub et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, septin association with the cytoskeleton and particularly with microtubular structures has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spiliotis and Nakos, 2021</xref>), and numerous other cilia-related proteins participate in sperm flagellum formation. Furthermore, most ciliopathies include male infertility and immotile sperm due to defective axonemal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Witman, 2014</xref>). Likewise, Adgb knockout mice display aberrant microtubule arrangements, thus it cannot be excluded that a scaffolding and simultaneous regulatory action between Adgb and Sept10 is necessary to support microtubular structure. Moreover, a recent study reported the consistent presence of Adgb in the ciliomes of three distinct evolutionary ancestral taxa, further suggesting a conserved function related to microtubular organization and likely flagella formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sigg et al., 2017</xref>). In line with this study, our recent <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations have demonstrated that Adgb is transcriptionally regulated by FoxJ1, a master regulator of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koay et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A robust ADGB-SEPT10 interaction was also detected by co-IP experiments in transiently co-transfected HEK293 cells. The interaction persisted despite various mutations of putative binding sites within ADGB, suggesting that the interaction occurs at different locations along the two proteins and that the proteins may entangle around each other. Indeed, it is not uncommon that protein-protein interactions involve multiple interaction surfaces, as referred to in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egri et al., 2022</xref>). Since ADGB contains multiple larger domains of uncharacterized function, it is conceivable that various sites could contribute to interaction with proteins. The close ADGB-SEPT10 interaction may serve as targeting mechanism for the proteolytic processing of SEPT10 that we could observe upon ectopic expression of both proteins. The unique chimeric domain structure of Adgb with an N-terminal calpain-like protease domain and the presence of an IQ motif suggests a CaM-mediated regulation. CaM-bound calcium represents a crucial activator of proteolytic activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calpain proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bähler and Rhoads, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Villalobo et al., 2019</xref>). An interesting observation in our study is the interaction of CaM and ADGB upon isolation of the globin domain but not with the full-length ADGB protein. The lack of interaction upon overexpression of a full-length ADGB might be due to interference by the larger protein (particularly the 700 amino acid long C-terminal region of unidentified origin). As such the globin domain might be liberated possibly by proteolytic cleavage. This hypothesis is consistent with our previous observations of time-dependent truncation of full-length ADGB from baculovirally infected <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9</italic>) insect cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bracke et al., 2018</xref>). Similar truncations are detected upon overexpression of full-length ADGB in HEK293 cells in the current study (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, this observation is consistent with the nature of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calpains, displaying frequent autolytic activation by auto-proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ermolova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Osako et al., 2010</xref>). Additional experiments would be required to prove these hypotheses. Importantly, the interaction between CaM and the ADGB IQ-binding motif, as well as presence of the calpain protease domain, seems pivotal in the observed proteolytic cleavage of SEPT10 as the cleavage product completely disappeared upon overexpression of either IQ or protease deletion constructs. Calpain-dependent proteolytic cleavage of septins is not unprecedented; it was shown that Sept5 is a substrate of both calpain-1 and calpain-2 in platelets, where the cleavage triggers secretion of chemokine-containing granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Randriamboavonjy et al., 2012</xref>). Septins are sensitive to molecular modifications, such as SUMOylation which impacts Sept6, 7, and 11-dependent filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ribet et al., 2017</xref>), or to PKA-dependent phosphorylation as reported for Sept12, leading to its dissociation from the septin complex and disruption of filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that CaM-dependent Adgb-mediated proteolytic cleavage of Sept10 may be a prerequisite for proper Sept10 function or localization within the sperm neck or annulus.</p><p>In conclusion, our study is the first to demonstrate a functional role for Adgb, the fifth mammalian globin. We present convincing <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that Adgb is required for murine spermatogenesis. Adgb is necessary for sperm head shaping and for proper microtubule and flagellum formation. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data illustrate CaM binding to ADGB and suggest that ADGB contributes to proteolytical cleavage of SEPT10 in a CaM-dependent manner. Our work provides a crucial contribution to the characterization of the physiological role of this novel enigmatic chimeric globin type.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals, ethics statement, and genotyping</title><p>All experimental procedures and animal maintenance followed Swiss federal guidelines, and the study was revised and approved by the ‘<italic>Service de la sécurité alimentaire et des affaires vétérinaires</italic>’ (SAAV) of the canton of Fribourg, Switzerland (license number 2017_16_FR).

Each gel lane was cut into six equal slices, the proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and the resulting peptide mixtures were processed on StageTips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rappsilber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>LC-MS/MS measurements were performed on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to an EASY-nLC 1000 nanoflow HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). HPLC-column tips (fused silica) with 75 µm inner diameter were packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 µm (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) to a length of 20 cm. A gradient of solvents A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile in water) with increasing organic proportion was used for peptide separation (loading of sample with 0% B; separation ramp: from 5 to 30% B within 85 min). The flow rate was 250 nL/min and for sample application 650 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode and switched automatically between MS (max. of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> ions) and MS/MS. Each MS scan was followed by a maximum of 10 MS/MS scans using normalized collision energy of 25% and a target value of 1000. Parent ions with a charge state form z=1, and unassigned charge states were excluded from fragmentation. The mass range for MS was m/z=370–1750. The resolution for MS was set to 70,000 and for MS/MS to 17,500. MS parameters were as follows: spray voltage 2.3 kV; no sheath and auxiliary gas flow; ion-transfer tube temperature 250°C. The MS raw data files were uploaded into the MaxQuant software version 1.6.2.10 for peak detection, generation of peak lists of mass error corrected peptides, and for database searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>). A full-length UniProt mouse (based on UniProt FASTA version April 2016) or human database (UniProt FASTA version March 2016) additionally containing common contaminants, such as keratins and enzymes used for in-gel digestion, was used as reference. Carbamidomethylcysteine was set as fixed modification and protein amino-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. Three missed cleavages were allowed, enzyme specificity was trypsin/P, and the MS/MS tolerance was set to 20 ppm. The average mass precision of identified peptides was in general less than 1 ppm after recalibration. Peptide lists were further used by MaxQuant to identify and relatively quantify proteins using the following parameters: peptide and protein false discovery rates (FDRs), based on a forward-reverse database, were set to 0.01, minimum peptide length was set to 7, minimum number of peptides for identification and quantitation of proteins was set to one which must be unique.

protein, are infertile and have defects in late stage spermatogenesis. The revisions are thorough and the inclusion of additional data makes the manuscript solid. The lack of defects at the hypothalamus-pituitary level makes the phenotype more striking as a direct effect of the mutation at the testis level. Overall, this revised version is significantly improved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72374.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>T Rajendra</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03wmf1y16</institution-id><institution>University of Colorado</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Gilles-Gonzales</surname><given-names>Marie-Alda</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.09.16.460596">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.16.460596v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The distinction between primary versus secondary effects of loss of andrglobin are not well-detailed, the global knockout model could have defects in the hypothalamus and pituitary or even testis levels and these may result in secondary phenotypes, sperm flagellar structural integrity in term so microtubule arrangements has not been described and the rationale for many of the experiments is not clearly described.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Th introduction is a disaster as if it was written by a layperson who does not know much about spermatogenesis and male fertility. Almost all statements in this section are inaccurate or maybe totally wrong. References are not accurately cited, and the main messages of those papers cited were mostly misinterpreted. Here are some examples: (1) lines 40-41: logically confusing? Sperm elongation is part of haploid cell differentiation/spermiogenesis, which is also part of the male germ cell differentiation/spermatogenesis. The authors need to consult an expert on spermatogenesis. (2) Lines 42-44: SSC renewal is not like what is described here!! Again, true experts need to be consulted. (3) Lines 44-45: Wrong! Spermatogonia proliferate to multiply themselves. Primary spermatocytes are derived from type B spermatogonia when the meiotic program is turned on. (4) Lines 47-49: This is completely wrong! The chromatoid body (CB) only represents an RNA processing center. Where did you get the idea that CBs stored materials required for spermatid development? Spermatid maturation is a wrong term. (5) Lines 50-53: Spermiogenesis is a spermatid differentiation process. Maturation is a wrong term. (6) Lines 55-56: How do &quot;these different steps lead to male fertility&quot;? Lines 59-61: Thousands of genes have been identified to be essential for the three phases of spermatogenesis. Why do you say these are all &quot;unknown&quot;? To an investigator working on spermatogenesis for decades, this is beyond insulting! (7) Lines 87-88: It sounds like the events in spermiogenesis are following some orders or sequential. This is simply not true. The introduction must be rewritten completely.</p><p>3. Page 7, line 115: Decreased testosterone levels are very rare in KOs with only disruptions in late spermiogenesis. This finding suggests that the HPT axis is messed up probably due to defects in the hypothalamus and/or pituitary in the global Adgb KO mice. For this reason, levels of FSH, LH, and testicular T levels must be measured and presented. If brain defects are identified, then the testicular/sperm phenotype may represent secondary effects; therefore, a conditional KO line is needed to exclude the contributions from brain defects in the global KO mice.</p><p>4. Lines 116-123: PAS staining is needed to accurately determine the stages of the seminiferous epithelial cycle. In Figure 1F, WT and KO sections are not from the same stages and thus, not comparable at all. What is a cell bulge?? The terminologies used are non-standard.</p><p>5. Lines 126-129: Why not using TUNEL to detect apoptotic germ cells? Dysregulation of apoptosis-related mRNAs does not mean apoptosis.</p><p>6. Lines 149-155: Based on the stages, one can accurately map the expression of Adgb mRNA and protein to specific cell types in the seminiferous epithelium. By doing so, the onset of mRNA and protein can be determined. The delayed translation is an important feature of gene regulation during spermiogenesis, and this gene apparently displays a delayed translation.</p><p>7. Lines 167-169: Since this gene has been shown to be implicated in ciliogenesis, the focus should be put on sperm flagella formation. Is the 9+2 microtubule structure normal in the KO sperm? How about outer dense fibers? Since sperm tails start to form at step 9, the TEM analyses should be focused on tubules from stages IX and X. The sections from WT and KO were not from the same stages and thus, non-comparable!!!</p><p>8. Lines 183-185: Is this gene expressed in Leydig cells? How come disruptions of elongated spermatids cause decreased levels of T?</p><p>9. Lines 215-216: Immunofluorescence should be performed using intact testis sections, not isolated elongating spermatids because the structural integratory and cellular context are all lost.</p><p>10. Discussion is too long and unfocused. The most important problems were not discussed, e.g., what disruptions are specific to Adgb ablation? What are the primary defects? And what are the secondary defects? how does ablation Adgb lead to the structural defects observed? If through Septins, then how?</p><p>11. Lines 415-416: Sept10 KO is needed to draw this conclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript of Keppner et al. is a novel preliminary characterization of a testes specific noncanonical globin protein called Androglobin. This work builds off of the authors prior findings over the last decade on the androglobin gene, generating the first Adgb knockout mouse model to explore its physiological functions. Herein they convincingly demonstrate that the loss of Adgb results a striking reproductive phenotype, where knockout male mice are infertile and azoospermic due to complete disruption of spermatid elongation and maturation. They attempt to explain how this phenotype may manifest in these mice and show that Adgb binds with a number of critical proteins for spermatogenesis including septins. However, the only mechanism they are able to implicate (primarily via in vitro over expression studies) is that Adgb may be capable of proteolytic cleavage of septins via a calmodulin dependent interaction. Though certainly an exciting theory, the reasoning and mechanisms behind these phenomena are unexplored and warrant further investigation.</p><p>Lines 193-200. The rationale for Adgb interaction specifically with Sept 10 is not provided. Does Adgb interact with the other Sept (2,7,11) found in the IP proteomics? In Line 209, what was the point of the deletion constructs because at the end all 3 domain deletions still interacted. So we are back to square-one. Was CaM identified in the proteomic experiments in the testes?</p><p>Line 171-185 RNAseq section – Specific GO terms p values or rank output for IPA analysis are not shown – these need to be included. At a minimum the top 10 GO terms from IPA with their consensus fold direction would be highly informative. Would also be illustrative and helpful to the reader for the authors to label and highlight individual genes with the largest fold changes that are hyper significant in the figure S1A volcano plot.</p><p>Line 194-195 The rational for Sept10 is a pretty weak statement, what about other proteins like Tprn or Mkl2 which are more specific and abundant? Even Spef2 (sperm flagellar protein) would have been much more interesting given phenotype observed. Authors should either elaborate further or modify.</p><p>Lines 214-227 For IFs of spermatids figure 5, in general localization of Adgb from images is difficult to appreciate, appears to be a large amount of unspecific staining. At a minimum, KO spermatids should be used as a negative control for early stage (s7, 12) as they are still present and will help clarify (2nd only panel is not sufficient, will never see any signal and you have not shown those same stages). Additionally, subpanel B does not enhance the figure substantially given that the sperm are already unhappy at this point. Perhaps show CoxIV staining at earlier stages than mature epididymal sperm.</p><p>Line 240 The introduction of calmodulin requires more explanation or background, it is only mentioned in the introduction when discussing Adgb's structure once as a putative motif and then becomes a major focus for the rest of the manuscript and discussion.</p><p>Of note, Figure 6D is one of the most striking pieces of data in the entire manuscript, very nice! But how does ADGB perform this function? Does this occur through its N-terminal protease domain?</p><p>Lines 244-247 Why does the full length not interact and why is the data not show? Authors should comment on this further, additionally the data shown from the interaction with the truncated globin gfp is not convincing that this is a &quot;robust&quot; interaction and needs to be supported by the expression of V5 calmodulin alone control which is absent from figure 6E.</p><p>Lines 250-252 Experiments from figures 6F and S10 are nicely done but what happens when you modify heme content? Deplete heme from the media or block heme synthesis? How do you know these mutant truncated globins aren't still hemylated? And what happens when you make these same mutations in the full length Adgb? All these results demonstrate is that these specific constructs still interact in vitro… it is not indicative that heme coordination is expendable.</p><p>Lines 259-263 and figure 6 legend describing the mammalian-2 hybrid assays under normoxic or hypoxic conditions – the authors claim exposure to hypoxia does not alter the luciferase reporters. However, in the legend they state that they do not include the Gal4-CaM alone control condition because of its hypoxic regulation. How then is this a good model system? And how do the authors explain the single transfection alone being modulated by hypoxia but the dual expression not? If anything, it is an essential control, particularly in comparison to the Epo construct they have used as a hypoxic positive control. This data should not be omitted and should be shown and explained/interpreted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72374.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have generated novel plasmids for SEPT2, SEPT7 as well as SEPT11 and performed reciprocal co-IP experiments following transfection and overexpression of these constructs. We also included SEPT12 in these assays as SEPT12 complexes together with SEPT7 and SEPT2, and SEPT12 have been shown to be crucial for septin ring/sperm annulus formation (Kuo et al., 2015, <italic>J. Cell Sci.</italic> 128, 923–934; Shen et al., 2017, <italic>PLoS Genet.</italic> 13(3): e1006631). Whereas these experiments illustrate lack of interaction between Adgb and all septins other than Sept10, we could convincingly confirm the interaction between SEPT7 and SEPT10 by reciprocal co-IP, further substantiating that Sept10 is the prime interactor of Adgb (Figure 4-Figure suppl. 3). These additional experiments argue as well in favor of proceeding with Sept10 for downstream experiments.</p><p>Multiple Adgb deletion constructs were used to delineate the interaction domain. However, instead of omitting these data, we prefer to fully report them. We believe that these findings underscore the robustness of the interaction, possibly via the multiple large domains of uncharacterized function present in ADGB. Indeed, it is not so uncommon that protein-protein interactions involve multiple interaction surfaces. Moreover, the finding that ADGB interacts both via its N- and C-terminal part with SEPT10 (Figures 4D, E) is an interesting observation that may possibly be of mechanistic relevance. Exploring the functional significance of this complex interaction pattern will be the subject of a follow-up study.</p><p>CaM was identified by MS in testis lysates following ADGB co-IP, but only at very low enrichment over the control. However, endogenous CaM was more robustly detected by MS in HEK293 cells following overexpression of the ADGB globin domain. This finding is consistent with the detection of exogenous CaM binding to the overexpressed globin domain only, liberated from the full-length protein impeding the interaction between CaM and ADGB, as referred to below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 171-185 RNAseq section – Specific GO terms p values or rank output for IPA analysis are not shown – these need to be included.

For reasons of consistency and as a fully independent approach we also performed mammalian 2-hybrid experiments. To exclude potential bias in VP16- or Gal4-tags we generated reciprocal fusion proteins for this experiment. These additional experiments with VP16-ADGB full-length and Gal4-CaM as well as with Gal4-ADGB full-length and VP16-CaM confirmed the lack of interaction between full-length ADGB and CaM (Figure 6-Figure suppl. 2B).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that more explanation is required. We hypothesize that the lack of interaction upon overexpression of full-length fusion proteins, is due to interference by the larger protein (particularly the larger 700 amino acid long C-terminal region of unidentified origin) and that the globin domain might be liberated possibly by proteolytic cleavage. This hypothesis is consistent with our finding of time-dependent truncation of full-length ADGB from baculovirally infected <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (<italic>Sf9</italic>) insect cells (Bracke et al., 2018, <italic>Anal. Biochem</italic> 543:62-70) as well as e.g. upon overexpression of full-length ADGB in HEK293 cells, resulting in several bands of lower molecular weight (e.g. Figure 6A). Furthermore, this observation is consistent with the nature of calpains which display frequent auto-proteolysis for activation of their protease functionality. We have adapted the text accordingly by adding a paragraph in the discussion. We believe that the central message of the manuscript would not benefit from even further experiments on this subject.</p><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for the remark on the V5-calmodulin-alone control, which is actually present (as evidenced by a band in the input middle lane) but was unfortunately mislabeled in Figure 6E. We have corrected this error in Figure 6E. Similarly, in Figure 6F and Figure 6-Figure suppl. 4 (as well as in new Figure 6-Figure suppl. 2A, Figure 6-Figure suppl. 5D and Figure 6-Figure suppl. 5E) the correctly labeled V5-calmodulin-alone control is consistently present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 250-252 Experiments from figures 6F and S10 are nicely done but what happens when you modify heme content? Deplete heme from the media or block heme synthesis? How do you know these mutant truncated globins aren't still hemylated? And what happens when you make these same mutations in the full length Adgb? All these results demonstrate is that these specific constructs still interact in vitro… it is not indicative that heme coordination is expendable.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comment of the reviewer. To address this query, we have now performed experiments under heme depletion and heme synthesis blocking conditions. Despite regulated expression levels of several MMP genes (MMP1, MMP9 and MMP13), the ADGB-CaM interaction was maintained, further substantiating the robustness of our results. These additional experiments are integrated in Figure 6-Figure suppl. 5 and we have reported these observations now in the Results section. As mentioned above, full-length ADGB likely interferes with CaM binding. Therefore, we did not attempt to perform these experiments upon mutation of the full-length protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 259-263 and figure 6 legend describing the mammalian-2 hybrid assays under normoxic or hypoxic conditions – the authors claim exposure to hypoxia does not alter the luciferase reporters. However, in the legend they state that they do not include the Gal4-CaM alone control condition because of its hypoxic regulation. How then is this a good model system? And how do the authors explain the single transfection alone being modulated by hypoxia but the dual expression not? If anything, it is an essential control, particularly in comparison to the Epo construct they have used as a hypoxic positive control. This data should not be omitted and should be shown and explained/interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestion we have re-inserted the single Gal4-CaM control in Figure 6H. Several studies reported that low oxygen levels result in an increase of cytoplasmic calcium mobilized from intracellular stores or by extracellular influx, which leads to the activation of calmodulin and its downstream effectors (Arnould et al., 1992, <italic>J. Cell. Physiol.</italic> 152, 215-221; Jung et al., 2010, <italic>J. Biol. Chem.</italic> 285, 25867-25874; Kanatous et al., 2009, <italic>Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol.</italic> 296, C393-402; Soderling and Stull, 2001, <italic>Chem. Rev.</italic> 101, 2341-2352; Stull, 2001, <italic>J. Biol. Chem.</italic> 276, 2311-2312). Moreover, Yuan and colleagues have shown a pronounced and significant response using an HRE-luciferase construct under hypoxic conditions, which was inhibited by increasing doses of the calmodulin inhibitor W-7 (Yuan et al., 2005, <italic>J. Biol. Chem.</italic> 280, 4321-4328). Similarly, in our experiment we observed a significantly increased luciferase activity with overexpressing calmodulin alone under normoxic vs. hypoxic conditions, whereas there was no difference for the globin alone. Furthermore, in the presence of 300 ng of Gal4-CaM and 500 ng of VP16-globin domain expression vectors under hypoxic conditions, we still observed an augmented signal as compared to calmodulin alone, albeit not significant. The luciferase reporter gene-based mammalian-2 hybrid technique is generally seen as a sensitive approach and one of the advantages is its quantifiability. The <italic>EPO</italic> gene is a strong hypoxia-inducible control and the Gal4-CaM-alone control is only moderately induced in comparison to <italic>EPO</italic>. We are convinced that this result does not influence our conclusion. Due to the comment by reviewer 2 on the length of the discussion, and because we do not believe that this is a central message of our paper, we have not elaborated on this effect in the discussion, apart from referring to it explicitly in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
