The microtubule cytoskeleton is known to play various essential roles in this morphogenetic process. While many microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been demonstrated to participate in neuronal morphogenesis, the function of many more remains to be determined. This study focuses on a MAP called HMMR in mice, which was originally identified as a hyaluronan binding protein and later found to possess microtubule and centrosome binding capacity. HMMR exhibits high abundance on neuronal microtubules and altering the level of HMMR significantly affects the morphology of neurons. Instead of confining to the centrosome(s) like cells in mitosis, HMMR localizes to microtubules along axons and dendrites. Furthermore, transiently expressing HMMR enhances the stability of neuronal microtubules and increases the formation frequency of growing microtubules along the neurites. HMMR regulates the microtubule localization of a non-centrosomal microtubule nucleator TPX2 along the neurite, offering an explanation for how HMMR contributes to the promotion of growing microtubules. This study sheds light on how cells utilize proteins involved in mitosis for non-mitotic functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>+tips</kwd><kwd>branching</kwd><kwd>nucleation</kwd><kwd>outgrowth</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020950</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSTC 111-2320-B-A49-015-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002701</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Intelligent Drug Systems and Smart Bio-devices (IDS2B)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The protein hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor interacts with microtubules to enhance their stability and recruits TPX2 to promote microtubule emanation in neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals interact with the environment through a highly intricate and organized network of interconnected cells. This network, known as the nervous system, is based on cells called neurons that are able to convey signals electrically and chemically. Neurons are also highly polarized with signal outputting compartments called axons that can extend over a meter in length and signal inputting compartments called dendrites that make the most elaborate tree branches pale in comparison. To develop such a complex and polarized morphology, neurons go through a stereotypical morphogenetic process which was initially observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>). Like other cellular processes in which a polarized morphology is established and maintained, neuronal morphogenesis relies on the interplay between different cytoskeletons. The microtubule cytoskeleton in particular is involved in most if not all aspects of the neuronal morphogenetic process. Microtubules are dynamic biopolymers that can undergo polymerization and depolymerization through the addition and removal of Î±- and Î²-tubulin heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>). In addition to tubulin heterodimers that make up the bulk of microtubules, a collection of proteins called microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) also regulate the dynamic nature of this cytoskeleton and play crucial roles in the morphogenesis of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conde and CÃ¡ceres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Poulain and Sobel, 2010</xref>). To better understand the role of MAPs in establishing and maintaining the neuronal morphology, we surveyed the microtubule-associated proteome in neurons using affinity purification and quantitative proteomics (Hwang et al., unpublished data). Surprisingly, hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR), also known as receptor for hyaluronan mediated motility (RHAMM) or intracellular hyaluronic acid binding protein (IHABP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 1998</xref>), is among the most abundant MAPs on neuronal microtubules. HMMR was originally identified as a hyaluronan-binding protein from the murine fibroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turley et al., 1987</xref>). HMMR-targeting antibodies have since been used to demonstrate the involvement of surface-localized HMMR in hyaluronan-dependent motility in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardwick et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pilarski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Samuel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Savani et al., 1995</xref>). More recent data demonstrate that HMMR is also an intracellular protein and interacts with the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Assmann et al., 1998</xref>). In agreement with its role as a MAP, HMMR has also been shown to interact with other MAPs such as the microtubule motor dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>) and the microtubule nucleator TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, HMMR plays crucial roles in microtubule assembly near the chromosomes and at the spindle poles, spindle architecture, as well as mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>). While the association of HMMR with microtubules is well documented in mitotic cells, very little is known about this interaction in non-mitotic cells. <italic>Hmmr</italic> mRNA has been shown to highly expressed in the proliferative regions of the nervous system in both developing amphibian and murine embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of HMMR protein in the adult brain and in dissociated primary neurons have also been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lindwall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagy et al., 1995</xref>). Furthermore, HMMR is essential for proper mitotic spindle orientation in neural progenitor cells and the appropriate formation of various brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2017</xref>). These observations demonstrate a crucial mitosis function of HMMR in neural progenitor cells. However, the function of HMMR extends beyond mitosis in neurons. Using antibodies targeting the cell surface HMMR or peptides mimicking hyaluronan binding domain of HMMR, it has been shown that HMMR is involved in neurite extension in primary neurons and intraocular brainstem transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nagy et al., 1998</xref>). These findings indicate that HMMR plays important roles in the nervous tissue and in non-mitotic neurons. However, whether HMMR exerts any effect on the microtubule cytoskeleton in neurons remains unexplored.</p><p>In this study, the function of HMMR in non-mitotic neurons is examined without any preconception regarding its localization. Using the shRNA-mediated depletion, HMMR knockdown negatively impacts the morphology of primary neurons. These morphological phenotypes include the decrease of axon and dendrite length as well as the reduction of axon branching complexity. The opposite phenotypes are observed in neurons transiently expressing <italic>Hmmr</italic>. Both endogenous and exogenous HMMR localizes to the microtubule cytoskeleton and exhibit punctate distribution along the neurites. In addition to its microtubule localization, HMMR is observed to enhance the stability and promote the formation of neuronal microtubules. We also found that the effect of HMMR on microtubule formation is due to its role in recruiting the microtubule nucleator TPX2 onto the microtubules. This work demonstrates that HMMR regulates the dynamics of microtubules independent of its mitotic function or its role on the centrosome in non-mitotic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HMMR regulates neuronal morphogenesis</title><p>To examine the role of HMMR in non-mitotic neurons, <italic>Hmmr</italic>-targeting shRNA was utilized to knock down <italic>Hmmr</italic> in mouse hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal neurons were selected because they exhibit a high morphological homogeneity, it has been estimated that 85~90% of hippocampal neurons are pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banker and Goslin, 1998</xref>). Three different shRNA sequences were used for depleting <italic>Hmmr</italic> in mouse neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Upon HMMR depletion, a significant decrease in total neurite length, axon length, dendrite length, and axon branch density can be detected in dissociated hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâE</xref>). To eliminate the possibility of the off-target effect, we performed the rescue experiment by co-transfecting plasmids expressing human HMMR (EGFP-hHMMR) and <italic>Hmmr</italic>-targeting shRNA into hippocampal neurons at 0 days in vitro (DIV) and incubated for 4 days before fixation and immunofluorescence staining.

These functional analyses demonstrate that HMMR plays an important role in regulating the morphogenetic processes in non-mitotic neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HMMR is a microtubule-associated protein in neurons</title><p>To understand the cellular mechanism of HMMR in regulating neuronal morphogenesis, the localization of HMMR in neurons was examined. The HMMR antibody was first validated using shRNA-mediated HMMR depletion in neurons. A significant decrease in HMMR immunofluorescence signal was observed in the soma and along the neurites in HMMR-depleted neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), confirming the specificity of the HMMR antibody. Using this antibody, HMMR is detected along the entire neuron with higher abundance in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Upon careful examination, we found that both the endogenous HMMR and transiently expressed AcGFP-mHMMR shows punctate localization along the axon and dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref>). Furthermore, when transiently overexpressed AcGFP-mHMMR reaches a high abundance level, it colocalizes with microtubules and sometimes causes the formation of looped microtubules in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Given that HMMR is known to interact with microtubules in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maxwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tolg et al., 2010</xref>), we examined whether the same interaction exists in neurons using the proximity ligation assay (PLA). We first examined whether the endogenous HMMR interacts with microtubules in neurons. Antibodies against HMMR and neuron-specific Î²-III-tubulin were used in this PLA. If the two primary antibodies are localized in close proximity (&lt;40ânm), an enzymatic reaction will catalyze the amplification of a specific DNA sequence that can then be detected using a red fluorescent probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">SÃ¶derberg et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with the idea that HMMR associates with neuronal microtubules, fluorescent PLA punta can be detected in the soma and along the neurite in 3 DIV hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These fluorescent PLA puncta can only be observed when both primary antibodies were present, indicating that these PLA signals are highly specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, AcGFP-mHMMR-expressing plasmid was transfected into dissociated mouse hippocampal neurons at 0 DIV and incubated for 3 days before fixation and PLA. Antibodies against AcGFP and Î²-III-tubulin were selected for this PLA. Consistent with the result using endogenous HMMR, fluorescent PLA puncta can be observed in the soma and along the neurite in 3 DIV primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). PLA signals can only be observed when both GFP and Î²-III-tubulin antibodies were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>).

While the addition of nocodazole causes a concentration-dependent reduction of total neurite length in both AcGFP and AcGFP-mHMMR expressing neurons, there are subtle differences in the susceptibility of neurite length to the concentration of nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). (1) 10 nM nocodazole treatment causes a significant reduction of neurite length in AcGFP expressing-neurons, but not in AcGFP-mHMMR-expressing neurons. This result indicates that AcGFP-mHMMR expression increases the tolerance of neurite elongation toward 10 nM nocodazole treatment. (2) 50 nM and 100 nM nocodazole treatment exhibits no statistical significance in AcGFP-expressing neurons, suggesting that 50 nM nocodazole has reached maximal effectiveness. In AcGFP-mHMMR expressing neurons, 100 nM nocodazole further reduces the neurite length compared to the 50 nM group.

To investigate this, we utilized the neuronal microtubule dynamics assay previously established in which EB3-mCherry is utilized as a fiduciary marker of growing microtubule plus-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). The rationale is that changes in microtubule dynamics can be detected as alterations in the velocity (or the speed of microtubule polymerization), persistence (the duration of time when EB3-mCherry comet can be followed), and/or frequency (the number of EB3-mCherry comets detected in a given time span). Plasmids expressing <italic>Hmmr</italic>-targeting shRNA and EB3-mCherry were introduced into dissociated neurons at 0 DIV and incubated for 4 days before ï¬uorescence live cell imaging. To quantify microtubule dynamics, the neurite was separated into three different 10 âÎ¼m regions: proximal, middle, and distal neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These 3 regions were selected because of our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), in which a significant reduction of EB3 frequency was detected at the tip and the base of the neurite but not in the middle of the neurite in the microtubule nucleator (TPX2) depleted neurons. The reason for this difference is due to the presence of GTP-bound Ran GTPase (RanGTP) at the tip and the base of the neurite. Since RanGTP has been shown to regulate the interaction between HMMR and TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that the same regulation mechanism exists in neurons. HMMR depletion results in a decrease of EB3-mCherry emanation frequency in all three neurite regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâC</xref>). Moreover, a trend of increased microtubule polymerization velocity and a trend of decreased persistence are observed in the proximal neurite of HMMR-depleted neurons. Next, we examined whether opposite effects on microtubule dynamics can be detected in HMMR overexpressing neurons. Plasmids expressing AcGFP-mHMMR and EB3-mCherry were introduced into dissociated neurons at 0 DIV and incubated for 4 days before ï¬uorescence live cell imaging and microtubule dynamics assay. Congruent with the depletion results, a significant increase in EB3-mCherry emanation frequency is observed at the proximal, middle, and distal neurites in HMMR-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâE</xref>). Further agreement comes from the decrease in microtubule polymerization velocity and the increase of microtubule persistence in neurons overexpressing HMMR. Both the decrease in microtubule polymerization velocity and the increase in microtubule persistence are consistent with the observation that HMMR can enhance the stability of neuronal microtubules. These data demonstrate that HMMR regulates the dynamics of microtubules in neurons.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) regulates the dynamics of neuronal microtubules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative image of a 4 DIV EB3-mCherry-expressing cortical neuron.

One explanation is that HMMR influences the function of another microtubule dynamics regulator in neurons. It has been shown that HMMR interacts with the microtubule nucleator TPX2 in a cell cycle-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maxwell et al., 2005</xref>) and this interaction is required for concentrating TPX2 at the spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groen et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that microtubule-bound TPX2 localizes along the neurite and is responsible for non-centrosomal microtubule formation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Combining these two observations, we hypothesized that HMMR affects the localization of TPX2 along the neurite which in turn regulates the formation of neuronal microtubules. To examine this hypothesis, the localization of TPX2 along the neurite was examined in neurons with or without HMMR depletion. Since the abundance of TPX2 along the neurite is rather low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), PLA was utilized to detect this localization of TPX2. PLA using antibodies against TPX2 and Î²-III-tubulin produces numerous puncta along the neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This punctate distribution appears similar to that produced by HMMR and Î²-III-tubulin PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, a statistically significant increase in PLA inter-punctal distance (the distance between PLA puncta) is detected in both axons and dendrites of HMMR-depleted neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâC</xref>). This result indicates that HMMR depletion reduces the localization of TPX2 on neuronal microtubules. These fluorescent PLA puncta can only be observed when both primary antibodies were present, indicating that these PLA signals are highly specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Next, the effect of HMMR overexpression on TPX2 localization is examined. Plasmids expressing AcGFP-mHMMR were introduced into hippocampal neurons on 0 DIV and incubated for 7 days before fixation and PLA. In agreement with the depletion experiment, a significant decrease in PLA inter-punctal distance is observed in HMMR overexpressing axon and dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâG</xref>). This result indicates that HMMR overexpression enhances the localization of TPX2 on neuronal microtubules. PLA puncta can only be observed when both primary antibodies were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

Transient expression of HMMR promotes axon and dendrite elongation as well as enhances branch density, while depletion of HMMR produces the opposite phenotypes. Both endogenous and transiently expressed HMMR localize primarily to the microtubule cytoskeleton in neurons. The distribution of HMMR along the neurite has a punctate appearance but does not colocalize with the microtubule plus-ends. Using transient expression and shRNA-mediated depletion, it was discovered that HMMR enhances the stability and promotes the formation of neuronal microtubules. Finally, we show that HMMR regulates the recruitment of the microtubule nucleator TPX2 onto neuronal microtubules. These results demonstrate for the first time that HMMR plays an important role in regulating microtubules and morphogenesis in non-mitotic cells.</p><p>HMMR has been documented to be a hyaluronate-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turley et al., 1987</xref>) as well as a microtubule-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assmann et al., 1999</xref>). In more recent studies, HMMR is found to be associated with the centrosome in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>). It contains a central rod domain with coiled-coil structures flanked by two microtubule-binding domains at the N-terminus and a centrosome-targeting bZip motif at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maxwell et al., 2003</xref>). While numerous studies focus on the role of HMMR in mitotic cells, studies on non-mitotic neurons are scarce. It has been documented that neutralizing HMMR with a functional blocking antibody compromises neurite extension in cell lines and primary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagy et al., 1995</xref>). A similar neutralizing strategy was used to demonstrate that HMMR is involved in axon outgrowth in an intraocular transplantation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nagy et al., 1998</xref>). Our loss-of-function assay is consistent with these aforementioned publications. It has been shown that the <italic>Xenopus</italic> HMMR homolog XRHAMM bundles microtubules in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groen et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, deleting proteins which promote microtubule bundling (e.g. doublecortin knockout, MAP1B/MAP2 double knockout) leads to impaired neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bielas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Teng et al., 2001</xref>). These observations are consistent with our data that overexpressing HMMR leads to the increased axon and dendrite outgrowth, while depleting it results in the opposite phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition, our data indicate that the increase in microtubule stability is the main mechanism driving the enhanced neurite outgrowth in neurons overexpressing HMMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). It is worth noting that the elevated level of HMMR increases the branching density of axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) and promotes the formation of looped microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This is consistent with the observations that looped microtubules are often detected in regions of axon branching site prior to branch formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dent et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dent and Kalil, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Purro et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Using EB3-mCherry as a marker for growing microtubule plus-ends, we discovered that HMMR increases the amount of growing microtubules. These growing microtubules can either come from the de novo formation of microtubules or the repolymerization from paused or shrinking microtubules. The explanation for this increased number of growing microtubules lies in the observation that the localization of TPX2 (a branch microtubule nucleator) on microtubules is regulated by HMMR in neurons. This is consistent with previous publications showing that HMMR interacts with TPX2 and is required for concentrating TPX2 at the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maxwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>). Given that GTP-bound Ran (RanGTP) promotes the interaction between HMMR and TPX2 in the cell-free system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scrofani et al., 2015</xref>), it is tempting to hypothesize that RanGTP also regulates the HMMR-TPX2 interaction in neurons. It has previously been shown that cytoplasmic RanGTP promotes the formation of non-centrosomal microtubules at the neurite tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). This is due to the effect of RanGTP on releasing TPX2 from the inhibitory importin heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Our results suggest that the effect of cytoplasmic RanGTP on neuronal microtubules may come from recruiting TPX2 to the existing microtubules as well as enhancing its nucleator activity. It has been shown that compromising microtubule nucleation in neurons by SSNA1 mutant overexpression prevents proper axon branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, dendritic branching in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons depends on the orientation of microtubule nucleation. Nucleation that results in an anterograde microtubule growth leads to increased branching, while nucleation that results in a retrograde microtubule growth leads to decreased branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yalgin et al., 2015</xref>). These results demonstrate the importance of microtubule nucleation on neurite branching. It is conceivable that overexpressing a microtubule nucleation promoting protein such as HMMR results in an increase in axon branching complexity.</p><p>Neurons are the communication units of the nervous system. The formation of their intricate shape is, therefore, crucial for the physiological function. Alterations in neuronal morphogenesis have a profound impact on how nerve cells communicate, leading to a variety of physiological consequences. These consequences conceivably include impaired neural circuit formation and function, compromised signal transmission between neurons, as well as altered anatomical structure of the CNS. Depending on the specific type and location of the morphogenetically altered neurons, the physiological consequences can include neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkel et al., 2012</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goo et al., 2023</xref>), as well as learning and memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Winkle et al., 2016</xref>). However, due to the involvement of HMMR in mitosis, most HMMR mutations are associated with familial cancers in humans (based on ClinVar data).</p><p>Given the importance of HMMR on spindle integrity and orientation, studies of HMMR on neural development have largely focused on these aspects. It has been documented that neural progenitor cells from <italic>Hmmr</italic> knockout or C-terminal truncation mice exhibit misoriented spindle and consequently these animals develop either megalencephaly or microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Connell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Hmmr</italic> depletion in <italic>Xenopus</italic> showed defects in anterior neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prager et al., 2017</xref>). During CNS development, the anterior part of the neural tube closes and differentiates into the brain while the posterior part becomes the spinal cord. A series of cellular actions take place during the neural tube closure that includes polarization, migration, and intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikolopoulou et al., 2017</xref>). This failure in closing the anterior neural tube suggests an underlying defect in the microtubule cytoskeleton. Upon careful examination, interphase cells from the deep neural layer in <italic>Hmmr</italic> depleted embryos adopted a web-like microtubule organization instead of their typical linear microtubule organization. This data is consistent with our observation that HMMR plays a role in organizing the microtubule cytoskeleton in non-mitotic cells of the neural tissue. In support of this idea, <italic>Hmmr</italic> is amongst the highest expressed RNA in the corpus callosum relative to other tissues in adult humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rouillard et al., 2016</xref>). Because HMMR plays such a critical role in mitosis of neural progenitor cells, any loss-of-function <italic>Hmmr</italic> mutation in humans will likely result in embryonic lethality and prevent the observation of non-mitotic, microtubule-based phenotypes such as corpus callosum malformation or lissencephaly.

In this manuscript, the authors examine the phenotype of neurons following alteration in the level of the protein HMMR, a microtubule-associated protein with established roles in mitosis. Neurite morphology is measured as well as microtubule stability and dynamic parameters using standard assays. A binding partner of HMMR, TPX2, is localized. The results support a role for HMMR in neurons.</p><p>The work presented in this manuscript seeks to determine if a MAP called HMMR contributes to microtubule dynamics in neurons. Several steps, including validation of the RNAi, additional statistical analysis, use of cells at the same age in culture, and better documentation in figures, would increase the impact of the work.</p><p>In many places, the data can be improved which might make the story more convincing. As presented, the results show that HMMR is distributed as puncta on neurons with data coming from a single HMMR antibody, and some background staining that was not discussed. In the discussion the authors state that HMMR impacts microtubule stability, which was evaluated by the presence of post-translational modification and resistance to nocodazole; the data are suggestive but not entirely convincing. The discussion also states that HMMR increases the âamountâ of growing microtubules which was measured as the frequency of comet appearance. The authors did not comment on how the number of growing microtubules results in the observed morphological changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We actually tested several HMMR antibodies, including E-19 (Santa Cruz, sc-16170), EPR4054 (Abcam, ab124729), and a variety of antibodies provided by Prof. Eva Turley. E-19 performed the best in immunofluorescence (IF) staining and knockdown validation. The other antibodies either failed to detect HMMR in IF staining or generate excessive background signal. We understand that the final images are produced using a single antibody. But since we meticulous validated this antibody and that the localization of overexpressed HMMR is consistent with the endogenous HMMR, we are very confident about our data generated using this single antibody.</p><p>We have added the following paragraph in the Discussion section to elucidate how the number of growing microtubules result in the observed morphological changes such as an increase of axon branches:</p><p>âIt has been shown that compromising microtubule nucleation in neurons by SSNA1 mutant overexpression prevents proper axon branching (Basnet et al., 2018). Additionally, dendritic branching in <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory neurons depends on the orientation of microtubule nucleation. Nucleation that results in an anterograde microtubule growth leads to increased branching, while nucleation that results in a retrograde microtubule growth leads to decreased branching (Yalgin et al., 2015). These results demonstrate the importance of microtubule nucleation on neurite branching. It is conceivable that overexpressing a microtubule nucleation promoting protein such as HMMR results in an increase of branching complexity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The manuscript jumps extensively between main figures and supplementary figures.

The explanation is that the 3 DIV hippocampal neurons used for Figure 1G was cultured in low-density and in the presence of cortical neuron-conditioned neurobasal medium (as written in Methods, Neuron culture and transfection section). The low-density culture with minimal overlapping neurites allowed us to better quantify total neurite length, because neurons expressing AcGFP-mHMMR sprouted long and highly branched axons. However, the addition of cortical neuron-conditioned neurobasal medium promoted neurite elongation. This is the reason why the total neurite length of 4 DIV hippocampal neurons expressing non-targeting shRNA (Figure 1B) and that of 3 DIV hippocampal neurons expressing AcGFP (Figure 1G) is similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Groen et al. have shown that Hmmr also bundles microtubules, a mechanism that surely is important for neuronal microtubules.

In addition, deleting proteins which promote microtubule bundling (e.g., doublecortin knockout, MAP1B/MAP2 double knockout) leads to impaired neurite outgrowth (Bielas et al., 2007; Teng et al., 2001). These observations are consistent with our data that overexpressing HMMR leads to the increased axon and dendrite outgrowth, while depleting it results in the opposite phenotype (Figure 1).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Please explain why in Figure 4, cortical neurons were chosen for analysis and why and how the three different ROIs were picked.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer the question why we chose cortical neurons for the analyses in Figure 4, it will be important to explain why we used hippocampal neurons for other figures. Primary hippocampal neurons have a high homogeneity in terms of their morphology. This uniform morphology allows more consistent morphological quantification. Figure 4, however, does not involve morphological quantification. We are more confident to conclude that HMMR regulates microtubule dynamics if this effect can be detected in the relatively heterogeneous cortical neurons. These are the reasons why we chose to analyze cortical neurons in Figure 4.</p><p>In our previous publication (Chen et al., 2017), it was discovered that a significant reduction of EB3 emanation frequency can be detected at the tip and the base of the neurite but not in the middle of the neurite in TPX2-depleted neurons.

Since RanGTP has also been shown to regulate the interaction between HMMR and TPX2 in the cell-free system (Scrofani et al., 2015), it is possible that the same phenomenon can be observed in HMMR-depleted neurons.

A western blot of cell extracts from control and depleted cells is needed to verify that the protein level is reduced; alternatively, documentation of the reduction in RNA levels in treated cells could be provided.

This impression is not supported by the quantification. Are representative images shown? Additionally, the authors should report the values for each replicate of the experiment and compare the three averages rather than comparison of lengths from all measurements.

The supplemental figures (see S2 and S3) show evidence that HMMR is present in a punctate pattern by conventional immunofluorescence. This is reasonable evidence that the protein is in a linear pattern along cytoskeletal microtubules and that the signal is present in puncta. Please move this to the main text, perhaps replacing Figure 2A, which is low magnification and very hard to see the HMMR staining. Additionally, the level of overexpression of HMMR is not mentioned. Please address this; were cells with similar levels of overexpression selected? Did the result depend on the overexpression? A related issue is the DIV for the cells - some are examined earlier and some at later times; does this impact the results? Please provide information or perform experiments with consistent timing.

Nonetheless, we examined the effect of HMMR depletion on neuronal morphology on 3 DIV. The trend of reduced total neurite length, axon length, and dendrite length can be observed, but no statistical significance can be detected. We also examined the effect of HMMR overexpression on neuronal morphology on 4 DIV and did observe an increase of total neurite length, axon length, and dendrite length.

We also tested various fixation methods, including 37Â°C formaldehyde fixation, -20Â°C methanol fixation, 37Â°C formaldehyde followed by -20Â°C methanol fixation.

We did not quantitatively compare the PLA signals in Figure 2C and those in Figure S4. This is because the PLA signals in Figure 2C are generated using anti-HMMR (to detect endogenous HMMR) and anti-Î²-III-tubulin antibodies while those in Figure S4 are generated using anti-AcGFP (to detect overexpressed AcGFP-mHMMR) and anti-Î²-III-tubulin antibodies. Since the affinity of the two antibodies (i.e., anti-HMMR and anti-AcGFP) toward their antigens is different, comparing the PLA signals is not informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The images of the endogenous HMMR (Fig S3) and the PLA with tubulin and HMMR antibodies are not the same (2C). The &quot;dots&quot; in PLA are widely separated; gauging from the marker bar length of 50 Î¼m, the small clusters of dots are about 10 Î¼m apart. In Figure S3, the puncta are much more closely spaced, appearing almost in a linear fashion along the microtubules. Enlarging the PLA image shows that each dot is very small - just a few pixels - please provide additional explanation including the minimal detection limit for the method, and why the images differ. If the standard immunofluorescence signal was enhanced, for example with the use of two secondaries, what is observed? Is the distribution of HMMR similar for both dendrites and axons? Microtubule polarity differs in these locations, so greater attention to this point seems of interest. There is a significant amount of punctate HMMR in the cytoplasm (or outside the cytoplasm?) in Figure S5; this is concerning. Please outline the cell edge for ease of visualization. What is the distribution of HMMR in a cell that has been treated with cold and/or nocodazole to disassemble the microtubules? is the signal lost?</p></disp-quote><p>The reasons images of the endogenous HMMR (Figure S3) and the PLA with tubulin and HMMR antibodies (Figure 2C) differ are due to the following reasons. o PLA utilizes two primary antibodies to target two different epitopes on HMMR and Î²III-tubulin. It is conceivable that not every anti-HMMR antibody has the correct orientation and/or proximity (&lt;40 nm) toward the anti-Î²-III-tubulin antibody to enable DNA amplification. This results in the shortage of PLA puncta compared to immunofluorescence signals.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The creator of PLA has pointed out that in situ PLA is a method based upon equilibrium reactions and several enzymatic steps.

This is mainly because HMMR signal is strong enough to be detected using standard immunofluorescence staining.</p><p>Regarding the question âIs the distribution of HMMR similar for both dendrites and axons?â The reviewer raised a very important issue about the polarity difference of microtubules in axons (uniform) and dendrites (mixed). We were aware of such issue and very carefully examined the distribution and signal intensity of HMMR in axons vs dendrites. However, no differences were detected.</p><p>The reviewer mentioned that âthere is a significant amount of punctate HMMR in the cytoplasm (or outside the cytoplasm?) in Figure S5; this is concerning. Please outline the cell edge for ease of visualization.â Instead of outlining the cell edge, we have selected another image to facilitate the visualization of HMMR signals. There are indeed HMMR signals outside the cell. However, these outside signals are usually weaker and smaller in size compared to those inside the cell.</p><p>After the examination of neurons expressing AcGFP-mHMMR with or without 100 nM nocodazole treatment, we did not notice any difference of AcGFP-mHMMR in distribution. We did not examine the distribution and signal intensity of the endogenous HMMR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) To determine if HMMR alters microtubule stability, the authors examine the distribution of acetylated tubulin and resistance to nocodazole-induced microtubule disassembly. In Figure 3 please show immunofluorescence images of the acetylated tubulin staining, not just the ratio images; the color is not obviously different in the various panels shown. For statistical analysis, see the comment above for Figure 1. For the nocodazole experiment, a similar change in neurite length following drug treatment was observed (Figure 3H), for the experimental and control, even though the starting length was greater in the overexpressing cells. Please consider the possibility that in both cases the microtubules are only partially resistant to nocodazole and that HMMR is not changing the fraction of microtubules that are sensitive to the drug. The cells were treated at 3 DIV; the authors note that more stable microtubules accumulate with time; how does time in culture impact stability? Often, acute treatment with a high concentration of nocodazole is used to assay microtubule stability; here the authors used a low (nM) concentration for 2 days (chronic). Why not use a higher concentration (1-10 Î¼M) for a shorter incubation? The data show that overexpression of HMMR results in curved, buckled microtubules are these microtubules more acetylated and/or retained after nocodazole treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggested that we show immunofluorescence images of the acetylated tubulin staining, not just the ratio images. But we still believe showing the ratio images is the better approach. This is because the microtubules density can be different from neuron to neuron. Showing acetylated tubulin may provide a false impression when the overall microtubule density is higher or lower in a particular neuron. We realized that â16 colorsâ pseudo-color scheme has the cyan color at the lower intensity which can sometimes be confused with the white color at the higher intensity. Therefore, we changed the pseudocolor from â16 colorsâ to âfireâ for Figure 3B and 3E to better visualize these images so that they appear more consistent with the quantitative data.</p><p>The reviewer raised a very good question regarding the possibility that HMMR is not changing the fraction of microtubules that are sensitive to nocodazole. We re-conducted the same experiment and used a series of different nocodazole concentrations. While the addition of nocodazole causes a concentration-dependent reduction of total neurite length in both AcGFP and AcGFP-mHMMR expressing neurons, there are subtle differences in the susceptibility of neurite length to the concentration of nocodazole. (1) 10 nM nocodazole treatment causes a significant reduction of neurite length in AcGFP expressing neurons, but not in AcGFP-mHMMR expressing neurons. This result indicates that AcGFP-mHMMR expression increases the tolerance of neurite elongation toward 10 nM nocodazole treatment. (2) 50 nM and 100 nM nocodazole treatment exhibits no statistical significance in AcGFP expressing neurons, suggesting that 50 nM nocodazole has reached maximal effectiveness. In AcGFP-mHMMR expressing neurons, 100 nM nocodazole further reduces the neurite length compared to the 50 nM group. These results argue against the possibility that HMMR does not change the fraction of microtubules that are sensitive to nocodazole. We have revised Figure 3H accordingly.</p><p>The reviewer asked why we did not use the acute nocodazole treatment (Î¼M concentration) to assess the effect of Hmmr on microtubule stability. This is because we used the neurite length as an indicator for microtubule stability. That is why the chronic treatment was chosen to produce a more detectable effect on neurite length.</p><p>The reviewer asked whether the looped microtubules caused by HMMR overexpression are more acetylated and/or nocodazole resistant. While we do not have direct evidence to answer the reviewerâs question, we can deduce the answer from our observations. We noticed that looped microtubules are only present when HMMR is highly expressed (i.e., using lipofection to introduce HMMR-expressing plasmid) but not when HMMR is mildly expressed (i.e., using electroporation to introduce HMMR-expressing plasmid). From these observations, we can conclude that HMMR is more abundantly present on looped microtubules. Since HMMR overexpression leads to higher microtubule acetylation (Figure 3E), looped microtubules which contains more HMMR are most likely to be more acetylated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) An additional measure of microtubule dynamics is to measure the growth of microtubules using a live cell marker for microtubule plus ends. Such experiments were performed, using tagged EB3. The images are rather fuzzy. Parameters of microtubule dynamics were measured at three locations - is there data that the authors can cite about any differences in dynamics in control cells at these locations? They look very similar, so it is not clear why the different locations were used. It is not possible to learn much from the kymographs which look similar for all panels; I would remove these unless they can be changed or labeled to help the reader. Data is presented for three shRNA reagents. No data are presented to document the extent to which the protein is depleted with these reagents. This should be fixed. Alternatively, an RNAi pool could be utilized. Is there a control for off-target effects? For the analysis were all the comets used to generate the average values? What about a comparison of the average of each trial - not each comet?</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous publication (Chen et al., 2017), it was discovered that a significant reduction of EB3 emanation frequency can be detected at the tip and the base of the neurite but not in the middle of the neurite in TPX2-depleted neurons. The reason for this difference is due to the presence of RanGTP at the tip and the base of the neurite. Since RanGTP has also been shown to regulate the interaction between HMMR and TPX2 in the cell-free system (Scrofani et al., 2015), it is possible that the same phenomenon can be observed in HMMR-depleted neurons. This is why we examined those 3 ROIs in Figure 4.</p><p>We notice that photobleaching causes the EB3-mCherry signal to diminish at later time points, which made it difficult to observe the differences amongst kymographs.

In order to enhance the weak signal of TPX2 along the neurite, we actually needed to use PLA in that publication (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep42297/figures/3">https://www.nature.com/articles/srep42297/figures/3</ext-link>).</p><p>Proximity ligation assay (PLA) generates fluorescent signals based on a local enzymatic reaction which catalyzes the amplification of a specific DNA sequence that can then be detected using a red fluorescent probe. Because this enzymatic reaction is not linear, the amount of amplified DNA nor the intensity of the fluorescence does not correlate with the strength of the interaction (Soderberg et al., 2006). As a result, quantification of PLA is typically done by counting the number of fluorescent puncta per unit area or by calculating the area containing fluorescent signal (not signal intensity) per unit area in the case that PLA signals are too strong and coalesced. That is why our quantification is based on the distance between PLA fluorescent puncta, not the fluorescent signal intensity.</p><p>References</p><p>Basnet, N., H. Nedozralova, A.H. Crevenna, S.
