interneurons. Myelination is discontinuous along interneuron axons and the mechanisms controlling myelin patterning and segregation of ion channels at the nodes of Ranvier have not been elucidated. Protein 4.1B is implicated in the organization of the nodes of Ranvier as a linker between paranodal and juxtaparanodal membrane proteins to the spectrin cytoskeleton. In the present study, 4.1B KO mice are used as a genetic model to analyze the functional role of myelin in Lhx6-positive parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) neurons, two major classes of GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus. We show that 4.1B-deficiency induces disruption of juxtaparanodal K<sup>+</sup> channel clustering and mislocalization of nodal or heminodal Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Strikingly, 4.1B-deficiency causes loss of myelin in GABAergic axons in the hippocampus. In particular, stratum oriens SST cells display severe axonal dysmyelination and a reduced excitability. This reduced excitability is associated with a decrease in occurrence probability of small amplitude synaptic inhibitory events on pyramidal cells. In contrast, stratum pyramidale fast-spiking PV cells do not appear affected. In conclusion, our results indicate a class-specific effect of dysmyelination on the excitability of hippocampal interneurons associated with a functional alteration of inhibitory drive.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myelin</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>GABAergic interneurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007379</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour l'Aide à la Recherche sur la Sclérose en Plaques</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoc fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pinatel</surname><given-names>Delphine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007379</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour l'Aide à la Recherche sur la Sclérose en Plaques</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karagogeos</surname><given-names>Domna</given-names></name><name><surname>Faivre-Sarrailh</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dysmyelination of GABAergic hippocampal interneurons causes mislocalization of axonal ionic channels and disturbs their intrinsic physiological properties, suggesting that it may contribute to cognitive deficits observed in multiple sclerosis patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent reports have established that subtypes of GABAergic neurons could be myelinated. Indeed, a substantial fraction of myelin, both in mouse and human neocortex, belongs to inhibitory neurons by comparison with pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>). Long-range projecting hippocampal GABAergic neurons are myelinated and play a role in the synchronization among distant brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Melzer et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, locally projecting interneurons such as the parvalbumin (PV) cells are frequently myelinated, independently of their morphological subtypes (i.e. basket, axo-axonic, or bi-stratified) in the mouse hippocampus. A fraction of somatostatin (SST) interneurons, which include both long-range and Oriens-Lacunosum Moleculare (O-LM) or bistratified local projecting neurons has been also reported to be myelinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2019</xref>). Myelin optimizes action potential (AP) propagation by forming electrical insulation and restricting ion channel distribution, but its significance is still elusive in local projecting interneurons. Oligodendrocytes wrapping of GABAergic axons may be essential for providing axonal metabolic support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krasnow and Attwell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Philips and Rothstein, 2017</xref>). Recent reports indicate that myelination of PV interneurons is modulated by neuronal activity or sensory experience and is able to shape the inhibitory circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benamer et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stedehouder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). However, how myelination could modulate the function of the different subtypes of interneurons remains poorly evaluated.</p><p>In the neocortex and hippocampus, GABAergic interneurons present the particularity to be covered by myelin sheaths that display a patchy distribution along the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benamer et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>).The discontinuous myelination of inhibitory ramified axons implies the presence of heminodal structures along mature axons. The mechanisms regulating myelin coverage as well as segregation of ion channels at heminodes and nodes of Ranvier remain to be elucidated. Remarkably, hippocampal PV and SST neurons display clusters of Na<sup>+</sup> channels forming prenodes along the axons before myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonetto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>). These prenodes can be induced by oligodendrocyte-secreted matrix molecules including Contactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubessy et al., 2019</xref>). Such Na<sup>+</sup> channel clusters along pre-myelinated inhibitory axons are associated with increased conduction velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freeman et al., 2015</xref>). We also showed that the axons of hippocampal PV and SST interneurons are highly enriched before myelination in Kv1 channels that may regulate firing during development. The Kv1 channels are associated with the cell adhesion molecules Contactin2/TAG-1, Caspr2, and ADAM22 and the scaffolding protein 4.1B forming complexes in the juxtaparanodal domains of the nodes of Ranvier after myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonetto et al., 2019</xref>). It is however so far unknown whether deficiency in any of the juxtaparanodal components Contactin2/TAG-1 encoded by <italic>Cntn2</italic>, Caspr2 encoded by <italic>Cntnap2</italic> or 4.1B encoded by <italic>Eph41l3</italic> could affect the myelination of hippocampal interneurons. Here, we focused our study on the consequences of 4.1B-deficiency.</p><p>Protein 4.1B belongs to a superfamily of proteins that share a conserved FERM domain (4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin) and serve as membrane cytoskeleton linkers and participate in a wide variety of cellular events such as motility and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denisenko-Nehrbass et al., 2003</xref>). In myelinated axons, protein 4.1B is implicated in the organization of the nodes of Ranvier as a linker between paranodal and juxtaparanodal membrane proteins to the actin/spectrin cytoskeleton. At juxtaparanodes, 4.1B is linked to the Caspr2/Contactin2 cell adhesion complex and is required for the clustering of the Kv1 channels as reported in the PNS and CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buttermore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cifuentes-Diaz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Einheber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horresh et al., 2010</xref>). At paranodes, 4.1B mediates the linkage between the Caspr/Contactin adhesion complex and ßII-spectrin and participates to the boundary with the nodal complex enriched in Nav channels and Neurofascin186 anchored to ßIV-spectrin/AnkyrinG scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brivio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zonta et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to its role in the organization of ion channel domains at the nodes of Ranvier, 4.1B linked with Caspr at paranodes has been also reported to promote internodal elongation during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brivio et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We discovered that 4.1B KO mice display selective aberrant myelination of GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus. An intriguing question is whether hippocampal interneurons require paranodal cytoskeleton as an instructive cue regulating the extent of myelin sheath coverage. We study the cellular features of SST and PV cells in the hippocampus by examining ion channel distribution, axon initial segment (AIS) topography and electrophysiological intrinsic properties. We show that 4.1B-deficiency induces a severe and selective loss of myelin sheath along SST and PV axons in the stratum radiatum of CA1 hippocampus. Notably, the excitability of SST cells located in the stratum oriens is specifically reduced in contrast to PV cells not affected in the stratum pyramidale. This study reveals the functional role of myelin in affecting the excitability of subtypes of hippocampal interneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deficiency in the scaffolding protein 4.1B causes severe loss of myelination in inhibitory axons of the stratum radiatum in the hippocampus</title><p>We used the transgenic <italic>Lhx6-tdTomato</italic> reporter line (Jackson laboratory) to fluorescently label subtypes of GABAergic neurons. Lhx6 is a transcription factor expressed in inhibitory neuron subclasses originating from the medial ganglionic eminence, which includes all hippocampal PV and SST neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liodis et al., 2007</xref>). Double-immunostaining for MBP as a myelin marker, and Caspr as a paranodal marker was performed and we evaluated that 75 ± 5% of the myelinated axons were Lhx6-positive in the stratum radiatum at P35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>We showed previously that cell adhesion and scaffolding molecules associated in complex with juxtaparanodal Kv1 are highly expressed in hippocampal GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonetto et al., 2019</xref>). Contactin2 is selectively expressed in SST cells in the stratum oriens and PV cells in the stratum pyramidale of the rat hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonetto et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we ask whether deficiency in any of the juxtaparanodal components Contactin2/TAG-1, Caspr2 or 4.1B could induce dysmyelination of hippocampal interneurons. Strikingly, we observed that 4.1B KO mice displayed a severe loss of myelin sheaths in the hippocampus as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The myelin pattern was selectively altered in the hippocampus of the 4.1B KO mice, markedly in the stratum radiatum both at P35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and P70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) as an indication that myelination of inhibitory interneurons may be severely affected. Only a slight dysmyelination was observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, which receives numerous excitatory projections from the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> inset and Figure 3D). We did not observe any massive loss of myelin outside the hippocampus, as shown in myelinated tracts like the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or in the layers of the somato-sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, Contactin2-deficiency did not markedly impair myelination in the CA1 hippocampus as illustrated at P70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In <italic>Cntn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice crossed with the <italic>Lhx6-tdTomato</italic> reporter line, the total length of myelinated axons and the percentage of Lhx6-positive myelinated axons in the stratum radiatum were similar to control mice as quantified at P35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Such myelin pattern alteration persisted in mature animals as shown at the age of 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Since the extent of myelination was difficult to be quantified in regions with a dense and intermingled network of myelinated axons, the number of internodes was estimated from the number of paranodes immunolabeled for Caspr in the different layers of the CA1 hippocampus at P70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The density of paranodes was significantly reduced by 85% (p=0.0060, Student’s t test) in the stratum radiatum of 4.1B-deficient mice (n=4 mice/genotype). The density of paranodes tended also to decrease in the stratum oriens (–29%; p=0.1774) and the stratum pyramidale (–34%; p=0.0667). The density of paranodes was not affected in the alveus (p=0.8002) nor in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (p=0.6273) suggesting that myelinated axons connecting extra-hippocampal areas may be preserved. In particular, this is an indication that the axons of pyramidal neurons that run in the alveus should be properly myelinated. The total length of MBP-positive axonal segments was measured at different levels of the CA1 hippocampal layers, starting from the stratum oriens (bin1) and the pyramidal layer (bin2), and throughout the stratum radiatum (bin3-7) towards the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Myelination was significantly decreased by 47% (p=0.0018, Student’s t test) in the stratum oriens and by 75% (p=0.0015) in the stratum radiatum of 4.1B-deficient mice, with a 69–90% reduction in the middle region of the layer (bin4: p=0.0004, bin5: p=0.0053, bin6: p=0.0113). Therefore, the fact that myelin mostly belongs to Lhx6-positive axons in the CA1 stratum radiatum, suggests that myelination of inhibitory interneurons may be strongly reduced in the hippocampus of 4.1B-deficient mice. However, we evaluated the percentage of Lhx6-positive myelinated axons in the stratum radiatum of 4.1B KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), which appeared similar to control (66.1 ± 3.6% in 4.1B KO versus 75 ± 5% in control) as an indication that dysmyelination was not restricted to Lhx6 GABAergic axons.</p><p>It was first critical to evaluate whether the lack of myelin could be due to a loss of GABAergic interneurons extending their axons throughout the stratum radiatum. We first quantified the density of PV and SST cells in the stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale of CA1, which was similar in the wild-type and 4.1B KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). Distinct interneurons subdivide their connections to sub-compartments of hippocampus pyramidal neurons with the PV basket cells connecting the soma, the bistratified cells connecting basal and apical dendrites in the stratum oriens and radiatum, and the SST O-LM cells projecting to the distal apical dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005</xref>) (see schematic illustration Figure 7A, H).

These particular SST axons are likely O-LM axons.

First, we recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) on pyramidal cells in APV (40 µM) and CNQX (10 µM) condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). We showed a significant increase in sIPSCs peak amplitude in the 4.1B KO mice (45.61±2.93 pA in 4.1B KO vs 31.51±0.88 pA in controls; p=0.0022, Mann-Whitney test, n=6 cells from 4 to 5 mice). The frequency of sIPSCs also tended to be increased (4.97±1.02 Hz in 4.1B KO vs 2.76±1.13 Hz in controls, p=0.1320, Mann-Whitney test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>).

To support this observation, we next examined the rise time and amplitude of 20 isolated sIPSCs per cell. The cumulative distribution showed that the occurrence probability of sIPSCs with slow rise time was decreased in 4.1B KO by comparison with control mice (p&lt;0.0001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). In addition, both genotypes showed a significant correlation between the rise time and amplitude of sIPSCs, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref> (p=0.0077 in controls and p=0.0072 in 4.1B KO, Pearson correlation test). Linear regression analysis of the relationship between amplitude and rise time of sIPSCs showed that while the slopes were comparable between genotypes (Null hypothesis test, p=0.9791), there was a significant difference in their elevations towards a faster rise time in 4.1B KO mice (Null hypothesis test, <italic>F</italic>=13.55, DFn = 1, DFd = 237, p=0.0003). Thus, events with small amplitude and slower rise time could be less abundant among the sIPSCs in 4.1B KO mice. To further examine the properties of inhibitory synaptic inputs, we recorded miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) on pyramidal cells as AP-independent inhibition. We found that neither the mean amplitude (28.29±2.33 pA in 4.1B KO mice vs 24.57±2.68 pA in controls; p=0.2224, Mann-Whitney test, n=9 cells from 3 to 5 mice) nor the mean frequency were affected in 4.1B KO mice (2.41±0.47 Hz in 4.1B KO mice vs 2.73±0.51 Hz in controls, p=0.5457, Mann-Whitney test).

We show that the extent of myelination of PV and SST axons is severely reduced in the stratum radiatum. Deficiency in the scaffolding protein 4.1B also impairs Kv1 clustering at juxtaparanodes and proper localization of Nav at the nodes of Ranvier. The excitability of the SST cells in the stratum oriens is decreased while the properties of the fast-spiking PV interneurons in the stratum pyramidale are unchanged. Our data suggest that this excitability defect reduces the distal inhibitory drive onto pyramidal cells.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>4.1B is implicated in the myelin coverage of hippocampal inhibitory axons</title><p>Despite the well-established physiological importance of myelination to speed axonal conduction, relatively little is known about its significance for GABAergic local interneurons. Recent reports have highlighted the fact that the different subtypes of GABAergic neurons could be myelinated and suggested that oligodendrocytes can recognize the class identity of individual types of interneurons that they target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zonouzi et al., 2019</xref>). PV- and to a lesser extent SST-expressing cells in the CA1 mouse hippocampus are frequently myelinated on their proximal axonal segments, independently of their subtype identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>). The sparse myelination of inhibitory ramified axons implies the presence of heminodes along mature axons. One inherent feature that limits myelin sheath growth and determines node position is the branching pattern. An intriguing question is whether axonal cues may be instructive to determine the extent of myelin sheath coverage. It is known that hippocampal inhibitory axons can form pre-nodal clusters of Nav channels along premyelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonetto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freeman et al., 2015</xref>). At a later stage of development, such prenodes of Nav/Neurofascin/AnkyrinG may indicate positions for limiting myelin sheath extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malavasi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thetiot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vagionitis et al., 2022</xref>). During development, components of the nodes of Ranvier accumulate adjacent to the ends of myelin sheaths to form heminodes prior to forming nodes. The developing myelin sheaths may stop growing when they meet a prenodal cluster, which would be instructive for the position of the node. Indeed, mutation of the nodal CAM Neurofascin-186 has been reported to increase internodal distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vagionitis et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we observed that deletion of 4.1B reduces the mean internodal length indicating that myelin sheath elongation is restricted in the mutant mice. 4.1B-deficiency strongly reduces myelin ensheathment of both PV and SST axons in the stratum radiatum, by 58 and 63%, respectively. The scaffolding 4.1B, which mediates the linkage between Caspr and the ßII-spectrin may be implicated as a paranodal cue modulating the myelin coverage of GABAergic axons. The association of 4.1 proteins with their transmembrane receptors and the actin-spectrin cytoskeleton can be negatively modulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) so that 4.1B may act as a clutch to promote myelin sheath elongation depending on axonal signaling. Whether the paranodal cytoskeleton including 4.1B may be implicated in adaptive myelination deserves further investigation.</p><p>The localized effect of 4.1B-deficiency on the myelination of hippocampal interneurons is intriguing. The stratified organization of the hippocampus likely reveals the selective role of 4.1B in promoting myelin sheath elongation in inhibitory interneurons. In the stratum radiatum, we evaluated that as much as 75% of the myelinated axons are Lhx6-positive. This is in accordance with other studies indicating that the fraction of myelin ensheathing GABAergic neurons is reaching up 80% in the stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>). We did not detect any massive loss of myelin immunostaining in other brain areas of 4.1B KO mice as illustrated in the somato-sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, a precise quantitative study would be required to examine whether selective dysmyelination of GABAergic interneurons is induced by 4.1B-deficiency throughout cortical layers and in particular, in layer2/3, in which nearly half of the myelin ensheaths inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Micheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stedehouder et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, the band 4.1 transcripts undergo extensive alternative splicing and belongs to a family of proteins including 4.1 G, 4.1 N, and 4.1 R proteins expressed in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buttermore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivanovic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we can hypothesize that the cell-type specific effect of 4.1B deletion may rely on compensatory mechanisms such as upregulation of 4.1 G or 4.1 R, as shown in the PNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Einheber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horresh et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>4.1B is required for the assembly of nodal and juxtaparanodal domains in myelinated inhibitory axons</title><p>In addition to the severe reduction of myelin sheath coverage, 4.1B-deficiency induces alteration of juxtaparanodal and nodal ion channels. The scaffolding protein 4.1B is linked to the Caspr2/Contactin2 cell adhesion complex at juxtaparanodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brivio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buttermore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zonta et al., 2008</xref>). As previously reported in the PNS and CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buttermore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cifuentes-Diaz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Einheber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horresh et al., 2010</xref>), juxtaparanodal Kv1 clustering is strongly reduced in 4.1B-deficient GABAergic axons of the hippocampus. We observed a similar alteration in Contactin2- and Caspr2-deficient GABAergic axons, although some residual expression of Kv1.2 can be detected at the juxtaparanodes of the mutant mice. The Kv1 channels are localized under the compact myelin and their function is still elusive under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pinatel and Faivre-Sarrailh, 2020</xref>). On the other hand, protein 4.1B binds Caspr at paranodes where it organizes the boundary with the nodal Nav channels. Strikingly, the nodal and heminodal Nav channels are no longer juxtaposed to the paranodes in the adult 4.1B KO mice, as previously reported in the developing spinal cord and likely as a consequence of the disorganization of the spectrin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brivio et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Whether the loss of myelin in the 4.1B mutant influences ion channel expression at the AIS is another intriguing question. We observed structural modification of the AIS of SST cells in the stratum oriens. The length of the AIS as measured with AnkyrinG is significantly shorter in 4.1B KO by comparison with wild-type mice, whereas its onset from the soma or the primary dendrite is not modified. Protein 4.1B is not required for the stabilization of AnkyrinG at the AIS as shown in cultured hippocampal interneurons from 4.1B KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonetto et al., 2019</xref>). However, 4.1B interacting with NuMA1 inhibits endocytosis of AIS membrane proteins and is required for AIS assembly, but not maintenance, as shown by shRNA silencing 4.1B expression at early stage of hippocampal culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Torii et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the AIS shortening in 4.1B-deficient SST interneurons may not be a primary event but rather a result of an adaptation to the reduction of myelin axonal coverage. Supporting this notion, previous studies have reported an adaptive response of the AIS of cortical pyramidal neurons in the cuprizone chemical model of demyelination. Specifically, it was observed that the length of the AIS is reduced together with a more proximal site of the onset. These changes reduce the AIS excitability suggesting a compensatory mechanism to ectopic action potentials generated in demyelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamada and Kole, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Class-specific effect of dysmyelination on the excitability of hippocampal interneurons</title><p>A defining feature of inhibitory interneuron subsets is their precise axonal arborisation whereby inhibitory synapses target specific subdomains of pyramidal neurons. PV basket cells innervate the perisomatic region and the SST O-LM interneurons connect the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. We observed a severe reduction of myelin in the stratum radiatum, whereas myelination appeared slightly affected in the stratum pyramidale. Such a layer-specific dysmyelination may indicate that the O-LM and bistratified interneurons may be more affected than the basket cells. The myelinated pattern of O-LM SST interneurons is highly visible since they extend myelinated axons from the stratum oriens straight across the stratum radiatum. The sheath coverage of O-LM axons is reduced by 55% in the 4.1B KO by comparison with wild-type mice.</p><p>We asked whether dysmyelination may induce changes in the neuronal excitability of interneuron subtypes innervating the different layers of the CA1 hippocampus. In this context, we showed that PV cells in the stratum pyramidale displayed a similar pattern of fast-spiking discharge in 4.1B KO than in control mice. Even if the rheobase tended to decrease suggesting that 4.1B-deficient PV cells could be more excitable than controls, we found no change in the other intrinsic parameters measured at the soma. In contrast, the dysmyelinated phenotype of stratum oriens SST interneurons is associated with lower excitability in 4.1B KO mice. This was correlated with a significant decrease in the input resistance and a significant increase in the AHP area. Such electrophysiological modifications may reflect changes in ion channel expression. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that the reduction in excitability of 4.1B-deficient SST neurons could also result from the change in their morphometry such as cell body size. Interestingly, in cortical pyramidal neurons, demyelination induced by cuprizone causes the restructuring of AIS and reduces excitability at this site. Acute demyelination leads to a more proximal onset of AIS without a change in the length of ßIV spectrin expression. However, the AIS of these acutely demyelinated axons display a reduced length of Nav1.6 channel expression and extended Kv7.3 channel expression at the distal site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamada and Kole, 2015</xref>). The <italic>I</italic><sub>M</sub> current comprised of K<sub>V</sub>7 channels is known to control the interevent intervals and is particularly effective in influencing firing frequency of O-LM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lawrence et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, one can hypothesize that the increase of AHP area in 4.1B-deficient SST cells could be due to a change in Kv7 expression at the AIS. In addition, we showed that the length of the AIS is significantly reduced without any change in its distance from the soma, which could lead to a decrease in excitability. Indeed, structural characteristics of the AIS, such as the length and/or distance to the soma, strongly affect the excitability and firing behavior of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kole and Stuart, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuba, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamada and Kuba, 2016</xref>). Along this line, the derivative analysis suggests that the AP is initiated closer to the soma in 4.1B-deficient SST neurons than in controls. In addition, protein 4.1B is associated in a complex with the Kv1 channels along the axon. The clustering of Kv1 channels is strongly reduced at juxtaparanodes of 4.1B-deficient mice and as a consequence, Kv1 can be diffuse along the axon to participate in the modulation of intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rama et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Functionally, it is well established that PV interneurons are involved in proximal inhibition while SST and also some CCK interneurons take part in distal dendritic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Udakis et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether the inhibitory inputs could be modified onto the pyramidal cells. We showed that the occurrence probability of small amplitude and slower rise time events among sIPSCs are reduced in 4.1B KO mice. This suggests that either the distal inhibitory inputs onto pyramidal cells may be decreased as a consequence of the reduced excitability of SST cells or that the proximal inhibition by PV cells may be increased. Nevertheless, this last hypothesis is unlikely since we did not observe an increase in the excitability of fast-spiking PV interneurons. The mIPSCs recorded in pyramidal cells did not differ in amplitude and frequency between control and 4.1B-deficient neurons suggesting that GABAergic receptors at the post-synaptic site and the number of presynaptic terminals are similar between both genotypes. This last result indicates that dysmyelination of inhibitory axons in CA1 may not be associated with structural synaptic defects, but with a reduction of distal inhibitory inputs. This together with the results from immunolabelling suggest that O-LM cells are the main dysmyelinated specific class of interneurons whose excitability may affect the inhibitory neuronal activity.</p><p>An important point to keep in view is that myelin sheath, apart from its insulator role, provides metabolic and trophic support in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krasnow and Attwell, 2016</xref>). As a possible consequence of impaired trophic support, it has been reported that in cortical neurons from lysophosphatidylcholine demyelinated mice, there is a decrease in mIPSC amplitude and frequency consistent with a selective loss of PV inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zoupi et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, demyelination of cortical PV basket cells from cuprizone treated mice strongly reduces the density of inhibitory presynaptic terminals onto the soma of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubey et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, we did not evidence synaptic alterations associated with dysmyelinated interneurons in 4.1B KO mice. As for long projecting neurons, it is also hypothesized that myelin optimizes the propagation of APs along inhibitory axons. Myelination defects of cortical PV fast-spiking cells are associated with reduced firing frequency and delayed predicted conduction velocity of their APs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benamer et al., 2020a</xref>). Indeed, a positive correlation between the degree of axonal myelination and conduction velocity has been reported for cortical PV interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Micheva et al., 2021</xref>). It has been also shown that the topography of interneuron myelination depends on the axon diameter and interbranch distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stedehouder et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we observed that the unramified axonal segment of O-LM cells crossing the stratum radiatum is ensheathed by myelin throughout. The strong reduction of myelin coverage along O-LM cell axons in 4.1B KO mice should decrease AP conduction velocity. In acute demyelinated cortical axons, conduction velocity of APs is reduced and ectopic APs appear; this is associated with a redistribution of Na<sup>+</sup> channels at branch points with increased nodal expression length of Nav1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamada and Kole, 2015</xref>). Here, we show mislocalization and increased length of nodal Nav channels that could induce modifications in membrane capacitance and axial resistance to current flow from the node into the internode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arancibia-Cárcamo et al., 2017</xref>). The misdistribution of ion channels implies that AP propagation should be defective along dysmyelinated SST axons in 4.1B KO mice.</p><p>Myelination of interneurons may play a critical role in brain functions such as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).

The hippocampal SST cells have been reported to contribute to learning-induced persistent plasticity and spatial memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artinian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Honoré et al., 2021</xref>). The O-LM cells are modulating the afferents onto pyramidal cell dendrites, facilitating through disinhibition the Schaffer collateral pathway from CA3 and down-regulating the temporo-ammonic pathway from the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leão et al., 2012</xref>). In the 4.1B KO mice, the severe loss of myelin in hippocampal interneurons may be associated with a dysfunction in the inhibitory network. A slight apparent disorganization of myelin was also observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, likely corresponding to inputs from entorhinal cortex. Although we do not exclude a dysmyelination effect of 4.1B-deficiency of extra-hippocampal afferences connecting the hippocampus, our results highlight the role of myelin in SST interneurons in fine-tuning the hippocampal inhibitory drive that might be involved in spatial exploration and memory.</p><p>This study may be relevant for understanding the contribution of interneuron demyelination as described in multiple sclerosis. Demyelinated lesions have been reported in the hippocampus of multiple sclerosis patients correlated with cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geurts et al., 2007</xref>). GABAergic interneurons are selectively vulnerable to demyelination in multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zoupi et al., 2021</xref>).

AlexaFluor-405, 488,–568 and –647-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Life Technologies, Courtaboeuf, France).</p><p>P25, P30, P35, P70, and P180 mice were deeply anesthetized with a mix of Zoletyl/Domitor and then transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed and placed in the same fixative overnight. Eighty micron-thick vibratome sections were permeabilized and blocked for 1 hr in PBS containing 5% horse serum and 0.3% Triton X-100. Antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH6, at 90 °C for 30 min was performed before immunostaining with anti-panNav and anti-AnkyrinG antibodies. Floating sections were incubated for 2 days at 4 °C with combinations of the following primary antibodies: goat anti-PV (1:1000), mouse anti-SST (1:200), goat anti-SST (1:500), rabbit anti-Caspr (1:2000), mouse anti-Kv1.2 (1:400), mouse anti-Kv3.1b (1:100), mouse anti-ankyrinG (1:100), mouse anti-panNav (1:200), rat anti-MBP (1:200), rabbit anti-Olig2 (1:2500), rabbit anti-4.1B (1:2000). Controls for antibody specificity were performed by incubation with secondary antibodies only. Control for the specificity of rabbit anti-4.1B antiserum was performed using brain sections from 4.1B KO mice. Sections were then washed and incubated with the appropriate AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500) overnight, washed and mounted on slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratory, Eurobio Scientific, Les Ulis, France). Image acquisition was performed on a Zeiss (Carl-Zeiss, Iena, Germany) laser-scanning microscope LSM780 equipped with 40X1.32 NA oil-immersion objective or 20 X objective. Images of AlexaFluor-stained cells were obtained using the 488 nm band of an Argon laser and the 405 nm, 568 nm and 647 nm bands of a solid-state laser for excitation. Fluorescence images were collected automatically with an average of two-frame scans at airy 1. Maximum intensity projection of images was carried out using ImageJ software (NIH). Images are single confocal sections unless the number of z-steps is indicated.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, the density of paranodes immunolabeled for Caspr was estimated in the different layers (alveus, stratum oriens, stratum pyramidale, stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare) of the CA1 hippocampus at P70. The density of single paranodes (1 doublet of paranodes = 2 single paranodes) was quantified in control and 4.1B-deficient mice using maximum intensity projection images (5-z steps of 2 µm) (4–7 ROI of 10<sup>5</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> from 4 mice/genotype). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, the total length of myelinated axons was measured in the stratum oriens (bin1), stratum pyramidale (bin2) and stratum radiatum divided in bins3-7 (40x300 µm) on single confocal sections, n=4 mice/genotype. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, we measured the total length of PV-positive myelinated axon in the stratum radiatum at P70 (stacks of 1 µm 5-8z steps; 5 ROIs of 10<sup>5</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> from 3 mice/genotype). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and M</xref>, the length of myelinated SST axons was measured in the stratum radiatum of control and 4.1B KO mice at P35 (stacks of 1 µm 5-8z steps; 10 ROIs of 10<sup>5</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> from 3 mice/genotype). To analyze the extent of myelin coverage of individual SST-positive axons across the stratum radiatum, only axons with a length &gt;100 µm were taken into account (n=29–35 axons from 3 mice/genotype). Three-D reconstruction of myelinated axons was performed using the Neurolucida Explorer Software (Micro Bright Field, Inc, Williston, VT, USA). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the distribution of the lengths of internodes was evaluated in the CA1 hippocampus of control and 4.1B KO <italic>Lhx6-Cre;tdTomato</italic> mice at P70. Double-immunostaining for MBP and Caspr and confocal imaging were performed (25–50 µm-width z-stacks of 2 µm). Maximum intensity projection images were examined together with single confocal sections using the ImageJ ‘synchronize windows’ tool. We measured the length of myelin sheaths bordered at each end by a paranode in 4 ROIs of 10<sup>5</sup> µm<sup>2</sup> from 2 mice/genotype (n=275 in control and n=191 in 4.1B KO mice). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the length of nodal Nav was measured in the CA1 hippocampus of control <italic>Lhx6-Cre;tdTomato</italic> at P30 and P70. Triple-immunostaining for Caspr, MBP and panNav was performed and Lhx6-positive axons expressing tdTomato were detected with the red channel. The distribution of nodal length was analyzed on confocal images (40 X oil objective, 1 µm 2-5z-steps) from 2 mice/age (P30: n=41, P70: n=64). Next the length of nodal or heminodal Nav channel clusters and the gap between Nav clusters and paranode were measured in the CA1 hippocampus of control and 4.1B KO <italic>Lhx6-Cre;tdTomato</italic> mice at P70 (n&gt;25/genotype from 2 to 3 mice/genotype). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the clustering of juxtaparanodal Kv1 channels was estimated in the CA1 hippocampus of wild-type, 4.1B<italic>, Cntnap2,</italic> and <italic>Cntn2</italic> KO mice at P70. The percentage of single paranodes bordered by Kv1.2 immunostaining in PV-positive axons was quantified on 5–10 µm z-stack of 1 µm confocal images. More than 150 single paranodes were analyzed in each genotype in 7–11 ROIs from 3 mice/genotype. Mutant mice were compared with their respective controls (not littermate) in double-blind experiments. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the AIS structural parameters (onset, length) were measured in SST neurons of the stratum oriens. Triple-staining for AnkyrinG, SST and MBP was performed at P35 (3 mice/genotype). To encompass AIS onset and distal ending, we selected neurons with SST axonal staining exceeding AnkyrinG AIS staining. The bottom and top sections were carefully determined for z-stack acquisition (20 X objective, 0.54 µm steps). The AIS length was measured on 2D projection taking care that the AIS of SST neurons were orientated in the plane of section (z-width 2–8 µm; means ± SD: 4.74±2.23 in WT; 4.58±1.56 in 4.1B KO). Measurements were performed on stacks using the ImageJ ‘synchronize windows’ tool.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Mice (P28-55) were deeply anesthetized with Zoletyl/Domitor and subsequently decapitated. Brains were quickly removed from the skull and placed into ice-cold oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) cutting solution containing the following (in mM): 132 choline, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 7 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, and 8 D-glucose (pH: 7.4, 290–300 mOsm/L). 300 μm-thick coronal brain slices were prepared using a VT1200S microtome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Slices were left at room temperature in oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) solution of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 1.3 MgCl2, 2.0 CaCl2, and 10 D-glucose, pH 7.4. Then, slices were transferred into a submerged recording chamber and perfused with oxygenated aCSF at a flow rate of 2–3 ml/min. Recordings were performed under visual guidance using infrared differential interference contrast microscopy (SliceScope Pro 3000 M, Scientifica, Uckfield, UK). tdTomato in neurons was excited by a UV lamp and the fluorescence was visualized using a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Japan). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, CA, USA), filtered at 2 kHz using the built-in Bessel filter of the amplifier. Data were digitized at 20 kHz with a Digidata 1440 A (Molecular Devices) to a personal computer, and acquired using Clampex 10.1 software (PClamp, Molecular Devices). For current clamp recording mode patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass tubing with resistances of 6–8 MΩ and filled with an internal solution containing the following (in mM): 130 KMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 KCl, 10 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)–1-piperazi-methanesulfonic acid, 2.5 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 0.2 ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid, 10 phosphocreatine. Access resistance ranged between 15 and 50 MΩ, and the results were discarded if the access resistance changed by &gt;20%. Neurons recorded in hippocampal CA1 region were held at a holding potential of −70 mV. Series resistance (between 5–21 MΩ) was monitored throughout each experiment and neurons with a change in series resistance of more than 25% were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>To study intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CA1 inhibitory neurons, we analyzed the voltage responses to a series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing square current pulses of 500ms duration of amplitudes between −70 pA and 130 pA with 10 pA step intervals from a holding potential of −70 mV in each cell. The voltage responses of neurons upon the current injections also helped to distinguish interneurons of a fast-spiking character having no or small ‘sag’ response to a hyperpolarizing current pulse from cells with lower spiking rate and a larger ‘sag’, typical of O-LM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maccaferri and McBain, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Input resistance (Rinput) was determined by calculating the slope of the plot of the membrane potential variation induced by a hyperpolarizing 500ms step of current (I: from –70 pA to 0 pA). Firing frequency was studied by injecting 500ms pulses of depolarizing current (I: from 10 pA up to 130 pA) into the cell and plotting the spike frequency (f) as a function of the current intensity (f/I plot). For presumed fast-spiking neurons, a second protocol was used were current steps varied from +100 pA to +400 pA with 100 pA steps, in order to analyze possible differences in high-speed discharge. Both analyses were done using Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). For the analysis of AP, the first AP evoked by a suprathreshold depolarizing current pulse (considered as the Rheobase) was selected. The following AP features were calculated using Minianalysis software: peak amplitude, area, half-width, threshold, AHP area, and AHP peak (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>). We further analyzed the shape of the AP rising phase using multiple derivatives of the raw membrane potential signal using Clampfit software (PClamp, Molecular Devices). In some dV/dt curves appeared a shouldering. A ‘double bump’ in the d<sup>2</sup>V/dt<sup>2</sup> curve and a value equal to or less than zero of the d<sup>3</sup>V/dt<sup>3</sup> trace between the two bumps indicated that the shouldering corresponded to a stationary inflection in the rising slope of the AP. This indicated that somatic and axonal components of the AP could be temporally differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kress et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paterno et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>GABA-induced spontaneous inhibitory post synaptic currents (sIPSCs) were recorded in pyramidal cells in voltage-clamp mode using patch pipettes of 8–10 MΩ filled with an internal solution containing the following (in mM): 140 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 4 NaCl, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 0.1 EGTA. Access resistance ranged between 15 and 30 MΩ, and the results were discarded if the access resistance changed by &gt;20%. The GABA-mediated current was pharmacologically isolated in the presence of AMPA and NMDA receptor antagonists (10 µM CNQX, 40 µM D-APV, respectively). For recording of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) TTX (1 µM) was added to the ACSF. CNQX, D-APV, and TTX were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All values are given as means ± SEM. All statistical tests were performed using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software). For comparisons of two independent groups, we used Mann–Whitney test or Student’s t test when values lie in a normal distribution using Shapiro-Wilk test. For multiple group comparisons, we used two-way ANOVA followed by the Sidak’s multiple comparison test. To quantify the probability that two sets of samples were drawn from the same probability distribution, we used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. To compare the rate of SST cells with stationary inflection to those without, we used Fisher’s exact test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is affiliated with AstraZeneca.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Maren Engelhardt (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors should refer to the interneuron population as SST-expressing neurons, or provide experimental evidence that they are indeed OLM cells.</p><p>2. Please, clarify issues related to the specificity of the immunostaining.</p><p>3. Please, clarify the disconnect between the measurements of the physical parameters and the details of the imaging parameters.</p><p>4. The authors should detail how specific these changes in myelinization are to local interneurons.</p><p>5. The behavioural data is only very weakly connected to the previous section of the study. From the current experimental design, it is unclear whether the observed changes are caused by alterations that occurred in the specific cell types and/or brain regions. For this reason, this section should be either strengthened with rescue experiments or removed from the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The spiking of more PV interneurons should be recorded and compared. The number of PV interneurons may not be enough to assess the potential changes.</p><p>2. In the hippocampus, PV is expressed in axo-axonic cells in addition to basket cells and bistratified cells. As the authors have not identified the interneuron types expressing PV, it would be more appropriate to call these cells PV interneurons.</p><p>3. The investigations of sIPSCs and mIPSCs do not help strengthen the authors' claim. To test whether the OLM input onto pyramidal cells is indeed reduced, they may consider performing paired recordings from identified interneurons and pyramidal cells. A reduced number of sIPSCs with small amplitude is not a strong claim that OLM cell output is reduced in KO mice, since other interneurons also innervate distal dendrites of pyramidal cells. In addition, it is not clear what was the access resistance of neurons in this set of experiments. Please clarify.</p><p>4. I had difficulty understanding the staining shown in Figure 4E'. The image was taken from a section prepared from a 4.1B KO mice, yet this image shows a 4.1B immunostained profile pointed by an arrow. Either the 4.1B antibody is not specific, or this arrow points to a non-4.1B labelled profile. Please clarify.</p><p>5. Similarly, why do we see immunolabeling for Caspr in Caspr2-/- mice (Figure 6F)?</p><p>6. In many figures, there is a clear reduction in MBP labeling in the alveus/str. oriens in KO mice (e.g. Figure 3A, B), where the pyramidal axons run. Yet, it is claimed that there is no change in the number of stained profiles. Some results imply that pyramidal cells in the hippocampus express protein 4.1B, which would explain why there is a change in MBP staining in KO mice. Do the authors have a good method to exclude the possibility that MBP is not altered in pyramidal cell axons?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are several pieces of data that the authors likely already have that would strengthen the claim about the specificity of the observed effects:</p><p>– In Figure 1 —figure supplement 1, panel D shows the percent of Lhx6 axons that are myelinated in the control and contactin2 KO mice. A similar figure with the percent of Lhx6 axons that are myelinated in the 4.1B KO mice will be very informative. If the % Lhx6 axons that are myelinated in the 4.1B KO mice is lower than in the control, that would argue for the specificity of the effect. Otherwise, if the myelin length is decreased, but the % myelinated Lhx6 axons is the same, that would be consistent with an overall decrease in axon myelination.</p><p>– More information on 4.1B distribution in the control hippocampus, if there is already data in the literature or any additional evidence that would point to a specific preference of 4.1B for PV and SST interneurons.</p><p>– Are there any changes at the AIS of PV neurons as the authors show for the SST neurons? Or in the AIS of pyramidal neurons (ankirynG stain)?</p><p>Increased amplitude of sIPSCs in the 4.1 KO – could also reflect an increased proximal inhibition, as mentioned in the results – but it is discussed only as evidence for the alternative, the decrease in distal inhibition.</p><p>An alternative interpretation of many of the observed effects is that 4.1B deficiency may be causing an overall delay in the development of myelination, as previously reported in the spinal cord. For example, the distribution of myelin in P25 hippocampus (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3) quite clearly shows that there is less myelin overall in the KO mouse. The oldest age used in the study is P70, and cortical myelination is known to continue beyond this age.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific suggestions for improving results and their presentation:</p><p>Two general comments:</p><p>1. The varying numbers of experimental animals (genotypes), ages, and experiments as well as parameters analyzed would benefit from a more structured presentation in the text, for example as a table. In its current form, the text requires a lot of back and forth to grasp the extent of data points presented in each figure.</p><p>2. For data presentation, I strongly suggest using data distribution plots/box plots in all figures. The authors have done so for Figures 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9, but nowhere else. Why?</p><p>In my opinion, the images provided in the manuscript are of very good anatomical value and prepared with precision and an eye for detail. My major point of conflict is the sampling of confocal images for the analysis of structural parameters. Nyquist conditions are essential to avoid undersampling in conventional confocal microscopy, especially when using the images to measure differences in the 1 μm range and smaller, in z. However, these conditions do not seem to be met with all data collected in this study, or I cannot find the required information. Using the stated information on p. 17, ll. 658 (40 x oil immersion objective, 1.32 NA and 488 nm excitation, assuming 1 as number of excitation photons and a lens immersion refraction index of 1.51), a quick calculation shows that single slices in a stack would require the z-stack sampling to be conducted at less than 0.2 μm. If this is not possible due to limitations of the confocal platform used, then single optical planes close to 0.3-0.5 should be produced, with subsequent deconvolution to overcome some of the limitations. However, the text states z-tack size of 2 μm (p. 17, ll. 669). This is problematic, especially since the parameters are used to quantify the density of such small structures as paranodes. I would like to encourage the authors to take a look at all their immunofluorescence data under these aspects and consider alternatives if indeed the Nyquist criterion is not met by a large factor.</p><p>Along the same lines, it is unclear in the current methods, how the 3D reconstruction was achieved prior to quantification. This pertains to myelin sheath length and AIS length. Particularly in the hippocampus, AIS are not present in seemingly organized orientation but are inherently &quot;crooked&quot; structures that cannot be measured (length, distance to soma, etc.) in merged intensity projections. Please state in more detail how length measurements were conducted (internodes, AIS). Again, for z-stack quantification, the Nyquist conditions become relevant. It is impossible to judge by stack size (as given for example on p. 18, ll. 682), where max intensity projections from 25 – 50 μm stacks are used to measure.</p><p>Regarding statistics, again, a table with summarized info on which experiment and quantification were done on how many animals, ROIs, or areas would be most helpful. Statistics are performed using either n for animals, or n for individual data points from several animals. Why is not all data represented as mean/animal? Also, the sampling in general with n = 3 animals is borderline acceptable; in some cases, it seems that only 2 animals were used (p. 18, ll. 687, 689), and in others, no number is given at all (p. 18, ll. 683 – n = 275 in control and n=191 in 4.1B-/- mice). This needs to be addressed, either by explaining why so few animals were used or by adding more data from individual animals. Assigning structures (AIS, nodes) as n results in overstating effects, since especially for AIS, there is significant heterogeneity in the length across neurons from the same type, and this is masked when 100 AIS are considered as individual n instead 100 AIS per animal, and the animal is (correctly) the n. Since the study seems to switch back and forth between these assignments, I suggest levelling these data across all experiments unless there are specific reasons not to do so, which then needs to be explained. As outlined on p. 20, all values are given as means {plus minus} SEM; this needs to be corrected for those cases where the standard deviation is the appropriate choice (e.g. all graphs showing n = individual structure, and not the mean of an animal). The data from electrophysiological recordings should be presented in such a way that e.g. the number of cells and/or animals is readily accessible from the graph or legend. In its current form, this information while available, needs to be pieced together from in-text information supplemented by figure legends. Sometimes, the authors do not include the number of animals behind individual cell data. For example, on p. 10, the paragraph beginning on l. 379 outlines data on inhibitory inputs on CA1 pyramidal neurons, which are statistically compared in the text (ll. 383), but do not highlight the number of cells or animals used. This information is also not available in the legend of Figure 9. Please carefully review all figures and edit accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86469.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

The image was taken from a section prepared from a 4.1B KO mice, yet this image shows a 4.1B immunostained profile pointed by an arrow. Either the 4.1B antibody is not specific, or this arrow points to a non-4.1B labelled profile. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the misleading legend, Figure 4E and E’ are WT.

Deletion of Caspr2 does not induce paranodal alteration, Caspr is expressed at paranodes in the Caspr2-/- mice as in WT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In many figures, there is a clear reduction in MBP labeling in the alveus/str. oriens in KO mice (e.g. Figure 3A,B), where the pyramidal axons run. Yet, it is claimed that there is no change in the number of stained profiles. Some results imply that pyramidal cells in the hippocampus express protein 4.1B, which would explain why there is a change in MBP staining in KO mice. Do the authors have a good method to exclude the possibility that MBP is not altered in pyramidal cell axons?</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the paranodal density in the alveus as shown in the new Figure 1I. See Results lane 178:</p><p>“The density of paranodes was not affected in the alveus (P=0.8002) nor in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (P=0.6273) suggesting that myelinated axons connecting extra-hippocampal areas may be preserved.

A similar figure with the percent of Lhx6 axons that are myelinated in the 4.1B KO mice will be very informative. If the % Lhx6 axons that are myelinated in the 4.1B KO mice is lower than in the control, that would argue for the specificity of the effect. Otherwise, if the myelin length is decreased, but the % myelinated Lhx6 axons is the same, that would be consistent with an overall decrease in axon myelination.</p></disp-quote><p>We evaluated the percentage of Lhx6-positive myelinated axons in the stratum radiatum of 4.1B KO mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D), which appeared nearly similar to control (66.1 ± 3.6% in 4.1B KO versus 75 ± 5% in control) as an indication that myelin alteration was not restricted to Lhx6 GABAergic axons.

For example, the distribution of myelin in P25 hippocampus (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3) quite clearly shows that there is less myelin overall in the KO mouse. The oldest age used in the study is P70, and cortical myelination is known to continue beyond this age.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now examined the myelin pattern of 4.1B KO mice at an older age.

For data presentation, I strongly suggest using data distribution plots/box plots in all figures. The authors have done so for Figures 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9, but nowhere else. Why?</p></disp-quote><p>For clarity of data presentation, bars are shown in Figure 1 (n = 4 mice) and Figure 3. Data are shown as box plots in Figure 6 (n = 7-11 ROIs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In my opinion, the images provided in the manuscript are of very good anatomical value and prepared with precision and an eye for detail. My major point of conflict is the sampling of confocal images for the analysis of structural parameters. Nyquist conditions are essential to avoid undersampling in conventional confocal microscopy, especially when using the images to measure differences in the 1 μm range and smaller, in z. However, these conditions do not seem to be met with all data collected in this study, or I cannot find the required information. Using the stated information on p. 17, ll. 658 (40 x oil immersion objective, 1.32 NA and 488 nm excitation, assuming 1 as number of excitation photons and a lens immersion refraction index of 1.51), a quick calculation shows that single slices in a stack would require the z-stack sampling to be conducted at less than 0.2 μm. If this is not possible due to limitations of the confocal platform used, then single optical planes close to 0.3-0.5 should be produced, with subsequent deconvolution to overcome some of the limitations. However, the text states z-tack size of 2 μm (p. 17, ll. 669). This is problematic, especially since the parameters are used to quantify the density of such small structures as paranodes. I would like to encourage the authors to take a look at all their immunofluorescence data under these aspects and consider alternatives if indeed the Nyquist criterion is not met by a large factor.</p><p>Along the same lines, it is unclear in the current methods, how the 3D reconstruction was achieved prior to quantification. This pertains to myelin sheath length and AIS length. Particularly in the hippocampus, AIS are not present in seemingly organized orientation but are inherently &quot;crooked&quot; structures that cannot be measured (length, distance to soma, etc.) in merged intensity projections. Please state in more detail how length measurements were conducted (internodes, AIS). Again, for z-stack quantification, the Nyquist conditions become relevant. It is impossible to judge by stack size (as given for example on p. 18, ll. 682), where max intensity projections from 25 – 50 μm stacks are used to measure.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the measurement of internodes, large stacks (25-50 µm width) have been imaged using the 20x objective. Paranodes were visible on two consecutive confocal sections using 2-µm steps. Only the internodes bordered by paranodes at each end were selected and measured on 2D maximum projection images.</p><p>Concerning the measurement of AIS, we hope that we have now better illustrated the AIS of SST cells in the stratum oriens in the new Figure 8 showing single channel images. In contrast to the AIS of pyramidal neurons which display sinuous feature, the AIS of SST neurons (and especially O-LM cells which axons run straight across the stratum radiatum) show a rather straight organization.</p><p>We improved the measurements of the AIS structural parameters (onset, length) of SST neurons of the stratum oriens and extended the Method section:</p><p>“To encompass AIS onset and distal sites, we selected neurons with SST axonal staining exceeding AnkyrinG AIS staining. The bottom and top sections were carefully determined for z-stack acquisition (20x objective, 0.54 µm steps, Nyquist conditions). The AIS length was measured on 2D projection taking care that the AIS of SST neurons were orientated in the plane of section (z-width 2-8 µm; means ± SD: WT, 4.74±2.23; 4.1B KO, 4.58±1.56). Measurements were performed on stacks using the ImageJ “synchronize windows” tool.” Methods, lane 723.</p><p>Indeed, these new measurements confirm that the AIS of SST neurons was significantly shorter in the 4.1B KO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding statistics, again, a table with summarized info on which experiment and quantification were done on how many animals, ROIs, or areas would be most helpful. Statistics are performed using either n for animals, or n for individual data points from several animals. Why is not all data represented as mean/animal? Also, the sampling in general with n = 3 animals is borderline acceptable; in some cases, it seems that only 2 animals were used (p. 18, ll. 687, 689), and in others, no number is given at all (p. 18, ll. 683 – n = 275 in control and n=191 in 4.1B-/- mice). This needs to be addressed, either by explaining why so few animals were used or by adding more data from individual animals. Assigning structures (AIS, nodes) as n results in overstating effects, since especially for AIS, there is significant heterogeneity in the length across neurons from the same type, and this is masked when 100 AIS are considered as individual n instead 100 AIS per animal, and the animal is (correctly) the n. Since the study seems to switch back and forth between these assignments, I suggest levelling these data across all experiments unless there are specific reasons not to do so, which then needs to be explained. As outlined on p. 20, all values are given as means {plus minus} SEM; this needs to be corrected for those cases where the standard deviation is the appropriate choice (e.g. all graphs showing n = individual structure, and not the mean of an animal). The data from electrophysiological recordings should be presented in such a way that e.g. the number of cells and/or animals is readily accessible from the graph or legend. In its current form, this information while available, needs to be pieced together from in-text information supplemented by figure legends. Sometimes, the authors do not include the number of animals behind individual cell data. For example, on p. 10, the paragraph beginning on l. 379 outlines data on inhibitory inputs on CA1 pyramidal neurons, which are statistically compared in the text (ll. 383), but do not highlight the number of cells or animals used. This information is also not available in the legend of Figure 9. Please carefully review all figures and edit accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>For the measurement of internode length, n = 275 in control and n=191 in 4.1B-/-; means ± SEM of 4 ROIs; 2 mice/genotype as indicated in the Methods and in the Legend of Figure 4.</p><p>For the electrophysiological recordings, the number of cells is now indicated in the text, and mice and cell number are indicated in Table 1 and Table 2 as noted in the Legend of Figure 7:</p><p>“For a detailed statistical summary of intrinsic parameters, see Table 1 and Table 2.
