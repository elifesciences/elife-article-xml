neurons exhibit pulse and surge modes of activity to control fertility. They also exhibit an unusual bipolar morphology comprised of a classical soma-proximal dendritic zone and an elongated secretory process that can operate as both a dendrite and an axon, termed a ‘dendron’. We show using expansion microscopy that the highest density of synaptic inputs to a GnRH neuron exists at its distal dendron. In vivo, selective chemogenetic inhibition of the GnRH neuron distal dendron abolishes the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and markedly dampens LH pulses. In contrast, inhibitory chemogenetic and optogenetic strategies targeting the GnRH neuron soma-proximal dendritic zone abolish the LH surge but have no effect upon LH pulsatility. These observations indicate that electrical activity at the soma-proximal dendrites of the GnRH neuron is only essential for the LH surge while the distal dendron represents an autonomous zone where synaptic integration drives pulsatile GnRH secretion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GnRH</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>luteinizing hormone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007219</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18ZR1422600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81771533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuang</surname><given-names>Yanping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1003000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuang</surname><given-names>Yanping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31400970</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001505</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-236</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan Edward</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herbison</surname><given-names>Allan Edward</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrical activity at the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron cell body and proximal dendrites is not required for the pulsatile secretion of GnRH that controls fertility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons represent the final output cells of a complex neuronal network that integrates a wide variety of internal and external factors to control the fertility of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herbison, 2016</xref>).

To date, synaptic integration within this soma-dendritic zone of the GnRH neuron has been the prime focus of attention in understanding how these cells generate pulse and surge modes of GnRH release. However, recent studies in the mouse have highlighted that one or both of the dendritic processes arising from a GnRH neuron can project for over 4000 μm before terminating in short neurosecretory axons within the secretory zone of the median eminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moore et al., 2018b</xref>). Unusually, these processes conduct action potentials from the soma-dendritic zone but also receive synaptic inputs, with their blended dendritic/axonal properties leading them to be termed ‘dendrons’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herde et al., 2013</xref>). These morphological studies have raised the possibility that synaptic inputs directed at GnRH neuron distal dendrons immediately adjacent to the median eminence secretory zone play a role in regulating GnRH secretion. The present studies were aimed at examining the significance and physiological relevance of the GnRH neuron distal dendron in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synaptic densities at the soma-dendritic and distal dendron zones of the GnRH neuron</title><p>While it has been possible to observe synapses on the GnRH neuron distal dendron using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moore et al., 2018b</xref>), their potential significance is unknown. To examine the relative density of synaptic inputs at the dendron compared with more proximal compartments of the GnRH neuron, we used expansion microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chozinski et al., 2016</xref>) to generate high-resolution images of synaptophysin-immunoreactive terminals apposing GnRH neurons in adult diestrous female GnRH-GFP mice (N = 4)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Expansion microscopy operates on the principal of isotropic swelling of the tissue specimen (typically by 4–5 times) before undertaking regular confocal microscopy; thereby providing ~70 nm resolution in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wassie et al., 2019</xref>). Although synaptophysin can be used to reliably mark almost all presynaptic terminals, a global post-synaptic marker is not available. Hence, to be able to define a synapse using only presynaptic and cytoplasmic labels, we first visualized GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on GnRH-GFP neurons by labelling for GFP alongside the pre- and post-synaptic markers vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) and gephyrin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We analyzed 25 ‘side-on’ profiles where VGAT and gephyrin were opposed to one another, thereby, defining a synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This revealed that the overlap between cytoplasmic GFP and the presynaptic marker VGAT must be &gt;0.23 μm (0.95 μm post-expansion) to represent a synapse; the gephyrin signal was contained within the GFP signal and all 25 synapses had an overlap in VGAT and GFP signals &gt; 0.23 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This value (0.23 μm) does not reflect the size of the synaptic cleft but rather the minimum overlap between the irregularity of pre- and cytoplasmic compartments at the synapse when viewed in 2D with this resolution. As not all appositions can be viewed in a ‘side-on’ profile, we also examined appositions in the ‘face view’ orientation that require scanning in the z-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Intensity profiles from a total of 12 GABAergic synapses were plotted with synapses found to have &gt;0.42 μm (1.75 μm post-expansion) overlap in VGAT and GFP signals in the z-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These observations set the parameters for determining synapses on GnRH-GFP neurons using the global presynaptic marker synaptophysin and GFP as the cytoplasmic label.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expansion microscopy views of synaptic appositions at the GnRH neuron proximal dendrite and distal dendron.</title><p>Schematic showing the morphology of a hypophysiotropic GnRH neuron with its soma-proximal dendrites located in the rostral preoptic area (rPOA) and the distal dendron and short axon branches in the median eminence (ME).

These observations parallel those of the POA chemogenetic inhibition strategy with optogenetic suppression of soma-proximal dendritic excitability abolishing the LH surge but having no effect upon LH pulsatility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is well established that dendritic computations and integration across both local and global scales are critical for generating precise patterns of neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>). We demonstrate here an unusual scenario in which the GnRH neuron utilizes anatomically distinct dendritic compartments to generate its two different modes of secretion: the pulse and surge. Whereas global or local distal dendron inhibition of hypophysiotropic GnRH neurons prevents the surge and greatly reduces pulsatile secretion, local soma-proximal dendrite inhibition abolishes the surge but has no effect on pulses. This indicates that the soma and proximal dendrites of the GnRH neuron are critical for the occurrence of the GnRH surge, whereas the distal dendritic zones are sufficient on their own for generating pulsatile release.</p><p>The use of chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibitory approaches require careful controls due, primarily, to the possibility of off-target effects of clozapine derived from CNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>) and the potential warming of brain tissue by lasers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owen et al., 2019</xref>). We have previously reported that CNO administered to wild-type mice has no impact upon pulsatile LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coutinho et al., 2020</xref>) and demonstrate here that, equally, CNO has no impact on the LH surge in wild-type mice. This indicates that CNO and its derivatives are unable to modulate the GnRH neuronal network in the absence of a CNO-activated receptor. We have also performed both yellow and blue light laser controls in these studies and show that the activating yellow light has no impact on LH pulses or the LH surge in wild-type mice and that switching to the incorrect wavelength blue light in Arch3-expressing mice is similarly without impact on either mode of secretion.</p><p>Substantial evidence indicates that the GnRH surge arises from direct synaptic activation of the soma-proximal dendritic region of rPOA GnRH neurons. The majority of hypophysiotropic GnRH neurons in the rPOA express cFos at the time of the GnRH/LH surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoffman et al., 1993</xref>) and evidence suggests that neighboring kisspeptin neurons provide a key stimulatory synaptic input to the GnRH neuron at this time (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herbison, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moenter et al., 2020</xref>). This concept is supported here by the observation that both chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition of GnRH neurons within the rPOA abolishes the LH surge. It is notable that the optogenetic activation of archaerhodopsin-3 does not completely suppress firing but entrains a 10 s on 10 s off pattern of firing every 30 min. As this was effective in stopping the surge, this suggests that the overall pattern of GnRH neuron firing may be more important than any average firing rate for surge induction. We also note that the chemogenetic inhibition of the distal GnRH projections was effective in blocking the LH surge indicating that action potential transmission to the GnRH terminals and/or further synaptic integration at the distal dendritic zone is necessary for the surge.</p><p>Accruing evidence has supported the possibility that the long, blended dendrite/axon (dendron) projections of GnRH neurons may represent an autonomous regulatory centre close to the GnRH secretory zone in the median eminence. Prior electron microscopic investigations have revealed the presence of synapses on these distal dendrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moore et al., 2018b</xref>) and, using expansion microscopy, we show here that the density of synaptic inputs at the distal dendrons is double that of the proximal dendrite. Thus, the distal dendron appears to be the most densely innervated dendritic compartment of the GnRH neuron. Studies in the brain slice indicate that GABA, glutamate and kisspeptin are all active in regulating the activity of the GnRH neuron distal dendron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iremonger et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, it seems very likely that the arcuate nucleus (ARN) kisspeptin neurons target this dendritic zone to generate pulsatile GnRH/LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbison, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plant, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The inhibition strategies used in this study are not able to determine whether changes in GnRH secretion arise from alterations in intrinsic excitability or synaptic integration in the GnRH neuron; both will ultimately be inhibited by hyperpolarization of the dendron. However, it seems very likely that the suppression of episodic GnRH secretion results from alterations in synaptic integration; first, there is very little evidence that the intrinsic properties of adult GnRH neurons contribute to the generation of LH pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbison, 2018</xref>). Second, we show here that there is substantial synaptic density at the dendron and third, there is robust evidence in several species for the kisspeptin neuron pulse generator to operate synaptically to drive LH pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbison, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plant, 2019</xref>).</p><p>We find here that the local chemogenetic inhibition of distal GnRH neuron projections in and around the median eminence exerts a very substantial suppression of pulsatile LH release but it does not stop entirely. Notably, the same result was observed with chemogenetic inhibition of the entire GnRH neuron. This may result from the CNO activation of G<sub>i</sub> signalling within GnRH distal projections being insufficient to arrest completely the potent G<sub>q/11</sub>-mediated effects of kisspeptin on both TRPC and voltage-gated calcium channels in the dendron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iremonger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Neither chemogenetic nor optogenetic inhibition of rPOA GnRH neuron soma and dendrites had any effect on pulsatile LH secretion despite abolishing the LH surge. This demonstrates that the soma and proximal dendritic compartments of rPOA GnRH neurons are not required for the generation of LH pulses. As the action potential initiation zones for GnRH neurons are only located in these proximal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herde and Herbison, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herde et al., 2013</xref>), this suggests that the propagation of action potentials down the dendron are not required for pulsatile secretion. This is compatible with the demonstration of episodic GnRH secretion in in vitro preparations without GnRH cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Purnelle et al., 1997</xref>). Although we infused large volumes of CNO into the rPOA, that would have been expected to infiltrate the entire region, it remains that hypophysiotropic GnRH neurons located in the dorsal aspects of the medial septum and caudal-most in the MBH may have been unaffected. It is possible that these few GnRH neurons are not necessary for surge generation but are, nevertheless, able to maintain pulsatile LH secretion. However, this seems unlikely as reducing the number of hypophysiotropic GnRH neurons has a marked effect on LH pulse amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Czieselsky et al., 2016</xref>) and we saw no change in LH pulse amplitude following either inhibition strategy.</p><p>It has recently become clear that the pulse generator is formed by ARN kisspeptin neurons that are intermittently synchronized and send excitatory projections to the GnRH neuron distal dendron in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbison, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plant, 2019</xref>). This kisspeptin activation of the GnRH neuron distal dendrons and consequent GnRH secretion in the ME has repeatedly been shown to occur in the absence of action potential generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">d'Anglemont de Tassigny et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Glanowska and Moenter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iremonger et al., 2017</xref>). As such, it seems highly likely that the synaptic innervation of the distal dendron represents a highly localized, autonomous regulatory mechanism for the generation of pulsatile GnRH/LH secretion. The present observations provide the first in vivo evidence in support of this concept and demonstrate a novel mechanism for the synchronization of neural output within the forebrain. It is possible that this unusual situation arises from the unique embryonic migration of the GnRH neurons from the nose into the brain resulting in their somata being scattered throughout the basal forebrain but their projections being concentrated together just above the ME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wray, 2010</xref>). The robust synaptic innervation of these clustered distal dendronic projections likely provides an efficient solution for the afferent synchronization of an otherwise widely dispersed neural population.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">STOCK Tg(Gnrh1-cre)1Dlc/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 021207 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:021207">IMSR_JAX:021207</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6;129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm35.1(CAG-AOP3/GFP)Hze</sup>/J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 012735 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:012735">IMSR_JAX:012735</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.DBA-Tg(Gnrh1-EGFP)1Phs</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spergel et al., 1999</xref></td><td valign="top">MGI:6158458 <break/></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">AAV2-Retro-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry</td><td valign="top">OBiO Technology (Shanghai) Corp., Ltd</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_44362">Addgene_44362</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">polyclonal guinea pig anti-GnRH antisera</td><td valign="top">gift G.

Slices were rinsed in PBS then incubated in donkey anti-guinea pig Alexa-488 antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) in GnRH-cre<sup>+/-</sup>::Flex-hM4D(Gi) mice or donkey anti-rabbit Alexa-594 antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) in GnRH-cre<sup>+/-</sup>;Rosa-CAG-Arch-GFP<sup>+/+</sup> mice for 1 hr and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Invitrogen) for 10 min, then mounted after rinsing. Dual fluorescence images were captured on an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were carried out with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). When comparing the amplitude and frequency of LH pulse within two groups, data were compared using Mann-Whitney test. When comparing the amplitude and frequency of LH pulse within three groups, data were compared using parametric one-way ANOVA (with post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). The firing rate and LH surge profiles were assessed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Differences were considered significant for p&lt;0.05. Values are given as mean ± SEM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The research was financially supported by the grants from the Natural Science Foundation of

This impressive work has generated some intriguing questions about the control of the gonadotropic axis. Among them is the relative role of different GnRH neuron compartments for the distinct modes of LH secretion, leading to the proposal that the distal dendrite is ideally situated and equipped to integrate upstream input that may constitute the GnRH pulse generator (rather than being intrinsically generated by GnRH neuronal activity). Wang and colleagues describe results from a series of studies investigating the distinct physiological roles of distinct dendritic segments in GnRH neurons.</p><p>Previous work in other systems (e.g. Govindaiah and Cox, 2004) has shown how the dendrite can act as a separate, isolated compartment from the rest of the neuron. However, the work on the GnRH system takes this concept a significant step further in showing that this compartmentalized activity can underlie functionally distinct modes of operation (pulse vs. surge). They use a combination of expansion microscopy, chemo- and optogenetic approaches and provide data that activity in proximal dendrites and distal dendrites have distinct responses. They report that (1) GnRH neurons have more synapses on their distal (compared to proximal) dendrites; (2) excitability of distal dendrite controls both pulsatile and surge mode of LH secretion; (3) excitability of soma/proximal dendrite controls surge mode of LH secretion. There are, however, concerns about the design of the study and controls that need to be addressed in order to support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Given that CNO diffuses readily in the body (as proved – multiply in the field, and also in this paper – by its effectiveness in the brain when it is given i.p.), what is the evidence or rationale that CNO injected into MBH stays locally in the MBH rather than spreads broadly? Even if CNO binding to DREADD receptor was locally confined (which seems highly improbable), is there any evidence that CNO-induced inhibition stays confined to distal dendron (this also seems unlikely given that DREADD receptor is coupled to diffusible intracellular messengers)? Given that conclusions of the authors are based on the assumption that CNO action is spatially restricted, this seems an important concern.</p><p>The chemogenetic approach is powerful, but has been under some criticism recently, with concerns about specificity and sensitivity. Missing from this study is an in vitro validation to demonstrate that application of CNO indeed hyperpolarizes GnRH neurons. Were CNO controls included to exclude effects of metabolism of CNO causing effects? In particular see Gomez et al., 2017.</p><p>In Figure 2G, it looks as if the peak was delayed in CNO-treated wild-types. Likewise, even though the CNO-treated tg mouse is largely flat in its curve, it looks as if there is a small increase at 20-21h vs at 19h. Can the authors please comment on this? I note also that in Figure 2H-M no wildtype animals injected with CNO were included as controls.</p><p>The optogenetic inhibition experiments have been validated in slices. But the effect seems quite modest. If I read Figure 5—figure supplement 1F correctly, this manipulation decreases firing frequency from ca. 2 to 1 Hz. Indeed, full suppression is difficult to accomplish with continuous illumination owing to the properties of Arch, but in the end, this experiment is difficult to evaluate, since the decrease in firing appears so limited. Can the authors please address how they believe this manipulation, which seems likely to more change the pattern of output of GnRH, rather than dramatically alter the amount of GnRH release, affects LH secretion?</p><p>Further issues with controls: blue light was used as a control for the absence of effect of yellow light upon Arch activation in the rPOA on pulsatility (Figure 5F-I and J-M). But this control seems more relevant to include when assessing the effect on surge (to show that blue light does not abolish surge), i.e. to complement Figure 5D-E.</p><p>Did the authors perform a negative control (laser in mice without opsins)? E.g. see Owen et al., 2019.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53945.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Given that CNO diffuses readily in the body (as proved – multiply in the field, and also in this paper – by its effectiveness in the brain when it is given i.p.), what is the evidence or rationale that CNO injected into MBH stays locally in the MBH rather than spreads broadly?

To our knowledge, the first to undertake a robust assessment of this issue was Stachniak and colleagues (Neuron, 2014) where they showed that intracerebral injections of 3 µM CNO into the paraventricular nucleus had a radius of action in the order of 3-50 µm. While we have not performed similar experiments ourselves, we expect that the 6 µM CNO we injected into the POA would have much the same spread. Indeed, it is clear from our experiments that CNO injected into the POA does not reach sufficient concentrations in the MBH; CNO injected into the POA has no effect on LH pulses whereas CNO injected into the MBH blocks LH pulses. Thus, we feel confident that there is not substantial diffusion of effective CNO from one site to another. We would also note that the amount of CNO injected peripherally (0.15 micromoles) is ~10,000x greater than that injected into the POA or MBH (12 picomoles).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The chemogenetic approach is powerful, but has been under some criticism recently, with concerns about specificity and sensitivity.

To date we only have a single recording that shows the expected suppression of GnRH neuron firing by CNO (trace shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) but it is unclear when this work can resume. Many studies have shown suppressive effects of CNO on neural activity both in vivo and vitro (see Smith et al., 2016 for recent review) and we do not believe this is a contentious enough issue to hold up publication of the study. We would be willing to ascribe to the COVID19 <italic>eLife</italic> policy of completing this control when able and posting the result.</p><p>The potential effects of clozapine are certainly something to be wary of with this approach. However, we note that CNO given to wild-type, AAV-injected controls has no effect on the LH surge (Figure 2D) indicating that clozapine (or indeed CNO itself) has no impact upon this neural network in our treatment protocol. Other studies in our laboratory (Coutinho et al., 2019) have also shown that intraperitoneal CNO has no effects on pulsatile LH secretion in wild-type mice. Thus, CNO and its metabolites have no effect on either the pulsatile or surge patterns of LH secretion in the absence of the CNO-gated receptor. We have now included reference to this important point in the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Cell-attached recording of a GnRH neuron from an AAV-injected mouse showing the effect of 1 μM CNO on firing.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53945-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2G, it looks as if the peak was delayed in CNO-treated wild-types.

Regarding the very small non-significant rise at 20 and 21h in CNO-treated tg mice (Figure 2G), this is due to two of the eleven mice (orange and teal traces) showing a very small late increase in LH. In neither case would this be considered an LH surge (see profiles C-E). As shown in Figure 2G there is a highly significant (P&lt;0.001) complete ablation of peak LH surge secretion in CNO-treated tg mice compared to all three controls. Regarding the pulses, as noted above, we have previously demonstrated that intraperitoneal CNO has no effects on pulsatile LH secretion and this is now noted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The optogenetic inhibition experiments have been validated in slices.

Indeed, with the 10s on 10s off protocol every 30 min we could reasonably expect GnRH neuron firing to follow this pattern (i.e. an overall 25% decrease) and yet the surge is clearly abolished. This is now raised in the Discussion emphasizing the potential importance of the pattern of GnRH neuron firing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further issues with controls: blue light was used as a control for the absence of effect of yellow light upon Arch activation in the rPOA on pulsatility (Figure 5F-I and J-M).
