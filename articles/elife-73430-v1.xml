For each of these papers, a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. When all experiments from a Registered Report were completed with interpretable data they were submitted and published as a Replication Study. However, there were numerous replication attempts that were not fully completed for various reasons as efforts were balanced attempting to complete as many experiments as possible across multiple Registered Reports, which were starting, finishing, and navigating challenges simultaneously over the course of the project. The decision to stop any individual experiment was influenced partly by the mundane technical or unanticipated methodological challenges unique to that experiment, and partly by factors related to time and cost estimates across all the replications that were ongoing as part of the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology as a whole. This includes four Registered Reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum and LaBarge, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans and Griner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greenfield and Griner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Incardona et al., 2015</xref>) where experimental work was initiated but ultimately stopped without results, one Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhargava et al., 2016b</xref>) where the results were submitted as a Replication Study and rejected (which has been posted as a preprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pelech et al., 2021</xref>]), two Registered Reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haven et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raouf et al., 2015</xref>) where experimental work began with preliminary outcomes although experiments were not completed, and five Registered Reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhargava et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chroscinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Richarson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharma et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharma et al., 2016b</xref>) where some experiments were completed. The present paper reports the preliminary outcomes and completed experiments for those seven partially completed attempts.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Partial replication: a chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer cell subpopulations</title><p>There has been an increase in using quantitative bioinformatic approaches to model and understand the evolution of drug resistance. For example, to inform more effective clinical outcomes, there is a growing understanding of how tumors, the microenvironment, the immune system, and the epigenome interact and evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCoach and Bivona, 2019</xref>). This is complicated by the challenges persister cell populations pose to therapy, drawing parallels to similar challenges in fighting microbial infections, with new bioinformatic approaches to decipher the complexities of heterogeneous cell populations, with a focus on drug-tolerant cells in cancers needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vallette et al., 2019</xref>). As part of the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, we published a Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haven et al., 2016</xref>) that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘A chromatin-mediated reversible drug-tolerant state in cancer cell subpopulations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We attempted to independently replicate experiments that tested the phenotype of a small subpopulation of ‘drug-tolerant persister’ cells (DTPs) that are generated when PC9 cells, a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-sensitive non-small cell lung cancer cell line, is exposed to high concentrations of TKIs. As described in Protocol 1 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haven et al., 2016</xref>), we first attempted to determine the growth characteristics of DTPs. When attempting to determine the percentage of erlotinib-treated PC9 cells that became DTPs we used the same concentration (2 µM) and timing (9 days with media and drug replaced every 3 days) as the original study. We found ~6% of the cells remained viable and continued to proliferate, compared to vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>), which was much higher than the ~0.3 % reported in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). We confirmed the PC9 cells used in the replication attempt had a deletion in exon 19, which confers epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) TKI sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arao et al., 2004</xref>), and did not contain a T790M mutation, which has been shown to confer erlotinib resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pao et al., 2005</xref>). We also performed a survival assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and checked EGFR kinase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which both required higher concentrations of erlotinib to achieve a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (survival: ~0.15 µM; EGFR: &gt;1 µM) compared to what was reported in the original study (survival: ~0.0085 µM; EGFR: &lt;0.01 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, we also observed similar results with erlotinib hydrochloride (HCl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which was used in a paper that reported DTPs from PC9 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramirez et al., 2016</xref>). These preliminary outcomes indicated that while the PC9 cells retained their sensitivity to erlotinib, the exposure of the cells to erlotinib was not at a similar ~100 times the IC<sub>50</sub> concentration reported in the original study. This could be due to differences, such as variations of the cells used (e.g., PC9 cells used in this attempt were less resistant than those of the original study) or the potency of erlotinib (e.g., differing compound potency resulting from different stock solutions). To test a similar relative concentration we increased the concentration to 20 µM erlotinib and observed ~1 % of the cells remained viable after 9 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This indicates that DTPs were generated when PC9 cells were exposed to high concentrations of TKIs, similar to the original study; however, this raised questions for replicating the proposed experiments in the Registered Report. For example, how do the results differ when experiments are performed using the same dose as the original study (2 µM) compared to the higher concentration suggested in these preliminary results (20 µM), or is a different set of conditions necessary (e.g., is it necessary to achieve ~0.3% cell survival after 9 days?). We did not continue this experiment beyond this point and instead focused our efforts toward attempting to complete other replication experiments. Importantly, conducting experiments under different conditions could help provide insight into what conditions are necessary to obtain the original results. Interestingly, this was a point discussed during review of the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haven et al., 2016</xref>). To summarize, this replication attempt obtained preliminary outcomes although the experiments were not continued and thus these data do not address whether DTPs maintained viability through IGF-1 receptor signaling and an altered chromatin state dependent on the histone demethylase KDM5A.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Replication attempt of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>.</title><p>Growth characteristics of PC9 cells treated with various doses of erlotinib.

It has been reported that glioblastoma cells transdifferentiate into tumor endothelial cells, supporting the idea that glioblastoma stem cells contribute to the endothelial angiogenic properties of these tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).

Since then a study reported tumor-specific CD8 T cells arose independently of CD4 T cells, but needed Th1-polarized CD4 T cells to effectively suppress tumorigenesis supporting the crucial role CD4 T cells play in tumor suppression by immunosurveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knocke et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We attempted to independently replicate experiments that tested the immune clearance of premalignant senescent hepatocytes and the dependence on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. As described in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raouf et al., 2015</xref>), the mechanism of mimicking aberrant oncogene activation was through stably delivering intrahepatic expression of oncogenic <italic>Nras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> via hydrodynamic injection. We used the same transposase and transposon plasmids as the original study and blindly injected mice with plasmids to stably express <italic>Nras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> or <italic>Nras<sup>G12V/D38A</sup></italic>. Wild-type (C.B-17) mice or SCID/beige mice that lacked a functional adaptive immunity were then blindly assessed for expression of Nras, and the prosenescence markers p21 and p16 at 6 or 30 days postinjection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–F</xref>) or wild-type (BL/6) or CD4<sup>−/−</sup> mice were blinded assessed for Nras expression 12 days postinjection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Unexpectedly, the Nras expression for both experiments were quite low, with many at, or near, zero percent. For comparison, the original study reported ~15 % Nras positive cells for C.B-17 and SCID/beige mice at 6 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2011</xref>). Simultaneously, while p21 expression was lower than reported in the original study, particularly at day 6, p16 expression was much higher and variable. Importantly, negative controls (e.g., isotype antibodies) were at low expression levels for all conditions. The extremely low Nras expression levels confound interpretation of these data since it is unclear if there was unsuccessful expression (e.g., low transposition levels despite using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system and the hydrodynamics-based procedure that are highly effective methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronovich et al., 2011</xref>]), the need to optimize the immunohistochemistry protocol (e.g., to address weak or absent staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>]), or the expression had not occurred at detectable levels or were already cleared despite following the same timing as the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2011</xref>). We did not continue this experiment beyond this point and instead focused our efforts toward attempting to complete other replication experiments. To summarize, this replication obtained preliminary outcomes although the experiments were not continued and thus these data are unable to address whether expression of oncogenic <italic>Nras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> in mouse livers induced cellular senescence that were dependent on a functional adaptive immunity, specifically CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Replication attempt of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2011</xref>.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Quantification of Nras-, p21-, and p16-positive cells on liver sections from C.B-17 or C.B-17 SCID/beige mice six or 30 days after intrahepatic delivery of <italic>Nras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> or <italic>Nras<sup>G12V/D38A</sup></italic>.

Similarly, the outcomes from the completed experiments were aggregated with those from other replications from the project to examine the replicability of cancer biology research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Errington et al., 2021b</xref>). Not all replication experiments attempted were completed as resources were balanced while attempting to complete as many replication experiments as possible as part of the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology. A decision to stop an experiment does not necessarily indicate the original results are not replicable, as it is possible that devoting more project resources to any one experiment would have ultimately resolved the challenges. This includes overcoming mundane technical challenges such as optimization of techniques (e.g., transfection conditions) or overcoming unanticipated methodological challenges such as changing the protocol or reagents to account for an experimental model system producing unexpected outcomes (e.g., low expression level of an exogenous protein). Likewise, a decision to end an experiment does not indicate the original finding is replicable as it is possible that the challenges indicate an underappreciation of the conditions necessary for repeating the finding. While not all of the replication experiments attempted were completed, and thus are unable to provide outcomes to compare with the original published findings, sharing these incomplete experiments might provide useful information, such as preventing duplication by enabling others to build on these attempts and to extract the implicit information entwined with the observations. Sharing these outcomes also provides transparency of what was attempted and observed for the experiments described in the Registered Reports that were not fully completed and submitted as a Replication Study. Additionally, while some experiments were uninterpretable, because the outcomes were unexpected due to methodological challenges, it is all too easy to conflate an experiment as ‘not working’ when unexpected or null results are observed. This can be addressed by predefining the outcome-independent criteria for whether an experiment should be included, or excluded, such as in a preregistration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neves and Amaral, 2020</xref>). However, this requires that all outcomes are shared, which is less common for null or incomplete findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franco et al., 2014</xref>). The Registered Reports publication format is one way to accomplish this, as are a growing number of publication and reporting platforms (e.g., preprints) enabling researchers to disseminate their research outcomes regardless of whether it was an exciting finding or a perplexing attempt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bespalov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sarabipour et al., 2019</xref>).

Mice were housed for approximately 1 week before being enrolled in the study. The individual mouse was considered the experimental unit within the studies and inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., resistance during tail vein injection, or injections taking &gt;10 s) were described in the Registered Report. Housing and experimentation (e.g., injections) were conducted in the same facility.</p><p>A pilot study was performed on seven mice. Due to difficulty in the smoothness of the injections with the plasmid solution compared to sodium chloride there was concern that the DNA was not completely dissolved in solutions and forming microprecipitants. Additionally, the anesthetic cocktail appeared to be too strong as mice did not recover as quickly as expected. Following confirmation by the original authors we switched the plasmid maxiprep kit from the kit specified in the Registered Report to another source (Qiagen, cat# 12362) and did not use anesthesia during the injections.</p><p>Following the pilot study, a total of 38 C.B-17 wild-type, 30 SCID/beige, 14 BL/6 wild-type, and 26 CD4<sup>−/−</sup> mice were randomized (stratified into strain-based groups and cohoused so that mice of the same strain receiving the same injections were housed together) to receive the pPGK-SB13 transposase vector and pT/Caggs<italic>Nras<sup>G12V</sup></italic> or pT/Caggs<italic>Nras<sup>G12V/D38A</sup></italic> transposon vector, which were used in the original study and shared by Dr. Lars Zender (University of Tuebingen), by hydrodynamic tail vein injection as described in the Registered Report.

Your article has has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Reviewers' Comments:</p><p>This is a summary of the results obtained from incomplete replication reports from the Cancer Reproducibility Project. This manuscript is a sweeping but inelegantly executed summary of incomplete replication studies. The data are a collection of experiments covering diverse discoveries reported by many investigators. The authors describe their replication experiments in the context of the original research data and simplistically conclude whether the current work agrees with, or is in opposition to, the original research. But all too often, the reports lack a critical evaluation of why the replication experiments may have failed to repeat the original research. This uncritical examination may leave the reader to unfairly doubt the previously published research, which, in the absence of a complete evaluation would be utterly unfair. While a strong argument can be made for publishing negative and contrary results, incomplete and contradictory results uncritically evaluated are of little value.</p><p>1) The Abstract is vague. While the research is sweeping and difficult to adequately summarize, the abstract must give the reader a sense of the scope, a summary of the results and a succinct and compelling conclusion that highlights the value of the effort.</p><p>2) The conclusions section is a simplistic summary of extensive efforts to reproduce important research and the difficulties of replicating them. No conclusions may be drawn as to why, but the many possible explanations, including limitations in technical expertise of the authors is not adequately addressed. If the authors are not going to provide detailed explanations in the discussion regarding why they might not have been able to replicate the studies, they should do so at the end of the Results section for each study. The lesson learned from this effort may be that the expertise required to repeat detailed and technically complex research is not straightforward even with a detailed methods and reagents list. But that should in no way be implied by the authors as a weakness in the original research. Stating any less than this unfairly detrimental to the original research.</p><p>3) Line 28 &quot;… attempts were completed and ultimately stopped so efforts could be focused on completing as many replications as possible.&quot; This statement is confusing.

However, we disagree with the reviewers that this implies that expertise is required – a more likely scenario is the lack of detailed methods and reagents lists despite attempts to gather these from the original papers and authors. The challenges in attempting to conduct these experiments, as well as all experiments attempted during the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, are a focus of a complimentary summary paper. We include reference to this paper and the other summary paper of the outcomes of completed experiments. Finally, we agree with the reviewers that we can not draw conclusions about why we were unable to complete some of these experiments since there are many possible explanations which were not explored. Instead we conclude that we stopped these experiments due to mundane technical or unanticipated methodological challenges as we navigated attempting to complete as many experiments during the course of the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Line 28 &quot;… attempts were completed and ultimately stopped so efforts could be focused on completing as many replications as possible.&quot; This statement is confusing.

For example, is it the PC9 cells as the reviewers suggest or the drug, or a combination of both? Importantly this is not a criticism of the original paper, rather it is what we observed during the replication that was unexpected and raises questions for the replication moving forward, such as do the results of downstream experiments differ when experiments are performed using the same dose as the original study vs the higher concentration suggested in these preliminary results – or is a different set of conditions necessary (e.g., is it necessary to achieve ~0.3% cell survival after 9 days?). While we did not further pursue these questions due to stopping this experiment, the results of the experiments proposed in the Registered Report under these different conditions would help provide insight into what conditions are necessary to obtain the originally reported results. We have revised the end of this section to highlight these considerations and to minimize the potential of this being perceived as a criticism of the original paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Lines 90-92. &quot;…which both appeared to require higher concentrations of erlotinib to achieve a half-maximal inhibitory concentration compared to what was reported in the original study.&quot; The authors should be more specific in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the estimated half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of the replication attempt (survival: ~0.15 µM; EGFR: &gt;1 µM) and the original study (survival: ~0.0085 µM; EGFR: &lt;0.01 µM) (original paper estimated from Figures 1E and 2E)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Partial Replication: Diverse somatic mutation patterns and pathway alterations in 191 human cancers.</p><p>7) Line 221. &quot;Led&quot;, instead of &quot;lead&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Lines 230-231.

We have removed this section from the manuscript to avoid confusion of these results. Of note, we did confirm the soft agar assay was performed to enable colony formation with the HMEC cells, although variation in cell lines and/or plate preparation could have resulted in this outcome. Also, the NIH3T3 cells were sent right before the start of the experiment, so they were handled following ATCC recommendations and propagated briefly before conducting the experiments (i.e., the cells were not passaged or stored for extended periods of time between expanding of the cells).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Partial Replication: Kinase-dead BRAF and oncogenic RAS cooperate to drive tumor progression through CRAF</p><p>9) Line 304-305. &quot;However, due to resource constraints…&quot; This is vague and should be more thoroughly explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised this sentence to better reflect the reason.
