liver damage, but a direct link has long remained elusive. Here, we establish a new paradigm for interrogating brain-periphery interactions by leveraging zebrafish for its unparalleled access to the intact whole animal for in vivo analysis in real time after triggering focal brain inflammation. Using traceable lipopolysaccharides (LPS), we reveal that drainage of these inflammatory macromolecules from the brain led to a strikingly robust peripheral infiltration of macrophages into the liver independent of Kupffer cells. We further demonstrate that this macrophage recruitment requires signaling from the cytokine IL-34 and Toll-like receptor adaptor MyD88, and occurs in coordination with neutrophils. These results highlight the possibility for circulation of brain-derived substances to serve as a rapid mode of communication from brain to the liver. Understanding how the brain engages the periphery at times of danger may offer new perspectives for detecting and treating brain pathologies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>liver infiltration</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>brain drainage</kwd><kwd>kupffer cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM124719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shiau</surname><given-names>Celia E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 ES007126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiménez</surname><given-names>Jessica A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007890</institution-id><institution>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UNC SURF fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Linlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Circulation of molecules from the brain can serve as a rapid mode of communication from the brain to the liver.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Whether a diseased or injured brain transmits signals to the periphery to activate a response is an interesting prospect in understanding brain-periphery communication, but remains underexplored. Interestingly, liver damage and neutrophil recruitment to the liver are common features in sepsis-related injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>) and several central nervous system (CNS) pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Campbell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Estrada et al., 2019</xref>), including traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease. A few recent studies have implicated a systemic, albeit most prominently a hepatic response to CNS inflammation due to CNS trauma or injury in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Campbell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anthony et al., 2012</xref>). However, the underlying mechanisms that may link brain inflammation with liver impairment remain unclear. The ability to track the cellular and molecular processes from the brain to the liver in vivo provides a direct means to understand the brain-liver association.</p><p>To investigate components of communication between the brain and periphery, we hypothesized that macrophages, key innate immune cells, capable of long-range migration and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Eom and Parichy, 2017</xref>), could act as mediators of brain-periphery communication. To this end, we investigated if a brain perturbation triggering inflammation, using a brain-localized LPS microinjection as an experimental means, could trigger a peripheral organ response mediated by macrophages. We employed the zebrafish because it offers unparalleled access to in vivo tracking and manipulation of molecular and cellular processes in the intact whole vertebrate animal from brain to peripheral organs, which are largely conserved from zebrafish to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Santoriello and Zon, 2012</xref>). Using zebrafish, we were able to directly capture the dynamic changes in macrophages occurring in the body after a focal brain challenge and found the liver to be the most prominent target peripheral organ for immune infiltration. Our data support the notion that infiltrating and resident macrophages in the liver may critically modulate CNS and systemic inflammation by shaping the hepatic response to circulating or widely distributed molecules that may be infectious, toxic, or exogenous.</p><p>A possible route through which the brain may affect liver function may simply be a drainage of effector molecules into circulation, albeit even at a trace level, to initiate systemic inflammation, rather than direct brain to liver signaling. While much research has focused on mechanisms penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSF) barrier to enable entry of a peripheral agent into the brain parenchyma such as those relating to infectious diseases causing brain dysfunction (for example, by neurotropic viruses including <italic>Rabies lyssavirus</italic>, West Nile virus, and cytomegalovirus) and drug delivery to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hladky and Barrand, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van den Pol, 2009</xref>), far less attention has been given to investigating the reciprocal transfer from brain to circulation and its consequences. Limiting the free passage of solutes and large molecules into the CNS is tightly-regulated by both BBB and BCSF barriers to ensure protection of the CNS from inappropriate tissue damage and inflammation. By contrast, the removal of waste and toxic agents from the brain interstitial space to ensure normal brain health and function requires appropriate metabolism or efflux of these substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hladky and Barrand, 2018</xref>). Previous studies on movement of CNS fluid and solutes indicate several possible routes of drainage of substances from the brain parenchyma including perivascular pathways that may exit through the CSF or lymph tracts, and the BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hladky and Barrand, 2018</xref>). Therefore, if the net outcome is some degree of systemic inflammation due to an efflux of inflammatory cues from the brain to circulation, even at a low level, then it could effectively target the liver, but this remains to be investigated.</p><p>Given that the liver is equipped to process a large fraction of the total blood circulation from two major blood supplies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eipel et al., 2010</xref>), the hepatic artery and portal vein from the gastrointestinal tract, it may not be surprising that the liver would be highly sensitive and responsive to inflammatory mediators and foreign agents in the blood flow. In fact, common and infectious bacteria (including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>) in the bloodstream have often been found to be cleared by the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gregory et al., 1996</xref>). However, the mechanisms that specifically make the liver susceptible to systemic inflammation remain incompletely understood. Besides metabolic functions, the liver provides critical immune surveillance by recognizing and clearing away infectious, toxic, and microbial substances in the blood, a function that has largely been attributed to the Kupffer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bilzer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kubes and Jenne, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006</xref>). Systemic inflammation stemming from infection, toxic insults, and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Edwards and Wanless, 2013</xref>) can cause chronic infiltration of leukocytes into the liver leading to liver damage and subsequent progression to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Karlmark et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mossanen and Tacke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). However, how the liver responds and contributes to systemic inflammation by way of leukocyte infiltration remains poorly understood, a process that has not been directly visualized in vivo for an open dissection.</p><p>Here, we reveal new insights into the cellular dynamics and critical roles of the IL-34 and MyD88 signaling pathways as well as Kupffer-cell-independent mechanisms in mediating immune infiltration of the liver in response to systemic lipopolysaccharides (LPS), classic pro-inflammatory bacteria-derived stimuli, after brain intraparenchymal LPS microinjection. By using fluorescently traceable LPS in the brain as an experimental paradigm, we show that inflammatory cues could originate from the brain and trigger immune infiltration of the liver, a process not previously appreciated involving drainage of the macromolecules from brain to circulation. Using comparative analyses, time-lapse imaging, and blocking circulation, we found that the effects of brain-LPS injection were largely recapitulated by intravenous LPS injection, and stemmed from systemic inflammation akin to sepsis or endotoxemia. We can block infiltration of immune cells into the liver by disrupting MyD88, a key adaptor of Toll-like receptors responsible for LPS recognition, or by eliminating the cytokine IL-34 pathway, and by reducing inflammation pharmacologically. Additionally, coordination between macrophages and neutrophils is also essential for the liver infiltration. Infiltration by macrophages and neutrophils negatively impacts the liver by promoting inflammation and disrupting normal hepatic growth. Taken together, changes in macrophage behavior involving immune cell infiltration of the liver may be triggered by drainage of inflammatory cues coming from the brain, providing a possible readout for an altered brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Brain immune activation is associated with macrophages infiltrating the liver prior to Kupffer cell establishment</title><p>Reciprocal connections between brain and liver are apparent in various conditions, including encephalopathy and encephalitis after severe liver damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Butterworth, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Felipo, 2013</xref>), liver disruption after traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Villapol, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lustenberger et al., 2011</xref>), and intracerebral injection of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Campbell et al., 2005</xref>). However, the routes of communication directly linking brain to liver remain poorly understood. To investigate one possible avenue of this, we sought to determine whether a brain perturbation such as inflammation could trigger macrophage activities corresponding to a response by the liver or other peripheral organs. To this end, we directly microinjected bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or <italic>E. Coli</italic> cells, well-established immune activators, into the brain tectum at four days post-fertilization (dpf) at a stage known to have a well formed brain with an established BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jeong et al., 2008</xref>) and choroid plexus/ventricle system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Henson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fame et al., 2016</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Earley et al., 2018</xref>). Stage-matched animals that were not injected or injected with the water vehicle in the brain were used as the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To analyze a possible change in peripheral macrophages after brain-LPS injection at four dpf, we used whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization for a macrophage marker, <italic>mfap4</italic>, to characterize the macrophage distribution in the whole body. Strikingly, we found a robust and distinctive aggregation of macrophages in the liver and near the brain injection site, but not apparently elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, the uninjected and water injected controls at four dpf were devoid of macrophages in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also found at least some of these macrophages in the liver to be activated based on their expression of the mitochondrial enzyme gene <italic>irg1/acod1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) known to be highly upregulated during inflammation and specifically induced in inflammatory macrophages in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lampropoulou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sanderson et al., 2015</xref>). Both injections of LPS or live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells into the brain led to macrophage presence in the liver, albeit LPS effects were consistently stronger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Induction of brain inflammation triggers macrophage infiltration into the liver.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Time-course of Kupffer cell development.

We found normally an absence of Kupffer cells at the stage of our brain microinjection at four dpf (0.2 ± 0.4 standard deviation (s.d.) per liver), few to none at 5–6 dpf (4.0 ± 2.2 s.d. per liver), and once larvae were fed and moved into the fish facility, Kupffer cell numbers grew substantially (78.2 ± 14.9 s.d. per area of liver at 26 dpf) reaching to hundreds per liver in the juvenile adults (26–40 dpf at 9–12.5 mm standard length) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Prior to this work, Kupffer cells were thought to be missing or sparse in zebrafish and other teleost species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goessling and Sadler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sakano and Fujita, 1982</xref>), but recent work tracing adult zebrafish Kupffer cells to their hematopoietic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">He et al., 2018</xref>), and the data presented here collectively provide the first evidence for the prevalence of Kupffer cells in the zebrafish liver akin to their mammalian counterpart. Since the brain-LPS injection and subsequent analysis were conducted at four dpf, before the establishment of Kupffer cells, the presence of macrophages in the liver was likely because of active recruitment of peripheral macrophages and monocytes.</p><p>We subsequently conducted a time-course analysis of macrophage activities after brain-LPS injection at four dpf to determine if macrophages were actively infiltrating the liver. Using in vivo static and time-lapse imaging in double transgenic zebrafish expressing both the macrophage reporter <italic>mpeg1:GFP</italic> and the liver hepatocyte reporter <italic>fabp10a:DsRed</italic>, we observed macrophages actively migrating or circulating into the liver, affirming the in situ results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We captured macrophage dynamics in the liver region at 8–10 hr post-injection (hpi) of LPS in the brain (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) when substantial numbers of infiltrating macrophages can be observed. Conversely, the brain-water injected controls mostly had zero macrophages in the liver (average of 1.4 ± 1.2 standard deviation (s.d.) macrophages per liver) compared with an average of 13.2 ± 6.6 s.d. macrophages per liver after brain-LPS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–e</xref>). Later at 24–30 hpi and 48 hpi, significant numbers of macrophages in the liver persisted even two days after brain-LPS injection (11.2 ± 6.3 s.d. and 13.1 ± 6.1 s.d. macrophages per liver, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). At these later timepoints, a few Kupffer cells may begin to emerge at less than five per liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In agreement with the timeline of Kupffer cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), only a few macrophages were detectable in uninjected and water-injected controls at the two later timepoints (3.1 ± 1.8 s.d. and 3.9 ± 2.8 s.d. macrophages per liver, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Macrophages in the liver at 48 hpi appeared more stationary than earlier at 8–10 hpi (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In all timepoints of analysis, infiltrated macrophages in the liver were found in several locations, including inside the sinusoids (liver microvessels) similar to that described during mammalian liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Iwakiri et al., 2014</xref>), and surprisingly also in the parenchyma intermingling with hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), a macrophage behavior previously not known. Due to some examples of broad liver <italic>mfap4</italic> in situ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) in comparison to a discrete number of infiltrating macrophages by live imaging after brain-LPS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we assessed whether this could be explained by an induction of ectopic <italic>mfap4</italic> expression in the liver upon LPS activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Using a transgenic line <italic>mfap4:tdTomato</italic> to mark cells expressing the <italic>mfap4</italic> gene, we found <italic>mfap4</italic> restricted to macrophages and absent in liver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting the broad liver <italic>mfap4</italic> expression may be diffuse in situ signals coming from a liver more densely populated by infiltrated macrophages. To analyze the nature of physical contact of infiltrated macrophages to the hepatic sinusoids after brain-LPS injection, we imaged double transgenic zebrafish expressing the endothelial (<italic>kdrl:mCherry</italic>) and macrophage (<italic>mpeg1:GFP</italic>) reporters. Time-lapse imaging showed that macrophages can actively infiltrate the hepatic sinusoids, as well as be associated or entirely independent of the hepatic vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58191-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse imaging of macrophages infiltrating the liver 10 hr after brain-LPS injection.</title><p>Representative single z-plane through the liver (<italic>fabp10a:DsRed</italic>+) shown from confocal imaging of one z-stack every 1 min and 15 s for ~1 hr using a 40x objective.

Results indicate no significant change in macrophage presence in liver, suggesting that infiltrated macrophages either stayed in the liver, moved in and out of the liver at similar rates, or both. To distinguish these possibilities, we tracked these infiltrating macrophages directly in vivo over a continuous 10 hr period after brain-LPS injection at four dpf starting at 12 hpi. Using live cell tracking, we found a small number (~13%) of infiltrating macrophages that stayed in the liver longer than 2 hr, including occasional infiltrates which remained in the liver past the total duration of imaging (&gt;9 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Infiltrating macrophages were coined ‘residing’ when they occupied the liver for more than 2 hr, and these were on average moving slower at 1.1 ± 0.7 µm/min than the ‘transient’ population at 2.2 ± 1.1 µm/min which occupied the liver for more than one timepoint (2 min) but less than 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We found a significant fraction (~30%) of infiltrating macrophages to be of the ‘transient’ type, while the majority at 57.4% were circulating (detected only in a single timepoint) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Both the ‘residing’ and ‘transient’ populations were not truly stationary but rather moved dynamically back and forth across the liver parenchyma amounting to large total distances traveled over time (309.2 ± 285.9 µm s.d. and 62.8 ± 66.7 µm s.d. in 560 min of tracking, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

While most of the LPS remained restricted within the ventricular system, we found the hindbrain ventricle (hbv) to be the key region from which LPS spread into the parenchyma and surrounding interstitial space, especially in the dorsal-most portion of the junction between the hindbrain and spinal cord encompassing the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessels (DLAVs) and the dorsal longitudinal lymphatic vessel (DLLV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). LPS at a low level were detected to exude out from the hbv into the hindbrain interstitial fluid (ISF) starting at around 1 min after injection (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and reached a maximum of about 30% of LPS injection level at 50 min after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). After a delay of about 13 min after injection, the first LPS fluorescence signals were faintly measured in the pronephros, a region assessed as a proxy for general circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Peripheral LPS level increased over time but remained low at less than 15% of the LPS injection level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To characterize LPS at the tissue and cellular level along its outflow path, we used high power confocal imaging on the same LPS-injected zebrafish which were tracked by stereomicroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>) to carry out further imaging at later timepoints. Interestingly, LPS molecules were taken up by brain lymphatic endothelial cells (blec), also known as fluorescent granular perithelial cells (FGPs), as well as by facial and trunk lymphatic vessels as shown by co-localization of LPS with the lymphatic reporter <italic>mrc1a:GFP</italic> at 1.5 hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>), suggesting LPS exited through these lymphatic structures. These results were consistent with the previous LPS tracing within the first hour after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>), but shown more definitively by high-resolution confocal imaging. By contrast, LPS were not localized within the CNS vasculature using the endothelial reporter <italic>kdrl:mCherry</italic>, but only in the peripheral blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that transport of LPS did not likely result from a disruption of the BBB or a direct transit through brain blood vessels. Tracing the movement of LPS from the brain to the periphery also revealed its transient flow through the liver sinusoids prior to immune cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). However, LPS did not appear to accumulate or bind to cellular structures within the liver as we did not detect LPS there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>), suggesting either the transient exposure of hepatic cells to LPS, or yet unknown extrahepatic signals trigger the hepatic response to systemic LPS. Taken together, LPS appeared to enter circulation via a mechanism directed by the lymphatics for clearing away excess substances from the brain parenchyma and interstitial fluids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p><p>In light of the broad LPS distribution, we sought to functionally test whether the liver response after brain-LPS activation was due to systemic LPS. To create a systemic LPS condition akin to mammalian models of sepsis or endotoxemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Szabo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mathison and Ulevitch, 1979</xref>), we directly injected LPS intravenously at the caudal plexus into the bloodstream and compared its resulting peripheral response to that after brain-LPS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These injections resulted in different outcomes for microglial activation at six hpi, whereby brain-LPS led to a strong activation of microglia but intravenous (IV)-LPS did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Both routes, however, led to the same robust macrophage infiltration of the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). To determine if circulation was required for the liver response after brain-LPS injection, we used a morpholino to knockdown <italic>tnnt2</italic>, a cardiac muscle troponin T gene, a well-established reagent for blocking circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sehnert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We indeed found that inhibiting circulation prevented macrophage infiltration into liver after brain-LPS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Taken together, several lines of evidence show that circulating LPS that causes systemic inflammation was driving macrophage infiltration into the liver after brain-LPS injection: 1) systemic distribution of LPS, 2) sufficiency of IV-LPS injection to cause liver infiltration, and 3) blocking circulation prevented macrophage infiltration of the liver.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Macrophage recruitment to the liver is a MyD88-dependent inflammatory response requiring the IL-34 pathway</title><p>We next tested the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs on liver response after brain-LPS microinjection to address whether systemic inflammation was indeed responsible for the macrophage recruitment into the liver. We screened five small-molecule drugs (GW2580, 17-DMAG, celastrol, Bay 11–7082, and dexamethasone) known to effectively curb inflammation by attenuating NF-kB mediated transcription or activating glucocorticoid functions in zebrafish and other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Conway et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shimp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sevin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Coffin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lancet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Venkatesha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aghai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yamamoto and Gaynor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lee et al., 2012</xref>).

We first assessed the effects these small molecules had on macrophage infiltration into the liver after brain-LPS microinjection using whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization with the macrophage marker <italic>mfap4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As positive controls for liver infiltration, we used brain-LPS injected animals that were untreated (water only) for comparison with water-reconstituted drugs (17-DMAG and dexamethasone), and treated with only DMSO for comparison with DMSO-reconstituted drugs (GW2580, celastrol, and Bay 11–7082). Untreated animals without brain microinjection were also used as negative controls. By in situ analysis, we found that Bay 11–7082 and dexamethasone substantially reduced the frequency of macrophage infiltration after brain-LPS injection compared with control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These effects were further validated by in vivo imaging of macrophage recruitment into the liver, which enabled a precise macrophage count at a high cellular resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicated that macrophage infiltration into the liver after brain-LPS stimulation can be prevented by suppressing inflammation via mechanisms inhibiting the NF-kB pathway or activating the glucocorticoid signaling.</p><p>To examine possible components affiliated with the NF-kB pathway that may drive macrophage recruitment into the liver, we examined whether an intracellular signal adaptor protein myeloid differentiation protein-88 (MyD88) of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) known for recognizing LPS and mediating cytokine production was essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Medzhitov, 2001</xref>). We employed an effective <italic>myd88</italic> specific splice-blocking morpholino to knockdown <italic>myd88</italic> as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">van der Sar et al., 2006</xref>) during the liver response to brain-LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). The efficacy of <italic>myd88</italic> morpholino to mediate splice-blocking was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). By in vivo imaging, we found that the number of liver-infiltrating macrophages after brain-LPS microinjection was significantly reduced when <italic>myd88</italic> function was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). To further validate these results, we performed the brain-LPS and control injections in <italic>myd88</italic> null mutants and their siblings derived from a heterozygous incross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). <italic>myd88</italic> mutants showed either few or no macrophages in the liver after brain-LPS injection at 16–24 hpi similar to baseline brain-water injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), demonstrating a much stronger effect in reversing macrophage infiltration than the partial <italic>myd88</italic> knockdown by morpholinos.

IL-34 and CSF-1 are known to mediate various functions of macrophages including inflammatory processes and promoting production of pro-inflammatory chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caescu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sauter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Masteller and Wong, 2014</xref>). They have recently been shown to be required for macrophage migration and colonization of the brain to form microglia in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Oosterhof et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, engineering an artificial expression of <italic>il-34</italic> in hepatocytes has been shown to be able to recruit macrophages to the liver in zebrafish, but the physiological relevance was not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). In light of these previous studies, <italic>il-34</italic> and the two zebrafish orthologs of CSF-1 gene (<italic>csf1a</italic> and <italic>csf1b</italic>) were strong candidates for attracting macrophages to the liver after brain-LPS injection. To examine this possibility, we first determined whether these genes (<italic>il-34</italic>, <italic>csf1a</italic>, and <italic>csf1b</italic>) were upregulated in the liver after brain-LPS injection using quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis on liver-specific and body-minus-liver tissues compared with control animals without the brain microinjection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). We found that while <italic>csf1a</italic> and <italic>csf1b</italic> were either not detected or had no difference in the liver with or without LPS injection, <italic>il-34</italic> was significantly upregulated in the liver after brain-LPS microinjection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). This upregulation was specific to the liver as <italic>il-34</italic> was not elevated in the body-minus-liver tissue after brain-LPS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). To test if <italic>il-34</italic> was a required cytokine for recruiting macrophages in our experimental paradigm, we used CRISPR/Cas9 targeted mutagenesis as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Earley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Oosterhof et al., 2018</xref>) to disrupt <italic>il-34</italic> function to assess the immune infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To verify the efficacy of the gene knockdown in transient <italic>il-34</italic> F<sub>0</sub> Crispr-injected animals, we determined whether they phenocopied a reduced microglia phenotype recently described in <italic>il-34</italic> stable mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuil et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed we found about 40% of the transient <italic>il-34</italic> F<sub>0</sub> Crispr-injected animals to have highly decreased microglial numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). By Sanger sequencing analysis, we verified that these F<sub>0</sub> Crispr-injected animals induced a high frequency of frameshift indels altering reading frames and introducing early stop codons in the <italic>il-34</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that transient <italic>il-34</italic> F<sub>0</sub> Crispr-injected animals after brain-LPS injection indeed had a significantly reduced number of infiltrating macrophages compared with controls (no Crispr injection) after brain-LPS injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>).

To examine this possibility, we investigated whether neutrophils, the other functional leukocytes prominent at early larval zebrafish stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennett et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), could participate in infiltrating the liver along with macrophages. Using live imaging in transgenic zebrafish at four dpf prior to Kupffer cell development, we quantified the numbers of neutrophils and macrophages in the liver 8–10 hpi with control water or LPS, as well as in uninjected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We performed the same brain injection experiments also at 8–10 dpf after Kupffer cell establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Our data interestingly showed that neutrophils also significantly infiltrated the liver after brain-LPS but not in the control brain-water and uninjected groups. Similar to macrophages, neutrophils infiltrated the liver irrespective of the presence of Kupffer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref>). To test whether liver infiltration would still occur at juvenile adult stages, when the liver, blood and lymphatic vasculature, and brain structures are fully mature, we conducted brain tectum injections in 1 month-old zebrafish which had a standard length of 0.8–1 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found at 16–18 hpi that the numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the liver were significantly increased after LPS injection compared with water vehicle injections and uninjected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the liver infiltration persists even at young adult stages. These results implicate that the hepatic response to brain-LPS injection is independent of Kupffer cells, age, or maturity of the brain vasculature and architecture, and drainage of LPS from brain to periphery may still be evident in adulthood. They also raise the possibility that macrophages coordinate with neutrophils for moving into the liver, and signals other than from Kupffer cells can recruit these leukocytes into the liver during systemic inflammation induced by circulating LPS.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Neutrophils and macrophages coordinate to infiltrate the liver during a systemic inflammatory response.</title><p>(<bold>a–b</bold>) Total count of macrophages or neutrophils in liver in control (uninjected and brain-water injected) or brain-LPS challenged animals before and after development of liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) at four dpf and 8–10 dpf, respectively.

Strikingly, a highly significant 3-fold increase of liver-infiltrating neutrophils was found in macrophage-ablated <italic>irf8</italic> morpholino-injected animals after brain-LPS injection at four dpf compared with the control brain-LPS animals, while brain-water injected controls had no neutrophil infiltration into the liver with or without macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). To verify these findings, we used a complementary approach for macrophage depletion by using clodronate-containing liposomes to induce apoptosis in macrophages as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">van Rooijen and Hendrikx, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Both methods of macrophage depletion corroborate to show striking increases in neutrophil recruitment to the liver after brain-LPS microinjection.

However, these infiltrating neutrophils do not appear to fully make up for macrophage functions as they do not exhibit the same dynamic movements or lasting occupation in the liver during the hepatic response to brain-LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). Most of the infiltrating neutrophils are circulating through the liver (&gt;80%) regardless of macrophage presence in the liver during brain-LPS response, albeit a larger fraction is transient (22%) and long-term (1%) after macrophage ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>).

Since the expression of some liver genes decreased but the liver size increased in myeloid-deficient animals after brain-LPS injection, these liver genes may not be associated with growth but rather function.

Recent new knowledge in meningeal lymphatics and glymphatics indicate that macromolecules in the brain can flow from the parenchymal interstitial space into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which drains into the lymphatic vessels or directly into the major veins (sinuses) to enter general circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Louveau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Jung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). In support of this, previous studies using a number of mammalian species (cat, rabbit, dog, and rat) have shown that injection of tracers at 5–100 ul volume such as horseradish peroxidase, India ink or dextran blue into the CSF or brain parenchyma gets drained rapidly into cervical lymph nodes within seconds as well as in entire vasculature within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Zhang et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cserr and Ostrach, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Casley-Smith et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bradbury and Cole, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bradbury et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Szentistvanyi et al., 1984</xref>), while radiolabeled albumin microinjected into the brain parenchyma of different brain regions appear rapidly in the CSF and within 4 hr can be found in cervical lymph nodes and the common carotid arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Szentistvanyi et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Harling-Berg et al., 1989</xref>).

Taken together, studies in mammals indicate the ability for molecules to transport from the parenchyma or CSF-filled ventricles into general circulation either through the lymphatics, or blood vessels directly. However, the physiological impact of brain drainage on the periphery had not been investigated, nor directly visualized. Our study demonstrates that such drainage can be directly tracked in vivo to induce a robust hepatic response defined by an active recruitment of inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils into the liver.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Current model for hepatic response to brain drainage of LPS into the periphery.</title><p>Diagram represents events happening prior to Kupffer cell development in the four dpf zebrafish. Left, at steady-state, peripheral macrophages normally do not migrate into the liver. Right, brain-localized microinjection of LPS leads to systemic distribution of LPS that robustly induces a hepatic response whereby macrophages/monocytes infiltrate the liver. Genes conferring inflammation and acute phase response are highly upregulated. Recruitment of macrophages/monocytes into the liver requires MyD88, a common adaptor protein for TLRs that recognize LPS. Since LPS were found to transiently flow through the liver sinusoids but not appear to accumulate in the liver, it raises the possibility that the requirement for MyD88 may also stem from extrahepatic signals. Although our model illustrates its function only within the liver, whether MyD88 also acts outside of the liver remains to be determined. In addition, IL-34 presumably secreted by the liver and downstream of MyD88 signaling can act as a chemoattractant to macrophages/monocytes expressing CSF1R. Macrophage recruitment may also depend on yet unknown direct or indirect signaling from neutrophils, which infiltrate the liver first subsequent to circulation of LPS.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58191-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Similarly, we found that brain tectum microinjection in zebrafish leads to effects comparable to that known of mammalian intracerebroventricular, intracisternal, and intraparenchymal injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Glascock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ma et al., 2017</xref>), such that the injected LPS in the parenchyma rapidly flows into the CSF compartment (or ventricles) likely via bulk flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>), followed by clearance of LPS and ISF predominantly by lymphatic drainage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). After brain-LPS injection, we found a low-level spread of LPS/CSF from the hindbrain ventricle into the brain parenchyma and surrounding interstitial space prior to LPS accumulation in brain lymphatic cells and passage through the extracranial lymphatic vessels. Whether CSF flows to the brain more widely than the major perivascular spaces upon intracranial injection remains controversial in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ma et al., 2017</xref>), although this appears to occur easily in the larval zebrafish perhaps due to its small brain size conducive to simple diffusion or bulk flow of fluids. Previous work in mice have shown that injected tracers in the subarachnoid CSF or lateral ventricle can enter the brain parenchyma quickly in less than 30 min, and get cleared through paravascular or perineural pathways via the lymphatic system similarly to intraparenchymal injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ma et al., 2017</xref>), indicating the process of drainage from the brain parenchyma may be conserved between zebrafish and mammals. On average, at about 13 min after tectum microinjection of fluorescent LPS in larval zebrafish, we begin to detect the LPS in circulation by fluorescence, albeit at a baseline intensity, far less than that at the injection site and in the ventricles. This is about two times faster than the transit time for a lateral ventricle injection in mice with a fluorescent tracer to reach blood circulation (around 25 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ma et al., 2017</xref>), which is still relatively fast. Two key traits that may endow larval zebrafish a faster rate of drainage of solutes from brain ventricle or parenchyma than in rodents may be: 1) the short physical distances between anywhere in the parenchyma and the nearest ventricle and vasculature, which would span no farther than the width of the brain, approximately a few hundred microns, enabling simple diffusion as a primary mode of transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hladky and Barrand, 2018</xref>, and 2) the lack of lymph nodes, based on the prevailing understanding of the zebrafish anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yaniv et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Küchler et al., 2006</xref>), which are lymphatic structures throughout the lymphatic network in mammals that capture and filter the fluid that exits the CNS before joining circulation. The content and concentration of the molecules leaving the CNS that reach blood circulation may be limited by lymph nodes in mammals, but these restrictions may be more lenient in zebrafish due to a possible lack of these structures. Instead of lymph nodes, we found that the intraparenchymally-injected LPS in larval zebrafish after spreading in the brain parenchyma and interstitial space is engulfed by brain lymphatic endothelial cells (blec), which are non-lumenized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Venero Galanternik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">van Lessen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shibata-Germanos et al., 2020</xref>), as well as collected by the facial and trunk lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). These non-lumenized blec also exist in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shibata-Germanos et al., 2020</xref>), but their contribution to the clearance of solutes from the CSF/ISF is yet unclear. Interestingly, while facial and trunk lymphatic vessels surrounding the brain were filled with LPS by 1.5 hpi, localization of LPS within the brain blood vessels was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>), indicating the main route by which LPS exit the CNS to enter general circulation was via the lymphatic tracts. Additionally, in both zebrafish and mammals, it is also possible that macromolecules to some degree get eliminated by ingestion by perivascular and other phagocytic cells before they drain out to the periphery through the lymphatic-vascular system.</p><p>Whether the process of drainage differs during developmental stages when the tissue boundaries and structures of the brain are less mature, we provide evidence that the peripheral hepatic response to brain-LPS injection may be age-independent in zebrafish. The hepatic response was observed from early to late larval stages, and also in juvenile adults, suggesting passage of inflammatory molecules occurs even after establishment of a fully mature brain architecture (including the blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers). This study focused on the early larval stage at four dpf as it offers a timepoint at which infiltrating macrophage cells can be clearly assessed in the liver without the presence of liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells). At this age, they are also functionally mature with established functional blood-brain barriers and ventricles with choroid plexus and CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jeong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Henson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fame et al., 2016</xref>). Regardless of the route or quantities at which macromolecules can drain out from the brain, our results implicate the process of drainage from brain as an effective mechanism by which the brain can quickly transmit molecular information to the periphery to engage a prompt hepatic response to potential CNS threats.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Responsiveness of liver to systemic inflammation irrespective of Kupffer cells</title><p>Our data demonstrate that the most striking effect of LPS injection into the brain parenchyma was the recruitment of macrophages into the liver in the zebrafish model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In agreement with the liver being most susceptible to systemic inflammation, previous studies using intravenous injection of the endotoxin LPS in different mammalian models have shown an immediate localization of LPS to the liver and less to other organs by tracking radiolabeled LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bikhazi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mathison and Ulevitch, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Braude et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Herring et al., 1963</xref>). Prior to our work, it was not known that introduction of endotoxin into the brain parenchyma can result in the same impact on the liver as that from a systemic administration. These findings beg the question as to how the liver is the predominant and conserved target of circulating LPS and systemic inflammation in vertebrates from zebrafish to mammals. One overarching explanation could simply be related to the sheer blood volume coming from the hepatic artery and portal vein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eipel et al., 2010</xref>) that the liver constantly processes, making it particularly sensitive to inflammatory cues in circulation.</p><p>Kupffer cells have been considered to be key immune cells responsible for producing cytokines and chemokines to recruit neutrophils and other leukocytes that may further propagate systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bilzer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dixon et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, tracking of radiolabeled LPS has shown that circulating LPS was mostly taken up by Kupffer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bikhazi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mathison and Ulevitch, 1979</xref>), implicating these cells as the main sink for endotoxins or microbes. By contrast, our study shows that the liver is capable of responding to systemic inflammation and recruiting neutrophils first and then macrophages, independent of Kupffer cells. We found that starting in the larval zebrafish at four dpf when the liver is already functional and differentiated with diverse hepatic cell types including hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, biliary cells, and stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yin et al., 2012</xref>), but before Kupffer cells are established, other hepatic cells besides the Kupffer cells are capable of signaling to recruit peripheral leukocytes into the liver. Furthermore, while the gut may provide a source of stimulating molecules through the portal vein, we show that the brain is another source of inflammatory cues that can result in immune infiltration of the liver that was not previously appreciated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>IL-34 pathway in mediating immune infiltration of liver triggered by systemic inflammation</title><p>The receptor tyrosine kinase CSF1R (also known as Fms) pathway regulates migration, differentiation, proliferation, and survival at varying degrees of different tissue-resident macrophages and monocytes in mammals and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Oosterhof et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuil et al., 2019</xref>).

Interestingly, among the three known ligands of the zebrafish homolog of the receptor tyrosine kinase CSF1R, namely <italic>csf1a</italic>, <italic>csf1b</italic>, and <italic>il-34</italic>, we found that <italic>il-34</italic> was singly upregulated in the liver upon brain-LPS microinjection.

This is a common feature shared among liver diseases caused by infection, toxic insults, or autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Edwards and Wanless, 2013</xref>). Using zebrafish, we found that macrophages and neutrophils were co-dependent in the process of infiltrating the liver after brain microinjection of LPS. We further showed by in vivo time-lapse imaging an early recruitment of neutrophils in the first few hours was followed by migration or circulation of peripheral macrophages into the liver. This is consistent with previous studies showing early neutrophil recruitment followed by monocyte-derived macrophages in other contexts of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Soehnlein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jenne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kim and Luster, 2015</xref>).

Using two complementary approaches to deplete macrophages either by <italic>irf8</italic> genetic deficiency or liposomal clodronate treatment in zebrafish, we found that macrophages may be important to limit neutrophil infiltration into the liver upon brain drainage of LPS. An excessive level of neutrophil infiltration may lead to a heightened release of toxic metabolic products and proteolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Prame Kumar et al., 2018</xref>), thereby causing more damage to the liver. Macrophages in the liver are known to remove apoptotic or impaired neutrophils by phagocytosis, which in turn can modulate their own signaling based on the receptor(s) used during neutrophil clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gregory et al., 2002</xref>). Since deficiency in <italic>irf8</italic> causes an elimination of macrophages but also an increase in baseline neutrophil number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shiau et al., 2015</xref>), we cannot completely rule out that a larger neutrophil pool may contribute to the significant increase in neutrophil infiltration after brain-LPS injection in <italic>irf8</italic> morpholino-injected animals. Nonetheless, the agreement in effect from two distinct methods of macrophage ablation, and the observed intimate macrophage-neutrophil contacts in the hepatic region strongly support reciprocal interactions between macrophages and neutrophils.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Perspective on the brain-liver connection</title><p>Our study shows that the drainage following microinjection of LPS into the brain robustly caused peripheral macrophages and monocytes to infiltrate the liver, a process mediated by an upregulation of the cytokine IL-34 in the liver presumably downstream of activating the Toll-like receptor adaptor protein MyD88, and signaling from neutrophils. Treatment with a subset of anti-inflammatory drugs indicates that glucocorticoid activity or inhibiting NF-kB activation suppresses immune cell infiltration during hepatic response to systemic inflammation. These results prompt intriguing questions on how a hepatic response to a central disruption may reflect the presence and severity of CNS inflammation; whether a hepatic response contributes to the recovery or disruption of brain homeostasis; and to what extent does drainage of harmful or inflammatory molecules from brain to circulation explains for the peripheral problems associated with primarily CNS pathologies. LPS were used as an effective tool for brain-localized microinjection in this study to allow tracing of inflammatory molecules originating in the brain to assess peripheral consequences, but whether endogenous proteins and other molecules could be secreted by the brain and drained into circulation to cause similar effects as the LPS do on the liver remains to be investigated. Some examples that lend support to this possibility relate to hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease that has a known association with liver dysfunction, such as brain tau secretion and its presence in the CSF as well as clearance of toxic accumulations of brain amyloid-beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pernègre et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bacyinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Nho et al., 2019</xref>); however the link between the brain secretion or drainage and liver disruption is yet unclear.

F test was used to compare variances. For unequal variances, Welch’s correction was used on the two-tailed t-test. For multiple comparisons of 3 or more groups, one-way ANOVA test was applied followed by pair-wise tests to determine the pair(s) showing significant differences. GraphPad Prism eight was used to run statistical tests and create graphs. Scatter bar plots show symbols representing biological replicates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jonathan Gable for critical insights and discussions on our manuscript.

signals from the brain affect peripheral tissues. Using live imaging and genetic manipulations they reveal that following injection of labeled LPS in the brain robust infiltration of macrophages occurs in the liver. They show this response involves IL-34 and MyD88 and is coordinated with neutrophils. This work illustrates system wide responses to inflammatory stimuli and interactions between organs via the circulation of pro-inflammatory signals.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Drainage of inflammatory macromolecules from brain to periphery targets the liver for macrophage infiltration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jean-Pierre Levraud as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Helen Stolp; Jean-Pierre Levraud.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The question of interplay between CNS and peripheral inflammation is important, and a systemic imaging approach, as zebrafish allows, appears well suited. Live imaging experiments are of high quality and the measurements of macrophage infiltration in the liver were compelling. However, it is unclear if needle-mediated LPS injection in the brain of a larva with a not fully mature BBB is properly modelling neurological injury. The mechanism of LPS drainage from the brain, at the very least, requires better characterization. The analysis of the molecular and cellular pathways involved in liver infiltration was also not fully convincing, with modest changes and improper controls.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study by Yang, Jimenez, Earley, Dixon and Shiau, titled &quot;Drainage of inflammatory macromolecules from brain to periphery targets the liver for macrophage infiltration&quot; utilises innovative molecular biological techniques in zebrafish to show that inflammatory mediators drain from the brain to the periphery affecting macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the liver. There are many aspects of this work that are of interest, but the whole work seems a bit confused.</p><p>This work seems to mix two important points. The first is how brain inflammation signals to the liver and the second is age specific liver recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils in response to inflammation, and the signalling mechanisms involved in this process. The Introduction, such as it is, addresses this first point, suggesting that liver damage is a common occurrence in conjunction with inflammatory brain injury or degeneration.</p><p>However, the authors show the movement of labelled LPS and tracer molecules through the brain interstitial fluid, to the CSF and then on to the periphery within a short period following brain injection. They also show that a systemic LPS injection causes the same response in the liver, and that blocking circulation before doing brain injections inhibits the response. Together these data imply that LPS is being removed from the brain, reaching the periphery and then stimulating its response. While this is interesting, it is not clear that this same pathway exists in normal neurological injury or equivalent interventions in the mammalian brain, where injected substances are found to stay within the parenchyma, and therefore it is unclear how translatable their findings are to other species, or how meaningful they are for an normal injury paradigm. It seems that these authors are studying macrophage and neutrophil recruitment to the liver in the context of peripheral inflammation – it is not clear that the brain has any specific involvement.</p><p>Additionally, the authors are using a very large dose of endotoxin, that possibly models meningitis (at best), so if inflammation is usually passed from the brain to the periphery via this pathway (CSF and lymphatics), it is likely to be to a much less extend that what is being investigated here. This work also does not mention the blood brain barrier in the zebrafish, its stage of development and any potential response to inflammation of the brain barriers or CSF production/flow that might confound their results. The authors did not address any potential confounder of the young animals used in this study.</p><p>The second half of this work, looking at the differential liver response to systemic inflammation (whether it comes via the brain or not) is more interesting, but still has some significant flaws in its current form.</p><p>The myd88 and IL-34 experiments were interesting in showing some involvement of these signalling molecules/systems, however these did not have a large effect, suggesting other signalling systems are also likely to be involved, and the modification of expression was generalised, so the importance of the brain or liver (or other structure) was not investigated.</p><p>While the use of animals with manipulation of their macrophages is interesting, the authors appear to have validated the models by assessing microglial numbers in the brain, rather than cell number in the periphery. Given the different dynamics of macrophage turn over in the brain compared to the periphery, and the lack of any clear central contribution to the results presented in this study, it is not clear that this is a meaningful validation of the models (e.g. PU-1, IL-34).</p><p>The authors also write about the liver response to inflammation as if it is a surprise, rather than one of the major known functions of the liver. That being said, the use of the developing system does show some really interesting results regarding neutrophil and macrophage recruitment to the liver, and these could be the focus of a very interesting paper if followed up appropriately. The idea that the macrophage/neutrophil recruitment is differentially related to functions such as cytokine production, the acute phase response and factors related to liver health and function is certainly interesting. Could authors produced data on liver growth from their imaging studies to support the idea raised in Figure 5?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors aim to investigate the link between brain pathology and liver inflammation/damage. For this they use the zebrafish as a model system, which is well suited to analyze such responses systemically. Much of the work is quite interesting and well supported by high quality in vivo imaging data and whole mount in situ's analyses.</p><p>As very apparent from the title and Discussion section, the main point the authors want to make is not that systemic LPS/<italic>E. coli</italic> can cause influx of macrophages, and neutrophils, in the liver, which was quite thoroughly investigated. Instead the authors appear most interested in the drainage of bacterial material from the brain. Some of the main conclusions were not really investigated in my opinion. I think there could potentially be several other reasons for the occurrence of LPS material in the blood. Even though brain vasculature of zebrafish at this early embryonic stage have some properties of a mature blood brain barrier, i.e. expression of occludins/claudins and exclusion of dyes with certain molecular size, it is very immature and could permit passage of LPS not by a specific route by diffusion. Additionally, the brain is punctured by a relatively large needle, which could somehow induce leakage. Or perhaps the pressure of the injection somehow forces the LPS into the blood stream. I guess the 10kd dextran data shows that at least molecules of this size don't exit the brain, suggesting the BBB is not massively disrupted. The injection and the LPS likely also cause cell death in the brain and indeed it seems microglia contain cell debris. Could this somehow contribute to cause the drainage? If the brain drainage is to be the main conclusion of this work, I think this would require more experimental support. E.g. perhaps look also at later developmental stages whether LPS still drains.</p><p>Another question is whether the LPS once in circulation accumulates in the liver, causing the attraction of macrophages, or if the influx is caused otherwise. The LPS could also be taken up in endothelial cells or some other vascular cell type, followed by attraction of leukocytes. Please comment on this.</p><p>The cause of the increased neutrophil infiltration could be related not to the absence of macrophages but as a side-effect of the macrophage depletion (irf8 loss of function skews differentiation towards neutrophils and clodronate causes death of macrophages, very likely followed by attraction of neutrophils by the corpses if they're not cleared properly).</p><p>The authors conclude that glucocorticoid activity suppresses the hepatic response to systemic inflammation. The fish were kept in a quite high dose of dexamethason (100 uM) for more than a day. The fish are rapidly developing at this stage, and dex could affect several mechanisms depending on glucocorticoid activity, including the response of the leukocytes. Therefore, I don't understand what the authors base this conclusion on.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting work, mostly based on elegant live imaging. However, if the fact that injection of LPS injection in the brain induces infiltration of macrophages in liver is convincingly established, much of the rest of the analysis is not so strong.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Morpholino experiments: there are no control morphants, in any experiment! This is particularly critical for Figure 3A where the difference is really small and could be a MO injection side effect.</p><p>2) Same problem with il34 CRISPR experiments: the comparison should be made with control crispants injected with an irrelevant sgRNA+CAS9 (alternatively, and even better, a stable il34 mutant could be used)</p><p>3) Is there a general increase in macrophage numbers (ie, emergency myelopoiesis) consecutive to LPS injection? This has to be measured and compared with the increase in the liver.</p><p>4). Figure 1—figure supplement 1: the strong, compact mfap4 signal seen in the liver after LPS injection is not consistent with the relatively modest macrophage infiltration (no more than 20 cells) seen by live imaging. Could hepatocytes be induced to express mfap4 in these conditions? There are mfap4 reporter lines (to label macrophages), so that would be easy to test.</p><p>5) Regarding the terminology &quot;Kupffer cells&quot;, applied to liver macrophages, a more cautionary tone is needed throughout the text and figures. Localisation in the sinusoids is generally considered a feature defining Kupffer cells. It would also be worth citing some of the ancient but extant literature that established that most teleost fish have very few Kuppfer cells (e.g., Sakano and Fujita, 1982)</p><p>6) Figure 2: an assessment of the fraction of intracranially-injected LPS that leaks to the periphery is necessary.</p><p>7) The brain injection causes a temporary hole in the BBB. Can one exclude that this is how LPS reaches the periphery?</p><p>8) Figure 4D: since total neutrophil numbers increase in irf8 morphants, it is not clear if this result is significant. This measurement should be somehow normalized to the total neutrophil count.</p><p>9) Figure 4—figure supplement 3: a 27% reduction in neutrophil numbers is rather low. Csf3r ablation is also known to have some effect on macrophage populations (Liongue et al., Blood 11::2535, 209). A quantification on the impact of macrophages is required here.</p><p>10) The tnnt2a MO experiment is not conclusive, since circulation was blocked from the onset, resulting, at 4dpf, in a smaller brain, a strong edema, and probably general inflammation. Drug- mediated inhibition of heartbeat, or physical blockade of bloodflow, would be more convincing.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Drainage of inflammatory macromolecules from brain to periphery targets the liver for macrophage infiltration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>In the manuscript by Yang et al., the authors investigate in zebrafish the effect of leakage of pro-inflammatory LPS form the brain in peripheral tissues. Using beautiful live imaging and genetic manipulations, they find that macrophages infiltrate the liver and their recruitment depends on myd88 and il34, thus underscoring the existence of rapid communication between the brain and the liver that may play a role in immune surveillance.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Two new reviewers and one reviewer that evaluated the previous version of this work agreed in that the manuscript has been greatly improved with substantial new data and an in-depth revision. Two key experimental manipulations, the knock down of myd88 and il34, are now backed by stable loss of function mutations and several experiments have been strengthen with new or improved analyses. However, there are still two important experimental manipulations using morpholinos that have not been properly controlled. In addition, editorial changes are needed to better explain the use of LPS injections as an experimental tool.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use morpholinos targeting csf3r and pu.1 expression and draw important conclusions based on those experiments. Given the inherent problems of morpholinos, particularly for inflammation studies, it is necessary to support the use of those reagents with stable mutants and/or additional controls. If mutants are not available or cannot be generated, the knockdown experiments may be further supported with rescue experiments and or F0 Crispr, in which case the significance of any findings related to those experiments should be tempered with an appropriate discussion of the caveats.</p><p>2) While brain injections of LPS can be a useful tool as used in this work, it is hardly a physiological condition. An editorial revision should address caveats and limitations, perhaps highlighting the use of this experimental approach as a tool.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58191.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We are interested to explore a possible route through which the brain may affect liver function simply by a drainage of pro-inflammatory substances or molecules, albeit even at a trace level, to instigate systemic inflammation, rather than a direct brain to liver signaling. Regarding the second point, our results do not indicate age-specific recruitment of leukocytes into the liver. We have now included new additional data showing juvenile adults (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) as well as late-stage larvae at 8-10 dpf (Figure 4B), when BBB/brain structures are mature, show liver infiltration consistent with the earlier four dpf larval stage that our study focuses on.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the authors show the movement of labelled LPS and tracer molecules through the brain interstitial fluid, to the CSF and then on to the periphery within a short period following brain injection.

Previous work in mice and other mammalian species have shown that injected tracers in the subarachnoid CSF or lateral ventricle can enter the brain parenchyma quickly in less than 30 minutes, and get cleared through paravascular or perineural pathways via the lymphatic system similarly to intraparenchymal injections (Iliff et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2017). These studies provide the groundwork to suggest that our findings related to brain drainage in zebrafish may be broadly relevant to other species.</p><p>We have improved the discussion of these points with new data and revised text. New experiments were conducted to provide a more detailed analysis of tracing LPS directly (Figure 2A-B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Video 7) as well as text that include more discussion of previous studies in other species in the Discussion section: “Drainage of macromolecules…” Overall, our study aims to address fundamental questions relating to brain-periphery interaction rather than any specific brain injury or disease model, although results of this work could have relevance to these conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems that these authors are studying macrophage and neutrophil recruitment to the liver in the context of peripheral inflammation – it is not clear that the brain has any specific involvement.</p></disp-quote><p>At the outset of our study it was not known whether direct signaling between the brain and the liver would occur upon injection of inflammatory activators into the brain; our data support the conclusion that drainage of LPS from the brain into circulation occurs and is sufficient to explain liver inflammation and immune cell recruitment. We therefore focus our analysis and interpretation on the consequences of such transport of molecules from brain to periphery, which addresses an important area yet under-explored and under-appreciated. While much research has focused on mechanisms of penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSF) barrier to enable entry of a peripheral agent into the brain parenchyma such as those relating to infectious diseases causing brain dysfunction (for example, by neurotropic viruses including <italic>Rabies lyssavirus</italic>, West Nile virus, and cytomegalovirus) and drug delivery to the brain (Hladky and Barrand, 2016; van den Pol, 2009), far less attention has been given to investigating the reciprocal transfer from brain to circulation and its consequences. Therefore, we think our study has significant implications for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the authors are using a very large dose of endotoxin, that possibly models meningitis (at best), so if inflammation is usually passed from the brain to the periphery via this pathway (CSF and lymphatics), it is likely to be to a much less extend that what is being investigated here. This work also does not mention the blood brain barrier in the zebrafish, its stage of development and any potential response to inflammation of the brain barriers or CSF production/flow that might confound their results. The authors did not address any potential confounder of the young animals used in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>The threshold at which an endotoxin or another inflammatory substance could cause a liver response in other species is an interesting point, however this goes beyond the scope of our current study.</p><p>We agree that a discussion on the brain barriers (BBB and BCSF) would be helpful for our interpretation. We should add that it is known that by four dpf (the stage of our experimentation), the BBB has been shown to be established based on Claudin-5 and ZO-1 expression in the cerebral microvessels as well as restricted permeability to HRP and other tracers (Jeong et al., 2008), as well as the choroid plexus/ventricle flow (Henson et al., 2014; Fame et al., 2016). We have now included new data examining the blood and lymphatic brain vasculatures (Figures 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2) that suggest the passage of LPS relies largely on the lymphatic and ISF in the brain rather than the brain blood vessels, before entering peripheral circulation. We have also added text in the Introduction, Results section and Discussion section that discuss these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second half of this work, looking at the differential liver response to systemic inflammation (whether it comes via the brain or not) is more interesting, but still has some significant flaws in its current form. The myd88 and IL-34 experiments were interesting in showing some involvement of these signalling molecules/systems, however these did not have a large effect, suggesting other signalling systems are also likely to be involved, and the modification of expression was generalised, so the importance of the brain or liver (or other structure) was not investigated</p></disp-quote><p>Since morpholino-based gene knockdown does not completely eliminate the target gene function and can yield partial effects, we have now added new data using stable null mutants which do not have a functional target gene. The results significantly strengthen our previous findings that myd88 and il34 mechanisms are essential for liver infiltration. The effects were clear-cut. Both il34 and myd88 null mutants exhibited no liver infiltration after brain-LPS injection, rather than merely reduced as in the morphants. We added these data in Figure 3D and 3H. Based on our data showing liver specific gene upregulation of il34 after brain-LPS injection (Figure 3) and the known endogenous expression of myd88 in the normal larval liver (Koch et al., 2018), they suggest that myd88/IL-34 mechanism functions in the liver. However, we do agree that the specific cell type(s) and region(s) that require these mechanisms still remain to be fully determined, and it is possible that multiple cell types rely on these pathways to coordinate the liver infiltration. We have added this point to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the use of animals with manipulation of their macrophages is interesting, the authors appear to have validated the models by assessing microglial numbers in the brain, rather than cell number in the periphery. Given the different dynamics of macrophage turn over in the brain compared to the periphery, and the lack of any clear central contribution to the results presented in this study, it is not clear that this is a meaningful validation of the models (e.g. PU-1, IL-34).</p></disp-quote><p>In zebrafish, LOF mutations in these genes (Pu.1, irf8, and il-34) directly affect microglia development during early embryonic and larval stages. Furthermore, the peripheral macrophage number is directly linked with brain microglial number because these peripheral macrophages in part seed the brain to form microglia. For example, il-34 is required for migration and colonization of peripheral macrophages in the brain, and thus a loss of microglia is a direct readout for disruption of il34 function (Kuil et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2018), whereas phenotype in the peripheral macrophages is not clear-cut due to the intrinsic variation in macrophage cell number between individuals. Loss of peripheral macrophages leading to a complete absence of microglia has also been directly shown in spi1b/pu.1 morphants/mutants (Li et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2015) and irf8 morphants/mutants (Shiau et al., 2015). Therefore, a readout of a loss of microglia has been used to effectively and efficiently demonstrate and validate a loss of function in these genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also write about the liver response to inflammation as if it is a surprise, rather than one of the major known functions of the liver. That being said, the use of the developing system does show some really interesting results regarding neutrophil and macrophage recruitment to the liver, and these could be the focus of a very interesting paper if followed up appropriately. The idea that the macrophage/neutrophil recruitment is differentially related to functions such as cytokine production, the acute phase response and factors related to liver health and function is certainly interesting. Could authors produced data on liver growth from their imaging studies to support the idea raised in Figure 5?</p></disp-quote><p>As for clarification, we do not think a response by the liver to systemic inflammation is surprising, but the underlying mechanisms that make this organ a usual suspect are interesting and poorly understood. In particular, how might leukocyte infiltration in the liver contribute to the hepatic response. To address an aspect of this, we think the direct visualization of macrophage/neutrophil infiltration during a hepatic response, which had not been conducted prior to our work, offers the much-needed insights to begin to understand this process.</p><p>We agree the differential effects were interesting. As suggested, we have followed up on this result to address whether an absence of immune infiltration affects liver growth after brain-LPS challenge in pu.1 morphants. We used two separate cohorts of controls animals (baseline and control-MO injected WT groups) to determine typical liver growth after 48 hpi comparing LPS injection to water vehicle injection. Interestingly, we found that instead of a reduction in liver size as one might predict from a reduction in liver genes expression, liver sizes increased in LPS injected pu.1 morphants, indicating liver growth was likely impeded by immune cell infiltration during inflammation. We have added new data as presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and relevant text in the Results section. The summary schematic in Figure 5A has also been updated with the new result reflected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors aim to investigate the link between brain pathology and liver inflammation/damage. For this they use the zebrafish as a model system, which is well suited to analyze such responses systemically. Much of the work is quite interesting and well supported by high quality in vivo imaging data and whole mount in situ's analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for recognizing the value and interest in this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As very apparent from the title/discussion, the main point the authors want to make is not that systemic LPS/E. coli can cause influx of macrophages, and neutrophils, in the liver, which was quite thoroughly investigated. Instead the authors appear most interested in the drainage of bacterial material from the brain. Some of the main conclusions were not really investigated in my opinion. I think there could potentially be several other reasons for the occurrence of LPS material in the blood. Even though brain vasculature of zebrafish at this early embryonic stage have some properties of a mature blood brain barrier, i.e. expression of occludins/claudins and exclusion of dyes with certain molecular size, it is very immature and could permit passage of LPS not by a specific route by diffusion. Additionally, the brain is punctured by a relatively large needle, which could somehow induce leakage. Or perhaps the pressure of the injection somehow forces the LPS into the blood stream. I guess the 10kd dextran data shows that at least molecules of this size don't exit the brain, suggesting the BBB is not massively disrupted. The injection and the LPS likely also cause cell death in the brain and indeed it seems microglia contain cell debris. Could this somehow contribute to cause the drainage? If the brain drainage is to be the main conclusion of this work, I think this would require more experimental support. E.g. perhaps look also at later developmental stages whether LPS still drains.</p></disp-quote><p>These are all good points. We have conducted several new experiments to provide a more thorough characterization of the brain LPS microinjection, in order to provide full confidence of our brain-specific injection method, and to clarify the process of brain drainage of LPS. To do this, we analyzed the detailed kinetics of LPS movement starting from the localized brain tectum injection using a high-speed and high-sensitivity stereoscope cMOS capture at 1 Hz (see new data added in Figure 2A-B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, and Video 7) and the same brain injected animals were subjected to confocal imaging at later timepoints to characterize localization of LPS relative to blood and lymphatic vessels (see new data added in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2). While most of the LPS remained in the ventricular system after tectal injection, we found the hindbrain ventricle to be the key region from which LPS appeared to leak out into interstitial spaces. Interestingly, LPS accumulated within the brain lymphatic endothelial cells (blec) as well as the facial and trunk lymphatic vessels as shown by co-localization of LPS within the lymphatic reporter <italic>mrc1a:GFP</italic> but <italic>not</italic> within the brain vasculature as marked by <italic>kdrl:mCherry</italic> (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2), indicating that the presence of peripheral LPS did not likely stem from a disruption of the BBB or a direct passage through brain blood vessels. We also do not see a typical microglial response at the time of LPS passage to indicate a link between these or neuronal cells contributing to drainage, see Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2 where microglia are labeled. We generated a new <italic>mpeg1:BFP</italic> line in order to visualize LPS/blood or lymphatic vasculature/microglia in 3-colored fish. Instead, LPS appeared to enter circulation via a mechanism directed by the lymphatics for clearing away excess substances from interstitial fluids.</p><p>These results are now provided as multiple new data files: Figure 2A-B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Video 7. We are replacing the previous Figure 1—figure supplement 5 on the drainage and passage of dextran with this new large data set, because the tracing of dextran does not directly nor accurately reflect LPS movement, and the use of a manual image acquisition at only one frame every minute is too slow to yield reliable and clear tracing of the dye. Due to the nature of the previous imaging setup, we also resorted to using a more blunt-ended needle for better visualization purposes than the fine-tipped needle we use for our routine brain microinjections (as shown in Figure 2A-B and Video 7). Our new tracing analyses address LPS drainage directly, and the movie acquisition has significantly improved using an automated capture at a very rapid speed of 1 Hz (60x faster than previous study) for about 1 hour of continuous imaging.</p><p>In terms of the concern of the maturity of the brain structures at the stage of our experiments at 4dpf, we have extended our studies into older stages when the brain structures (including BBB) are fully mature. We conducted experiments in 1 month old juvenile adults, which still showed significant increases in both macrophage and neutrophil numbers in the liver after brain-LPS injection (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1), as well as at late larval stages at 8-10 dpf after several days of feeding, substantial presence of Kupffer cells and BBB maturation that the hepatic response persists after brain-LPS injection (see Figure 4B). These results indicate that the hepatic response to the brain perturbation is independent of age or maturity of the brain vasculature and architecture, and drainage of LPS from brain to periphery may still be evident even in young adults.</p><p>Finally, we should add that our data corroborate previous data shown by others indicating that by four dpf the BBB and brain ventricles are well established with boundaries and restrictions (Jeong et al., 2008; Henson et al., 2014; Fame et al., 2016); what we have observed for LPS passage at four dpf using our injection method matches a stereotypical pathway in every fish we analyzed and does not appear to be a random or broad leakage or diffusion process that allows LPS to get out to the periphery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another question is whether the LPS once in circulation accumulates in the liver, causing the attraction of macrophages, or if the influx is caused otherwise. The LPS could also be taken up in endothelial cells or some other vascular cell type, followed by attraction of leukocytes. Please comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>Good question. Tracing the movement of LPS from the brain to the periphery revealed its transient flow through the liver sinusoids prior to infiltration by macrophages/neutrophils (Figure 2, Video 5). However, LPS did not appear to accumulate or bind to cellular structures within the liver as we did not detect LPS there (Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Video 5), suggesting either the transient exposure of hepatic cells to LPS, or yet unknown extrahepatic signals trigger the hepatic response to systemic LPS. Although the liver endothelial cells were not found to bind to LPS, other major peripheral blood vessels do, such as the posterior cardinal vein (PCV), which we show in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. This could certainly be a source of cells that could attract macrophages, but how macrophages are signaled to enter the liver where there is no direct LPS accumulation remains an open question. Text has been added in the results to point to these different possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The cause of the increased neutrophil infiltration could be related not to the absence of macrophages but as a side-effect of the macrophage depletion (irf8 loss of function skews differentiation towards neutrophils and clodronate causes death of macrophages, very likely followed by attraction of neutrophils by the corpses if they're not cleared properly).</p></disp-quote><p>These are great points. We had the same concerns so (1) the analysis of control brain-water injections in both irf8 and clodronate based depletions, and (2) use of 2 complementary approaches (irf8 LOF and clodronate) based on very different mechanisms and distinct caveats were critical to provide interpretable results if they both show the same effect. If there were dramatic “side-effects” we expected to see significant baseline neutrophil infiltration in the absence of LPS, but there was not (Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Examining clodronate-induced macrophage effects in our own hands, we only found partial depletion of the macrophage population, and the remaining macrophages (arrows) either appear morphologically normal or take on a ball-shape but not appearing inflammatory or clustering in groups of corpses, suggesting an unlikely scenario for a mass immune response (representative data provided on right for your reference).</p><p>Although irf8 knockdown causes a significant increase in baseline numbers of neutrophils, we did not observe an apparent increase in neutrophils surrounding the liver after LPS compared with controls (Figure 4E and data not shown), and furthermore, the shift in neutrophil behaviors after LPS towards more “macrophage-like”, taking on a more transient and long-term association with the liver stood out from those infiltrating in controls (with normal macrophages) (Figure 4J). These traits suggest distinct changes in neutrophils that may not be explained merely by an increased baseline number. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that an increased baseline neutrophil number could contribute to the increased liver infiltration, so we have added text to address this point in the Discussion section. We believe the agreement in the result from these two different methods logically lend support to this interpretation of the data, although the potential caveat should be stated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors conclude that glucocorticoid activity suppresses the hepatic response to systemic inflammation. The fish were kept in a quite high dose of dexamethason (100 uM) for more than a day. The fish are rapidly developing at this stage, and dex could affect several mechanisms depending on glucocorticoid activity, including the response of the leukocytes. Therefore, I don't understand what the authors base this conclusion on.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon reviewing this point, we revisited our documentation, and realized that the water-soluble form of dex we used does not have the normal dex MW of 392.46 g/mol, because the vendor provides this reagent at 65 mg of dex per gram due to cyclodextrin used to balance the chemical (which is in a side note that we unfortunately had missed); product information can be found at https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/Σ/D2915?lang=en&amp;region=US. We very much thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue, which led us to catch this mistake in a timely manner. All places reporting this concentration has been corrected to show 6.5 uM.</p><p>We agree that it is possible that the glucocorticoid activity could be directly affecting the immune cells, liver cells, or both. We have modified the text to specify that it suppresses the macrophage infiltration, which our data shows (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), rather than specifying which cell type it may affect. In the Discussion section, the text now reads: “Treatment with a subset of anti-inflammatory drugs indicates that glucocorticoid activity or inhibiting NF-κB activation suppresses immune cell infiltration during hepatic response to systemic inflammation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is an interesting work, mostly based on elegant live imaging.

We have now addressed this using stable il34 mutants which became available recently. See Figure 3H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is there a general increase in macrophage numbers (ie, emergency myelopoiesis) consecutive to LPS injection? This has to be measured and compared with the increase in the liver.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there appears to be a general increase in overall macrophage number after LPS injection, as expected. However, there is no actual increase in the liver to speak of, because at baseline (uninjected) without LPS there are effectively zero macrophages normally in the liver at four dpf (Figure 1A, Figure 4A); so we are looking at an induction of macrophages in the liver rather than an “increase”. This is the important reason for using four dpf for most of our experiments as it provides a time window when baseline is effectively zero, and any presence of a macrophage in the liver usually marks an extraordinary event due to an immune response. Based on the behaviors of the infiltrated macrophages after LPS injection, a substantial fraction of them (~13%) entered and remained in the liver for a long period of time (several hours)(Figure 1—figure supplement 5), suggesting their actions were not random and fleeting merely due to a general cell number increase, but rather tailored for the liver.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4). Figure 1—figure supplement 1: the strong, compact mfap4 signal seen in the liver after LPS injection is not consistent with the relatively modest macrophage infiltration (no more than 20 cells) seen by live imaging. Could hepatocytes be induced to express mfap4 in these conditions? There are mfap4 reporter lines (to label macrophages), so that would be easy to test.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. First, a point of clarification, we have seen at 4dpf brain-LPS injections that the range of infiltrated macrophage numbers can go well above 20, and also above 30 per liver which is substantial considering the small number of total cells in the liver in larval zebrafish (Figure 1C, Figure 3D, 3G, 3G, Figure 4A), and that normally it would take an age of 14 dpf to reach numbers of ~ 20 resident macrophages per liver (Figure 1A). However, we were also curious about the reason why in some cases of the mfap4 in situ after brain-LPS injection there was seemingly a broad liver expression. We have added the following text and data provided in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 to address these points.</p><p>“Due to some examples of broad liver <italic>mfap4</italic> in situ expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) in comparison to a discrete number of infiltrating macrophages by live imaging after brain-LPS injection, we assessed whether this could be explained by an induction of ectopic <italic>mfap4</italic> expression in the liver upon LPS activation. Using a transgenic line <italic>mfap4:tdTomato</italic> to mark cells expressing the <italic>mfap4</italic> gene, we found <italic>mfap4</italic> restricted to macrophages and absent in liver cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), suggesting the broad liver <italic>mfap4</italic> expression may be diffuse in situ signals coming from a liver more densely populated by infiltrated macrophages.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Regarding the terminology &quot;Kupffer cells&quot;, applied to liver macrophages, a more cautionary tone is needed throughout the text and figures. Localisation in the sinusoids is generally considered a feature defining Kupffer cells. It would also be worth citing some of the ancient but extant literature that established that most teleost fish have very few Kuppfer cells (e.g., Sakano and Fujita, 1982)</p></disp-quote><p>Ultimately, Kupffer cells are defined by their macrophage origin and normal residence in the liver, namely “liver-resident macrophage”. We appreciate the suggestion to make our definition more clear so we have modified the text at the start of the relevant Results section.“To relate macrophage presence in the liver after brain-LPS injection to macrophages that normally reside in the liver (which we refer to as Kupffer cells), we analyzed the developmental timing of Kupffer cells, which had not been previously described, starting at the 4 dpf larval stage to the 40 dpf juvenile adult stage (Figure 1A).” Because in vivo imaging of Kupffer cells has remained scant/absent, we think the dynamic nature of these cells to inform their localization and relationship with the sinusoids remains a very open question and poorly explored in all species. Sakano and Fujita, 1982 used ultrastructural microscopy to examine cells in the hepatic sinusoids in 19 species of teleosts but not directly in zebrafish. Because they were looking in very restricted areas of the liver for Kupffer cells, this could be the reason that they would have missed these macrophages. Currently, a formal and careful analysis of the development of Kupffer cells in zebrafish is lacking, but the first direct analysis of adult Kupffer cells was recently demonstrated (He et al., 2018), in agreement to our findings. To the best of our knowledge, the normal liver-resident macrophages characterization in Figure 1A represents the first dataset describing Kupffer cells in the developing zebrafish. To provide context to these results, we have added the following text in the Results section: “Prior to this work, Kupffer cells were thought to be missing or sparse in zebrafish and other teleost species (Goessling and Sadler, 2015; Sakano and Fujita, 1982), but a recent study tracing adult zebrafish Kupffer cells to their hematopoietic origin (He et al., 2018), and the data presented here collectively provide the first evidence for the prevalence of Kupffer cells in the zebrafish liver akin to their mammalian counterpart.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2: an assessment of the fraction of intracranially-injected LPS that leaks to the periphery is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now done several experiments to directly trace LPS passage in real time from brain to periphery. Quantification of relative amounts drained out has been calculated based on real time tracking of the fluorescence. Please see new additional data provided in Figure 2C-D, Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and the complementary Video 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The brain injection causes a temporary hole in the BBB. Can one exclude that this is how LPS reaches the periphery?</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted a more thorough analysis of the brain microinjection method and LPS movement. The original supplemental data (previous Figure 1—figure supplement 5) that analyzed the passage of dextran is not representative of the movement of LPS, so we are replacing it with multiple new data files: Figure 2A-B, Supplementary Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Video 7. Due to the nature of the previous imaging setup that required manual image acquisition, we resorted to using a more blunt-ended needle for better visualization purposes than the fine-tipped needle we use for our routine brain microinjections (see Figure 2C-D, Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Video 7). Therefore, the “hole” as referred does not represent our typical brain injections. Our new tracing analyses address LPS drainage directly, and the movie acquisition has significantly improved using an automated application at a very rapid speed of 1 Hz (60x faster than previous study) to reliably trace LPS for a continued 1 hour of imaging (Video 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4D: since total neutrophil numbers increase in irf8 morphants, it is not clear if this result is significant. This measurement should be somehow normalized to the total neutrophil count.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid concern. Although irf8 deficiency is known to cause a significant increase in baseline numbers of neutrophils, we did not observe an apparent increase in neutrophils surrounding the liver after LPS compared with controls (Figure 4E and data not shown), and furthermore, the shift in neutrophil behaviors after LPS towards more “macrophage-like”, taking on a more transient and long-term association with the liver stood out from those infiltrating in controls (Figure 4J). These traits suggest distinct changes in neutrophils that may not be explained merely by an increased baseline number. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that an increased baseline neutrophil number could contribute to the increased liver infiltration, so we have added this point in the Discussion section. We believe the agreement in the result from the two different methods (irf8 MO and clodronate) logically lend support to our interpretation of the data, and have added text to point out the potential caveat in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 4—figure supplement 3: a 27% reduction in neutrophil numbers is rather low. Csf3r ablation is also known to have some effect on macrophage populations (Liongue et al. Blood 11::2535, 209). A quantification on the impact of macrophages is required here.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We have conducted this control experiment by using in vivo imaging in double transgenic zebrafish carrying both macrophage and neutrophil reporters for control and csf3r MO conditions. We found again an average reduction in neutrophil number at ~30% in csf3r morphants compared with controls, but no significant change in macrophage number, suggesting no general effect on macrophage cell number due to csf3r MO (data added to Figure 4—figure supplement 3C). We also want to add that although the reduction of overall neutrophil number is modest on <italic>average</italic> ~30%, the maximum decrease in our cohort was as high as a 65% drop in number (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). Our assessment did not show macrophage reduction as that indicated by Liongue et al., but matched the csf3r zebrafish mutant which was reported to have normal macrophage numbers but ~ 50% reduction in neutrophils (Pazhakh et al., 2017). Liongue et al., however, examined at younger stages using only the csf1ra (fms) marker which may explain for the difference, but these results appear overturned by their own later publication showing that csf3r mutants have only neutrophil-specific phenotypes, and normal macrophages (Liongue and colleagues in Basheer et al., 2019) consistent with Pazhakh et al., 2017. Taken together, csf3r perturbation appears to target neutrophils specifically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The tnnt2a MO experiment is not conclusive, since circulation was blocked from the onset, resulting, at 4dpf, in a smaller brain, a strong edema, and probably general inflammation. Drug- mediated inhibition of heartbeat, or physical blockade of bloodflow, would be more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of a more effective method better suited for this experiment that could block circulation without substantial levels of side effects (including pharmacological chemicals we have read). We would welcome any specific suggestion on a proven method to block blood flow in zebrafish. To our knowledge, tnnt2a MO has been the most robust and frequently used for the purpose of stopping blood flow. It indeed affects development since blood flow is completely blocked from the beginning, but it does still allow us to perform an injection of LPS into the brain tectum to examine liver effects and macrophage behaviors, because these structures are still intact. For example, we found few to zero macrophages in the liver of tnnt2 morphants after brain-LPS injection similar to control brain-water injections despite presence of macrophages all around the liver (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). Despite the developmental hindrance due to a lack of blood flow, we think this reagent is effective for our intended purpose.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Two new reviewers and one reviewer that evaluated the previous version of this work agreed in that the manuscript has been greatly improved with substantial new data and an in-depth revision.

Both morpholino- and F0 Crispr injection- mediated <italic>csf3r</italic> knockdown corroborate to suggest a possible neutrophil role in recruitment of macrophages into the liver during inflammation. While neither method yields a total <italic>csf3r</italic> elimination to deplete most neutrophils, a stronger hindrance to macrophage infiltration may be possible from a complete <italic>csf3r</italic> depletion.” Additionally, we have edited text to soften the conclusion made from csf3r knockdown, instead of a requirement for neutrophil signaling for macrophage infiltration of liver, our revised text states macrophages coordinate with neutrophils. These changes were also made in the Abstract and the subsection “Liver infiltration by macrophages may be driven and coordinated by neutrophils”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While brain injections of LPS can be a useful tool as used in this work, it is hardly a physiological condition.

We have made several text modifications in the manuscript to address its limitations and highlight the use of LPS as our tool to trace molecules starting from the brain to understand its possible impact on the periphery. We list here all the major edits.</p><p>In the Abstract we have modified the text to say: “Using traceable lipopolysaccharides (LPS), we reveal that drainage of these inflammatory macromolecules from the brain led to a strikingly robust peripheral infiltration of macrophages into the liver independent of Kupffer cells.”</p><p>In the Introduction, we highlighted it as a tool: “To this end, we investigated if a brain perturbation triggering inflammation, using a brain-localized LPS microinjection as an experimental means, could trigger a peripheral organ response mediated by macrophages. [….] By using fluorescently traceable LPS in the brain as an experimental paradigm, we show that inflammatory cues could originate from the brain and trigger immune infiltration of the liver, a process not previously appreciated involving drainage of the macromolecules from brain to circulation.”</p><p>In the Discussion section, we provide a more thorough explanation as well as limitations to the use of LPS: “LPS were used as an effective tool for brain-localized microinjection in this study to allow tracing of inflammatory molecules originating in the brain to assess peripheral consequences, but whether endogenous proteins and other molecules could be secreted by the brain and drained into circulation to cause similar effects as the LPS do on the liver remains to be investigated. Some examples that lend support to this possibility relate to hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease [...]”</p></body></sub-article></article>
