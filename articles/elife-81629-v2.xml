In this study, we phenotypically characterised B-cell populations from the Intelliselect Transgenic mouse (Kymouse) demonstrating full B-cell development competence. Comparison of the naïve B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires of Kymice BCRs, naïve human, and murine BCR repertoires revealed key differences in germline gene usage and junctional diversification. These differences result in Kymice having CDRH3 length and diversity intermediate between mice and humans. To compare the structural space explored by CDRH3s in each species’ repertoire, we used computational structure prediction to show that Kymouse naïve BCR repertoires are more human-like than mouse-like in their predicted distribution of CDRH3 shape. Our combined sequence and structural analysis indicates that the naïve Kymouse BCR repertoire is diverse with key similarities to human repertoires, while immunophenotyping confirms that selected naïve B cells are able to go through complete development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transgenic mouse</kwd><kwd>B cell</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1159947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kellam</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R015708/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Richardson</surname><given-names>Eve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A commonly used immunoglobulin loci-transgenic mouse, the Kymouse, has B cells that go through complete development and have receptor repertoires that show key differences in encoding gene frequencies but structural similarity in their most variable regions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Twenty-five years of progress in genetic engineering from the first immunoglobulin (Ig) transgenic mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brüggemann et al., 1989</xref>) culminated in 2014 in the integration of a complete human Ig haplotype in mice for the first time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Humanised Ig loci-transgenic animal models have proven extremely useful in therapeutic antibody discovery; 20 of the 127 therapeutic antibodies licensed in the US or EU as of April 2022 were derived from transgenic mouse platforms (data from Thera-SAbDab; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raybould et al., 2020</xref>). Transgenic platforms have also found a new application in vaccine response modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sok et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pantophlet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walls et al., 2020</xref>). As humanised animal models become the source of a growing number of therapeutics and play an increasingly important role in the evaluation of novel vaccine candidates, it is crucial to understand the degree to which their B-cell repertoires can be considered representative of humans.</p><p>Contemporary Ig transgenic animal models vary according to the number of genes and localisation of the inserted human Ig loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Green, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brüggemann et al., 2015</xref>). In Kymab’s Intelliselect Transgenic mouse (Kymouse), a complete set of human variable (V), diversity (D), and junction (J) genes of the IGH locus as well as the V and J genes of the Igλ and Igκ loci were inserted at the sites of the endogenous mouse loci. The mouse constant regions were retained, preserving downstream interactions with endogenous intracellular signalling components and cell membrane Fc receptors, resulting in functional, fully active chimeric antibodies. Kymice exhibit normal B-cell production and maturation and the resulting B-cell receptors (BCRs) are diverse, with human-like CDRH3 lengths and evidence of somatic hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). However, the baseline phenotypic diversity in B cells and BCRs in the Kymouse has not been fully described.</p><p>B cells are an integral part of the humoral immune response due to their ability to produce antibodies against diverse antigens, providing protection against infection. B cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, where they undergo several phases of antigen-independent development leading to the generation of immature B cells. B cells are routinely classified based on their maturation status, antibody isotype, and effector function. Ig gene rearrangement during these early stages of B-cell development results in the expression of a mature BCR that is capable of binding to antigen. This is followed by positive and negative selection processes, to eliminate non-functional and self-reactive immature B cells. Surviving B cells complete antigen-independent maturation in the spleen, producing immunocompetent naïve mature B cells that subsequently develop into either follicular or marginal zone B cells. In response to vaccination or invading microbes, antigen-specific B cells within secondary lymphoid organs differentiate into antibody-producing cells, early memory cells, or rapidly proliferate and form structures known as germinal centres (GCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2007</xref>). GCs are inducible lymphoid microenvironments that support the generation of affinity-matured, isotype-switched memory B cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells. Long-lived plasma cells secrete high-affinity antibodies, and memory cells can readily elicit an efficient antibody immune response upon re-exposure to the immune stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corcoran and Tarlinton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weisel and Shlomchik, 2017</xref>). Iterative cycles of B-cell hypermutation and selection within the GC leads to an accumulation of affinity-enhancing mutations and ultimately to the progressive increase of serum antibody affinity, a process known as antibody affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacob et al., 1991</xref>). Antibody-secreting plasma cells play critical roles in protective immunity on the one hand and antibody-mediated autoimmune disease on the other. During immune responses a small fraction of newly generated plasma cells enter either the bone marrow or the lamina propria of the small intestine where they populate specialised survival niches and become long-lived plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lemke et al., 2016</xref>) thus maintaining antibody titres for extended periods.</p><p>The variable domain of a BCR is composed of a heavy chain and a light chain. Each of the chains in the antibody has three hypervariable regions known as the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which make most contacts with the antigen. The heavy chain locus consists of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments, which recombine to form the variable domain of the heavy chain (V<sub>H</sub>). These genes are referred to as the IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ genes, respectively. The first two CDRs of the heavy chain, CDRH1 and CDRH2, are encoded by the IGHV gene alone, while the third and most variable CDR, CDRH3, spans the IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ gene junctions. The insertion of random and palindromic nucleotides at the VD and DJ junctions further contributes to the diversity of the CDRH3, ensuring binding diversity to different antigens and epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu and Davis, 2000</xref>). Each of the light chain loci, kappa and lambda, consist of V and J gene segments but no D gene segments, and both the germline and the recombined light chain variable region (V<sub>L</sub>) are less diverse than their heavy chain counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins and Watson, 2018</xref>). These genes are referred to as the IGKV and IGKJ or IGLV and IGLJ genes for the kappa and lambda chains, respectively: we use IGKLV or IGKLJ to refer to the V or J genes of either light chain locus collectively.</p><p>Due to the greater diversity of the heavy chain, most next-generation sequencing (NGS) of BCR repertoires (BCR-seq) has focused on the heavy chain; lower throughput methods exist for identifying the light chain pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Curtis and Lee, 2020</xref>). The resulting BCR sequences can be aligned to reference germline gene databases to infer most likely germline gene origins and insertions or deletions at the V(D) or (D)J junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2013</xref>). Alignment of BCRs to common germline genes also allows inference about clonal structure, as sequences sharing common germline gene assignments as well as homology in the CDRH3 loop may be inferred to have arisen from a common progenitor B cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greiff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yaari and Kleinstein, 2015</xref>). The amino acid sequences of these heavy chains can also be functionally examined through annotation with structural tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kovaltsuk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marks and Deane, 2020</xref>). Changes in the pattern of CDRH3 shapes in BCR repertoires have been observed along the B-cell differentiation axis in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kovaltsuk et al., 2020</xref>) but the extent to which the CDRH3 shape differs between humans and mice has not been explored.</p><p>Here, we have characterised the frequency of GC B cells, memory B cells, and long-lived plasma cells from spleens, lymph nodes, and bone marrows of antigen-inexperienced Kymice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). The frequencies of these B-cell subsets as well as the breadth and nature of their BCR repertoires constitute the first step in our understanding of how the immune system of this model organism responds to different antigens, vaccines, and pathogens that are both of scientific and of therapeutic interest. Examining the nature of the naïve BCR repertoire in Kymice through both single-cell and bulk sequencing and structural analysis shows that the Kymouse naïve BCR repertoires are more human-like in their distribution of CDRH3 shapes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Antigen naïve Kymice exhibit similar B-cell subpopulation frequencies</title><p>We characterised the B-cell subpopulations within spleen and lymph node samples of 12 antigen-inexperienced Kymice using an 11-colour flow cytometry panel that incorporated a range of B-cell lineage markers to identify both murine memory and GC B-cell populations. A canonical gating scheme organises B cells by their maturation status – from transitional B cells through naïve, non-switched and ultimately class-switched memory B cells. To look at the heterogeneity of the B-cell subpopulations in more detail, we incorporated unbiased Leiden clustering on the multi-parameter fluorescently activated cell sorting (FACS) data. Sorted cells separated into two large clusters, B cells and non-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, within the B-cell population immature isotypes (IgD and IgM) were enriched in naïve cells, whereas markers CD95 and GL7 were enriched in GC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The murine memory B-cell population has been described to comprise five subpopulations defined by the progressive transition from naive-like to more memory-like cells and the surface markers CD80, CD73, and PD-L2 have previously been reported to enable their distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tomayko et al., 2010</xref>). Using a low dimensional UMAP representation, we observed distinct staining patterns of these markers in the memory B-cell compartment and were able to distinguish between 12 major B-cell populations, including transitional, naïve, and activated as well as six distinct memory subsets, defined as (1) PD-L2<sup>hi</sup>, (2) CD73<sup>hi</sup> CD80<sup>hi</sup> PD-L2<sup>low</sup>, (3) CD80<sup>low</sup>, (4) PD-L2<sup>hi</sup> CD80<sup>hi</sup> CD73<sup>low</sup>, (5) CD80<sup>hi</sup>, and (6) CD73<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). GC B cells formed a small and well-separated cluster whose small frequency was not surprising given that these were antigen naïve animals. Based on the three memory markers (CD80, CD73, and PD-L2) the relative frequency of the total memory B cells was 6.60% ± 2.51%, and the frequency of CD95 and GL7 positive GC cells was 0.18% ± 0.26%. The median expression profile of each subset is shown as a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The antigen naïve B-cell populations in un-immunised and non-infected Kymice are therefore normal and consistent between different Kymice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>UMAP projections of sorted cell populations from the spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow of Kymice.</title><p>UMAP projections of sorted cell populations identified using unsupervised clustering from spleen and lymph nodes (<bold>A</bold>) or from bone marrow samples (<bold>C</bold>) can be used to visualise marker expression on the combined cells that were used for sorting and to characterise their phenotypes. UMAP projections show a clear separation between B cells and non-B cells for both sample types. The projections are coloured by the 12 resolved cell types in the spleen and lymph nodes (<bold>A</bold>) and the six resolved in the bone marrow samples (<bold>C</bold>). Normalised and scaled marker expression and frequencies were used to visualise mouse-to-mouse variation for each of the resolved cell types in the spleen and lymph nodes (<bold>B</bold>) or the bone marrow samples (<bold>D</bold>). The expression profiles are homogeneous across mice. In spleens and lymph nodes non-class-switched IgD+ naive B cells were the predominant cell population, followed by non-B cells and IgM+ naive B cells, reflective of a tissue that has not been exposed to antigen. In bone marrow samples on the other hand the most numerous populations were non-B cells, followed closely by class-switched IgG+ B cells, a result that reflects a tissue niche that supports survival of long-lived antibody producing cells.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81629-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>B cells in the bone marrow are class switched with variable levels of surface BCR expression</title><p>To understand the B-cell profile beyond spleen and lymph nodes, we also profiled the bone marrow cells of mice. We characterised bone marrow samples using a nine-colour flow cytometry panel that incorporated a range of B-cell lineage markers. The staining panel was designed to identify plasma cells as well as class-switched B-cell subsets in antigen-inexperienced mice. As expected, we saw that the cells separated again into two large clusters, B cells and non-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The expression profiles of the subsets were again plotted as heatmaps showing the median expression profiles of each subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Within the B-cell cluster, we identified several discrete subsets marked by the expression of different BCR isotypes. B cells were clustered into five distinct subpopulations, including immature IgD+ and IgM+ cells, mature IgM+ and IgG+ B cells, and plasma cells.

We then compared the relative usage of the IGHJ genes of humans and Kymice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Kymice tended to use IGHJ4 (47.3% in Kymice versus 44.2% in humans) and IGHJ6 (32.8% in Kymice versus 28.6% in humans) while using the other genes (IGHJ1, IGHJ2, IGHJ3, IGHJ5) slightly less frequently, in particular IGHJ5 (11.1% in Kymice versus 15.1% in humans). Estimation statistics revealed that the differential IGHJ gene usage between Kymouse and human resulted in a decrease in the CDRH3 length for Kymouse of 0.85nt (95% CI: 0.77, 0.94; p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Finally, we looked at the number of nucleotide insertions in the VD and DJ junctions. The results showed that Kymice VD junctions are on average 3.73nt shorter than humans (95% CI: 3.68, 3.78; p&lt;0.001), with a mean insertion size of 3.35nt compared to 7.30nt for humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Equally, the Kymice DJ junctions are on average 3.68nt shorter than humans (95% CI: 3.63, 3.73; p&lt;0.001), with a mean insertion size of 2.91nt compared to 6.77nt for humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, the number of junctional nucleotides inserted in the Kymouse heavy chain is 7.33 fewer than in humans (95% CI: 7.25, 7.40; p&lt;0.001), with an average of 7.55 in Kymice compared to 14.88 in humans. These results show that the main factors that give rise to the shorter CDRH3 lengths in the Kymouse compared to humans is the reduced number of nucleotide insertions in the VD and DJ junctional regions, and the differential usage of IGHD germline genes between the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This is consistent with our results from the single-cell analysis.</p><p>A correlate of shorter CDRH3 length is a reduction in the theoretical CDRH3 diversity obtainable, particularly given that this is caused by a reduction in the non-templated insertion of nucleotides. To examine the diversity of the repertoires, we considered how many unique CDRH3s or clonotypes can be found in a given repertoire, normalised by the total number of sequences observed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows that the ratio of the number of unique CDRH3s to the number of sequences is comparable in Kymice and humans, and that both are considerably higher than in C57BL/6 mice.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Examination of the CDRH3 and clonal diversity in the primary B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires of humans, Kymice, and mice reveal comparable diversity on a repertoire level, despite the described differences in CDRH3 lengths.</title><p>Overlap analysis reveals considerably greater diversity among human repertoires. The top rows pertain to exact CDRH3 (amino acids) and the bottom rows to clonotypes (same IGHV, IGHJ, and greater than 90% amino acid identity across length-matched CDRH3s).

We calculated the Shannon diversity of the CDRH3 and clone distributions, a measure which takes into account both richness and abundance and found comparable diversity across all repertoire types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). The diversity observed depends on CDRH3 length considered, with the mouse and Kymouse repertoires having greater diversity at shorter lengths (peak diversity at lengths 12 and 13, respectively) and the human repertoires having greater diversity at lengths greater than 18 amino acids (peak diversity at length 15) for both CDRH3s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and clonotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Given that junctional insertions are required to reach lengths of 23 or greater in the human and Kymouse data, this supports the hypothesis that the reduced junctional diversification in naïve Kymouse repertoires limits CDRH3 diversity at the longest lengths, however the greater diversity at shorter lengths is seen. It is also clear that the Kymouse occupies a region in CDRH3 diversity and length between wild-type mice and humans.</p><p>Finally, we considered the CDRH3 and clonotype overlap among mice, Kymice, and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). The overlap among CDRH3s is highest between individual mice and individual Kymice. On average, 5.1% of CDRH3s were shared between any two Kymice and 3.4% of CDRH3s shared between any two mice, compared to just 0.12% of CDRH3s shared between any two human subjects. Despite comparable CDRH3 diversity reported for individual Kymice and humans, over 25 times more CDRH3s are shared between pairs of Kymice on average than between humans. Clonotype sharing was also higher between individual Kymice (average 7.92% vs 0.84% in humans). Interestingly, clonotype sharing was significantly higher among individual Kymice (average: 7.92%, range: 6.04–11.14%) than between individual mice (average 4.55%, range: 3.52–5.90%) despite comparable CDRH3 sharing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The Kymouse repertoires are structurally more human-like than mouse-like</title><p>Ultimately, genetic diversity is reflected in the structure of the resulting BCR and secreted antibody protein. Therefore, we compared the structural similarities of the BCR repertoires via structural annotation of the CDRs. We first compared the CDRH1 and CDRH2 loops, which adopt a limited set of conformations known as canonical classes. For both CDRH1 and CDRH2 the Kymouse repertoires group separately from human repertoires, but group with human repertoires before the mouse repertoires, in their usage of canonical forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). All canonical forms are strongly predicted by IGHV germline gene subgroup (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) especially as these sequences are non-mutated. Despite the effects of the differential IGHV usage observed in humans and Kymice, this does not make the Kymouse canonical class usage more similar to mice as the murine repertoires use different canonical classes than either the human or humanised repertoires. Interestingly, six of the nine murine IGHV germlines encode a single canonical form, H1-8-A, suggesting more limited structural diversity in murine CDRH1s.</p><p>We then performed structural comparisons of the shapes of the human, Kymouse, and mouse CDRH3s. CDRH3s do not adopt canonical conformations, so we used two different approaches: firstly, structural annotation which consists of comparison to a CDRH3 structural database and annotation with a structural cluster ID, and secondly full CDRH3 modelling. Of the 1944 possible structural clusters in the CDRH3 structural database, 1594 were observed in at least one repertoire. The majority (1270) of these clusters were observed in all species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). There was an observable difference among repertoires in the species origin of the structural clusters observed, i.e., each species was biased in the structural space it tended to use. The majority of structural clusters used in human and Kymouse repertoires were of human origin (57.5% and 55.0%, respectively), while the majority of structural clusters used in mouse repertoires were of murine origin (64.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>As described, the CDRH3 lengths in the human dataset were on average 2.36aa longer than those in the Kymouse, and 4.21aa longer than those in the C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As we considered only CDRH3s between length 4 and 16 in this structural analysis, this difference was reduced to a difference of 0.45 amino acids between human and Kymouse repertoires (CI 0.43, 0.47) and 0.63 between human and mouse repertoires (CI 0.62, 0.65). The average CDRH3 lengths of the human templates in the FREAD database were longer than those in the murine templates (12.6aa compared to 11.2aa, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). We checked that the observed differences in structural template usage by humans, Kymice, and C57BL/6 mice were not just reflecting differences in the availability of templates at the difference CDRH3 lengths. Therefore, we stratified the FREAD database by CDRH3 length and ran the datasets against each CDRH3 length separately. If the preferential usage of human-specific templates by humans and humanised mice, and vice versa for mice, is simply a result of random sampling from the FREAD database, we expect the ratio of the proportion of human templates in human repertoires to the proportion of human templates in the FREAD database to be approximately 1 across all CDRH3 lengths, and below 1 across all CDRH3 lengths for mice. Instead, we see a significant enrichment (at the 1% level) of species-specific templates at multiple CDRH3 lengths.</p><p>The human repertoires are more structurally variable than are the humanised murine or murine repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B and C</xref>). The murine repertoires are the least variable (there is the smallest range of distances between any two given subjects for mice, and on average the smallest average distance between pairs of subjects). All the Kymouse repertoires were structurally closer (Euclidean distance in Z-normalised CDRH3 structural cluster usage) to any given human repertoire than to any C57BL/6 mouse repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B and C</xref>). With no correction for sample size or for CDRH3 length distribution, the humanised murine and human repertoires form a monophyletic cluster that is sister group to the murine repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The CDRH3 structural repertoire of Kymice is human-like: distance between CDRH3 structural cluster usage profiles is measured with Euclidean distance in Z-normalised proportions.</title><p>This is calculated pairwise between subjects and these distances are clustered hierarchically. <bold>A through C</bold> show these pairwise distances stratified by the type of comparison.

We calculated Rand indices for 100 subsamples with equal numbers of each CDRH3 length to control for any length effect; in all subsamples, the human and humanised repertoires could be clustered separately from the murine repertoires resulting in an adjusted Rand index of 1.0. Further, in all 10 subsamples, at least one human repertoire was more structurally similar to a given humanised murine repertoire than to at least one other human repertoire (between 5 and 9 of 10 subjects per subsample). In conclusion, even when adjusting for sample size and differing CDRH3 length distribution, the repertoires of Kymouse are structurally more similar to human repertoires than they are to murine repertoires according to the homology-based structural annotation technique.</p><p>The species bias we observed in structural cluster usage, which is assigned via sequence similarity to a structural template, meant that a template-free modelling procedure might lead to different results. We modelled non-singleton clonotype representatives from humans, Kymice, and mice using the deep learning tool ABlooper, then compared the resultant CDRH3s via C<sub>α</sub> RMSD. Analogously to clustering of the CDRH3 template database, we performed greedy clustering with a 0.6 Å cut-off. This clustered the 43,378 models with 41,397 unique CDRH3s into 6546 clusters. The modelled human CDRH3s were on average longer than Kymouse CDRH3s by 0.99 amino acids (CI: 0.94, 1.05) and longer than mouse CDRH3s by 1.23 amino acids (CI: 1.17, 1.29). We observed a slightly different clustering by usage than via the homology approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>), with monophyly of Kymice, and Kymice and humans, but not of mice. The distribution of intersubject differences was such that the human/Kymouse and human/human comparison distributions are largely overlapping. Indeed, the differences between all distributions were less extreme with overlap between most of the distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The monophyly of Kymice and humans versus mice is observed when subsampling in order to equalise the CDRH3 length distribution, i.e., it is not driven by differences in CDRH3 length. The deep learning-based modelling approach supports the earlier finding that Kymice CDRH3 repertoires are more structurally similar to human CDRH3 repertoires than murine repertoires, and vice versa; the extent of this similarity is greater than observed with the homology modelling approach.</p><p>In conclusion, the sequence differences in the repertoires which were described in the germline and diversity sections do impact upon the repertoire of CDR structures which are observed in the Kymouse. The distribution of canonical forms in CDRH1 and CDRH2 is distinguishable, but usage is human-like. In the CDRH3, both structural annotation and full structure prediction indicate that the naïve Kymouse CDRH3 structural space is human-like, indicating that Kymice repertoires offer comparable structural starting points for the production of antigen-specific antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>A state-of-the art humanisation tool scores Kymouse sequences as fully human</title><p>We finally tested whether the Kymouse sequences are considered human by a state-of-the-art humanisation tool.

All sequences produced scores in the ‘Positive (High Score)’ category which had minimal anti-drug antibody events reported among therapeutic antibodies. No murine sequences were classified as human.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The phenotypic diversity of B cells in the spleens, lymph nodes, and bone marrows of the Kymouse, determined by immunophenotyping panels, showed that the main immunologically relevant B-cell subpopulations could be identified at appropriate cell frequencies, consistent with the Kymouse being fully competent for B-cell development and capable of a complete humoral immune response. As expected, the baseline levels of the immune relevant subsets, i.e., memory B cells and GC B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes as well as the plasma cells in bone marrow were low reflecting the lack of immune exposure beyond commensal and environmental antigens during mouse husbandry.</p><p>While somatic hypermutation plays a key role in the development of mature high-affinity antibodies, the breadth of an immune response to an antigen is limited at first by the diversity produced by recombination and non-template additions of the non-somatically hypermutated, germline-encoded heavy chain Ig genes and their pairing with similarly rearranged Ig light chain genes that together comprise the BCRs in the naïve B cells. Paired V<sub>H</sub>/V<sub>L</sub> sequencing of the naïve Kymouse BCR repertoire revealed a near 50:50 Igκ/Igλ ratio which more closely approximates the human Igκ/Igλ ratio of 60:40 than the murine Igκ/Igλ ratio of 95:5. Analysis of encoding gene frequencies revealed different average gene frequencies in all encoding gene categories between Kymice and humans: IGHV and IGKLV genes and gene subgroups, IGHD gene subgroups and IGHJ genes. There was also a significant difference in CDRH3 length with significantly shorter CDRH3s in the Kymouse repertoires than in human repertoires, in part due to IGHD gene usage with decreases in the length of the IGHD gene in the CDRH3. However, deep unpaired V<sub>H</sub> sequencing which increased our sequence depth by greater than 200-fold showed that naïve Kymouse BCRs have a CDRH3 length distribution that is intermediate between human and mouse repertoires (on average ~14aa for Kymouse versus ~16aa for human repertoires and ~12aa for mice). A great proportion of this effect is ascribable to fewer nucleotide insertions at both the VD and DJ junctions during junctional diversification in the Kymouse with on average 7.33nt fewer inserted in Kymouse compared to humans over the two junctions. This reduced junctional diversification in the Kymouse leads to lower diversity in longer CDRH3s and greater clonotype overlap between individual Kymice than between individual humans, consistent with the observation that junctional insertions are a key factor in the publicness of antibody CDRH3s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaffe et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Deep unpaired V<sub>H</sub> sequencing also showed that the IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ gene usage profiles in Kymice are distinct from human profiles consistent with our lower depth paired analysis. However, IGHV and IGHJ gene usage frequencies did not perfectly separate Kymice from human repertoires in clustering analyses, indicating that these Kymice gene usage frequencies might fall within natural human variation in these frequencies. This contrasts with the previous NGS characterisation of the OmniRat in which both IGHV and IGHD gene usage was distinct from humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joyce et al., 2020</xref>). However, Kymouse repertoires did show a preference for shorter IGHD genes: this was also observed in the NGS characterisation of OmniRat BCR repertoires, suggesting that a preference for shorter IGHD genes may be common across transgenic rodent platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joyce et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, different germline gene distributions in the Kymouse may affect how representative transgenic models are of immune responses to germline-targeting immunogens especially if a desired naïve BCR frequency is at lower level than in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Data present here allows the pre-assessment of gene usage frequencies to interpret such studies.</p><p>While antibody sequence diversity is clearly the primary determinant of the functional diversity of a repertoire, there exists some sequence and structural redundancy. We decided therefore to look at whether there were differences between repertoires in terms of their distribution of CDRH3 structures: changes in CDRH3 structural cluster usage have been previously observed along the B-cell development axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kovaltsuk et al., 2020</xref>) and allow comparison of repertoires derived from different species. Despite the differences in germline gene usage established here, modelled structural comparison of the human and humanised repertoires to the murine repertoires showed murine repertoires use mostly CDRH3 structural clusters that have been identified from murine antibodies, while human and Kymouse repertoires use CDRH3 structural clusters identified from a more even distribution of species of which more than 50% were identified from human antibodies. Further, grouping of the exact distribution of CDRH3 structural clusters reveals that Kymouse structural cluster usage is closer to human usage than murine usage, accounting for CDRH3 length differences. When modelling the CDRH3s (as opposed to performing an approximation via structural annotation), part of the ‘structural distance’ between the human, mouse, and Kymouse repertoires disappeared suggesting part of the signal observed in homology modelling is due to different sequences with similar predicted shapes. This suggests that despite the observed differences at the sequence level, the CDRH3 structural shapes adopted by the Kymice BCRs are within the distribution of observed human shapes.Finally, using the Hu-mAb humanness classifiers, all Kymouse and human sequences are classified as human, meaning that naïve sequences isolated from the Kymouse are predicted to have similar immunogenicity in humans to sequences isolated from humans themselves.</p><p>Kymice contain the Ig haplotype of a single human subject consistent with reduced diversity relative to outbred human B-cell repertoires where the considerable allelic and haplotypic diversity observed in human populations has significant effects on the expressed BCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodriguez et al., 2022</xref>). Given the Kymouse’s use of a single haplotype, and differences in the observed germline gene usages, it is likely that the BCR response to antigen stimulus in the Kymouse will represent only a subset of the possible diversity of the outbred human response and this should be in consideration in vaccine response modelling.</p><p>In conclusion, although naïve BCR repertoires of the Kymouse have key distinctions from human repertoires at the sequence level they are comparable to the human repertoires in terms of CDRH3 structural usage. The less diverse primary repertoire of the Kymouse does not appear to be an impediment to its use as a source of high-affinity therapeutic antibodies, and indeed a higher frequency of shorter CDRH3 lengths could be favourable in terms of the developability profile of any mAbs derived from these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raybould et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to the analysis of naïve, antigen-inexperienced repertoires in the current study, we and others have also used the Kymouse as a model system in multiple immunisations with a broad range of different viral, bacterial, and parasite antigen targets, as well as self-antigens for therapeutic applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walls et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sainson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petzer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hastie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saghari et al., 2022</xref>). The polyclonal serum response elicited in these Kymice has been shown to be functional and the isolated monoclonal antibodies bind physiologically important epitopes recognised by similar human antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rujas et al., 2020</xref>).

While the C57BL/6 mouse and Kymouse sequences were mostly full length (IMGT positions 1–128), the human sequences were in most cases missing FWR1 (IMGT positions 1–26 under the IMGT CDR definition). As the human sequences were non-mutated, we considered it reasonable to simply fill in FWR1 according to the sequence found in the assigned germline. For the human and Kymouse sequences, the RF model trained on the IGHV gene assigned by IgBLAST were used for scoring, while for the murine sequences all seven (IGHV1-7) RF models were used to score the sequence and the highest score was selected.

This mouse does not have &quot;the full set of variable genes&quot;, it's in fact missing many known IGHV genes. More accurate to say that it was the first mouse in which an entire IGH haplotype was integrated or something along those lines.</p><p>2. Line 54: The term &quot;BCRs&quot; has already been defined on line 52.</p><p>3. Lines 81-82: &quot;V&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, and &quot;J&quot; already defined above.</p><p>4. Line 123: How were spleen and lymph node populations pooled?</p><p>5. Lines 132-136 and 141-145: More detail is needed here. What protocol was used to conduct RT-PCR and generate VDJ libraries? What type of MiSeq libraries? 2x300 bp? Where UMIs used? I presume that PRESTO was also used? This should be stated as well as other parameters used/details regarding sequence read processing.</p><p>6. Lines 140 and 149: Should be &quot;FACS&quot;?</p><p>7. Lines 144: A description of processing steps leading to the 412,493 sequences would be useful here. (Same comment for human data, line 151).</p><p>8. Section starting at Line 147: Can you be more explicit? Did you generate additional data from the same samples used by Ghraichy et al? Or did you reanalyze data from this study?</p><p>9. Section starting at line 154: Is C57BL/6 the most appropriate strain for comparison? Are the constant gene regions from 129S7? Some rationale/discussion should be provided here regarding the genetic background of the Kymouse.</p><p>10. Line 164: &quot;IGHV&quot; and &quot;IGHJ&quot; are not defined.</p><p>11.

Line 204: What was done in cases for which the germline assignment was ambiguous due to variation not captured in FWR1?</p><p>13. Lines 243-244: It's not clear what data is available on opig? Authors should outline what is provided. It appears to be processed data. Is the raw data available on any other public repository? E.g., EMBL, NCBI?</p><p>14. Line 262: You reference Figure 1C before 1B in the text. The panel order should probably be switched. In addition, it looks like the figures in panels 1C and 1D are currently in reverse order. The labels in panel D seem to match panel A, and C appears to match panel B.</p><p>15. Lines 318-319: I believe the authors mean &quot;dendrogram&quot; rather than &quot;phylogenetic tree&quot;.</p><p>16. Lines 319-320: It is not necessarily the case that the ky mouse and human are the &quot;same&quot; in the number of genes used, which is quite clear from the heatmap in panel 2A. The authors should be more precise in their language. As noted earlier, the Kymouse does not carry a full set of all human IGHV genes but instead carries IGHV genes found on just the human haplotype that was used to construct the mouse. Your data clearly show this, e.g., based on your &quot;outlier&quot; sample, which is probably the only sample in your cohort that carries IGHV4-38-2. Based on the analysis by Lee et al. 2014, it would appear that the Kymouse does not carry IGHV4-38-2. The authors should not overgeneralize.</p><p>17. Is there a reason the authors did not also compare gene usage profiles for IGK and IGL datasets to control human samples?</p><p>18. Lines 343-350: It would seem appropriate to also compare CDR3 lengths at an individual level, rather than pooling data across all individuals in each species and taking the average. Again, the assumption is being made that all humans come from the same distribution – pooling the data across all human samples, for example, makes it difficult to assess inter-individual variation. It would be worthwhile at least provide plots and summary data for this in the supplement.</p><p>19. Line 540: &quot;BCR&quot; already defined previously.</p><p>20. Lines 557-559: It could also be worth noting that these transgenic animals may in fact poorly represent the full extent of responses (in terms of diversity) observed across the human population. This will undoubtedly deserve attention as data from these and other transgenic animal models are interpreted in the future. It would be interesting to understand the authors' viewpoints on what uses or limitations the Kymouse (and other similar transgenic animals) might have.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81629.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide additional analysis of Ig light chain (IGK and IGL) repertoires in Ky mice to complement the IgH analyses in the current manuscript.

RT-PCR was performed to amplify the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domains, and standard 2x300bp Illumina libraries were generated before sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer as previously described (Lee et al. 2014).

To identify possible causes for a difference in CDRH3 length, we compared IGHD gene alignment length and length of nucleotide insertions at the VD and DJ junctions. While there was a small but significant (5% level) difference in IGHD gene alignment length (average 4.6aa ± 0.06 vs. 4.4aa ± 0.08), the largest difference is in insertion length at both the VD and DJ junctions (average 7.8 nt ± 0.01 vs. 4.1nt ± 0.1, 7.3nt ± 0.02 vs. 3.7nt ± 0.1). A significantly greater proportion of the Kymouse primary repertoire does not have junctional insertions compared to the human repertoire: 19.1% of the Kymouse sequences had no VD insertions, while 8.2% of the human sequences lacked VD insertions. 14.1% of Kymouse sequences had no DJ insertions while 4.5% of human sequences lacked these insertions. Over 10 times as many of the sequences in the Kymouse repertoires lacked junctional insertions compared to human repertoires (3.8% in Kymice vs. 0.3% in humans).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide a more thorough discussion of the potential uses and limitations of this animal model in evaluating human immune responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important take-away from the paper.

Given the Kymouse’s use of a single haplotype, and differences in the observed germline gene usages, it is likely that the BCR response to antigen stimulus in the Kymouse will represent only a subset of the possible diversity of the outbred human response and this should be consideration in vaccine response modelling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Additional clarifications of previous studies of immune responses in Ky mice compared to humans.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added further clarification via expanding on the section in the Discussion section, including all relevant literature.</p><p>Line 1476:</p><p>“In conclusion, although naïve BCR repertoires of the Kymouse have key distinctions from human repertoires at the sequence level they are comparable to the human repertoires in terms of CDRH3 structural usage. The less diverse primary repertoire of the Kymouse does not appear to be an impediment to its use as a source of high-affinity therapeutic antibodies, and indeed a higher frequency of shorter CDRH3 lengths could be favorable in terms of the developability profile of any mAbs derived from these systems (Raybould et al. 2019). In addition to the analysis of naïve, antigen-inexperienced repertoires in the current study, we and others have also used the Kymouse as a model system in multiple immunisations with a broad range of different viral, bacterial and parasite antigen targets, as well as self-antigens for therapeutic applications (Walls et al. 2020; Jiao et al. 2020; Sainson et al. 2020; Petzer et al. 2020; Hastie et al. 2021; Richardson et al. 2021; Saghari et al. 2022). The polyclonal serum response elicited in these Kymice has been shown to be functional and the isolated monoclonal antibodies bind physiologically important epitopes recognised by similar human antibodies (Rujas et al. 2020). Indeed, a number of studies have showed the Kymouse is able to elicit monoclonal antibodies equivalent to those found in humans exposed to the same antigen (Sok et al. 2016; Scally et al. 2017; McLeod et al. 2019; Oyen et al. 2020).

Statistical analysis was in the form of Bonferroni-corrected t-tests on gene frequencies at the level of gene subgroups.</p><p>Main text:</p><p>“We used the bulk V<sub>H</sub> data to re-calculate gene usage frequencies in Kymice at a higher depth, and compare the usage frequency of the IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ germline genes to those in bulk heavy chain human data of comparable depth. At such enhanced depth, all IGHD and IGHJ genes in the Kymouse haplotype were observed in all repertoires, as were all non-orphon IGHD and IGHJ genes in the general human database. There were thirteen IGHV genes found in human repertoires that are absent in the Kymouse haplotype which were observed in some but not all human repertoires (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Statistical testing on a gene-by-gene basis was largely in agreement with the findings from the single-cell analysis (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) with the exception that IGHJ4 usage was elevated in the bulk data relative to the single-cell data, and IGHJ6 usage lower such that it is not significantly different from human repertoires (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><p>In addition to statistical testing on a gene-by-gene basis (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), we used hierarchical clustering to compare the gene usage profiles of individual Kymice and humans, building dendrograms to show the relationships between the individuals’ gene usage profiles. The frequencies as determined by sequence abundance are shown to differ in such a way that the two repertoire types can be clustered separately. The hierarchical clustering of the IGHV genes showed that the Kymice and humans form nearly separate monophyletic clusters except for a single outlier human subject (Figure 3A). Most of the variation in IGHV gene usage is explained by the IGHV gene subgroup usage: clustering by IGHV gene subgroup usage separates humans and Kymice without the outlier human sample, with Kymice using a lower proportion of IGHV1 and IGHV2 genes (5.3% vs. 22.6% and 0.2% vs. 2.1% in Kymouse vs. human repertoires respectively for these subgroups), and an increased IGHV3 (51.6% vs. 39.7%), IGHV4 (35.3% vs. 31.6%) and IGHV6 usage (4.7% vs. 1.0%) (Figure 3B).</p><p>The IGHJ gene usage profile is similar: Kymice and nine out of the ten humans form monophyletic clades with a single outlier human. On average, the Kymouse uses IGHJ4 more frequently than humans (46.7% vs. 42.6%), and IGHJ5 and IGHJ1 less frequently (10.1% vs. 13.5%, and 0.6% vs. 1.0%) (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Both the IGHV and IGHJ gene usage profiles of naïve Kymouse repertoires are more similar to one another than to any human repertoire.</p><p>The IGHD gene usage is likewise distinguishable between humans and Kymice on average (Figure 3D). As can be seen from the heatmap, the IGHD germline genes used by the Kymice (<italic>e.g.</italic> IGHD3-22, IGHD2-15) are infrequently used by humans and <italic>vice versa</italic>. IGHD2, IGHD4 and IGHD5 subgroups are preferred by human repertoires (average 17.2% vs. 5.8%, 9.1% vs. 5.5% and 9.5% vs. 4.8% respectively in human vs. Kymouse repertoires), while Kymouse repertoires preferentially use IGHD1, IGHD6 and IGHD7 (24.2% vs. 10.3%, 27.4% vs. 20.4% and 2.4% vs. 0.6% on average in Kymice and humans respectively) (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3B: I don't understand the y-axis numbers…please clarify in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>contribution of each of the five contributing genetic factors to the CDRH3 length difference observed between Kymice and humans: where positive, it means that the factor results in longer CDRH3s on average in the Kymouse repertoire vs. the human repertoire (i.e. V gene choice in this case), and where negative, it contributes to the described shorter CDRH3s in the Kymice on average.</p><p>We have changed the figure legend to clarify.</p><p>The y-axis in Figure 3B shows the estimated contribution of each of the five contributing genetic factors to the CDRH3 length difference observed between Kymice and humans: where positive, it means that the factor results in longer CDRH3s on average in the Kymouse repertoire vs. the human repertoire (i.e. V gene choice in this case), and where negative, it contributes to the described shorter CDRH3s in the Kymice on average.</p><p>We have changed the figure legend to clarify:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4: what's the clonal overlap across mice?

With regards to the clonal overlap across mice, we found that is significantly greater than among humans, but less than among Kymice. With regards to the overlap on the structural level, overlap on a structural level in terms of the % shared CDRH3 structural clusters is much higher between any two subjects than clonotype sharing, as is to be expected given the reduced dimensionality. The structural sharing is highest between individual Kymice and individual mice, as predicted from sharing of CDRH3 sequences and clonotypes; it is lowest between Kymice and mice, which is not necessarily reflected in the CDRH3 sequence sharing. The structural sharing between the humans and Kymice is comparable to from human to human. This adds an extra detail to the structural comparison.</p><p>Line 1088</p><p>“Interestingly, clonotype sharing was significantly higher among individual Kymice (average: 7.92%, range: 6.04 – 11.14%) than between individual mice (average 4.55%, range: 3.52% – 5.90%) despite comparable CDRH3 sharing.”</p><p>The overlap on a structural level in terms of the % shared CDRH3 structural clusters is much higher between any two subjects than clonotype sharing, as is to be expected given the reduced dimensionality. As an interesting comparison to this pairwise CDRH3 and clonotype sharing, we provide two plots in Figure 6—figure supplement 5: one showing sharing of CDRH3 structural clusters (analogous to CDRH3 sequence sharing) and one showing sharing of “structural clonotypes”, which is a combination of H1 and H2 canonical classes and the H3 structural cluster (analogous to sequence clonotypes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In this work, you did not discuss whether antigen-specific responses are similar in hu-mice and humans.

As noted earlier, the Kymouse does not carry a full set of all human IGHV genes but instead carries IGHV genes found on just the human haplotype that was used to construct the mouse. Your data clearly show this, e.g., based on your &quot;outlier&quot; sample, which is probably the only sample in your cohort that carries IGHV4-38-2.

While there was a small but significant (5% level) difference in IGHD gene alignment length (average 4.6aa ± 0.06 vs. 4.4aa ± 0.08), the largest difference is in insertion length at both the VD and DJ junctions (average 7.8 nt ± 0.01 vs. 4.1 nt ± 0.1, 7.3nt ± 0.02 vs. 3.7nt ± 0.1). A significantly greater proportion of the Kymouse primary repertoire does not have junctional insertions compared to the human repertoire: 19.1% of the Kymouse sequences had no VD insertions, while 8.2% of the human sequences lacked VD insertions. 14.1% of Kymouse sequences had no DJ insertions while 4.5% of human sequences lacked these insertions.
