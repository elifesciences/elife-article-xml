To facilitate explorations of mosquito biology, we have created Aegypti-Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aegyptiatlas.buchonlab.com/">http://aegyptiatlas.buchonlab.com/</ext-link>), an online resource hosting RNAseq profiles of Ae. aegypti body parts (head, thorax, abdomen, gut, Malpighian tubules, ovaries), gut regions (crop, proventriculus, anterior and posterior midgut, hindgut), and a gut time course of blood meal digestion. Using Aegypti-Atlas, we provide insights into regionalization of gut function, blood feeding response, and immune defenses. We find that the anterior and posterior midgut possess digestive specializations which are preserved in the blood-fed state. Blood feeding initiates the sequential induction and repression/depletion of multiple cohorts of peptidases. With respect to defense, immune signaling components, but not recognition or effector molecules, show enrichment in ovaries. Basal expression of antimicrobial peptides is dominated by holotricin and gambicin, which are expressed in carcass and digestive tissues, respectively, in a mutually exclusive manner. In the midgut, gambicin and other effectors are almost exclusively expressed in the anterior regions, while the posterior midgut exhibits hallmarks of immune tolerance. Finally, in a cross-species comparison between Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae midguts, we observe that regional digestive and immune specializations are conserved, indicating that our dataset may be broadly relevant to multiple mosquito species. We demonstrate that the expression of orthologous genes is highly correlated, with the exception of a ‘species signature’ comprising a few highly/disparately expressed genes. With this work, we show the potential of Aegypti-Atlas to unlock a more complete understanding of mosquito biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Aedes</kwd><kwd>Anopheles</kwd><kwd>RNAseq atlas</kwd><kwd>gut transcriptome</kwd><kwd>blood feeding</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Aedes aegypti</kwd><kwd>Anopheles gambiae</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI148529-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchon</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 2024252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchon</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI148541-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchon</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R21AG065733-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buchon</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNAseq profiles of female <italic>Aedes</italic> body parts, gut regions, and blood-fed guts provide insight into the anatomical patterning of immune and digestive function, and demonstrate the sequential induction of multiple peptidase cohorts over the course of blood meal digestion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hematophagous mosquito vectors contribute substantially to the world’s disease burden through the transmission of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites and arboviruses (“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">World Health Organisation, 2020a</xref> | Vector-borne diseases,”). With the rise of insecticide resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moyes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ranson et al., 2011</xref>; “WHO | Insecticide resistance,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">World Health Organisation, 2020b</xref>), and the expansion of mosquito species’ ranges potentiated by climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), new and more efficient means of vector control are needed, grounded in a solid understanding of mosquito physiology. The FlyAtlas project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chintapalli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leader et al., 2018</xref>) contributed to the field of insect physiology, not only by characterizing the functions associated with the major body parts and organs of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, but by making it possible to quickly ascertain where in the body, and in what quantity, any gene of interest is transcribed. FlyAtlas also showed how the various contributions of different organs added up to constitute the whole fly transcriptome, providing an estimate of the relative transcriptional yield of the parts of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> body. Similar anatomical datasets have been created for several species of <italic>Anopheles</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martínez-Barnetche et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sreenivasamurthy et al., 2017</xref>), but not for <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. While transcriptional profiles have been created for various <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> body parts in diverse studies (<italic>e.g</italic> head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ptitsyn et al., 2011</xref>), Malpighian tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2017</xref>), midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angleró-Rodríguez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cui and Franz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hyde et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raquin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>), ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nag et al., 2021</xref>), carcass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2012</xref>), the lack of uniformity of strain and methodology between these studies makes direct comparison difficult.</p><p>The mosquito gut is of special interest to vector control, as it is central to the hematophagous lifestyle and serves as the first interface between a mosquito and the pathogens it transmits. Insect guts are highly regionalized organs, with specialized functions differentially distributed along their length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benguettat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buchon and Osman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dutta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lemaitre and Miguel-Aliaga, 2013</xref>). The mosquito gut is divided into five anatomically distinct regions: foregut (comprising pharynx, dorsal diverticula, and crop), proventriculus, anterior midgut, posterior midgut, and hindgut. The crop and dorsal diverticula are muscular cuticle-lined sacs which store imbibed sugar for gradual release into the midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clements, 1992</xref>). In <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, the proventriculus and anterior midgut were found to exhibit an enrichment of transcripts encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warr et al., 2007</xref>) suggesting that these regions serve a special defensive function against orally acquired pathogens. Within the midgut, digestive functions are believed to be divided between the anterior and posterior regions, with the former specializing in the digestion of nectar but playing no direct role in the digestion of the blood meal, which is processed in the posterior midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hecker, 1977</xref>). The hindgut receives and eliminates excreta from the midgut and urine from the Malpighian tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clements, 1992</xref>). Genome-wide transcriptomic profiles have the potential to reveal much more detailed information about the regionalization of function in the mosquito gut. In recent years, many groups have used microarrays and RNAseq to create transcriptomic profiles of mosquito midguts, mostly in the context of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cui and Franz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hyde et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raquin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vedururu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vlachou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warr et al., 2007</xref>). However, to our knowledge, only a single microarray-based study has ever characterized the transcriptomes of individual mosquito midgut regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warr et al., 2007</xref>) and no transcriptomic profiles have been generated for either foregut or hindgut tissues in any mosquito species.</p><p>The <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> gut’s response to the ingestion of a blood meal has been characterized as a biphasic process. In the first phase, mRNAs encoding a cohort of ‘early’ serine endopeptidases, transcribed in response to juvenile hormone (JH) secretion during previtellogenic maturation, are translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felix et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jiang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Noriega et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Noriega et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noriega et al., 2001</xref>). In the second, ecdysone signaling mediates the transcription of a ‘late’ cohort of endo and exopeptidases, with the transcripts of key peptidases and overall proteolytic activity typically peaking around 24 hr post blood meal (pbm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barillas-Mury et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brackney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gooding, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Graf and Briegel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isoe et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noriega et al., 2002</xref>). The transcriptional timeline is, however, more complex than a simple early translation/late transcription paradigm might suggest. Several studies have, by RT-qPCR and microarray, documented de novo transcription of peptidases and other genes peaking much earlier than 24 hr pbm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brackney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isoe et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanders et al., 2003</xref>). However, we found no RNAseq data to allow us to compare gut or midgut transcriptomes genome-wide in sugar-fed conditions and across the time-course of bloodmeal digestion.</p><p>Here, we aimed to complement existing datasets by, first, contextualizing the adult female gut’s transcriptome with profiles of the whole body and other major body parts and organs (head, thorax, abdomen, Malpighian tubules, ovaries) with the dual goal of (a) creating an at-a-glance reference for the anatomical distribution of transcripts, genome-wide and (b) facilitating the identification of tissue-specific marker genes which may, in the future, be useful in the construction of tissue-specific expression systems. Second, we created profiles for the five anatomically distinct regions of the adult female gut (crop, proventriculus, anterior midgut, posterior midgut, hindgut) to facilitate explorations of the regionalization of gut function. Finally, we profiled transcriptional responses to blood feeding in the anterior and posterior midgut and at multiple timepoints (6, 24, and 48 hr) after blood meal ingestion. We opted to profile <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, as it is among the most important insect vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Powell, 2018</xref>), with an increasing worldwide range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iwamura et al., 2020</xref>), and a recently updated genome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matthews et al., 2018</xref>). All the resulting transcriptional data can be accessed at the Aegypti-Atlas online database we constructed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aegyptiatlas.buchonlab.com/">http://aegyptiatlas.buchonlab.com/</ext-link>).</p><p>With RNAseq profiles for body parts, gut regions, and blood-fed guts in hand, we launched a broad investigation into multiple aspects of mosquito biology. Our inquiries were guided by the following questions: What functions are associated with each body part? What are the functional specializations of the gut regions? How does the gut transcriptome change in the context of blood feeding, and how are those changes distributed in the midgut? What can our atlas tell us about the organization of mosquitoes' antimicrobial defenses? Finally, in a cross-species comparison between the midguts of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (<italic>s.l</italic>.), we asked whether the gut’s structure-function relationship is conserved between two hematophagous mosquito vector species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The transcriptional landscape of an adult mosquito reflects the embryonic origins and functional signatures of its major tissues</title><p>In order to develop a transcriptomic atlas of some of the main body parts of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, we generated RNAseq profiles from the whole bodies and dissected body parts (head, thorax, abdomen, gut, Malpighian tubules, and ovaries) of sucrose-fed adult female mosquitoes of a field-derived ‘Thai’ strain from a region where arbovirus transmission is endemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">League et al., 2019</xref>). For the dissected body parts (but not whole body), we omitted the anterior-most section of the thorax as well as the final segments of the abdomen to exclude transcripts from salivary glands and from sperm in the spermatheca (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> for diagram). We first evaluated the relative variance between body part and whole-body profiles by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All transcriptomes from the same body part clustered together closely, providing evidence for the replicability of our data. On PC1, body parts were grouped in a manner that accorded with their divergent embryonic origin (primarily mesoderm/ectoderm for head, thorax, and abdomen, endoderm for gut and Malpighian tubules) and whole-body transcriptomes were clustered in between. Ovaries, which contain the germline, strongly separated from the other, exclusively somatic, body parts on PC2. Altogether, PCA indicated that the transcriptomes of body parts are largely defined by their embryonic origin, and that germline tissues possess a highly distinctive transcriptional signature.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The transcriptomes of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> body parts reflect their embryonic origins and functional specializations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis of the transcriptomes of whole body and body parts; 3–6 replicates per body part.

The quantity of markers ranged from 8 in the abdomen to 391 in the ovaries, which expressed more markers than all other body parts combined; nearly one in fifty of all genes in the genome qualified as an ovary marker. We further noted that ovaries simultaneously expressed the greatest number of highly enriched transcripts <italic>relative to other dissected body parts</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and the smallest number of highly enriched transcripts <italic>relative to whole body</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This apparent paradox led us to hypothesize that the ovaries make a disproportionately large contribution to the transcriptome of the whole female mosquito. A gene that is uniquely expressed in the ovaries will not be highly enriched relative to the whole mosquito body if the ovarian transcriptome comprises a large proportion of the whole body’s transcriptome.</p><p>To validate our sequencing results, we performed RT-qPCR amplification of one putative marker gene from each body part. We selected a translation factor (AAEL013144) as a reference gene for our assay over more traditional candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dzaki et al., 2017</xref>), on the basis of its robust expression and relatively small variation across samples <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>. The results of our RT-qPCR confirmed the anatomical specificity of each selected marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> Fig).</p><p>The existence of transcripts specific to each body part allowed us to calculate their relative contribution to the whole body’s transcriptome (see the ‘mosquito equation’ in Materials and methods). Expressed as percentages, the body part contributions we obtained were: head (4.7%), thorax (19.4%), abdomen (26.2%), gut (14.0%), Malpighian tubules (1.7%), and ovaries (28.8%). It should be noted that the percentage calculated for the thorax is likely to slightly underestimate its actual contribution, as a portion of the thorax was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to eliminate salivary glands. This removal likely accounts, at least in part, for the fact that the sum of the calculated scaling factors is 94.9%, rather than 100%. We validated our estimates by using them to predict the whole-body expression of every gene in the genome, then plotting those predictions against observed values from the whole-body transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Calculated and observed values were highly correlated (slope of 1.00, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95) after removal of a single outlying gene (AAEL018689, a mitochondrial ribosomal RNA) which was underpredicted by our calculation. This analysis validates our hypothesis that the ovaries contribute a disproportionate number of transcripts to the whole-body transcriptome. Further, our data demonstrate that, due to the preponderance of ovarian contribution, multiple tissues have only a low representation in the body, severely limiting the ability to detect tissue-specific changes in whole-mosquito experiments.</p><p>To examine the biological processes and molecular functions enriched in each body part, we performed a Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA) of genes 5 x (or, for ovaries, 2 x) enriched in each body part (in comparison to whole body, DESeq2 <italic>padj</italic> &lt;0.05). An extended list of GO categories may be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. We complemented this approach by identifying the twenty highest expressed genes in each body part (treemaps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), reasoning that the highest expressed genes in a transcriptome may also give insight into function. In brief, the head showed enrichment for sensory machinery and neuronal signaling, the thoracic carcass (which houses flight muscle) showed signs of enhanced metabolic activity, and the abdominal carcass (which contains mostly fat body) displayed enrichment for regulatory proteolytic enzymes (CLIP-domain serine endopeptidases), defense, and lipid transport. The gut was enriched with defense-related genes including immune-activating peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), AMPs, and immune-modulating amidase PGRPs. It also showed enrichment for digestive enzymes, especially peptidases. Notably, its three most prevalent transcripts were the non-CLIP serine endopeptidases early trypsin (<italic>ET</italic>), female-specific chymotrypsin (<italic>CHYMO</italic>), and juvenile hormone-regulated chymotrypsin (<italic>JHA15</italic>) which, together, accounted for more than one third of its transcriptome. (Note: Vectorbase gene IDs for all genes named in this text are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The Malpighian tubules, which serve a function analogous to mammalian kidneys, expressed large quantities of ion transporters, especially vacuolar ATPases, which may be required to create proton gradients for use in secondary active transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weng et al., 2003</xref>). Because the ovaries did not express many highly enriched genes, we adjusted our analysis to examine genes expressed 2 x higher than in the whole body and discovered categories related to cell division and germline maintenance. We also observed that a small cohort of mitochondrial genes (<italic>COX1</italic>, <italic>COX2</italic>, <italic>COX3</italic>, <italic>ATP6</italic>, and a 16 s gene) were among the highest expressed transcripts in several body parts, especially those containing tissues that carry out energy-intensive functions (head, thorax, Malpighian tubules). Overall, we concluded that the most prominent transcripts and enriched GO categories in each body part were consistent with expectations for the tissues they house. We take these results as a validation of our data set, and as confirmation that the segments of the mosquito carcass (head, thorax, abdomen) perform well as proxies for important tissues (brain/eyes, flight muscle, fat body).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Gut region-specific transcriptomes reveal functional compartmentalization of the mosquito midgut</title><p>To evaluate the regionalization of gut function, we generated RNAseq profiles for the five main regions of the mosquito digestive tract: crop and dorsal diverticula (hereafter referred to as ‘crop’ for brevity), proventriculus, anterior midgut, posterior midgut, and hindgut. A PCA of these profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) demonstrated clear segregation between regions, and close clustering of all replicates from the same region, indicating clearly distinct transcriptomes. The anterior and posterior midgut, which are predominantly derived from endoderm, clustered together opposite the crop and hindgut, which are of primarily ectodermal origin. The proventriculus, which is partially derived from both germ layers, was intermediate between these two clusters on PC1. Whole-gut transcriptomes clustered closely with posterior midgut transcriptomes, suggesting that the posterior midgut contributes more to the transcriptome of the whole gut than do the other regions. Accordingly, very few genes in the posterior midgut showed enrichment compared to the whole gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). GOEA on genes enriched in each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), complemented by an examination of the twenty highest expressed genes in each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) revealed that the ectodermally derived regions of the gut (crop and hindgut) expressed genes involved in chitin metabolism, lipid metabolism, ion transport and numerous CLIP-domain serine endopeptidases. The proventriculus was notably enriched for wingless signaling and defensive genes (lysozymes, and the highly expressed AMP gambicin, <italic>GAM1</italic>). In the anterior midgut, carbohydrate metabolism and heme-binding proteins (predominantly cytochrome P450s) were the most prominently enriched categories. The highest expressed gene in this region was a member of the MBF2 family of transcription factors of unknown function in mosquitoes. As the posterior midgut transcriptome closely resembled that of the whole gut, only a handful of genes were enriched 5 x in this region relative to whole gut. We also noted that a large proportion of the genome was either unexpressed or little-expressed in the posterior midgut relative to the other gut regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To better identify genes enriched in the posterior midgut, we calculated enrichment against an aggregate of the other four gut regions. We found that the posterior midgut is highly enriched for peptidases (especially non-CLIP serine endopeptidases) and genes involved in translation. Other enriched categories include signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent targeting, amino acid transport and amino acid metabolism. Together these categories describe a region that is primed to translate and secrete large quantities of peptidases, and to process and absorb the resulting free amino acids. Overall, our data demonstrate that the five gut regions are highly specialized functional units.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mosquito gut regions’ transcriptomic investments and outputs reveal digestive specializations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis of the transcriptomes of whole gut and gut regions; 3–6 replicates.

To better understand how digestion and nutrient absorption are distributed along the gut, we examined the regional cumulative expression of enzymes and transporters putatively involved in the digestion and absorption of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins/amino acids. We postulated that the cumulative expression of a given set of digestive enzymes/transporters of common function reflects the <italic>investment</italic> of each region in that function (what fraction of their transcriptome they dedicate to that process). We first assembled lists of lipases, lipid-transporting proteins, amylases/maltases, glucosidases, sugar transporters, peptidases, and amino acid transporters with a probable digestive function (excluding genes with anticipated non-digestive function, <italic>e.g</italic>., peptidases annotated as, or orthologous with, CLIP-domain serine endopeptidases, caspases, proteasome components, <italic>etc</italic>.). For complete lists and inclusion criteria, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. We summed the expression of the genes from each category (in TPM) and calculated their relative expression by region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The highest investments in different categories of lipases were divided among several regions, with phospholipases receiving the greatest investment from crop and anterior midgut, sphingomyelinases from anterior midgut, and the remainder of lipases modestly more expressed in the posterior midgut and hindgut. The crop was the greatest investor in lipid carrier proteins and fatty acid transporters, while the anterior midgut showed the greatest investment in phospholipid and sterol transporters. The highest investments in sugar digestion/absorption and protein digestion were found in the anterior and posterior midgut, respectively. The hindgut was a disproportionate investor in amino acid transporters, suggesting that many of the products of protein digestion from the midgut are absorbed there. These data demonstrate that distinct gut regions invest different amounts of their respective transcriptomes in the digestion and absorption of different nutrients, hinting at a system of specialization/sequential processing of ingested materials.</p><p>Caution should be used in the interpretation of cumulative expression data, as <italic>investment</italic> (in TPM) is distinct from <italic>output</italic> (i.e. the number of transcripts of a given gene or category produced in a region). The five regions do not produce equal numbers of transcripts overall, so their transcriptional investments must be scaled by their total transcriptional <italic>yield</italic> to achieve an estimate of their relative contributions to specific functions. We measured the RNA content from each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and scaled the cumulative expression values from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> by yield to gain an estimate of the transcriptional output of each region with respect to each digestive category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We found that the posterior midgut, by virtue of its outsized transcriptional yield, is the dominant contributor not only of peptidases, but of most categories of transcripts with digestive and absorptive functions. However, the proventriculus and anterior midgut together are the source of more than half of all amylases/maltases and glucosidases and contribute a sizeable minority of all sugar transporters. These observations cement our conclusion that the anterior midgut specializes in the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, while the posterior midgut is responsible for most protein and lipid digestion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Blood feeding initiates a series of transcriptomic shifts over the course of digestion</title><p>The gut of the hematophagous mosquito undergoes dramatic changes upon blood feeding.

Multiple categories pertaining to protein synthesis and secretion were also regulated by blood-feeding: at 6 hr pbm, a small number of genes associated with mRNA splicing, protein folding, and SRP-dependent secretion were upregulated, while genes associated with miRNA inhibition of translation were downregulated. However, by 24 hr pbm, all these changes were reversed and, additionally, genes associated with peptide transport (39 genes) and translation (57 genes) were significantly downregulated. At 48 hr pbm, protein folding, peptide transport, and translation were all upregulated again. Notably, translation was one of very few categories that was significantly enriched in 48 hr blood-fed guts compared to exclusively sugar-fed guts.</p><p>Several of the categories regulated by blood feeding appear to reflect necessary adaptations to the changing luminal environment. Six hrs following blood meal ingestion, ferric iron-binding proteins (including three ferritin subunit precursors, AAEL004335, AAEL007383, and AAEL007385) were upregulated and two genes in the lysozyme activity category (<italic>LYSC11</italic>, and <italic>LYSC4</italic>) were also induced, possibly in response to the previously described increase of ROS and bacterial density pbm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gusmão et al., 2010</xref>). At 24 hr pbm, the defense response category was also induced. Two defensins (<italic>DEFA</italic> and <italic>DEFD</italic>) were enriched, as well as two peptidoglycan-degrading amidases (<italic>PGRP-SC1</italic>, and <italic>PGRPS4</italic>), orthologs of which, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, modulate the activation of the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>). At 48 hr pbm, both the ferric iron-binding and defense response categories were downregulated relative to 24 hr, which is unsurprising as most of the luminal content had been evacuated by that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also noted a significant induction of genes involved in cellular respiration which could reflect the metabolic expenditure required for the peristaltic evacuation of the blood bolus. GO categories related to the digestion and absorption of macronutrients were nearly all upregulated at 6 hr pbm, with some upregulated again at 24 hr but downregulated to return to baseline by 48 hr. In summary, GOEA indicates that blood feeding regulates the gut’s transcription of genes involved in diverse functions, including digestion, absorption, translation, and defense.</p><p>In adult mosquitoes, a peritrophic matrix is synthesized in the hours immediately following the ingestion of a blood meal. Previous studies have documented or proposed the involvement of several genes in peritrophic matrix synthesis in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. These include the glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate amino transferase <italic>AeGfat-1</italic>, which catalyzes the first step of chitin biosynthesis, the chitin synthase <italic>AeCs</italic>, which catalyzes the final step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kato et al., 2006</xref>), and the peritrophins AAEL004798, AAEL006953, and <italic>Aper50</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Whiten et al., 2018</xref>). All five of these genes were robustly expressed in our blood-fed guts, and two (<italic>AeGfat-1</italic> and <italic>Aper50</italic>) were significantly upregulated at 6 hr pbm. Notably, the peritrophin AAEL006953 was heavily concentrated in the proventriculus at baseline and, at a TPM of over 68,000, was that region’s top expressed gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Other candidates, orthologous to <italic>Drosophila</italic> chitin synthases (AAEL002718) and peritrophins (AAEL005702, AAEL009585) showed little expression in the gut at any timepoint.

Overall, cumulative transcript analysis echoed the results of our GOEA. Both showed that the gut’s transcriptional investment in sphingomyelinases and amino acid transporters peaked at 6 hr pbm, and that the expression of carbohydrate digestive enzymes was elevated at 24 hr pbm but declined again at 48 hr pbm. Our granular cumulative expression analysis revealed that aminopeptidases, dipeptidases, and dipeptidyl peptidases reached peak investment at 6 hr, and carboxypeptidases at 24 hr. Remarkably, the gut’s investment in serine endopeptidases (non-CLIP), which constitute the majority of peptidase transcripts in the gut by nearly an order of magnitude, remained steady across sugar-fed, 6 hr, and 24 hr pbm guts, before plunging by approximately one third at 48 hr pbm.</p><p>We extended our cumulative investment approach to other functions in the gut by aggregating transcripts of other transcriptionally prominent families and comparing their relative proportions across all timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This revealed the dramatic temporary increase in the expression of a family of twelve genes containing the insect allergen domain (IPR010629) which are orthologous to the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> G12 gene and have been found to possess hemolytic, cytolytic, and antiviral properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foo et al., 2021</xref>). We also observed that the family of MBF2 transcription factors - one member of which was previously noted among the highest expressed genes of the anterior midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) - surged from just over 1% of the transcriptome to more than 4% at 24 hr pbm, partially subsiding to approximately 1.7% by 48 hr pbm. Our comparison of summed transcripts yielded an apparent paradox: while GOEA demonstrated the upregulation of multiple peptidases at 6 hr pbm, the gut’s overall investment in peptidases (cumulative TPM) had actually declined at this timepoint from 39.7% to 32.7% of the transcriptome, before rising to 41.2% at 24 hr pbm. This contradiction is explained by the depletion of transcripts from the small ‘early’ cohort of peptidases (<italic>ET</italic>, <italic>CHYMO</italic>, and <italic>JHA15</italic>) which compensated for the upregulation of other peptidases at 6 hr pbm. It should be noted that, while peptidase <italic>investment</italic> did not increase much in blood-fed guts, higher RNA yield <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref> caused peptidase transcript <italic>output</italic> to increase significantly at 24 hr pbm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To more closely examine the dynamics of peptidase transcription in the blood-fed gut, we performed a clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) which revealed that the transcript levels of many peptidases in the gut change dramatically over the course of blood meal digestion, that these changes come in the form of both induction and repression/depletion, frequently followed by a return to baseline at the subsequent timepoint, and that they manifest in multiple successive waves. Our clustering analysis divided the dynamically expressed gut peptidases into three waves of induced transcripts (rapid, intermediate, and delayed), and three corresponding waves of repressed or depleted transcripts. Among induced peptidases, the rapid and delayed waves comprise genes that peaked in our data set at 6 hr and 24 hr pbm, (23 and 40 genes respectively). Our clustering analysis implied that another, ‘intermediate’ cohort of induced peptidases (16 genes) nests somewhere between these waves. These genes show sustained induction from 6 to 24 hr, and likely peak at some time between these two timepoints. The waves of rapid, intermediate, and delayed repressed/depleted peptidases mirror the expression patterns of their induced counterparts in inverse. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> shows the expression of representative peptidases from each of the six cohorts across the blood feeding kinetic. We validated our findings by performing RT-qPCR on selected peptidases (two repressed/depleted and five induced genes) at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hr pbm. We selected <italic>RpS30</italic> (AAEL009653), a housekeeping gene with robust and steady expression over the course of blood meal digestion, as a reference gene for our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> shows the relative expression of each peptidase (for unscaled data normalized only to the reference gene, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). At each timepoint we assayed, we captured one or more genes peaking sharply, further illustrating the dynamic nature of peptidase expression in the blood-fed gut. Most peptidases are organized in genomic clusters which, we hypothesized, could underlie co-regulation. We also examined the evolutionary relatedness of the peptidases from each temporal cluster by comparing their positions on a phylogenetic tree (composed using Geneious R11 software, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). While sequence similarity corresponded closely with physical location in most cases, neither parameter appeared correlated with temporal clustering. Altogether, our data reveal that blood feeding initiates a well-orchestrated transcriptomic response in the gut, dominated by the dynamic up and down-regulation of peptidases throughout the entire process of digestion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Regional digestive specializations are preserved in the blood-fed midgut</title><p>Considering the extensive functional regionalization of the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> gut and the profound reshaping of the whole-gut transcriptome upon blood feeding, we asked whether regional differences are preserved in the blood-fed gut. To evaluate the regionalized effects of blood feeding, we generated transcriptomes for dissected anterior midguts (without proventriculus) and posterior midguts at 24 hr pbm. PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) revealed that all profiles clustered both by region and by blood feeding status. As we previously noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), there was little difference between sugar-fed whole gut and posterior midgut profiles. Upon blood feeding, both whole gut and posterior midgut shifted in tandem, maintaining proximity, indicating that blood feeding does not lessen the dominance of the posterior midgut’s transcriptional yield over that of the anterior. Both midgut regions shifted in response to blood feeding; moreover, they moved in the same directions with respect to PC1 and PC2, suggesting that the overall transcriptional responses of the two regions share some commonality. We noted that the relative investments of these two regions in most of the prominent functional categories did not change dramatically upon blood feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, two of the most remarkable changes in the transcriptome of blood-fed mosquitoes, the upregulation of MBF2 transcription factors and G12 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), were mainly localized to the posterior midgut.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Regional specializations in sugar and protein digestion are preserved in the blood-fed midgut.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis of the transcriptomes of sugar-fed and 24 hr blood-fed whole guts and anterior and posterior midguts; 3–6 replicates per condition.

Most categories that were upregulated in the anterior midgut were similarly upregulated in the posterior, albeit to differing extents. The fact that blood feeding promotes enrichment of many of the same digestive/absorptive categories in both anterior and posterior midgut could imply that the two regions are converging on a common role with respect to macronutrient exploitation. However, an analysis of cumulative expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) demonstrated that the two regions’ respective investments in digestive enzymes and transporters remained highly divergent. Consistent with the results of the GOEA, the posterior midgut substantially increased its investment in lipase transcripts, with a smaller increase in the anterior midgut. By contrast, the anterior midgut kept a substantial edge in its investment in lipid transporters and lipid carrier proteins. The posterior midgut increased its investment in amylases/maltases and glucosidases by approximately five and twofold, respectively, and the anterior midgut increased both by less than twofold. However, the difference in baseline expression was such that the blood-fed anterior midgut’s investment was still ten times that of the blood-fed posterior midgut. Neither region substantially increased its investment in sugar transporters, peptidases, or amino acid transporters. When these regional investments were weighted by the increased RNA yield observed in both blood-fed midgut regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), we found that the proportional output of the posterior midgut increased across most digestive categories, but that the anterior midgut still contributed a substantial minority of transcripts for sugar-digesting enzymes and sugar transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Altogether, we concluded that both midgut regions participate in the transcriptional response to blood feeding, and that the blood-fed anterior and posterior midgut retain their regional specializations with respect to carbohydrate and protein digestion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Immune gene patterning reveals areas of immune activity and immune tolerance in the mosquito body and gut</title><p>As mosquitoes are prolific vectors of important human pathogens, their defensive functions are of paramount interest.

The ovaries were also the site of the highest expression of genes coding for components of Toll, IMD, and JAK-STAT signaling. Remarkably, genes coding for extracellular regulators (such as most CLIP-domain serine endopeptidases) and pattern recognition proteins (PGRPs and Gram-negative bacteria-binding proteins, GNBPs) did not show this pattern of expression. Instead, they were generally highly expressed in the head, thorax and abdomen, the three compartments that contain fat body. Even more remarkably, AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) showed negligible expression in the ovaries.

These two AMPs were expressed in different body parts in a near mutually exclusive manner.

The posterior midgut, by contrast, expressed just 110 TPM of AMPs and lysozymes combined, supporting our hypothesis that the posterior midgut is characterized by immune tolerance toward microbes. When AMP and lysozyme expression is weighted by gut regional RNA yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), it is apparent that the anterior midgut and proventriculus contribute the majority of transcripts in these categories despite their relatively small transcriptional yields.

However, enrichment analysis alone cannot capture all the complexities of comparative transcriptomics, as it is primarily sensitive not to quantities of transcripts from a given category, but to quantities of genes belonging to that category. Furthermore, GOEA is substantially less robust in non-model species, owing to incomplete annotations which impact many key genes. We propose that complementary approaches, such as identifying highest expressed genes and examining transcriptomic profiles through the lenses of <italic>investment</italic> and <italic>output</italic>, can help to strengthen conclusions and capture dynamics which might otherwise be overlooked. By examining the twenty highest expressed genes in each body part and gut region, we were able to identify genes that account for large proportions of the transcriptome, but which were missed by enrichment analysis (e.g.<italic> GAM1</italic> in the proventriculus, MBF2 factors in the anterior midgut). Comparing the top-expressed genes across transcriptomes allowed us to see that some body parts are dominated by a small number of highly expressed genes (e.g. the gut) while others spread their transcriptome more equally over the genome (e.g. the ovaries). Comparing the relative expression of one-to-one orthologs between species allowed us to identify genes that are disproportionately expressed in one species (e.g. the Tsetse EP protein, a putative antimicrobial effector in the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> proventriculus) and to detect a reshuffling of expression among ribosomal proteins across the two species.</p><p>Another approach we adopted – summing transcripts belonging to a functional category and comparing the sums across body parts, regions, or timepoints – allowed us to assess relative investment in the given category. We confined the use of this method to categories of genes encoding proteins that are all presumed to have similar molecular function, narrowly defined (e.g. peptidases cleaving proteins, or antimicrobial peptides killing pathogens). The utility of evaluating regional or temporal specialization by summing transcripts (investment) as opposed to counting genes (enrichment), is evident when we consider that using GOEA, the highest expressed peptidase in the gut carries no more weight than the fifth highest – despite a difference of over 165,000 TPM, or 16.5% of the total gut transcriptome. Using this investment approach, we were also able to break large categories (e.g. peptidases) into smaller categories (e.g. carboxypeptidases, dipeptidases, etc.) for a fine-grained picture of where and when each was most expressed. There is, however, an important caveat to the interpretation of cumulative analysis as it fails to account for differential transcriptional yields between profiled body parts, regions, or conditions. We overcame this caveat by weighting transcriptional investment by RNA yield to calculate estimated regional/temporal output of digestive transcripts, from which we were able to infer how certain tasks (<italic>e.g</italic>., sugar digestion) are divided between the regions of the gut, as well as how peptidase transcript output changes over the course of blood meal digestion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Spatial organization of gut function is conserved across mosquito species; few highly/disparately expressed genes drive transcriptomic differences</title><p>The <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> gut is linearly divided into five anatomically distinct regions. With the caveat that the crop only admits sugar meals, ingested materials encounter each of these regions sequentially. The regions of the gut therefore possess an ordinal quality, corresponding to stages (either transient or prolonged) of the ingestion/digestion process. Through GOEA and quantitative evaluation of transcripts belonging to digestive categories, we discerned a clear pattern of strong investment in sugar digestion/absorption in the anterior midgut, as hypothesized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hecker, 1977</xref>. Peptidases, by contrast, were predominantly expressed in the posterior midgut. These specializations were maintained under blood-fed conditions, and largely conserved in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> (<italic>s.l</italic>.) midguts. Other notable instances of conserved regional function are apparent in the proventriculus, where both species share enrichment of wingless signaling components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>) and AMPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hao et al., 2003</xref>) with other dipteran species.</p><p>While the midgut regions of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>An. gambiae</italic> shared many important functions, and their one-to-one orthologs maintained strikingly close transcriptional correlation, we noted that differences in the expression of a small number of highly expressed genes created large disparities in their overall categorical apportionment of transcripts. Most notably, the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> proventriculus and anterior midgut expressed far greater quantities of AMPs – possibly in response to some microbial presence – as well as a handful of highly expressed but poorly characterized genes, including an apparent ortholog of a tsetse midgut protein with a putative defensive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haines et al., 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> posterior midgut expressed far fewer peptidase transcripts than its <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> counterpart, and far more of an MBF2 family of transcription cofactors which, in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> gut, was only prominent in the anterior regions of the sugar-fed midgut and, intriguingly, the blood-fed posterior midgut. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, MBF2 factors have been shown to complex with the transcription factor FTZ-F1 and cofactor MBF1 to activate transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2000</xref>). We cannot say whether this role is conserved in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. However, the expression of MBF2 factors in both species outstripped the expression of their orthologs of <italic>FTZ-F1</italic> (AAEL019863, AAEL026810, AGAP005661) and <italic>MBF1</italic> (AAEL008768, AGAP004990) by several orders of magnitude in multiple conditions and/or gut regions (see Aegypti-Atlas website), suggesting MBF2 may not be confined to cofactoring FTZ-F1 in these species. Altogether, this analysis yielded multiple ‘species signature’ genes worthy of closer scrutiny and functional study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The anterior midgut participates in the transcriptional response to blood feeding</title><p>The anterior midgut has been held to play little or no role in the process of blood meal digestion, as the blood bolus is sealed into the posterior midgut by the formation of the peritrophic matrix shortly after ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Billingsley, 1990</xref>). However, late in the blood meal response (24 hr) we found that the anterior midgut had increased its investment in some categories of digestive enzymes and transporters (e.g. sphingomyelinases, sterol transporters, amylases/maltases, glucosidases, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) as well as its overall transcriptional yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). While the proportional output of the anterior midgut drops relative to the posterior midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), it still contributes approximately one third of the transcripts for sugar-digesting enzymes in the whole midgut (exclusive of proventriculus). This finding is congruent with Billingsley and Hecker’s observation that alpha-glucosidase activity was elevated in homogenates of <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> anterior midguts at 24 hr pbm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Billingsley and Hecker, 1991</xref>). As the majority of amylases/maltases and glucosidases in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> genome possess signal peptides but lack transmembrane domains, it is possible that enzymes secreted in the anterior midgut are capable of diffusing into the extra-peritrophic area in the posterior midgut where they may participate in blood meal digestion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Gut peptidases are dynamically up and downregulated in sequential transcriptional waves upon blood feeding</title><p>Peptidase expression in the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> gut unfolds in a series of phases, coordinated by rising and falling titers of JH and ecdysone. In the post-emergence/pre-vitellogenic phase, JH drives the transcription of a cohort of “early” peptidases, priming the gut for its first blood meal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jiang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noriega et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Noriega et al., 1997</xref>).

Next, rising ecdysone titers drive the transcription of a “late” cohort of peptidases, which complete the digestive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2021</xref>).

However, a few publications have documented that some peptidases peak at earlier timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brackney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isoe et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanders et al., 2003</xref>), and that at least one of these (<italic>SPI</italic>) is directly responsive to/dependent on ecdysone signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2021</xref>). Here, our genome-wide multi-timepoint series has demonstrated that these early-peaking genes are not isolated and exceptional but are, rather, members of large transcriptional cohorts. We show that peptidases in the blood-fed <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> gut are expressed not only in two phases: ‘early’ (translational) and ‘late’ (transcriptional), but that the ‘late’ transcriptional response manifests in multiple successive waves or shifts. We have divided these into three (‘rapid’, ‘intermediate’, and ‘delayed’), but because we only obtained RNAseq profiles for guts at baseline and three blood-fed timepoints, we can only speculate how many of these shifts are actually triggered over the course of blood meal digestion, and how synchronously any of the peptidases that our clustering analysis grouped together are actually regulated. Our timepoints were too broadly spaced to say at what time each gene reached its true peak, or whether peptidases that were apparently quiescent throughout blood meal digestion in fact participated in a shift that was too transient to be detected by our experimental design. Future work will likely uncover even more complexity than we have described.</p><p>The sharp temporal patterning of peptidase transcription in the blood-fed mosquito gut raises intriguing questions. How is this transcriptional choreography achieved? Is the transcription of all ‘late’ phase peptidases ecdysone-dependent, and are rising ecdysone levels sufficient to drive them? To what extent is the transcriptional induction of succeeding waves dependent on the activity of prior ones? Why are some ‘delayed’ peptidases so slow to show any transcriptional response when ecdysone titers are ascendent (e.g. AAEL008782, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>)?. And what mechanism effects the precipitous drop in the ‘rapid’ cohort of induced peptidases (ascendent at 6 hr pbm) at a timepoint (24 hr pbm) when ecdysone titers are still high (e.g. AAEL013715) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hagedorn et al., 1975</xref>)? What is the adaptive significance of the rapid up and down-regulation of so many genes of shared function? We observed that the gut’s investment in aminopeptidases, dipeptidases, and carboxypeptidases has distinct temporal peaks, suggesting that polypeptides may be attacked more from one terminus or the other at different times over the course of digestion. However, most of the peptidases that participate in shift-changes are endopeptidases, and it is not clear how the sequential substitution of one set of endopeptidases for another – as opposed to simultaneous expression – helps to move the process of digestion forward. We speculate that rapidly changing conditions in the blood-fed gut may alter the stability and kinetics of specific peptidases, and that different peptidases predominate at different times because they are adapted to function in specific, transient conditions obtaining at corresponding stages of the digestive process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The anterior and posterior midgut regions are, respectively, characterized by signs of immune activity and immune tolerance</title><p>In the midguts of both <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, the majority of AMP transcripts are contributed by the proventriculus and anterior midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) with minimal expression in the posterior midgut.

While it is not uncommon for antimicrobial effectors to display strong tropisms to specific tissues, we are not aware of comparable instances where a single AMP exhibits such overwhelming transcriptional dominance. In future work, it might be interesting to compare the activity of holotricin and gambicin against different types of microbes (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, fungi, etc.), and to examine the effects that silencing these genes has on midgut communities, and on mosquitoes’ survival in the contexts of oral and systemic infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this manuscript we introduce Aegypti-Atlas, a repository of RNAseq data, and demonstrate how these data can yield insights into tissue function, the organization of digestive specializations, regulatory networks, and immune effectors, as well as the changes wrought by diet and evolution in mosquitoes.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Emilie Pondeville (Reviewer #2).</p><p>All reviewers were quite positive on the findings reported by the manuscript and agree that the paper contains important data that will be of use to the vector biology community. There are however some issues to address (see below) An important one is the lack of clarity/detail in the Materials and methods in regards to how the libraries were constructed and details of how the comparisons across tissues were made. However, collectively they think that the paper is a valuable contribution and if the authors can clarify/revise in regards to those issues it would be a nice paper. We therefore ask you to prepare a revised submission to address the points listed below</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. As a dry/wet bioinformatician/molecular biologist, this reviewer acknowledges that this work has been beautifully executed following standard practices for mosquito rearing and following the guidelines of RNA sequencing. Though, data reproducibility is a concern in bioinformatics since different analysis pipelines may lead to dissimilar results from same datasets. While aiming to reach a broad audience of specialists and non-specialists in RNAseq analyses, this reviewer suggests that authors deposit their command lines and scripts (even if only relevant parts) in an open-access repository such as GitHub or equivalent, so others may compare their own data without technical variation. Also, raw tables with normalized gene expression (i.e., outputs of DEseq2) could also be provided for future reference, either deposited in GEO/NCBI or as tables together with the code at GitHub.</p><p>2. One major concern relates to the normalization of transcriptomic data presented here. Authors emphasize that data from some tissues such as ovaries or specific midgut regions showed considerably distinct patterns of gene expression. Consequently, such patterns of unbalanced transcriptional levels can skew normalization and could be of concern. The tool used here for normalization of transcript counts, DEseq2, should not be severely impacted by these events since, as mentioned by its author Michael Love, &quot;the median ratio normalization in DESeq2 doesn't have as strong of an assumption that most genes don't change&quot; (see post at https://support.bioconductor.org/p/61604/ for details). This reviewer suggest that the authors provide some data confirming that the normalization is stable enough between samples, hopefully showing that the core of genes that do not change expression reflect the size factors estimated by DEseq2 (a good example of this quality control is given in the blog post above). If some striking differences are seen, I would suggest applying HMM-normalization or other technique to better normalize the data and increase accuracy. Example of normalization methods for such situation are given in this Review by Liu et al. Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 2019 – DOI 10.3389/fbioe.2019.00358.</p><p>3. A known problem in high-throughput analysis is the establishment of arbitrary thresholds or cutoffs when analyzing differential expression. Here the authors often established arbitrary thresholds/cutoffs without depicting the reason for doing so (e.g., top 20 genes, 5-fold difference or 2-fold difference, etc). This reviewer thinks that it would be of great improvement for this manuscript if authors explain in detail the relevance of their choices and how it impacted their analyses.</p><p>4) Although some studies already analysed gene expression in the different organs of Aedes mosquitoes and changes occurring after a blood meal, this study is the first to analyse gene expression in most of female tissues allowing an accurate comparison of profiles between tissues. The analysis of data is very thorough and well described, showing investment (number of transcripts) and output (number of transcripts balanced by total number of transcripts in a specific tissue) of each organ.

As a dry/wet bioinformatician/molecular biologist, this reviewer acknowledges that this work has been beautifully executed following standard practices for mosquito rearing and following the guidelines of RNA sequencing. Though, data reproducibility is a concern in bioinformatics since different analysis pipelines may lead to dissimilar results from same datasets. While aiming to reach a broad audience of specialists and non-specialists in RNAseq analyses, this reviewer suggests that authors deposit their command lines and scripts (even if only relevant parts) in an open-access repository such as GitHub or equivalent, so others may compare their own data without technical variation. Also, raw tables with normalized gene expression (i.e., outputs of DEseq2) could also be provided for future reference, either deposited in GEO/NCBI or as tables together with the code at GitHub.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words concerning our work. We have done as requested. Our scripts and DEseq2 outputs have been deposited at GitHub and are accessible here: https://github.com/bingdun/RNAseq_analysis_of_Aedes_aegypti.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. One major concern relates to the normalization of transcriptomic data presented here. Authors emphasize that data from some tissues such as ovaries or specific midgut regions showed considerably distinct patterns of gene expression. Consequently, such patterns of unbalanced transcriptional levels can skew normalization and could be of concern. The tool used here for normalization of transcript counts, DEseq2, should not be severely impacted by these events since, as mentioned by its author Michael Love, &quot;the median ratio normalization in DESeq2 doesn't have as strong of an assumption that most genes don't change&quot; (see post at https://support.bioconductor.org/p/61604/ for details). This reviewer suggest that the authors provide some data confirming that the normalization is stable enough between samples, hopefully showing that the core of genes that do not change expression reflect the size factors estimated by DEseq2 (a good example of this quality control is given in the blog post above). If some striking differences are seen, I would suggest applying HMM-normalization or other technique to better normalize the data and increase accuracy. Example of normalization methods for such situation are given in this Review by Liu et al. Front. Bioeng. Biotechnol. 2019 – DOI 10.3389/fbioe.2019.00358.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extracted size factors for each of the samples in the body-part vs whole body DEseq2 analyses performed (a) with all genes in the genome and (b) with the subset of genes that were not significantly different in the first analysis (p &gt; 0.05). We found the values were nearly identical. Since size factors are median values and, in all comparisons between body parts and whole body, fewer than half of all genes were differentially expressed, this result was consistent with expectations. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> we plot the two sets of size factors we extracted:</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76132-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A known problem in high-throughput analysis is the establishment of arbitrary thresholds or cutoffs when analyzing differential expression. Here the authors often established arbitrary thresholds/cutoffs without depicting the reason for doing so (e.g., top 20 genes, 5-fold difference or 2-fold difference, etc). This reviewer thinks that it would be of great improvement for this manuscript if authors explain in detail the relevance of their choices and how it impacted their analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We employed a variety of arbitrary cutoffs in this manuscript. These include:</p><p>a) Putative markers, Figure 1B (TPM &gt; 5, 50x enriched versus all other body parts)</p><p>The putative markers in our manuscript serve two purposes: first, they are a suggested starting place for researchers who may want to build tissue-specific expression systems. Second, they were used as terms in the calculation of the “mosquito equation” which estimates what fraction of transcripts each body part contributes to the mosquito whole body.</p><p>We chose the &gt;5 TPM cutoff because, for a gene to be useful as a potential tissue-specific driver, it would need to be robustly expressed. Our enrichment cutoff (50x enrichment) was chosen because we wanted to set the threshold somewhere that allowed us to identify a robust cohort of body-part specific transcripts in each body part to use in calculating the “mosquito equation”. At TPM &gt;5 and 50x enrichment, the abdomen had the smallest number of qualifying genes (8). At the next most restrictive threshold we tried (100x) the number of qualifying genes in the abdomen fell to 3. We felt it was not desirable to base the calculation on such a small cohort.</p><p>After calculating the mosquito equation, we used it to predict the expression of each gene in the genome in whole body and plotted it against observed values (2 supp 2A). The resulting strong correlation satisfied us that 50x was a sufficiently restrictive cutoff for this purpose.</p><p>b) ‘Top 20’ (Treemaps, figures 1C, 2C, and 7E)</p><p>The purpose of the ‘Top 20’ figures was to demonstrate (a) that some transcriptomes (<italic>e.g.</italic>, gut) invest heavily in a few genes while others (<italic>e.g.</italic>, ovaries) spread their transcripts over more of the genome and (b) to illustrate the types of function that the top expressed genes in each body part have (e.g. peptidases dominating the gut, AMPs in the prov, etc.).</p><p>We chose to use the 20 highest-expressed genes because we found this was the threshold that best illustrated the contrast between transcriptomes: the top 20 genes contribute ~50% of all gut transcripts and ~10% of all ovary transcripts. We found that using more than 20 genes was not desirable as the cells in the treemaps became too small to distinguish.</p><p>c) GO plots: padj &lt;0.05, 5x Enrichment (1C, 2B, 6 supp 1C); 2x Enrichment (1C (ovaries only) 3B, 4C)</p><p>For all GO analyses, we found, through trial and error, that a test set of ~200-1000 genes was optimal to obtain meaningful and statistically significantly enriched categories against a background of ~20,000 genes in the Aedes genome. We found that test sets of &gt;2000 genes (&gt;10% of the genome) were too large, resulting in higher and often non-significant p values. Thresholds of 2x and 5x enrichment versus whole-body yielded the following quantities of significantly upregulated genes (overly small and overly large test sets are marked with *):</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom">2x</th><th valign="bottom">5x</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Head</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*2664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1376</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thorax</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*2271</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">761</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abdomen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1871</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">359</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gut</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*2163</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">985</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">MT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*2567</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1193</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ovaries</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">555</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*44</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Crop</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*2501</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1427</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Prov</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1234</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">414</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ant</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">757</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">188</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Post</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hind</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1449</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">620</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We found that the 5x enrichment netted a desirable fraction of the genome in all body part and gut region comparisons except for ovaries vs whole body, which yielded only 44 genes, and posterior gut versus whole gut, which yielded a single gene.</p><p>The low number of genes in ovaries meeting the 5x threshold motivated the choice to use a 2x cut-off for ovaries only. We felt this choice was justified by the fact that ovaries are the greatest contributor (~29%) of transcripts to whole gut, making it more difficult for differentially expressed genes in this organ to meet the 5x threshold.</p><p>A different approach was required for the posterior midgut which contributes ~90% of whole gut transcripts (see Figure 2E). In effect, a comparison of posterior midgut to whole gut was nearly equivalent to comparing the posterior midgut to itself. To evaluate enrichment of function in this region, we created a test set which included all genes that were significantly enriched in the posterior midgut (padj &lt; 0.05) in comparison to all other gut regions, in a combined DESeq2 comparison, with all replicates from other regions receiving equal weight in the analysis. This yielded a test set of 608 genes. We would like to note here that in the previous version of the manuscript (and pre-print) we mistakenly stated that the GOEA for posterior midguts in <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> employed a 5x cutoff. This is incorrect. No fold-change cutoff was employed for this region in either species. We regret the error and have corrected it in all figure legends and supplementary materials.</p><p>The comparisons of blood-fed timepoints and regions did not yield as many 5x enriched genes as the body part/gut region comparisons. This is unsurprising, as we were comparing differences in condition rather than in tissue. For these comparisons, we opted to use a 2x threshold.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom"><bold>2x</bold></th><th valign="bottom"><bold>5x</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Upregulated</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">6 vs SF</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">828</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">228</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">24 vs 6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">911</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">381</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">48 vs 24</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">469</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">48 vs SF</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">102</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BF post vs Post</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">989</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">409</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BF ant vs Ant</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">317</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*95</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Downregulated</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">6 vs SF</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1048</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">371</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">24 vs 6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">741</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">170</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">48 vs 24</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">569</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">268</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">48 vs SF</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*85</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BF post vs Post</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">737</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">135</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BF ant vs Ant</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">525</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">108</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Note: in the preprint version of this manuscript, we employed a 400-gene cutoff to limit test set size only for blood-fed comparisons.

The analysis of data is very thorough and well described, showing investment (number of transcripts) and output (number of transcripts balanced by total number of transcripts in a specific tissue) of each organ. The putative biological functions of the different organs are not new and surprising, however, the gene expression profiles and conferred biological functions of the different gut regions is original and was not previously assessed.

RNA yield analyses were not performed as a correction for differences in sequencing depth between RNAseq samples (which were already normalized by the calculation of TPM). Rather, RNA yield experiments were conducted completely independently from RNAseq experiments. The RNA yield experiments serve a similar purpose (for gut regions) to the mosquito equation calculation (for body parts). The objective was to estimate what proportion of the whole gut transcriptome was derived from each gut region.</p><p>We have expanded this section of Methods to make our approach clearer (see lines 964 to 981 in the revised manuscript), but we will also briefly reiterate it here:</p><p>In RNAseq experiments: the samples extracted for the creation of libraries were diluted to the recommended concentration for library preparation, and the resulting libraries were pooled in approximately equal concentration to ensure equal depth of sequencing. Therefore, the resulting quantity of reads from each sample <italic>does not</italic> reflect the RNA yield of the gut regions from which they were extracted. The conversion of counts to TPMs then normalized the data across samples, correcting for any residual variation from dis-equal sequencing depth.</p><p>The RNA yield experiments were conducted by dissecting a known number of gut regions (20 to 50 for small ones, 10 for posterior guts) into 1 mL of Trizol, performing a standard phenol-chloroform extraction (no column purification), resuspending the resulting RNA pellet in a known volume, measuring the concentration by Qubit, and calculating the yield in ng/region (concentration * suspension volume / # of dissected regions).</p><p>The proportional expression of digestive enzymes/transporters (2F, 4F) and of immune genes (5E) was calculated by weighting the cumulative TPM from each category for each region (as determined by RNAseq) by that region’s RNA yield (as determined by Qubit measurement) to establish an estimate of what proportion of transcripts in the whole gut belonging to that category were derived from each contributing region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Additionally, there are points throughout the manuscript that need further explanation to improve clarity and to allow for successful assessment of the methods used.
