One unique component of this complex is the cranial neural crest (CNC) cells. CNC cells and their derivatives give rise to all facial bones, ligaments, and muscle connective tissues including tendons and fascia that directly surround muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chai and Maxson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heude et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le Douarin et al., 2004</xref>). Recently, CNC cells have been shown to regulate formation of mesoderm-derived craniofacial muscles through cell-cell interactions. Mouse genetic studies have further shown that CNC cells and their derivatives surround myogenic cells, facilitate myogenic cell migration, and establish cellular scaffolding at future myogenic sites to regulate muscle morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grimaldi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rinon et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, disruption of <italic>Dlx5/6,</italic> which is specifically expressed by CNC-derived cells in the mouse, leads to the loss of all first pharyngeal arch-derived masticatory muscles and second pharyngeal arch-derived muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heude et al., 2010</xref>). Proliferation and survival of CNC-derived cells and fourthÂ toÂ sixth pharyngeal arch-derived myogenic cells in the soft palate are also affected, resulting in a truncated soft palate in <italic>Dlx5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugii et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, TGFÎ² signaling in CNC-derived cells is critical for proliferation and differentiation of tongue and masseter muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hosokawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iwata et al., 2013</xref>). It is important to note that the transcription factors and signaling pathways critical for the role of CNC-derived cells in myogenesis are not restricted in their expression to merely the CNC-derived cells surrounding the muscle, known as perimysial cells; they are also expressed in other CNC-derived musculoskeletal tissues (e.g. bones, bone eminences, and tendons) and regulate their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Depew et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hosokawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that the same transcription factors and signaling pathways could activate cell-type-specific responses in multiple components of the musculoskeletal complex that may help coordinate the development of this intricate system. Therefore, it is important to investigate the cell-type-specific signaling mechanisms that regulate the heterogeneous CNC-derived cells and reveal their impact on craniofacial musculoskeletal development.</p><p>The soft palate is a muscular structure that comprises the posterior third of the palate. Its movement opens and closes the nasopharynx and oral cavity to direct air and food into different passages, as well as during speech. Several components of the soft palate are CNC-derived, including perimysial cells, palatal stromal cells that constitute the majority of palatal shelf mesenchyme, and tendons. In contrast, the soft palatal muscles are derived from pharyngeal mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grimaldi et al., 2015</xref>). Five muscles are involved in the human soft palate. They include the tensor veli palatini (TVP) and levator veli palatini (LVP), which descend from the skull base and elevate the soft palate, and the palatoglossus (PLG) and palatopharyngeus (PLP), which ascend from the tongue and the pharyngeal wall, respectively, and depress the soft palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The fifth muscle, the musculus uvulae, which is specific to humans, is located at the end of the soft palate. Patients with cleft palate often have multiple types of tissue abnormalities including bone defects and insufficient, misoriented muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dixon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Functional restoration of cleft soft palate is challenging because the muscles have limited ability to regenerate after surgical repair of the cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Von den Hoff et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, comprehensive understanding of the growth and transcription factors that regulate the coordinated development of the distinct tissues in the soft palate is of both scientific and clinical significance.</p><p>Runx2, a known regulator of skeletogenesis and odontogenesis, is a Runt DNA-binding domain family transcription factor and contains multiple activation and repression domains. Patients with haploinsufficiency of <italic>RUNX2</italic> exhibit cleidocranial dysplasia, which is associated with specific skeletal and dental phenotypes. During osteoblast differentiation, Runx2 acts as a master organizer, recruiting phosphorylated Smad1/5, c-Fos, and c-Jun to activate expression of osteoblast-specific collagen and fibronectin upon receiving BMP signals and parathyroid hormones; it also binds histone deacetylases to repress cell cycle inhibitors and stimulate proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schroeder et al., 2005</xref>). Despite its well-known roles in regulating hard tissue development, the importance of Runx2 in soft tissue development has not been studied. Interestingly, several clinical case reports reveal that some RUNX2-deficient patients have thin masseter muscles, cleft lip, or high-arched palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Furuuchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sapp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sull et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamachika et al., 2001</xref>). These studies hint that Runx2 may regulate the development of the palatal muscles and other components in sync with the bone to form the intricate craniofacial musculoskeletal complex by performing multiple tissue-specific roles.</p><p>In this study, we performed an unbiased transcriptional profile analysis of the developing soft palate using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). We identified cellular-level heterogeneity in the CNC-derived soft palate mesenchyme, associated with distinctive cell fates: perimysial and midline mesenchymal lineages, as well as previously unknown cell types associated with putative progenitors. In addition, we found Runx2 was expressed in non-osteochondrogenic cells in the perimysial populations and in CNC-derived progenitor cells. Consistent with its expression pattern, loss of <italic>Runx2</italic> in CNC-derived cells resulted in a soft palate cleft along with tendon, bone, and muscle differentiation defects. We further revealed that loss of <italic>Runx2</italic> led to ectopic expression of <italic>Twist1</italic> and reduction in the expression of perimysial marker genes (<italic>Aldh1a2</italic> and <italic>Hic1</italic>) in CNC-derived perimysial cells. We also identified that suppression of <italic>Twist1</italic> expression by Runx2 is important for the development of palatal muscles and for maintaining the expression of the perimysial marker and myogenic-promoting gene <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>, thus coordinating soft palate morphogenesis by orchestrating the fate determination of CNC-derived mesenchymal lineages. Taken together, our findings reveal that Runx2 regulates distinct downstream targets in different subgroups of CNC-derived cells to fine-tune the development of craniofacial structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals mesenchymal cell heterogeneity within the soft palate primordium</title><p>CNC-derived cells adopt diverse fates to establish the soft palate during development. To investigate the heterogeneity of the CNC-derived population that contributes to the developing soft palate at the single-cell level, we performed unbiased single-cell RNA-seq and integration analysis at three critical stages (E13.5, E14.5, E15.5). The soft palate primordium begins to form around E13.5, followed by fusion of the soft palatal shelves at E14.5 and myotube maturation at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Following integration analysis by Seurat 3, we identified 19 clusters identifiable as 8 cell types using known genetic markers: CNC-derived mesenchymal cells (<italic>Meox1+, Dlx5+</italic>), myogenic cells (<italic>Myod1+, Myf5+</italic>), neurons (<italic>Tubb3+, Stmn2+</italic>), endothelial cells (<italic>Cdh5+</italic>), erythroid cells (<italic>Hba-x</italic>+), glial cells (<italic>Plp1</italic>+, <italic>Sox10</italic>+), myeloid cells (<italic>Lyz2+</italic>), and epithelial cells (<italic>Krt14+</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Several lineages consisted of multiple clusters, such as CNC-derived mesenchymal, epithelial, neuronal, and myogenic cells, highlighting the heterogeneity within those populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, in the CNC-derived mesenchymal cell population, we observed eight different clusters (Clusters 0â4, 7, 8, 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâB</xref>). Besides Clusters 2 and 10, which were identified as terminally differentiated osteogenic and chondrogenic cells, respectively, the cell types and functions of the other clusters in the CNC-derived mesenchymal population have not yet been well characterized.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of distinct populations of cranial neural crestÂ (CNC)-derived mesenchymal cells in the soft palate during development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UMAP plot integration analysis of mouse soft palate cells from E13.5, E14.5, and E15.5 based on clusters (left) and different developmental stages (right).

We thus identified four major types of CNC-derived cells in the soft palate besides osteogenic (Cluster 2) and chondrogenic cells (Cluster 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Cluster 0 was enriched with early CNC marker genes such as <italic>Tfap2b, Six2,</italic> and <italic>Prrx1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">SimÃµes-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>), so we suspected that this population might be an undifferentiated early progenitor population associated with early CNC cells, and accordingly we hypothesized that they were CNC-derived progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Genes enriched in Cluster 1 (<italic>Tbx22, Wnt16, Meis2</italic>) were associated with the palatal shelf midline during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Louw et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pauws et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>); hence, we refer to this cluster as midline mesenchymal cells. Clusters 3, 4, and 7 expressed high levels of genes related to head and muscle morphogenesis (<italic>Cxcl12, Igf1, Aldh1a2</italic>); we refer to them as perimysial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schiaffino and Mammucari, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vasyutina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, Cluster 8 was strongly enriched in genes associated with mitosis (<italic>Top2a, Ccnb1, Ube2c</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pines, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strauss et al., 2018</xref>) even after cell cycle regression was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We therefore refer to this cluster as mitotic cells.</p><p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> identities of each cluster, we performed RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of the soft palate at E14.5. Different soft palate myogenic sites develop sequentially from anterior to posterior direction. Specifically, in coronal sections, the unfused palatal shelves in the LVP region (posterior) protrude toward the midline and the myogenic cells grow in a lateral to medial direction along the palatal shelves at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while the palatal shelves in the TVP region (anterior) are already fused and the myogenic cells wrap around the pterygoid plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As the TVP and LVP myogenic sites are more identifiable than those of the PLG and PLP at E14.5, we used the former as reference points for the anatomical locations of each cluster in our analysis. Using the top enriched genes of each cluster, we identified their distinct anatomical locations <italic>in vivo</italic>. The <italic>Ibsp+</italic> osteogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,M</xref>) and <italic>Col2a1+</italic> chondrogenic clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,N</xref>) were mostly associated with part of the styloid process of the temporal bone in the LVP region and the pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone in the TVP region. In the LVP region, the <italic>Tfap2b</italic>+ progenitor cluster was mainly located in the lateral portions of the palatal shelves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The majority of the <italic>Aldh1a2+</italic> perimysial cluster was distributed in the lateral portion while only a small portion of this cluster appeared in the central myogenic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In contrast, the two other perimysial clusters (<italic>Hic1+</italic> and <italic>Tbx15+</italic>) were most abundantly located in the central myogenic sites of the LVP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IâJ</xref>). Midline mesenchymal cells (<italic>Tbx22+</italic>) were mainly located in the medial portions of the palatal shelves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). The <italic>Top2a</italic>+ mitotic cells were distributed throughout the palatal shelves and adjacent to both early progenitors and committed CNC-derived cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). A similar distribution of different cluster markers was observed in the TVP region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1OâT</xref>). Outside of the soft palate, the perimysial markers (<italic>Aldh1a2, Hic1</italic> and <italic>Tbx15</italic>) were expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the tongue and masseter muscles in addition to the palatal myogenic sites of the TVP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1PâR</xref>), while near the LVP region, <italic>Hic1</italic> and <italic>Tbx15</italic> were also expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the migratory path of myogenic progenitors of the LVP and the myogenic sites of the middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle and tensor tympani muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IâJ</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâE</xref>). These observations suggest the perimysial lineage might be a common CNC-derived sub-population involved in the development of multiple craniofacial muscles.</p><p>Because the oropharyngeal muscles are only present in the soft palate, not the hard palate, we investigated whether the perimysial markers are also specific to the soft palate. Interestingly, <italic>Tbx15</italic> expression was absent from the hard palate, but <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> and <italic>Hic1</italic> were expressed in the hard palate mesenchyme specifically surrounding the tooth germ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3DâF</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> and <italic>Hic1</italic> might have different functions in the hard and soft palate. Interestingly, we also observed that <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> was expressed in the medial mesenchyme of the tongue, while <italic>Hic1</italic> and <italic>Tbx15</italic> were expressed broadly in the mesenchyme of the tongue at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C,EâF</xref>). Moreover, the expression of <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> in the tongue gradually decreased from E12.5 to E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3AâC</xref>). As myogenic precursors started to appear in the center of tongue primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2012</xref>), the <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>+ population might be specifically associated with early myogenic populations, while <italic>Hic1+</italic> and <italic>Tbx15+</italic> populations may be associated with more general myogenic populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Runx2 is expressed in the perimysial populations and CNC-derived progenitor cells during soft palate development</title><p>To elucidate the dynamic process by which CNC-derived cells differentiate during soft palate development, we performed individual single-cell transcriptome analyses for E13.5, E14.5, and E15.5, then compared them. The pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone and part of the styloid process of the temporal bone are not considered to be part of the palate, so we excluded the osteochondrogenic clusters belonging to these structures from further analysis. Interestingly, we observed decreased cell heterogeneity in CNC-derived soft palate mesenchymal populations during development. The number of CNC-derived clusters declined from seven at E13.5 to six at E14.5 and eventually five at E15.5 using the same unsupervised clustering settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, myogenic cells formed a single cluster at E13.5 but expanded to two clusters at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate how each cluster changed over time, we extracted and compared the CNC-derived and myogenic cells from E13.5 to E15.5 based on the earlier integration analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with previous observations, in the myogenic clusters we observed an increased number of both early myogenic precursors (Cluster 9, <italic>Msc+, Myf5+</italic>) and differentiated myocytes (Cluster 17, <italic>Myl4+</italic>) as development progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The number of cells in Clusters 1 (<italic>Tbx22+</italic>), 3 (<italic>Hic1+</italic>) and 4 (<italic>Tbx15+</italic>) also increased from E13.5 to E15.5, but the number of cells in CNC-derived Clusters 0 (<italic>Tfap2b+</italic>), 7 (<italic>Aldh1a2+</italic>), and 8 (<italic>Top2a+</italic>) gradually decreased. This suggests that Clusters 0, 7, and 8 may be progenitors that are transiently present at early stages of soft palate development and give rise to Clusters 1, 3, and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref>). To test this, we also computationally predicted the differentiation trajectory of CNC-derived cells using pseudotime analysis. Our results predicted Cluster 0 to be common CNC-derived progenitors that bifurcate into two more committed groups: perimysial progenitors (Cluster 7) for the later perimysial population (perimysial fibroblasts) (Clusters 3 and 4), and another group of progenitors (a subset of Cluster 0 and Cluster 8) for midline mesenchymal cells (Cluster 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1BâC</xref>). The integration analysis suggested that the fate decision between perimysial and midline mesenchymal cells happens at E13.5-E14.5. Cluster 8, predicted to be a more committed group of progenitors, represents the Top2a+ mitotic population. Because mitosis establishes a time window during which transcription factors can easily access and activate genes important for cell lineage determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gurdon, 2016</xref>), cells with high mitotic activity are likely undergoing cell fate transition. Therefore, those Top2a+ mitotic cells might be transitioning from early progenitor status to becoming more committed to a particular fate. Interestingly, the number of <italic>Aldh1a2+</italic> cells in Cluster 7 gradually decreased, but the number of <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>+ cells increased in Clusters 3 and 4 from E13.5 to E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), probably because <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> labels both the majority of the early perimysial population (Cluster 7) and also some of the late perimysial populations (Clusters 3 and 4).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Runx2 is expressed in cranial neural crestÂ (CNC)-derived progenitors and perimysial cells during soft palate development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Individual UMAP clustering of CNC-derived mesenchymal and myogenic cells at three different embryonic stages (E13.5, E14.5, and E15.5) from integration analysis (top and middle panel).

Double staining of Runx2 and the myogenic marker MyoD/<italic>Myod1</italic> from E13.5-E15.5 revealed changes in Runx2 expression in the myogenic region as development progressed. Runx2 expression was gradually restricted from most of the palate primordium at E13.5 to only the mesenchymal cells in the putative progenitor, perimysial, and osteogenic sites in the LVP region at E14.5; eventually, it was found only in the osteogenic regions at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2KâM</xref>). As there was no detectable Runx2 expression in the TVP perimysial site from E13.5 to E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2NâP</xref>), we focused on the LVP region as we investigated the colocalization of Runx2 with markers of early CNC-derived progenitors and different lineages <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Notably, in analyzing the CT scans, we found that three out of six <italic>Runx2</italic> mutant mice with missing palatine bones and more severe pterygoid plate defects also had soft palate clefts, while the other three <italic>Runx2</italic> mutants without clefts exhibited palatine bones that were smaller, though not statistically significantly so, and less severe pterygoid plate defects, particularly shorter pterygoid plate height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2AâJ</xref>), suggesting the severity of skeletal defects is associated with the variability of soft palate clefts in <italic>Osr2-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. Consistent with the CT scans, histological analysis showed that the height of pterygoid plate was reduced and muscle attachment was abnormal in the TVP region of <italic>Osr2-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3GâH,LâM</xref>). Because the aponeurosis serves the important function of attaching the hard tissue to the muscle, we also analyzed the fibrous tendon tissue marked by <italic>Scx</italic> by RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. The tendon tissue did not extend to the midline in the palate primordium in the TVP region in <italic>Osr2-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice as it did in the controls at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3IâL</xref>). It could be seen more clearly at P0 that the aponeurosis in <italic>Osr2-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice was thinner and it did not stretch from the lateral-oral side to the medial-nasal side as it did in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4AâD</xref>), suggesting its attachment to the posterior bone probably was likely abnormal. As Runx2 is not expressed in the perimysial site of the TVP region, Therefore, this muscle attachment defect of the TVP might be due to disruption of the hard tissue and aponeurosis. In the LVP region, the muscles were reduced in size in <italic>Osr2-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3IâK,NâP</xref>).

We began by analyzing the expression pattern of <italic>Twist1</italic> during soft palate development. Based on the integration analysis of E13.5-E15.5 single-cell transcriptomes from controls, we observed <italic>Twist1</italic> was primarily expressed in midline mesenchymal cells (<italic>Tbx22+</italic>), while its expression in CNC-derived common progenitors and perimysial cells (<italic>Tfap2b</italic>+; <italic>Aldh1a2+</italic>) was relatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, expression of <italic>Twist1</italic> in the CNC-derived cells changed over time.

This spatiotemporally specific <italic>Twist1</italic> expression in the palate primordium and myogenic regions of the soft palate was accompanied by an opposite trend in Runx2 expression in the same regions at the same stages. This is perhaps shown most clearly by the colocalization of Runx2 and <italic>Twist1</italic> in the LVP region at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâG</xref>), which suggested that expression levels of Runx2 and <italic>Twist1</italic> are tightly coordinated during soft palate development.

To date, understanding of the molecular heterogeneity in different regions of the soft palate mesenchyme has mainly been based on location-specific genes that control local development and signal induction during palate outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Potter and Potter, 2015</xref>). However, this does not completely explain how molecular heterogeneity contributes to the multiple roles played by CNC-derived cells during palate formation, or specifically how they guide soft palate muscle development.</p><p>In this study, we have revealed the cellular-level heterogeneity in the soft palate and established that different subtypes of CNC-derived cells are associated with distinct differentiation potentials and functions. Functional analysis of each CNC-derived cluster shows previously unknown subtypes of CNC-derived cells, and computational analysis suggests previously unknown lineage differentiation trajectories. <italic>Tfap2b+</italic> cells are the least differentiated subtype and give rise to <italic>Aldh1a2+</italic> perimysial progenitor cells and <italic>Top2a+</italic> transitioning cells, which further differentiate into perimysial fibroblasts and midline mesenchymal fibroblasts. <italic>Tfap2b+</italic> common progenitors, transitioning cells and some <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>+ perimysial progenitor cells are transiently present only at early stages of soft palate development, consistent with their roles as progenitors. This transient presence of CNC-derived progenitor cells is similar to that of neural crest cells, which are known to be pluripotent during embryonic development and disappear at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bronner and LeDouarin, 2012</xref>). In addition, we show that markers labeling soft palate perimysial populations, such as <italic>Hic1, Aldh1a2</italic>, and <italic>Tbx15</italic>, are also expressed by connective tissues in other craniofacial muscles, including the tongue and masseter muscles. Consistent with our findings, <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> is known as an important enzyme for retinoic acid signaling, which is crucial for neural crest cells as they guide the positioning of extraocular muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matt et al., 2008</xref>). The potential myogenic-supportive function of <italic>Hic1</italic> has been confirmed by the recent finding that the Hic1+ population represents a source of quiescent mesenchymal progenitors that play important roles during the regeneration of skeletal muscles in the limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scott et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> and <italic>Hic1</italic> might be novel markers for CNC-derived perimysial tissues, which may perform important pro-myogenic functions during muscle development.</p><p>During embryonic development, the palatal shelves grow in a lateral-to-medial direction both before and after their elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bush and Jiang, 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, our <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis shows that the least differentiated <italic>Tfap2b+</italic> subpopulation is located in the lateral region of the soft palate during the early stages of its development, and the perimysial and midline mesenchymal populations reside in central myogenic sites and the medial region of the soft palate. Our results have revealed complex cellular heterogeneity and a differentiation hierarchy of cell populations that contribute to the craniofacial musculoskeletal system, which will require further analysis.</p><p>Recently, studies have found that several transcription factors regulate the development of different components of a musculoskeletal complex in a coordinated fashion to form a functional unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colasanto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathew et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vickerman et al., 2011</xref>). Our study shows that Runx2 is expressed in CNC-derived cells involved in early cell fate determination and in perimysial cells in the soft palate mesenchyme. Loss of <italic>Runx2</italic> in CNC-derived cells of the soft palate mesenchyme leads to multiple tissue defects in the soft palate, including fibrous tendon tissue, soft palate cleft and muscle defects. There is a fate change of CNC-derived cells from perimysial cells to midline mesenchymal cells in the soft palate of <italic>Runx2</italic> mutant mice. As perimysial cells are closely associated with muscle development, loss of <italic>Runx2</italic> affecting their differentiation may in turn affect their secretion of signaling cues that promote muscle proliferation and differentiation. Indeed, we show that multiple genes associated with pro-myogenic secreted factors specifically expressed by perimysial populations, such as <italic>Aldh1a2, Igf1, Cxcl12</italic>, and <italic>Cthrc1</italic>, are downregulated in <italic>Runx2</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schiaffino and Mammucari, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spector et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vasyutina et al., 2005</xref>). Our study provides clues as to how those transcription factors might play different roles in regulating multiple musculoskeletal system components, but how the development of multiple components is integrated still needs further investigation.</p><p>Transcription factors often regulate different downstream targets in distinct tissues. Previous studies have shown that Runx2 regulates the differentiation of CNC-derived cells during early tooth and intramembranous bone formation through distinct sets of downstream targets including <italic>Gli1, Lef1, Tcf1, Wnt10a, Wnt10b</italic>, and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> in osteogenic cells and <italic>Dusp6, Enpp1, Igfbp3</italic>, and <italic>Fgf3</italic> in dental mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we have shown that downstream targets of Runx2 have differing responses to the loss of <italic>Runx2</italic> in the soft tissue. Perimysial markers were specifically downregulated upon loss of Runx2, while genes expressed specifically in the midline mesenchymal cells and a set of more broadly expressed genes are upregulated. Although Runx2 has both transcriptional activation and repression domains, its different regulatory effects on distinct downstream targets in the soft palate mesenchyme could be direct or indirect. Our results thus reveal previously unknown roles of Runx2 in muscle development and help to elucidate the tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms by which Runx2 guides development.</p><p>Twist1 suppresses the function of its binding partner Runx2 through blocking the DNA binding domain of Runx2 to inhibit osteoblast differentiation and promote chondrocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bialek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hinoi et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we reveal complimentary expression patterns of Runx2 and <italic>Twist1</italic> in the perimysial and midline mesenchymal populations during soft palate development, which seems to confirm their antagonistic interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bialek et al., 2004</xref>). However, in contrast to the previously reported model of Twist1 and Runx2 antagonistic interaction, we show that loss of <italic>Runx2</italic> in CNC-derived cells leads to abnormal upregulation of <italic>Twist1</italic> in the perimysial population. Further analysis has shown that suppression of <italic>Twist1</italic> in the perimysial population by Runx2 is necessary to maintain the expression level of perimysial marker gene <italic>Aldh1a2</italic>, which may be important for regulating muscle development. Our findings thus reveal a novel mechanism of Runx2-Twist1 genetic interaction that integrates the development of different types of CNC-derived cells with muscles to guide them to form a functional unit in the soft palate.</p><p>In summary, our study reveals a complex cellular heterogeneity within the developing soft palate and demonstrates that distinct subpopulations of CNC-derived cells are associated with distinct functions, which coordinate to form intricately connected components of the oropharyngeal complex. Moreover, the regulation of myogenesis by perimysial CNC-derived cells through Runx2-Twist1 interaction in the soft palate might also be shared by other craniofacial musculoskeletal structures. Our study highlights the complex regulatory roles of CNC-derived cells in the development of craniofacial musculoskeletal systems and provides knowledge that may lead to new strategies for craniofacial muscle regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Whereas <italic>Runx2</italic> is a known master regulator of osteogenesis, this manuscript demonstrates that <italic>Runx2</italic> function is required for perimysial cell differentiation during soft palate myogenesis. Further data showed that expression of <italic>Twist1</italic> was significantly increased in the perimysial mesenchyme cells and that genetically inactivating one <italic>Twist1</italic> allele was able to rescue soft palate developmental defects in the <italic>Osr2-KICre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. The data were well organized and the manuscript well written. The results and conclusions provide significant new insight into the mechanisms of soft palate development, a clinically important but currently understudied area of craniofacial biology. The sc-RNA-seq data sets should be a significant resource to the community</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main drawback identified by the reviewers is the <italic>Runx2/Twist1</italic> mechanism proposed, which the reviewers feel is problematic based on the presented data. In particular the use of the ATAC-seq data. The known mode of <italic>Twist1/Runx2</italic> interactions is that <italic>Twist1</italic> regulates <italic>Runx2</italic> activity by binding to it, thus preventing <italic>Runx2</italic> from binding DNA. However, this point is immediately confused by suggesting that both bind to DNA upstream of the <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> promoter through the use of ATAC-seq. Importantly, the finding that there are putative <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>Runx2</italic> binding sites in this region is not validated. The issue is further complicated the binding sites for <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>Runx2</italic> are over 20 kb apart, suggesting they do not identify a single enhancer element. Moreover there is no functional data provided to show that either of these regions are functional enhancers. The activities of <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>Runx2</italic> need to be carefully spelled out. The observations were found to be confusing â for example removal of <italic>Runx2</italic> leads to repression of <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> expression while <italic>Twisty</italic> expression increases. The finding that removing one copy of <italic>Twist1</italic> rescues <italic>Aldh1a2</italic> expression in the LVP does not prove that <italic>Runx2</italic> positively regulates <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> expression. An alternative explanation is that <italic>Runx2</italic> normally functions by repressing <italic>Twist1</italic>. In revising the paper the authors need to clearly state how they think <italic>Twist1</italic> and <italic>Runx2</italic> are working while also providing alternative explanations. This does not require additional work but does require deeper consideration and more thoughtful writing. Also, a model of <italic>Twist1/Runx2</italic> interaction (a flow diagram, not one incorporating tissue level signaling) would be helpful.</p><p>2) Please pay attention to improving the presentation of data in which colors appear over- or under-saturated. For example it appears that <italic>Twist1</italic> expression is almost gone when only losing one copy. Other figures bring up similar questions concerning areas of staining that are ignored or not well-described, while other areas are richly described. It is also noted that none of the images use confocal microscopy, though determination of co-expression is made throughout the paper. Many of these concerns could be addressed without additional data. The lack of confocal sections would be acceptable but needs to be acknowledged.</p><p>3) Since <italic>Runx2</italic> is a master regulator of osteogenesis and the <italic>Osr2KI-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mutant shown in Figure 3B appears to have a defect in the palatal process of the palatine (with a large gap in the middle of the posterior region of the hard palate bone), images of skeletal preparations should be included in this manuscript with description of the relevant palatal and pterygoid process defects. In addition, it needs to be discussed how the posterior hard palate bone defects could secondarily disrupt the palatine aponeurosis and integration/orientation of the soft palate muscles. If the palatal bone defects were variable in the <italic>Osr2KI-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, whether the skeletal defects correlated with the variability of soft palate cleft should also be noted.

In addition, it needs to be discussed how the posterior hard palate bone defects could secondarily disrupt the palatine aponeurosis and integration/orientation of the soft palate muscles. If the palatal bone defects were variable in the Osr2KI-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, whether the skeletal defects correlated with the variability of soft palate cleft should also be noted. Related to this point, it will be of great value to also document whether the Osr2KI-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Twist1<sup>fl/+</sup> mice exhibited rescue of the palatal and pterygoid bone defects and discuss how that could be relevant to the rescue of the soft palate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments.</p><p>1) We have performed microCT analysis of both hard and soft tissues of <italic>Runx2</italic> mutants and control mice. We observed palatine bone and pterygoid process defects along with the soft tissue defects in the <italic>Runx2</italic> mutant mice (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A-J), and the severity of skeletal defects was associated with the variability of the soft palate cleft. In <italic>Runx2</italic> mutants with soft palate clefts, the palatine bones were missing, and the pterygoid plate was significantly smaller in length and height than in control mice (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A-D, I). In <italic>Runx2</italic> mutants without clefts, although the length, width and height of the palatine bone and the length of pterygoid plate appeared smaller than those of control mice, those differences were not statistically significant. However, the height of the pterygoid plate in <italic>Runx2</italic> mutants without clefts was significantly shorter than in control mice (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2E-H, J). Hence, only the pterygoid plate defects were consistent for all the <italic>Runx2</italic> mutants.</p><p>2) We analyzed the aponeurosis by performing RNAscope <italic>in situ</italic> analysis of <italic>Scx</italic> in the soft palate regions of both control and <italic>Runx2</italic> mutant mice at P0 (Figure 3âfigure supplement 4). In <italic>Runx2</italic> mutant mice, the aponeurosis was thinner, and it did not stretch from the lateral-oral to the medial-nasal direction as it did in control mice. This probably causes the abnormal attachment of the TVP. However, for the LVP, we observed the muscle defects as early as E14.5 (Figure 4A-B), when palatine bones start to condense and differentiate, and it is before the palatal shelvesâ fusion in the LVP region. This suggests that the defects of the LVP muscle are primary, independent of posterior hard palate bone and aponeurosis defects in <italic>Runx2</italic> mutant mice.</p><p>3) We collected <italic>Runx2/Twist1</italic> compound mutant rescue samples and performed hard tissue CT and histological analysis.</p><p>Since the palatine bone phenotypes in <italic>Runx2</italic> mutant mice varied, and the differences in those with less severe bone phenotypes were not significant (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2J), it is difficult to conclude whether the palatine bone defects were rescued or not. We nevertheless collected <italic>Runx2/Twist1</italic> compound mutant rescue mice for hard tissue CT analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Based on the CT analysis result, we observed that there were no significant differences between the palatine bones of <italic>Runx2/Twist1</italic> compound mutant rescue mice and <italic>Runx2</italic> mutants with less severe skeletal phenotypes. Moreover, as we mentioned earlier, the defects of the LVP muscle and the rescue of perimysial marker (<italic>Aldh1a2</italic>) expression appear as early as E14.5 (Figure 6J-L), when the palatine bones start to condense and differentiate. Taking these results together, it appears that the LVP muscle defect is unlikely as the result of defect in hard palate bone.</p><p>Interestingly, the height of the pterygoid plate was significantly affected in all the <italic>Runx2</italic> mutants, so we analyzed the pterygoid plate in control, <italic>Runx2</italic> mutants and <italic>Runx2/Twist1</italic> compound mutant rescue mice histologically and measured their heights. We observed partial rescue of pterygoid plate defects caused by loss of <italic>Runx2</italic> in <italic>Runx2/Twist1</italic> compound mutant mice (Figure 6B-H).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Deletion of <italic>Runx2</italic> in CNC-derived cells gives rise to hard tissue defects in <italic>Osr2-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice.</title><p>(A-C) Isolated palatine bones and sphenoid bones from control (A), <italic>Osr2-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (B) and <italic>Osr2-Cre;Runx2<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Twist1<sup>fl/+</sup></italic> mice (C).
