foreign peptides by converting small differences in ligand binding half-life into large changes in cell signaling. Such a kinetic proofreading model has been difficult to test directly, as existing methods of altering ligand binding half-life also change other potentially important biophysical parameters, most notably the mechanical stability of the receptor-ligand interaction. Here we develop an optogenetic approach to specifically tune the binding half-life of a chimeric antigen receptor without changing other binding parameters and provide direct evidence of kinetic proofreading in T cell signaling. This half-life discrimination is executed in the proximal signaling pathway, downstream of ZAP70 recruitment and upstream of diacylglycerol accumulation. Our methods represent a general tool for temporal and spatial control of T cell signaling and extend the reach of optogenetics to probe pathways where the individual molecular kinetics, rather than the ensemble average, gates downstream signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>kinetic proofreading</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>LOV2</kwd><kwd>chimeric antigen receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001127</institution-id><institution>Genentech Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tischer</surname><given-names>Doug K</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM109899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-1548297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Orion David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Direct control of ligand binding half-life with light shows that lifetime strongly affects T cell signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The T cell response begins when the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) binds its cognate peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on an antigen-presenting cell. Ligand discrimination is essential, as falsely recognizing a self-peptide can lead to autoimmunity, while missing a foreign-peptide allows pathogens to evade detection. Compounding this challenge, self-pMHCs generally outnumber foreign-pMHCs by several orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Unternaehrer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhardwaj et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Irvine et al., 2002</xref>). How the TCR recognizes its foreign-pMHC while ignoring the vastly more numerous self-pMHC is a fundamental open question in immunology.</p><p>For many cell surface receptors, occupancy drives the strength of signaling. Lower affinity ligands can signal as well as high affinity ligands when their concentration is increased such that an equal number of receptors are bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kinzer-Ursem et al., 2006</xref>). This is unlikely to be the case for activation of the T cell, because low affinity pMHCs are significantly less potent than high affinity pMHCs, even when adjusted for occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daniels et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, given the large excess of self-pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Unternaehrer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhardwaj et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Irvine et al., 2002</xref>) and the relatively small differences in binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Germain and Stefanová, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gascoigne et al., 2001</xref>), it is likely that more TCRs are bound to self-pMHC than foreign-pMHC. For a T cell to detect foreign pMHCs, it is likely that some ligand-intrinsic factor makes bound foreign-pMHCs more stimulatory than bound self-pMHCs.</p><p>A major model of T cell ligand discrimination is kinetic proofreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McKeithan, 1995</xref>), which predicts that small differences in ligand binding half-life can be amplified into large differences in signaling. Such a model is attractive because it allows a few receptors bound to long-lived ligands to signal better than many receptors bound to short-lived ligands, potentially explaining why abundant self-pMHCs do not activate T cells, though scarce foreign-pMHCs do. It posits a delay made up of multiple irreversible biochemical steps between ligand binding and downstream signaling. Only ligands that bind persistently signal effectively. These steps only occur while the ligand is bound and quickly reset upon dissociation, preventing two successive short binding events from mimicking one long binding event. This mechanism is based on the kinetic proofreading that gives DNA replication, protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ninio, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hopfield, 1974</xref>), and mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgess and Guthrie, 1993</xref>) specificity far beyond what would be predicted from equilibrium binding constants alone. Consistent with this hypothesis, kinetic measurements generally show that stimulatory pMHCs have longer binding half-lives, while non-stimulatory pMHCs have shorter binding half-lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Germain and Stefanová, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gascoigne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsui et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Kinetic proofreading effects need to be strongest when differences in pMHC binding affinities are small, as abundant self-pMHCs will bind more TCRs than scarce foreign-pMHCs. Strong kinetic proofreading ensures that short self-pMHC binding events are unlikely to contribute to downstream signaling. However, recent techniques that measure pMHC binding affinities in more native 2D environments show a larger range of binding affinities than previously measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that there may not be as large an excess of self-pMHC bound to the TCR and raises the question of the magnitude of kinetic proofreading needed to discriminate pMHC ligands.</p><p>To probe kinetic proofreading in T cells, the field most commonly relies on altered peptide series to change binding half-lives. The limitation of this approach is that when the binding interface is altered, both the bond’s half-life and stability under tension must change together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). Differentiating the effects of these two variables is essential because recent evidence has shown that the TCR is mechanosenstive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Das et al., 2015</xref>) and that foreign-pMHC can form catch bonds with the TCR, growing more stable under load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, conventional mutational approaches make it difficult to determine whether changes in signaling arise from alterations in binding half-life or reflect changes in the force being applied to the TCR. To specifically probe the role of binding half-life in ligand discrimination, the field needs new techniques to manipulate the receptor-ligand half-life while leaving force transmission and all other aspects of the interaction unchanged. Here we develop an optogenetic approach for T cell activation that addresses this need.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42498.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strategy for testing kinetic proofreading with optogenetic tools.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conventional methods of mutating the pMHC to alter the binding half-life also change the binding interface, which changes several parameters at once. By contrast, optogenetic control allows light intensity to control ligand binding half-life while keeping the binding interface constant. Therefore, no other aspects of the receptor-ligand interaction change. Red and blue lines highlight the binding interfaces. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of experimental setup.

Because cells slowly contract over the imaging time course, we show the change in cell area during each pulse of blue light.

Biochemically purified LOV2 presented on a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) served as the ligand while allowing for simultaneous imaging of live cell signaling reporters.</p><p>A key advantage of this approach is that it allows us to test the kinetic proofreading model directly. For most protein-protein interactions, the binding half-life and the bond’s stability under tension necessarily co-vary with each other, as they are both consequences of the height of the transition state. This makes it hard to distinguish between a kinetic proofreading and mechanosensitive model of T cell signaling. A ligand with a long binding half-life is <italic>necessarily</italic> more stable under load, and both models predict it would be more stimulatory. Our approach uncouples these parameters by using one ligand-receptor pair to explore a range of half-lives. Blue light, not point mutations, tunes the binding half-life. Because the ligand-receptor pair remains constant in all experiments, so too does the amount of tension they can withstand. Our optogenetic approach directly and specifically tunes ligand binding half-life, allowing us to cleanly measure the degree to which binding half-life influences T cell signaling.</p><p>A point of controversy is whether kinetic proofreading steps occur at the TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stepanek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mandl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sloan-Lancaster et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Madrenas et al., 1997</xref>) or further downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Donoghue et al., 2013</xref>). An advantage of our synthetic CAR approach is that it is simpler than the TCR, helping to bypass some early signaling steps (e.g. CD4 or CD8 coreceptor involvement which are lacking in the CAR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris and Kranz, 2016</xref>) and focus on the role the shared downstream pathway can play in ligand discrimination. Paired with live cell readout at multiple steps in the signaling pathway, our approach helps to define the degree to which different portions of the pathway contribute to kinetic proofreading.</p><p>By directly controlling ligand binding half-life with light and holding all other binding parameters constant, we show that longer binding lifetimes are a key parameter for potent T cell signaling. Surprisingly, this discrimination occurs in the proximal signaling pathway, downstream of ZAP70 recruitment and upstream of DAG accumulation. This work aids our understanding of how T cell discriminate ligands and expands optogenetics as a tool for controlling the timing of single molecular interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LOV2 photoreversibly binds the CAR</title><p>We first validated the ability of the LOV2 ligand to photoreversibly bind the Zdk-CAR.

Thus, it is important to remember that the lifetime of ligand binding can differ from the effective lifetime of receptor engagement. However, we anticipate the effects of ligand rebinding to be reduced in our approach compared with an altered peptide series, as LOV2 is refractory to CAR binding after being stimulated with blue light. Nevertheless, our 4–7 s window separating stimulatory and non-stimulatory half-lives could be an underestimate if our CAR can quickly rebind a molecule of LOV2.</p><p>It is important to stress that these binding half-lives are enforced by constant, not periodic, blue light illumination. Mechanisms other than kinetic proofreading could explain reduced signaling if the cells were stimulated in short, periodic bursts. By contrast, constant blue light illumination allows cells to reach a steady state, which is when we make our single cell measurements. Although on the whole receptor occupancy and downstream signaling are constant, individual receptor-ligand pairs are continually forming and dissociating with a half-life set by the intensity of blue light. Under these conditions, differences in signaling are only attributable to differences in the single molecule interactions between receptor and ligand, not global state changes of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>DAG levels correlate more strongly with ligand binding half-life than CAR occupancy</title><p>Stimulating cells with the same intensities of blue light but different concentrations of LOV2 enabled us to measure the effects of binding half-life in the context of low, medium, and high receptor occupancy.

Each heat map represents an independent data set. <italic>n</italic> is the degree of proofreading calculated by fitting the single cell measurements to our kinetic proofreading model (Supplemental <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 7</xref>, substituting DAG levels for ZAP70 recruitment where appropriate), reported with a 95% confidence interval.

While this result is only true when the signaling pathway is far from saturation, it is reasonable that T cells operate far from saturation when they encounter foreign-pMHCs, given the low stimulatory nature of self-pMHCs. However, how a T cell responds is ultimately a combination of the magnitude of signaling, and the particular set of signaling proteins expressed in different stages of T cell development and in different T cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hogquist et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lucas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hogquist et al., 1997</xref>). Ligand kinetics may be more or less important at evoking responses in these different situations.</p><p>We purposefully used a simple model to reduce the number of free parameters and provide a conservative value of <italic>n</italic>. While this allows us to rule out an occupancy model and estimate the magnitude of the kinetic proofreading effect, it is not meant to reflect the specific biochemical steps in the pathway. Accordingly, our model differs from the data in some important ways. Most significantly, the model predicts signaling to be more sensitive to CAR occupancy than we observe. Even at the lowest CAR occupancies we measured, the single cell data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, top left panel) show no obvious reduction in DAG signaling, as our model predicts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, middle panel). Interestingly, more detailed models of kinetic proofreading that incorporate feedback loops can reduce the pathway’s sensitivity to receptor occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lalanne and François, 2013</xref>) and might improve our model’s fit. The system we developed here to specifically change ligand binding half-life should provide a surgical tool to help experimentally investigate these models and other mechanisms that might enhance discriminating ligands by their binding kinetics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>How much of ligand discrimination do our results account for? As T cells can respond to between 1–10 foreign-pMHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Irvine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2013</xref>) in the context of ~10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> self-pMHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Unternaehrer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhardwaj et al., 1993</xref>), foreign-pMHCs must signal at least 10<sup>4</sup>–10<sup>5</sup> fold stronger than self-pMHCs. Given that differences in binding half-lives between self-pMHCs and foreign-pMHCs are on the order of 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Germain and Stefanová, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gascoigne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2010</xref>), our observed degree proofreading can account for much, but not all, of ligand discrimination. T cells likely use kinetic proofreading in combination with other mechanisms, such as co-receptor involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Irvine et al., 2002</xref>), mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), or signal amplification downstream of DAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2009</xref>), to fully discriminate self from non-self.</p><p>What biochemical steps underlie the observed kinetic proofreading? We addressed this question by measuring one of the earliest signaling events: the recruitment of ZAP70 to the CAR. ZAP70 binds to doubly phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITMAs) in the CAR's cytoplasmic domain. In contrast to DAG levels, ZAP70 recruitment showed no detectable evidence of kinetic proofreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In other words, ZAP70 recruitment was solely dependent on CAR occupancy and was unaffected by the ligand binding half-life. As live cell reporters reflect the cumulative effect of all upstream signaling steps, these results argue that the observed kinetic proofreading occurs somewhere downstream of ZAP70 recruitment and upstream of DAG production.</p><p>It is important to recognize how cell adhesion can affect cell signaling, as T cells adhered to a supported lipid bilayer can display ligand-independent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). The close (&lt;20 nm) apposition of the two membranes can exclude the bulky transmembrane phosphatase CD45 away from the more homogenously distributed CARs or TCRs, favoring ITAM phosphorylation and T cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). We initially used an anti-β2m antibody to passively adhere our cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huse et al., 2007</xref>) to ensure any decreased fluorescence of our TIRF reporters could not be due to cell detachment, but our results are not sensitive to this adhesion system. We observe an equal degree of proofreading at the level of DAG whether or not passive adhesion was used (n = 2.7 ± 0.5 with anti-β2m versus n = 2.8 ± 0.2 without anti-β2m [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>]; 95% CI). Additionally, when cells were adhered to the SLB only with the anti-β2m antibody and no LOV2 ligand, they displayed little ruffling (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>) and lower intensities of the DAG reporter (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting there was no gross activation of the cells. This could be because the antibody we used did not zipper the cell membrane close enough to the SLB to effectively excluded CD45 on its own.</p><p>As the anti-β2m antibody was not necessary, we did not use the it in the ZAP70 experiments. While we did not measure CD45 localization, our results suggest that CD45 exclusion does not contribute to measurable kinetic proofreading at the level of ZAP70 recruitment in our CAR system. However, because CD45 exclusion and T cell signaling are sensitive to the size of the extracellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Irles et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">James and Vale, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choudhuri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), CD45’s contribution to kinetic proofreading may be different in the context of the native TCR-pMHC interaction.</p><p>Even though LOV2 was the only means of cell adhesion in the ZAP70 experiments, the cells retained a small RICM footprint under the higher, inhibitory intensities of blue light. The CAR could adhere the cells by many weak interactions with the abundant LOV2 in the low-affinity conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) or with scarce LOV2 in the high-affinity conformation. Because saturating amounts of blue light were not necessary to maximally suppress cell signaling, a small fraction of LOV2 was likely always in the high-affinity conformation, albeit with a short half-life, even for the highest intensity blue light used with cells.</p><p>Our results differ from a study with a DNA-based CAR, which found a delay between ligand binding and ZAP70 recruitment, implicating some kinetic proofreading effects upstream of ZAP70 recruitment. Mechanistically, this delay was related to the time needed for ligand-occupied CARs to form small clusters, the only place where effective ZAP70 recruitment was observed. The putative dimeric state of our CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Irving and Weiss, 1991</xref>) versus the putative monomeric state of their CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatia et al., 2005</xref>) could account for these differences.</p><p>Significantly, for cells with high CAR occupancy but low ligand binding half-life, we observe ZAP70 recruitment without high DAG levels. These results nicely match the prediction of a two-step ZAP70 activation model. Requiring ZAP70 to bind a phospho-ITAMs and then subsequently be phosphorylated by Lck for full activity allows cells to have significant ZAP70 recruitment without strong downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thill et al., 2016</xref>). It also matches observations of thymocytes and peripheral T cells in vivo, where ZAP70 can be recruited to the CD3zeta but not phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Oers et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Madrenas et al., 1995</xref>), a prerequisite for full activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakraborty and Weiss, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has shown that the recruitment of Lck to the TCR is a key rate-limiting step in discriminating ligand binding lifetimes but left open whether it was mediated through Lck’s phosphorylation of ITAMs or ZAP70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stepanek et al., 2014</xref>). As we observe no kinetic proofreading in ZAP70 recruitment, our results suggest Lck’s proofreading effects are mediated through ZAP70 phosphorylation. However, TCR ITAM phosphorylation is sensitive to the strength of the pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sloan-Lancaster et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Madrenas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Madrenas et al., 1995</xref>). It could be that ZAP70 recruitment doesn’t parallel ITAM phosphorylation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sloan-Lancaster et al., 1994</xref>), as both tyrosines within a single ITAM need to be phosphorylated to effectively recruit ZAP70 or that parameters other than binding lifetime affect ITAM phosphorylation. Future experiments that titrate ligand binding half-life with our system and measure both ITAM phosphorylation, ZAP70 recruitment and ZAP70 phosphorylation would help parse the mechanism in finer detail.</p><p>ZAP70 phosphorylation is attractive as a proofreading step because it occurs physically close to the receptor, allowing it to reset quickly upon ligand dissociation. This is a central requirement of kinetic proofreading. Another candidate biochemical step could be the phosphorylation of Y132 on LAT because of its involvement in recruiting PLCγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Paz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin and Weiss, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>). Lck was recently shown to act as a bridge between ZAP70 and LAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lo et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that at least some fraction of LAT molecules could be tethered to phosphorylated ITAMs. Future experiments should focus on how mutations that change the kinetics of LAT Y132 or ZAP70 Y315/Y319 phosphorylation affect ligand discrimination.</p><p>In summary, we addressed a fundamental question in immunology: How do T cells discriminate ligands? We overcame previous technical limitations by developing a new optogenetic approach that directly tunes ligand binding half-life while keeping constant all other parameters that could affect CAR signaling. We found direct evidence that ligand binding half-life strongly controls downstream DAG levels but not upstream signaling events, like ZAP70 recruitment.</p><p>Additionally, our experiments with a CAR revealed a similar degree of kinetic proofreading as complementary experiments that measured calcium release downstream of optogenetic stimulation of the TCR (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yousefi et al., 2019</xref>). As both DAG levels and calcium release are similarly situated in the signaling pathway (both being immediate consequences of PLCγ activity), it suggests that the observed kinetic proofreading is a consequence of shared signaling elements between these two systems, either at the level of the receptors and/or the proximal signaling pathway. Considering our ZAP70 results, the most parsimonious explanation is that ligand half-life discrimination is not completed entirely by the receptor (CAR or TCR) and that kinetic proofreading can emerge from steps in the proximal signaling pathway.</p><p>To date, optogenetics has been a powerful approach because it tells us how the timing, amount, and localization of an ensemble of signaling molecules modulate cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tischer and Weiner, 2014</xref>). With the direct control over the persistence of individual protein-protein interactions presented here, optogenetics can advance to explore how the lifetime of individual molecular interactions regulates cell signaling. This could be a powerful angle for investigating other pathways where the individual molecular kinetics rather than the ensemble average are thought to gate downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Case et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>C1-Halo</td><td>PMID: 17629516</td><td/><td>Dr. Mark M Davis <break/>(Stanford University)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td valign="bottom">ZAP70-mCherry</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 23840928</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">Dr. Jay Groves <break/>(UC Berkeley)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td valign="bottom">LOV2 (V529N)</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 27427858, <break/>PMID: 18604202</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">Dr. Klaus Hahn <break/>(UNC Chapel Hill)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td valign="bottom">Zdk1 (purified)</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 27427858</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">Dr. Klaus Hahn <break/>(UNC Chapel Hill)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td valign="bottom">Zdk-CAR</td><td valign="bottom">This paper and <break/>PMID: 1705867</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">Zdk1 was fused to the <break/>N-terminus of an existing <break/>CD8 CAR, provided by Dr. <break/>Art Weiss (UCSF)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, male)</td><td valign="bottom">Jurkat</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 6327821</td><td valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0367">CVCL_0367</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">Dr. Art Weiss (UCSF)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, male)</td><td valign="bottom">Jurkat expressing <break/>Zdk-CAR and C1- <break/>Halo reporter</td><td valign="bottom">This paper.</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">A clonal Jurkat line expressing <break/>the Zdk-CAR and C1-Halo <break/>reporter made via lentiviral <break/>transduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, male)</td><td valign="bottom">Jurkat expressing <break/>Zdk-CAR and ZAP70 <break/>-mCherry reporter</td><td valign="bottom">This paper.</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">A clonal Jurkat line expressing <break/>the Zdk-CAR and ZAP70-mCherry <break/>reporter made via lentiviral <break/>transduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="bottom">Mouse anti-human <break/>B2 microglobulin</td><td valign="bottom">BioLegend</td><td valign="bottom">Cat. #: 316308 <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_493689">AB_493689</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">Cells labeled at 0.5 ug/ml <break/>in growth media.</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="bottom">PP2</td><td valign="bottom">abcam</td><td valign="bottom">Cat. #: ab120308</td><td valign="bottom">Used at 10 uM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="bottom">Halo dye (JF549)</td><td valign="bottom">PMID: 25599551</td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">Dr. Luke Lavis <break/>(Janelia Research Campus)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="bottom">Alexa Fluor 488 C5 <break/>Maleimide</td><td valign="bottom">ThermoFisher <break/>Scientific</td><td valign="bottom">Cat. #: A10254</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="bottom">Sulfo-Cyanine3 <break/>maleimide</td><td valign="bottom">Lumiprobe</td><td valign="bottom">Cat. #: 11380</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="bottom">POPC</td><td valign="bottom">Avanti Polar Lipids</td><td valign="bottom">Cat. #: 850457C</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="bottom">PEG-PE</td><td valign="bottom">Avanti Polar Lipids</td><td valign="bottom">Cat. #: 880230C</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="bottom">biotinyl CAP PE</td><td valign="bottom">Avanti Polar Lipids</td><td valign="bottom">Cat. #: 870277X</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p>Standard molecular biology protocols were used for all cloning.

The microscope was also equipped with a motorized laser TIRF illumination unit, a Borealis beam-conditioning unit (Andor Technology), a CSU-W1 Yokogawa spinning disk (Andor Technology), a 60x Apochromat TIRF 1.49 NA objective (Nikon), an iXon Ultra EMCCD camera, an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera (Photometrics) and a laser merge module (LMM5; Spectral Applied Research) equipped with 405-, 440-, 488-, 514-, and 561 nm laser lines. For RICM, light from a Xenon arc lamp (Lambda LS, Sutter Instrument) source was passed through a 572/35 nm excitation filter (Chroma, #ET572/35x) filter and then a 50/50 beam splitter (Chroma, #21000). Microscope and associated hardware was controlled with MicroManager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>) in combination with custom built Arduino controllers (Advanced Research Consulting Corporation). Blue light for optogenetic stimulation was from a 470 nm LED (Lightspeed Technologies Inc., #HPLS-36), independently controlled with MATLAB. The maximum power density cells were exposed to was 16 uW/cm<sup>2</sup>. For most timepoints, only RICM and TIRF561 images were collected. During and in between these timepoints, a TIRF488 dichroic mirror remained permanently in the top dichroic turret, ensuring the blue-light illumination of the cells was never interrupted. The top TIRF488 dichroic passed the longer wavelengths used for RICM and TIRF561. Only when LOV2 localization was imaged with TIRF488 at the end of a three-minute stimulation was the top dichroic removed to allow the shorter fluorescence excitation light to pass.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Image processing</title><p>ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) was used for all image manipulation and measurements, while MATLAB was used to analyze the measurements. Prior to analysis, all imaging channels underwent drift correction (K. Li, ‘The image stabilizer plugin for ImageJ,’ <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kangli/code/Image_Stabilizer.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kangli/code/Image_Stabilizer.html</ext-link>, February, 2008) and flat field correction. After each day of imaging, TIRF488, TIRF561 and RICM images were taken on slides with concentrated solutions of fluorescein, Rose Bengal or dPBS, respectively. Camera offset was determined by taking images with the shutter closed. To flat field correct, the camera offset was subtracted from both the experimental and dye images. The experimental image was then divided by the dye slide image to yield the final flat field corrected image used in analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Time course overview</title><p>Typically, cells were held in strong blue light for five minutes and then exposed to five minute blocks of stimulation. Each block was composed of an initial two minute hold in strong blue light followed by a three minute stimulation at a fixed intensity of intermediate blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). DAG levels reported are the average of the final six timepoints. Since each timepoint is 10 s apart, these timepoints are acquired during the last minute of the three minute stimulation. CAR occupancy was measured from a TIRF488 image taken at the end of the three minute stimulation, after the last DAG measurement made in TIRF561. As fluorescence excitation light from TIRF488 potently stimulates LOV2, the TIRF488 channel could only be imaged once at the very end of a three minute stimulation. These five minute blocks were repeated over the course of an hour to stimulate cells with a variety of blue light intensities.</p><p>Cells were illuminated with blue light intensities that were ‘out of order’ to help guard against any time-dependent ‘position effects’ or changes of state of the cells. The two minute pulse of strong blue light before each three minute stimulation was intended to help keep each stimulation independent and guard against hysteresis by beginning each three minute stimulation from the same low-signaling state.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>DAG measurements</title><p>To calculate DAG levels at steady state, the mean TIRF561 pixel intensity within the cell mask was averaged over the last six frames (equivalent to the last 50 s) of a three-minute hold in blue light. To account for background fluorescence from the DAG reporter in the absence of signaling, cells were treated with saturating amounts of PP2 (10 uM final; abcam, #ab120308) after every time course. The resulting mean TIRF561 pixel intensity was subtracted from mean TIRF561 pixel intensity in response to blue light (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We sometimes observed minor drift in TIRF561 values over time as cell slowly contracted. This drift was stimulation independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and could obscure relatively small increases in DAG signaling. To correct for this drift, every three-minute stimulation of blue light was preceded by a standard two minute ‘reset’ pulse of fixed, higher intensity blue light. The magnitude of the drift was measured as the difference between mean TIRF561 pixel intensity of a reset pulse and the average mean TIRF561 pixel intensity of the last three reset pulses (when the drift had stabilized). The magnitude of the drift was subtracted from the PP2 corrected mean TIRF561 pixel intensities to yield the raw DAG level.</p><p>DAG values were either normalized relative to saturation or to treatment with the Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for an explanation of DAG normalization schemes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>CAR occupancy measurements</title><p>RICM images were thresholded to create a mask of the cell footprint. A second local background mask was made by constructing a thin ribbon along and slightly expanded from the perimeter of the cell mask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Once steady state is reached, free LOV2 should be homogenously distributed on the SLB. The mean TIRF488 pixel intensity the cell footprint is the sum of free LOV2 and LOV2 bound to the CAR, while the mean TIRF488 pixel intensity in the background mask reflects free LOV2. Therefore, CAR occupancy was calculated as the mean TIRF488 pixel intensity in the cell mask minus the mean TIRF488 pixel intensity in the background mask.</p><p>We noticed fluctuations in the 488 nm laser power on the timescale of seconds. To minimize the errors in quantitation from these fluctuations, the 488 nm laser power was tracked by measuring relative changes the integrated whole field TIRF488 fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). On a large scale, the TIRF488 fluorescence should remain constant (as the LOV2-Alexa488 can only diffuse laterally on the SLB), only being affected by changes in 488 nm laser power and photobleaching. Integrated whole field TIRF488 fluorescence intensities were first normalized to their mean over the time course. Measured CAR occupancies were then divided by the corresponding normalized whole field TIRF488 fluorescence. This procedure significantly reduced the variability of measured CAR occupancies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>ZAP70 measurements</title><p>Imaging of the ZAP70 reporter was done similarly to the DAG reporter, except the anti-β2 microglobulin antibody was omitted. We observed greatly reduced dynamic range of the ZAP70 reporter when imaged with the anti-β2 microglobulin antibody due to high basal recruitment. However, in the absence of the antibody, the cell TIRF footprint was small during the PP2 wash-in experiments (the passive adhesion of the anti-β2 microglobulin antibody helps maintain larger footprints when cells are not stimulated), which led to high variability in the mean pixel intensity of basal ZAP70 recruitment. Therefore, ZAP70 recruitment is reported simply as the mean intensity of pixels within the cell footprint, as determined from the RICM images. The corresponding DAG data sets were acquired and analyzed in the same way as the ZAP70 data to ensure that our DAG kinetic proofreading results were not altered by the absence of the anti-β2 microglobulin antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Criteria for including or excluding cells in analysis</title><p>All cells visible within the TIRF field we analyzed, only excluding cells that were dead or dying (judge morphologically) or detached from SLB during the acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Biological and technical replicates</title><p>A biological replicate consisted of four to five time courses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) of stimulating cells with blue light on SLBs with different concentrations of LOV2, all on the same day (to ensure the light path did not change). Each biological replicate was conducted on different days, with new preparations of cells, SLBs and LOV2. Each time course within a biological replicate contained approximately 30 cells, whose DAG levels and receptor occupancy were individually measured.

Cells were first washed in PBS and fixed for 10 min in a 1:1 mixture of PBS:BD Cytofix at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and stained with the primary antibody (either OKT3 or OKT8; UCSF antibody core) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were again washed twice with FACS buffer and stained with the secondary antibody (Goat anti-mouse Alexa488, Invitrogen A-11029). Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD LSR II). An identical staining protocol was used for the Quantum Simply Cellular beads, except they were not fixed. Care was taken to ensure both the primary and secondary antibodies were saturating by using a series of 2-fold serial dilutions of one antibody while the other was held at the highest concentration. No significant decrease of fluorescence was observed for the first 2-fold dilution of either the primary or secondary antibodies, confirming the highest concentration reached saturation. The highest, saturating concentration of OKT3 was 50 ug/ml, OKT8 was 10 ug/ml and the secondary antibody was 20 ug/ml. FACS buffer: dPBS (Ca2+/Mg2 +free; ThermoFisher Scientific, #14190144) with 1% (v/v) FBS and 2 mM EDTA.</p><p>Total surface receptor numbers were calculated per manufacturer’s instructions. In short, log log regression of antibody binding capacity as a function of bead MFI (R2 = 0.9937) was used to convert the MFI of each cell line to total number of bound primary antibodies. Background antibody binding in the no primary control was then subtracted. Because the IgG primary antibodies can bind between one and two surface receptors, a two-fold range is reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Absolute concentration of LOV2 on the bilayer</title><p>To estimate the absolute molecular density of LOV2 in our bilayer, we used single molecule TIRF microscopy.</p><p>First, the LOV2 binding capacity of the bilayer at saturation was calculated. Limiting amounts of LOV2-Alexa488 were diluted into LOV2-Cy3 and added to bilayers already functionalized with saturating amounts of streptavidin until single molecules of LOV2-Alex488 were resolvable. The number of LOV2-Alexa488 molecules were counted by hand and the total LOV2 molecules on the bilayer were calculated knowing the dilution factor, original concentrations of LOV2-Alexa488 and LOV2-Cy3 and their labeling efficiencies (measured spectroscopically).<disp-formula id="equ9"><mml:math id="m9"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mn>488</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>488</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>488</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Where ρ is the molecular density on the bilayer (molecules/um<sup>2</sup>), DF is the LOV2-Alexa488 dilution factor, [LOV2Cy3] and [LOV2Alexa488] are the concentrations of the undiluted protein stocks and fAlexa488 is the fraction of the LOV2-Alexa488 protein stock labeled with Alexa488.

Your article has been reviewed by Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this system the Lov2 domain binds Zdk1 with a low nM Kd in the dark and a low µM Kd in with intense blue light. Intense blue light will induce rapid conversion to low affinity form and dimmer blue light will induce slower conversion (even when Zdk1 is bound) and some degree of dark recovery of those molecules equilibrate to a concentration of active Lov2 that binds Zdk1 and dissociates with a k<sub>off</sub> defined by the light intensity. The Lov2 domain is attached to supported lipid bilayer (SLB) with a fluorophore and the Zdk1 domain (a small three helix bundle based on protein A repeat) is expressed as a first gen CAR. The system is cycled between the dark/dim (binding on) or light (binding off) states with the dark/dim periods leading to increased cell spreading. Even in the light state a contact area is maintained, probably by the low affinity interaction of the off Lov2 with Zdk1. As a readout the authors mostly focus on DAG sensor readout as the ZAP-70 readout for CAR itself seems to be recruited in simple proportion to engagement (even in light/off state?). The DAG reporter signal is proportional to kinetics rather that occupation. Suggesting that the step between the ITAM mediated recruitment of ZAP-70 and the LAT dependent recruitment of PLCγ (based on literature) can be involved in kinetic proofreading with a threshold around 10 seconds.</p><p>As a technical paper that develops a tool, this is an interesting paper and could be published in the Tools and Resources section. The paper is more relevant to synthetic biology and design of CAR based therapies, but limited relevance to how a TCR works or self/non-self discrimination. We do not think that the paper resolves the latter question, which the authors set out to address. A number of technical points about the method need to be addressed. Furthermore, somewhat disturbingly, the vast literature in the field is cited in a selective manner. Below, we provide guidance on both these important issues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Abstract and Introduction should be reshaped to reflect more of the background of CARs and T cell ligand discrimination and what a simplified signaling model with light based kinetic control could teach us.</p><p>2) Many aspects of the system are poorly described- at this point in the technologies they are working with they should provide:</p><p>a) Absolute quantification (molecules/cell) of the CAR on the Jurkat cells. This could be done by flow cytometry with 488 or 640 labelled Luv2 (dark) and MESF beads from Bangs labs.</p><p>b) The density of the Lov2 domain in the SLB in molecules/µm2 across the range that they are using. This could be done by line scanning FCS (dilute fluorescent version with non-fluorescent version if density is too high.) See PMID: 19254560.</p><p>c) The estimate of occupancy will be inaccurate if they don't include a control for exclusion of non-binding Luv2 mutant or similar sized protein in the bilayer with a difference fluorophore. See: PMID: 17911103.</p><p>3) It would be useful to see at least diffraction limited higher magnification images of the different signals to establish the correlation between IRM contact, CAR occupancy, the ZAP-70 and C2 domain sensor. It the CAR forming microclusters or is forming larger domains as it appears in the zoomed out views provided.</p><p>4) A number of relevant papers need to be cited that are pertinent, and the present results related to these studies. A small sampling of the missing literature are:</p><p>a) The work from the Davis lab from several years ago on using caged pMHCs that were sensitive to light, which allowed measurements that described the speed at which signals propagate downstream.</p><p>b) The role of rebinding that allows ligands with short half-lives to signal, described by work from eight years ago by Van der Merwe and co-workers (Immunity) and Huseby and co-workers.</p><p>c) The role of co-receptors, amount of active Lck and diffusion in kinetic proof reading described by Stepanek et al., (2014).</p><p>d) You also ignore the data the Germain lab, and others, have presented showing that the same ab TCR signals differently in DP thymocytes vs. mature cells [in particular, allows meaningful propagation of signals for gene expression in DP with pMHC ligands incapable of electing the same response or biochemical changes in a mature T cell], meaning that intracellular events can control signal propagation separately from occupancy, half-life or mechanosensing.</p><p>5) The model for proofreading is a bit strange. Many people have made models that are far more realistic and incorporate feedback, including several papers from the Germain lab (1995; 1997; 2005; 2002), Chakraborty and Palmer, Chakraborty and Weiss, and the more theoretical efforts by Murugan, Huse, and Leibler. These papers should at least be cited and briefly discussed.</p><p>6) The estimate of 3 proofreading steps is undoubtedly wrong. The various steps do not have the same time scales and there are feedback loops. These effects make the model's fit to obtain n very difficult to interpret. This part needs to be deleted.</p><p>7) The comments about ZAP70 not being subject to kinetic proof reading in the Introduction need to be made with great care. Two points to note in this regard: a] There are data suggesting that partial phosphorylation of ITAMs is at least correlated if not connected to antagonism. b] in vivo, ZAP that is bound to TCR is not phosphorylated. Also note that in vivo the T cells are constantly stimulated by self ligands (see recent paper by Weiss, Chakraborty and co-workers in MCB).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Light-based tuning of ligand half-life supports kinetic proofreading model of T cell signaling&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Arup Chakraborty (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewing editor has asked that you address one point prior to a final decision. Please describe the steps in optimisation of the adhesion system and the specific requirement for the system chosen. Also, the implications of this adhesion system for kinetic proofreading – aka kinetic segregation model – should be discussed. For example, could the lack of kinetic proofreading in TCR proximal signaling be due to the presence of the adhesion system, which takes care of CD45 exclusion and makes signaling a matter of occupancy? If the light dependent kinetics were in control of CD45 segregation, would this step show a sensitivity to kinetics?</p><p>Recent relevant papers include:</p><p>Chang.et al., 2016.</p><p>Cai.et al., 2018.</p><p>The editor is not asking for additional experiments, just a transparent discussion of the results of the adhesion system, why anti-β2m, and if this is actually required for the signaling by the light inactivated CAR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study continues to struggle with proving &quot;kinetic proofreading&quot; (KP) due to the issue that the light dependent acceleration of dissociation of the LOV2 domain from Zdk1 doesn't impact the dark reversion rate (on rate) so the affinity is decreased by blue light. This is a similar limitation faced by people working with mutation-based systems for TCR or CARs. The mass action equation makes it very hard to change the half-life while maintaining a constant affinity and occupation. They partly compensate for this by doing the experiments at different densities of the LOV2 domain to have matched receptor occupancy at all light intensities. These densities are now specified, but there is a surprise there. This is partly successful as they do see a better correlation of DAG to kinetics rather than occupation, but it’s expected that this system fires fully at low occupancy, so this lack of linear relationship to occupation is expected. Thus, the proof of KP is not advanced that much in practice, but the potential is there. Additional innovations seem necessary to fully exploit it.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The authors have added a synthetic adhesion system, which was only mentioned in the methods and some legends. They use a biotinylated mAb to β2m, which should pull the cells very close to the substrate, perhaps less than 10 nm. I assume this will exclude CD45 at least partially if not quite robustly (the authors should check this) so all they need to do to trigger the CAR is pull them into these close contacts. This changes everything as they are not making the LOV2-Zdk1 interaction achieve KP through &quot;kinetic-segregation&quot;. This is thought by many to be a critical process that needs to be mediated by the ITAM bearing receptor to initiate signalling in many contexts. So, this adhesion system and its implications need to be described in the experimental design and schematics in figures as its likely critical to interpretation. Can the system work at all without this synthetic adhesion system? This may explain why they see no kinetic proofreading at the level of ZAP-70- as its recruitment is taken care of by the adhesion system and then bringing the CAR into the close contacts.</p><p>The other surprise is that the binding of the LOV2 domain displays significant positive cooperativity in binding to the SLB, suggesting that it oligomerises. How does this impact the measurements and interpretation?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Light-based tuning of ligand half-life supports kinetic proofreading model of T cell signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article and response to our request has been reviewed by a Reviewing Editor and Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Unfortunately, your response has not addressed the only issue that needs to be resolved. When the question about adhesion first came up, we asked about low affinity interaction in the off state that might support residual adhesion. You noted that this was not a relevant question because the adhesion system was added to make the system independent of the CAR interactions with the ligand to keep the cells in place over many cycles. Now you say the adhesion system is not needed and in fact you did not use it for the studies looking at ZAP-70's role in kinetic proofreading. Given this, unfortunately, we need to ask again if this indicates that there is a low affinity interaction in the 100% &quot;off&quot; state that could mediate some residual adhesion, but without signaling. If the cells remain attached in the presence of the most intense blue light that would completely turn off the interaction, then it seems there would be support for the presence of such an interaction. Can you acknowledge this, or do you have another explanation for the system working with or without the parallel adhesion system?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42498.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this system the Lov2 domain binds Zdk1 with a low nM Kd in the dark and a low µM Kd in with intense blue light.

The experiments and literature references you shared helped to make our paper stronger and clearer. We have outlined the most significant changes to the paper below and provided a detailed point-by-point response separately.</p><p>1) The reviewers wanted us to focus more explicitly on our use of a CAR, both in the setup and interpretation of our results. During revision, we made modifications throughout the manuscript to emphasize our use of a CAR more directly. We included comparisons to historic insights from chimeric antigen receptors and the increased medical relevance of understanding their signaling mechanisms. In interpreting our results, we explicitly delineate what conclusions apply to CAR signaling and which ones could be more general features of T cell signaling.</p><p>2) Experimentally, the reviewers wanted a more detailed description of the performance of our new system, especially in terms of absolute numbers of molecules. Happily, we were able to address all of their points. Absolute quantification of the levels of cell-surface CARs (62-238 x10<sup>3</sup> molecules/cell) and LOV2 densities (between 40-1200 molecules/um<sup>2</sup>) showed that our system performs in similar molecular ranges as previously published CAR-based approaches. High magnification images showed that both of our reporters localized as expected: ZAP70 co-localized with areas of CAR occupancy while DAG was found roughly diffusely throughout the cell footprint. To address concerns about inaccurate receptor occupancies as a result of unbound LOV2 molecules being excluded from the cell footprint, we reanalyzed our data under a worst-case scenario: that all unbound LOV2 molecules are excluded from the footprint. Under these conditions, we find our value of n increases from 2.7 to 7.0, indicating that our reported results are a conservative estimate.</p><p>3) The reviewers wanted more comparisons between our approach and results to other papers in the field. Towards this end, they suggested several excellent papers to include. We have incorporated these and other references in our revised submission. These helped to strengthen our paper and give the reader a broader lay of the field by enabling more points of comparison in both the setup of our approach and discussion of the results. We appreciate that they took the time share specific, constructive feedback, which allowed us to easily understand and directly address their concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Abstract and Introduction should be reshaped to reflect more of the background of CARs and T cell ligand discrimination and what a simplified signaling model with light based kinetic control could teach us.</p></disp-quote><p>In motivating our experimental approach, we have more heavily emphasized the advantages of a synthetic, CAR-based input. The simple, modular design of CARs facilitates easier engineering with our optogenetic approach and allows us to bypass many of the mechanisms the endogenous TCR might use to discriminate ligands. The fact that we observe kinetic proofreading with the more minimal CAR places constraints on the possible receptor mechanisms that contribute to sensing the duration of ligand binding. By directly controlling ligand binding half-life with a simple receptor, paired with live cell readout at different levels of the pathway, we are able to better isolate and study the extent to which the proximal signaling pathway aids in the kinetic discrimination of ligands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Many aspects of the system are poorly described- at this point in the technologies they are working with they should provide:</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a more thorough quantitative evaluation of our system would be helpful for readers to interpret our results and would also aid in replication of our work by others.

We also measured TCR levels on wt Jurkats for comparison. We find that there are between 62-238 x10<sup>3</sup> CAR molecules on the surface of our cells lines, compared to 273-547 x10<sup>3</sup> TCR molecules on wt Jurkats. The quantification and controls are detailed in Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The density of the Lov2 domain in the SLB in molecules/µm2 across the range that they are using. This could be done by line scanning FCS (dilute fluorescent version with non-fluorescent version if density is too high.) See PMID: 19254560.</p></disp-quote><p>In lieu of a line scanning FCS, we used single molecule TIRF microscopy to measure the absolute density of LOV2 on the bilayer. Fluorescent LOV2 was diluted into non-fluorescent LOV2 and added to the bilayer at saturating concentrations. By counting the single molecules, we calculated the total LOV2 binding capacity of the bilayer at saturation. We then measured what fraction of saturation our experimental conditions achieved and used this value to calculate the absolute concentration of LOV2 on the bilayers in our experiments.</p><p>We find that over the range of LOV2 concentrations we used, there are between 40 and 1200 molecules/um<sup>2</sup>. This is in a similar range to what others have reported with a CAR on planar lipid bilayers (between 0.1-800 molecules/um<sup>2</sup>; Taylor et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The estimate of occupancy will be inaccurate if they don't include a control for exclusion of non-binding Luv2 mutant or similar sized protein in the bilayer with a difference fluorophore.

Both the sites of receptor occupancy and reporter activity are contained within the IRM footprint. The CAR does appear to form larger domains when bound to LOV2. However, we cannot rule out that single CAR molecules are also occupied and signal, as background free LOV2 prevents single molecule imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A number of relevant papers need to be cited that are pertinent, and the present results related to these studies.

Below, we briefly describe how we discussed each of the suggested works and provide their location in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) The work from the Davis lab from several years ago on using caged pMHCs that were sensitive to light, which allowed measurements that described the speed at which signals propagate downstream.</p></disp-quote><p>The speed of onset to DAG production in our system is comparable to the ~8 second “offset time” described in this work. While we both use optical methods of stimulation, we cannot directly measure such an “offset time” because blue-light acutely terminates signaling in our system. Once blue light is removed, LOV2 goes through a slow reversion to an active state with a half-life of ~30 seconds. That DAG levels reach their maximum on this timescale suggests that once a CAR is bound, DAG can be produced within seconds. (Subsection “LOV2 binding induces cell signaling”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The role of rebinding that allows ligands with short half-lives to signal, described by work from eight years ago by Van der Merwe and co-workers (Immunity) and Huseby and co-workers.</p></disp-quote><p>This work is important because it shows that sufficiently fast on-rates can effectively occupy receptors longer than their binding half-life. Not only does this highlight the importance that other binding kinetics can play in ligand discrimination, it also allows us to point out that the 4-7 second transition between stimulatory and non-stimulatory half-lives we observe may in fact be an underestimate. The immobilization time the CAR experiences may be longer if LOV2 rebinding is sufficiently fast. (Subsection “LOV2 binding induces cell signaling”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The role of co-receptors, amount of active Lck and diffusion in kinetic proof reading described by Stepanek et al., (2014).</p></disp-quote><p>This work made a great discussion point to contrast our results with, given that we don’t observe kinetic proofreading effects at the level of ZAP70 recruitment. We used it to remind readers that our system does not engage co-receptors and so may be blind to additional kinetic proofreading steps in the endogenous TCR. (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) You also ignore the data the Germain lab, and others, have presented showing that the same ab TCR signals differently in DP thymocytes vs. mature cells [in particular, allows meaningful propagation of signals for gene expression in DP with pMHC ligands incapable of electing the same response or biochemical changes in a mature T cell], meaning that intracellular events can control signal propagation separately from occupancy, half-life or mechanosensing.</p></disp-quote><p>Since our system specifically manipulates ligand binding half-life, we tended to focus our attention on how binding half-life affects T cell activation. This work reminded us to emphasize that the T cell response is not entirely dictated by a ligand’s properties, but also is sensitive to the internal state of the T cell. (Subsection “Quantifying the degree of kinetic proofreading”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The model for proofreading is a bit strange. Many people have made models that are far more realistic and incorporate feedback, including several papers from the Germain lab (1995; 1997; 2005; 2002), Chakraborty and Palmer, Chakraborty and Weiss, and the more theoretical efforts by Murugan, Huse, and Leibler. These papers should at least be cited and briefly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to use a simple model of kinetic proofreading to reduce the number of free parameters and provide a conservative estimate of the degree of proofreading. However, as noted, the trade-off is that the model does not have direct analogy to the numerous biochemical steps that others have shown to be important in ligand discrimination. Thus, our model differs from the data in some important ways, most notably that our data shows cells are less sensitive to receptor occupancy than the model predicts. We now explicitly discuss these limitations of our model and how it could be improved by incorporating aspects of previously published models. (Subsection “Quantifying the degree of kinetic proofreading”) and elsewhere throughout the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The estimate of 3 proofreading steps is undoubtedly wrong. The various steps do not have the same time scales and there are feedback loops. These effects make the model's fit to obtain n very difficult to interpret. This part needs to be deleted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that 3 proofreading steps is likely an oversimplification and may be confusing to some readers. The corresponding section has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The comments about ZAP70 not being subject to kinetic proof reading in the Introduction need to be made with great care. Two points to note in this regard: a] There are data suggesting that partial phosphorylation of ITAMs is at least correlated if not connected to antagonism. b] in vivo, ZAP that is bound to TCR is not phosphorylated. Also note that in vivo the T cells are constantly stimulated by self ligands (see recent paper by Weiss, Chakraborty and co-workers in MCB).</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the reviewer is raising the important point that equivalent amounts of ZAP70 recruitment do not necessarily mean equivalent amounts of receptor phosphorylation or ZAP70 activation. We are more careful in the current manuscript to restrict our claims to our direct experimental measurements—kinetic proofreading is not observed at the level of ZAP70 recruitment but is observed at the level of DAG accumulation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewing editor has asked that you address one point prior to a final decision. Please describe the steps in optimisation of the adhesion system and the specific requirement for the system chosen. Also, the implications of this adhesion system for kinetic proofreading – aka kinetic segregation model – should be discussed. For example, could the lack of kinetic proofreading in TCR proximal signaling be due to the presence of the adhesion system, which takes care of CD45 exclusion and makes signaling a matter of occupancy? If the light dependent kinetics were in control of CD45 segregation, would this step show a sensitivity to kinetics?</p><p>Recent relevant papers include:</p><p>Chang et al., 2016.</p><p>Cai et al., 2018.</p><p>The editor is not asking for additional experiments, just a transparent discussion of the results of the adhesion system, why anti-β2m, and if this is actually required for the signaling by the light inactivated CAR.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The study continues to struggle with proving &quot;kinetic proofreading&quot; (KP) due to the issue that the light dependent acceleration of dissociation of the LOV2 domain from Zdk1 doesn't impact the dark reversion rate (on rate) so the affinity is decreased by blue light. This is a similar limitation faced by people working with mutation-based systems for TCR or CARs. The mass action equation makes it very hard to change the half-life while maintaining a constant affinity and occupation. They partly compensate for this by doing the experiments at different densities of the LOV2 domain to have matched receptor occupancy at all light intensities. These densities are now specified, but there is a surprise there. This is partly successful as they do see a better correlation of DAG to kinetics rather than occupation, but it’s expected that this system fires fully at low occupancy, so this lack of linear relationship to occupation is expected. Thus, the proof of KP is not advanced that much in practice, but the potential is there. Additional innovations seem necessary to fully exploit it.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The authors have added a synthetic adhesion system, which was only mentioned in the methods and some legends. They use a biotinylated mAb to β2m, which should pull the cells very close to the substrate, perhaps less than 10 nm. I assume this will exclude CD45 at least partially if not quite robustly (the authors should check this) so all they need to do to trigger the CAR is pull them into these close contacts. This changes everything as they are not making the LOV2-Zdk1 interaction achieve KP through &quot;kinetic-segregation&quot;. This is thought by many to be a critical process that needs to be mediated by the ITAM bearing receptor to initiate signalling in many contexts. So, this adhesion system and its implications need to be described in the experimental design and schematics in figures as its likely critical to interpretation. Can the system work at all without this synthetic adhesion system? This may explain why they see no kinetic proofreading at the level of ZAP-70- as its recruitment is taken care of by the adhesion system and then bringing the CAR into the close contacts.</p><p>The other surprise is that the binding of the LOV2 domain displays significant positive cooperativity in binding to the SLB, suggesting that it oligomerises. How does this impact the measurements and interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>We initially included the passive adhesion system to ensure that a decrease in the TIRF signal could not be due to the cells detaching from the bilayer. Ultimately, this system is dispensable, as experiments included in the supplement (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) without the adhesion system show an equivalent degree of kinetic proofreading (<italic>n</italic> in our model) at the level of DAG. Thus, the passive adhesion system was not used for the ZAP70 data and could not impact those results. However, we point out that the kinetic segregation of CD45 may impact kinetic proofreading differently in the native TCR-pMHC context, where the size of the extodomains may differ from our CAR-LOV2 pair. Revisions to reflect these changes in the Discussion section. Additionally, we added two more references of recent papers that highlight kinetic proofreading outside of the TCR as examples of areas where our approach may have future utility.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Light-based tuning of ligand half-life supports kinetic proofreading model of T cell signaling&quot; for consideration by eLife. Your revised article and response to our request has been reviewed by a Reviewing Editor and Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Unfortunately, your response has not addressed the only issue that needs to be resolved. When the question about adhesion first came up, we asked about low affinity interaction in the off state that might support residual adhesion. You noted that this was not a relevant question because the adhesion system was added to make the system independent of the CAR interactions with the ligand to keep the cells in place over many cycles. Now you say the adhesion system is not needed and in fact you did not use it for the studies looking at ZAP-70's role in kinetic proofreading. Given this, unfortunately, we need to ask again if this indicates that there is a low affinity interaction in the 100% &quot;off&quot; state that could mediate some residual adhesion, but without signaling. If the cells remain attached in the presence of the most intense blue light that would completely turn off the interaction, then it seems there would be support for the presence of such an interaction. Can you acknowledge this, or do you have another explanation for the system working with or without the parallel adhesion system?</p></disp-quote><p>For the ZAP70 experiments where passive adhesion was not used, we agree with the reviewer that the residual adhesion could be due to many weak interactions with LOV2 in the low-affinity state. An alternative possibility is that because saturating amounts of blue light (as assayed from our in vitroLOV2-Zdk binding experiments) were not needed to maximally suppress cell signaling, cells were never exposed to saturating amounts of blue light, meaning a small fraction of LOV2 likely still existed in the high-affinity conformation. This small population of LOV2 may also account for the residual adhesion we observed. Both of these possibilities are now discussed to provide a more complete technical description of the new system.</p></body></sub-article></article>
