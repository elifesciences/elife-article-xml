To test this idea in a reductionist setting, in which genes and environment are controlled, we investigated differences in neuroanatomy and structural covariance by ex vivo structural magnetic resonance imaging in mice whose behavioral activity was continuously tracked for 3 months in a large, enriched environment. We confirmed that environmental enrichment increases mouse hippocampal volumes. Stratifying the enriched group according to individual longitudinal behavioral trajectories, however, revealed striking differences in mouse brain structural covariance in continuously highly active mice compared to those whose trajectories showed signs of habituating activity. Network-based statistics identified distinct subnetworks of murine structural covariance underlying these differences in behavioral activity. Together, these results reveal that differentiated behavioral trajectories of mice in an enriched environment are associated with differences in brain connectivity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>An individual's experiences and behavior shape their brain, thereby building and refining a network of connections between neurons. This unique network may affect an individual's brain resilience in the face of aging, injury or disease. Understanding how individual experiences shape brain connections could help scientists develop personalized treatments. It may also have important implications for preventing brain disease.</p><p>Studying mice can provide a window into some of these brain processes. By using inbred mice, scientists can rule out the role of genetics in brain differences. Scientists can also control the animalsâ environments and track the activity of individuals to study their behavior.</p><p>Bogado Lopes et al. show that more active mice living in enriched environments have signs of more complex networks of brain connections. In the experiments, the researchers placed genetically identical mice in either standard laboratory mouse housing or in enriched environments. Mice in the enriched housing had access to multi-level enclosures connected with tubes and supplied with a rotating array of toys. A tiny tracking device was inserted under the skin of the mice to follow their movements. Finally, all mice underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging to assess their brain anatomy and connections. This revealed that the most active and adventurous mice in the enriched enclosures had the most robust signs of increased brain connectivity. However, mice with declining activity levels in the enriched enclosures had fewer brain connections. Brain connection patterns in these creatures of habit were nearly identical to the ones in mice housed in small unenriched enclosures.</p><p>The results show that how individual mice respond to their environments affects their brain structure. More active behavior patterns lead to more robust networks of brain connections. Larger studies in mice could provide more about lifestyle-dependent brain resilience. It may also help scientists to develop individualized approaches to optimizing brain health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>individuality</kwd><kwd>structural covariance</kwd><kwd>behavioral tracking</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>adult neurogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001656</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Basic Funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Senko</surname><given-names>Anna N</given-names></name><name><surname>Kempermann</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002957</institution-id><institution>Medizinische FakultÃ¤t Carl Gustav Carus, Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dresden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Basic Funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Senko</surname><given-names>Anna N</given-names></name><name><surname>Kempermann</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>88881.129646/2016-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bogado Lopes</surname><given-names>Jadna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008662</institution-id><institution>Joachim Herz Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bogado Lopes</surname><given-names>Jadna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Investigator Research Grant MR/N025377/1 (AV)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vernon</surname><given-names>Anthony C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>TransCampus</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TransCampus Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vernon</surname><given-names>Anthony C</given-names></name><name><surname>Kempermann</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EH 367/7-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrlich</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Centre Grant MR/N026063/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vernon</surname><given-names>Anthony C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When genes and environment are controlled, mice still develop stable differences in behavior, which are associated with large-scale differences in brain structure and connectivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ânon-shared environmentâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plomin and Daniels, 2011</xref>), the elusive component of the non-genetic factor in phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morgante et al., 2015</xref>), contributes to interindividual differences and neurobiological individuality.

The structural connectome, which can be estimated based on the correlation between regional brain volumes (across subjects) or white matter links between specific brain regions (within subjects) partially recapitulates known functional networks and represents an individual âfingerprintâ in humans and non-human animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melozzi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pagani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yee et al., 2018</xref>). Open questions about the exact nature of the connectome and how it is represented in covariance patterns as assessed by imaging studies abound, especially with respect to the crucial issue of causes and consequences.</p><p>We have reported that environmental enrichment (ENR) increases variability in activity-related behaviors (roaming entropy, RE), or total object exploration in a novel object recognition task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">KÃ¶rholz et al., 2018</xref>). The ENR mice also showed greater variability in measures linked to brain plasticity, such as adult hippocampal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">KÃ¶rholz et al., 2018</xref>) accompanied by distinguishing epigenetic patterns in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zocher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zocher et al., 2020</xref>).

During 12 weeks of exposure to the ENR, mean values of RE as a measure of exploration and territorial coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freund et al., 2013</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zocher et al., 2020</xref>) were calculated per night and aggregated across four time blocks of 21 nights each. Increasing interindividual component of variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) confirmed the emergence of individual behavioral differences. Two distinguishable patterns were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>): mice with consistently high levels of RE and those with habituation and decreased RE values over time. Mice were stratified according to this criterion and grouped into âflatâ roamers (<italic>n</italic> = 15) or âdownâ roamers (<italic>n</italic> = 15) depending on the slope of the linear regression line through a set of four RE time blocks.

Mice that showed in-between slope values (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and those with positive slopes (<italic>n</italic> = 6) were excluded from the clustering to achieve a sharper distinction between the extremes and equally sized groups of 15 mice were formed.

Using atlas-based segmentation (ABS), statistically significant (5% false discovery rate [FDR]) group differences in absolute volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) were found for 12% (22/182) of mouse brain atlas regions of interest (ROIs) with effect sizes (SMD) ranging from +2.7 in CA1 oriens (CA1Or) to +1.15 in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

This analysis revealed that RE slope values correlated positively with clusters of local volume changes in the mediodorsal and parafascicular thalamic nuclei, the periaqueductal grey, medial geniculate nucleus, deep mesencephalic nuclei, gray and white matter layers of the superior colliculus, and the central nuclei of the inferior colliculus (FWE p &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

These provide non-invasive insights into the organization of the brain at the macroscale, going beyond the analysis of local changes within individual brain regions as revealed by univariate analysis methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). Within this framework, âstructural covarianceâ, permits the study of variation in the organization of brain regional structures within networks that might emerge across a population of individuals in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evans, 2013</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mueller et al., 2021</xref>). Applying structural covariance and NBS analysis to our individuality model, we observed patterns of structural covariance across the mouse brain that are highly distinct between STD- and ENR-housed mice, which may reflect synchronized plastic changes occurring across multiple brain regions over time. Remarkably, within the ENR group itself, the structural covariance matrix for the âdownâ roamers was similar to the matrix generated for standard-housed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>). The structural covariance matrix for those mice with a âflatâ RE suggests a much higher degree of inter-regional correlation in comparison to âdownâ or STD mice, findings confirmed and extended by the NBS analysis. Variation in mouse brain structural covariance in the ENR group suggests that individual behavioral trajectories (as here first approximated by RE, but in reality encompassing the full scope and complexity of behaviors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freund et al., 2015</xref>) are associated with a certain degree of individualization of brain structural networks at the macroscale and that this largely explains differences observed between standard and ENR mice per se.</p><p>The two groups of flat vs. down roamers were formed in order to be able to calculate structural covariance matrices at the ends of the behavioral spectrum within the ENR group. We used a within-group effect to point to the existence of interindividual differences, but by necessity, structural covariance has to be calculated in groups and cannot be calculated for individuals with the available structural MR images from this dataset. We excluded two animals with borderline slopes at the boundary between the groups and as a measure of stringency, removed mice with a clearly positive slope from the âflatâ group. Chi-square statistics support the qualitative impression that the visualization conveys: the patterns differ strongly.</p><p>Our data suggest that the behaviors reflected in RE are supported by widely distributed brain circuitry, in particular the hippocampal formation, cingulate and temporal cortices, white matter tracts and olfactory areas. Consistent with this view, neuroanatomical and/or structural covariance changes within these mouse brain circuits have been previously shown to be associated with spatial memory, navigation and cognitive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lerch et al., 2011</xref>), social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>), and susceptibility or resilience to stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anacker et al., 2016</xref>), all domains of mouse behavior that may contribute to the individual estimate of RE.</p><p>Environmental enrichment has always been by and large a âblack boxâ paradigm and discussions about the relative contribution of the various factors that make up enrichment (e.g., group size, space, changing objects) have filled volumes, without reaching a unified theory. In the center of our own considerations are learning and social interaction as key components. While the deconstruction of enrichment is an important research avenue, a case can also be made for leaving the black box closed and appreciate enrichment for its ability to apply a complex combination of inanimate and social stimuli. For the present study we have to leave open, to which extent and how exposure to the enriched conditions is causal for the observed behavioral trajectories and the associated changes in structural covariance. Nevertheless, the associations are strongly indicative of at least shared (indirect) causality.</p><p>The mice in our study are inbred, thus the genetic background and the ânominalâ environment are identical for all mice in the ENR group. Hence, phenotypic variation at the level of brain and behavior must arise from the non-shared component of the environmental factors (ânon-shared environmentâ). Collectively, our data support a view that a continuum exists between RE and experience-dependent plasticity in brain structure (as measured by ex vivo sMRI). We speculate that exposure to ENR may build on initial variance in mouse brain volumes observable from early in postnatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>) and amplifies these differences by providing the opportunity for the development of individual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freund et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kempermann, 2019</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=5954115,9757413,6380334,81302&amp;pre=&amp;pre=&amp;pre=&amp;pre=&amp;suf=&amp;suf=&amp;suf=&amp;suf=&amp;sa=0,0,0,0&amp;dbf=0&amp;dbf=0&amp;dbf=0&amp;dbf=0">KÃ¶rholz et al., 2018;</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zocher et al., 2020</xref>).

With these, however, we intended to maximize the <italic>N</italic> number within each subgroup to increase power, use equally sized groups, and base the definition of the two group on a simple, rational, and plausible parameter (i.e., slope of the behavioral trajectory). The observed differences in covariance are large and occur in a group of mice, which are genetically homogenous and share the same environment. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that greater activity results in greater brain plasticity and, by consequence, a richer connectome. While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> offers first insight into which connections are involved, we here primarily emphasize the fact that the number of connections increases with greater activity. Actual effect sizes, specific network properties, and the role of specific connections will have to be examined in larger follow-up studies based on more and different behavioral measures and stringently objective stratification strategies. As first step into this direction, we however present the continuous correlation between RE slopes and gray matter volumes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>Because âflatâ roamers show stronger structural brain connectivity (based on structural covariance in MRI), it is tempting to speculate that keeping a stable level of territorial coverage has a positive effect on brain networks. In fact, our RE measure has already been used in human studies, providing evidence that greater levels of RE (assessed with a smartphone app) are associated with a greater positive affect and greater hippocampalâstriatal functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heller et al., 2020</xref>).

We hypothesize learning and social factors to make important contributions to the individuality effect. It is, however, an unresolved question, to which extent these enrichment factors are necessary for behavioral and structural individualization to emerge.</p><p>Even now, however, our study demonstrates how whole mouse brain structures are distinctively affected by the non-shared component of environmental enrichment and can be linked to stable behavioral trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and housing conditions</title><p>Female C57BL/6JRj mice from as many litters as possible were purchased at 4 weeks of age from Janvier Labs and were randomly divided into standard (STD) (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and enriched (ENR) (<italic>n</italic> = 38) housing conditions.

The behavioral phenotypes from RE were mean centered and scaled to unity variance. We used time blocks as fixed effect and an interaction between time block and individual identifier as random effect. With a random effect, it was possible to estimate interindividual variances for each time block, while the residual variances were estimated separately. To fit the model, we applied Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation with Gibbs sampling (MCMCglmm R package). A Gaussian error distribution was assumed with weakly informative default priors for the fixed effect (time blocks). An inverse Wishart distribution prior was selected for residual variances.

Briefly, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (Narcoren 16 g/100 ml; 5 Î¼l/g; i.p.) and intracardially perfused with 30 ml of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), containing 10 U/ml heparin, followed by 30 ml of 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA). Post-perfusion, the mouse was decapitated, and the skin, ears, and lower jaw removed, and the brain left within the cranium. This is done to minimize deformations due to dissection.

Fixed brain samples were placed securely, four at a time, in a custom-made MR-compatible holder and immersed in proton-free susceptibility matching fluid (Fomblin; Solvay, UK). Samples were scanned in a random order, with the operator blinded to treatment group by numerical coding of samples. Scanning was interspersed with phantoms to ensure consistent operation of the scanner. T2-weighted images were acquired using a 3D fast spin-echo (FSE) sequence with the following parameters: effective echo time (TE) 30 ms, repetition time (TR) 3000 ms, ï¬eld of view 25 Ã 25 Ã 20 mm and acquisition matrix 250 Ã 250 Ã 200 yielding isotropic voxels of 100 Âµm<sup>3</sup>, scan time = 5 hr and 44 min. This MRI resolution (100 Âµm<sup>3</sup>) is at the lower end for ex vivo anatomy as compared to other studies, which employ longer acquisition times with specific pulse sequences and the use of contrast enhancement, for example, the inclusion of gadolinium in the perfusion and rehydration steps to reach resolutions as low as 30â40 Âµm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruce et al., 2021</xref>).

After careful checking of atlas label alignment to each individual subjectâs MR images, we automatically extracted volumes for the 182 ROIs comprising the DSURQE atlas, merging the left and right labels for each ROI. Total brain volume was calculated from the summation of the individual atlas ROI volumes. Both absolute volumes (mm<sup>3</sup>) and relative volumes were compared to assess brain scaling. Relative volumes were calculated as a percentage of total brain volume that is ([(brain region volume)/(whole-brain volume) Ã 100]). Whilst others and we have used this approach there are caveats. Specifically, whilst some brain regions scale linearly to total brain volume, such as the hippocampus, other regions, such as the cerebellum, may not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mankiw et al., 2017</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Individual behavioral trajectories shape whole-brain connectivity in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jason Lerch as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yohan Yee (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The division of their cohort into two groups raised concerns by all three reviewers. The authors need to address these concerns by clearly showing the existence of two distinct groups, exploring sensitivity to different cutoffs, better justifying why some mice were excluded entirely, and if an intermediate group of mice are still excluded describing their covariance patterns.</p><p>2) The manuscript would also benefit from directly using their key behaviour metric, roaming entropy (RE), by using RE-slopes as continuous variables (in addition to clustering based on RE-slopes).</p><p>3) The authors need to slightly expand their statistical analyses by running permutation tests over the chi-squared tests, exploring a range of thresholds for network based statistics, and assessing whether alternate means of removing overall brain volume change their results.</p><p>4) The authors need to partially expand their introduction and discussion by being clearer that structural covariance, as used here, is a group measure and not easily applicable to an individual, being more nuanced in associating structural covariance with connectivity, and discussing what aspects of their environment (social vs space) have impacts on structural covariance.</p><p>Also, a note of clarification based on discussions with reviewer #2: &quot;On acquiring more data to test whether their elaborate enrichment setup is _required_ for individuality, I don't think that's necessary, since that's not specifically the aim of this study. I should have been clearer about my comment â I meant that more as a Gedanken experiment to illustrate what would be needed to specifically tie their enrichment setup to the increasing variability in roaming entropy.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Most of my confusion and possibly critique relates to the division of mice into two groups. Here the authors need to show the data that supports this division in a more convincing fashion, clear up how the automated clustering supports these division, illustrate how the intermediate group behaves on their measures, and possibly show sensitivity analyses as to how sensitive the groupings are to differences in ways of subdividing the cohort. In addition to clearing up the clustering it would be good to show slopes as a distribution/histogram to be convince the reader that it is indeed a bimodal distribution.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I genuinely enjoyed reading this paper-it was well written, clear on what was done, concise, and on a relevant and interesting topic.</p><p>A common question that came up throughout my reading of the manuscript was on choices made in grouping data: why partition mice into flat and down roamers (while excluding a few with slopes above and in between), as opposed to directly working with the slope. For example, in looking at structural covariance differences, a single analysis (on the entire group of mice) examining covariance differences due to RE-slope could be achieved through the inclusion of RE-slope interaction terms in linear models. Such an approach would benefit from a larger sample size and increased power. Unless the distribution of RE-slopes is bimodal, the justification for stratification is unclear. Similarly, why average the RE over three weeks? Given the temporal resolution of the RFID data and that RE is computed for each night, partitioning into four long periods seems unnecessary.</p><p>Clarity on the role of the enriched environment would be helpful. While it is reasonable to believe that individuality emerges from exposure to an enriched environment, it is unclear from this study if this enrichment is <italic>required</italic>. An explicit comparison of enriched mice with those raised in standard housing would rule out intrinsic age-associated divergence of roaming entropy. In other words, if four cohorts of standard-housed mice were exposed to the enriched environment to track roaming but only during each of the four time periods, would the emergence of individuality not be as pronounced?</p><p>Some comments on specific parts of the study and manuscript:</p><p>1) Line 100: &quot;Mice that showed in-between slope values (n = 10) were excluded from the clustering&quot; is inconsistent with the subject numbers listed on lines 88 (total n=38) and 96-97 (15 flat roamers, 15 down roamers). Also, this conflicts with the statement on lines 393-394 (&quot;Excluded from the subgroup analysis are 2 mice with in-between slope values and 6 mice with higher than 0.006 slope values&quot;).</p><p>2) Line 165: do you mean Figure 2B (as opposed to 3B)?</p><p>3) Line 175: I would suggest averaging over cortical and subcortical regions separately, given their distinctive function, development, gene expression, connectivity, and covariance patterns.</p><p>4) Line 282: missing closing parenthesis.</p><p>5) There are various places in the manuscript where structural covariance is used as a proxy to traditional measures of connectivity. While structural covariance has been found to be statistically associated structural and functional connectivity, the idea that structural covariance is driven by synchronized plasticity between structurally connected regions has yet to be confirmed. Therefore, I would caution against making this connection (no pun intended) between covariance and connectivity. A mention of this (and other study limitations) in the discussion might be helpful.</p><p>6) Lines 550-551: Could you double check the definition of the p-value? Unless NBS (which I am admittedly not an expert on) defines the p-value differently, the p-value is a probability of observing data given the null, as opposed to a probability of an effect.</p><p>7) Reasons for only including female mice should be explicitly listed â I assume male mice were excluded to avoid aggression/mating?</p><p>8) Figure 3: it would be helpful to annotate the rows and columns of these matrices with names of coarse structures.</p><p>Potential ideas to further improve the study include:</p><p>1) Are anatomical changes driven by neurogenesis? I.e., does the size of the dentate gyrus correlate with DCX?</p><p>2) Apart from access to a larger and richer space, the ENR group differs from STD in the number of mice and therefore potential social interactions. I'd be curious to know whether these results can be separated into social vs spatial exploration effects. For example, based on RFID data, do flat roamers tend to spend time with other mice more, while down roamers are more isolated? If it is possible to extract from the RFID data, I think an analysis that includes measures of social interactions would make this a far stronger study.</p><p>3) Similar to the above comment, can the effect of activity be teased out from the RFID data? Exercise has been shown to correlate with brain structural differences; I wonder if some of the neuroanatomical variation seen comes about from mice just moving around more.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>â The interpretation of structural covariance is oversimplified especially in introduction. Specifically, REF 19 is being mischaracterized â this paper did suggest some convergence but also significance divergence with white matter connectivity. In the discussion the authors invoke the idea that structural covariance &quot;may reflect synchronized plastic changes occurring across multiple brain regions over time&quot;. This idea should be included in the motivation for the investigation as well.</p><p>â Given references to prior related work by the authors and others, it is not currently clear what are the exact analyses that have not previously been done which are unique to this paper. The paper would benefit from a clear discussion paragraph stating what this study does that has not been done previously and what is a replication (differentiating replication from restatement of results already reported in the same mice).</p><p>â The statement on p.7 that &quot;The majority of these ROIs were conserved as significant group differences when considering relative volumes (% of whole brain), suggesting normal scaling&quot; should be clarified. Do the authors mean normal scaling versus nonlinear scaling cf https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar2578? Note that dividing by total brain size is not really an effective way to &quot;control&quot; for the effect of total brain size (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922006012)</p><p>â The chi-square tests for equality of two correlation matrices would be better if replicated with permutation testing as REF 21 seems to indicate these tests are anti-conservative in small samples.</p><p>â NBS uses permutation testing which is good. However it is more rigorous to consider the t-statistic over a range of thresholds not just a single threshold. I'd suggest 2.5-3.5 in 0.1 intervals as a sensitivity analysis. Also it's not clear why t=2.4 is mentioned in results but t=3.1 in mentioned in the methods.</p><p>â This is out of my area of expertise but is it possible that genetic differences including de novo mutations could underlie some inter-individual differences between inbred mice?</p><p>â I am having trouble understanding the rationale for the precise cut off values between groups. On p.15 manuscript says &quot;Excluded from the subgroup analysis are 2 mice with in-between slope values and 6 mice with higher than 0.006 slope values.&quot; while on p.10 it says &quot;Mice that showed in-between slope values (n = 10) were excluded from the clustering to achieve a sharper distinction. Presumably, I am not understanding something but it should be more clear.</p><p>â In addition, the rationale for excluding &quot;up roamers&quot; with higher slope values is not clear. These mice should be included in the flat group in a sensitivity analysis to assess robustness of findings.</p><p>â Currently it is not clear to what extent findings depend on the specific thresholds chosen to differentiate flat vs down roamers. It would be an improvement to conduct a sensitivity analysis in order to confirm the robustness of the findings to methodological variability to methodological choices which may seem arbitrary to a reader.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80379.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The division of their cohort into two groups raised concerns by all three reviewers.

In order to describe differences in structural covariance patterns however, groups have to be formed within this continuum; for individual mice no covariance exists. For âindividualisedâ matrices one would need to acquire multiple different sequences and use a morphometric similarity mapping approach (Seidlitz et al., Neuron, 2018), which was not (yet) done here. We describe that mice that are at the upper end of the RE activity spectrum show a greater degree of â<italic>correlatedness</italic>â of gray matter volume changes than those at the lower end. This difference in covariance patterns is visualized in the correlation matrices of Figure 3. By necessity the borders of these extreme groups are arbitrary. If the N in each group is too small, the matrix is less robust than with greater N. Splitting the entire group of animals in the Individuality cage in two, comparing the lower and the upper half yields essentially the same result. Omitting the mice with upward slopes and two intermediates increases the sharpness of the distinction in the visualization.</p><p>Note that we take the patterns as patterns only and do not interpret individual pairs of correlating areas. To the extent such approach was reasonable in the context of the given study, this was achieved with the graph theory analysis presented in Figure 4. The conclusion from Figure 3, in contrast is, that the structural covariance patterns are different between mice at the upper and the lower end of the scope of RE trajectories within the same environment. We point to the variance in structural covariance that is induced by enrichment.</p><p>âThe two groups of flat vs. down roamers were formed in order to be able to calculate structural covariance matrices at the ends of the behavioral spectrum within the ENR group. We used a within-group group-effect to point to the existence of inter-individual differences, but by necessity, structural covariance has to be calculated in groups and cannot be calculated for individuals with the available structural MR images from this dataset. We excluded two animals with borderline slopes at the boundary between the groups and as a measure of stringency, removed mice with a clearly positive slope from the âflatâ group. Chi Square statistics support the qualitative impression that the visualization conveys: the patterns differ strongly.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript would also benefit from directly using their key behaviour metric, roaming entropy (RE), by using RE-slopes as continuous variables (in addition to clustering based on RE-slopes).</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done and is now presented as new Figure 2B which clearly shows positive correlations that survive multiple comparisons correction (FWE p&lt;0.05) between RE slope and local volume changes. We agree that this is a helpful additional piece of information. We have retained the correlation between the RE slope and the down / flat sub-groups as a new supplementary figure, noting that this largely recapitulates the pattern seen in the revised Figure 2B across all mice, but with no statistically significant changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to slightly expand their statistical analyses by running permutation tests over the chi-squared tests, exploring a range of thresholds for network based statistics, and assessing whether alternate means of removing overall brain volume change their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present the NBS results for both contrasts across a range of common t-thresholds (see added panels C and D to Figure 4). The clustersâ significance was validated by permutation testing. In line with the main results (shown at our a priori threshold of t=2.4 (ca. p=0.008, i.e. p&lt;0.01)) the figure shows that similar components are present at more lenient thresholds (as expected those components are somewhat larger) and also more conservative thresholds (components grow smaller, as expected). Overall these data speak to the robustness of the NBS results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors need to partially expand their introduction and discussion by being clearer that structural covariance, as used here, is a group measure and not easily applicable to an individual, being more nuanced in associating structural covariance with connectivity, and discussing what aspects of their environment (social vs space) have impacts on structural covariance.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, as these are critically important points that no reader should miss. We have carefully added clarifications throughout the manuscript.</p><p>âOpen questions about the exact nature of the connectome and how it is represented in covariance patterns as assessed by imaging studies abound, especially with respect to the crucial issue of causes and consequences.â</p><p>âEnvironmental enrichment has always been by and large a âblack boxâ paradigm and discussions about the relative contribution of the various factors that make up enrichment (e.g. group size, space, changing objects have filled volumes), without reaching a unified theory. In the center of our own considerations are learning and social interaction as key components. While the deconstruction of enrichment is an important research avenue, a case can also be made for leaving the black box closed and appreciate enrichment for its ability to apply a complex combination of inanimate and social stimuli. For the present study we have to leave open, to which extent and how exposure to the enriched conditions is causal for the observed behavioral trajectories and the associated changes in structural covariance. Nevertheless, the associations are strongly indicative of at least shared (indirect) causality.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, a note of clarification based on discussions with reviewer #2: &quot;On acquiring more data to test whether their elaborate enrichment setup is _required_ for individuality, I don't think that's necessary, since that's not specifically the aim of this study.

But the point is very interesting and we have added a short statement in this direction to the end of the discussion. These are in fact thoughts that guide the future direction of our work (See quote in the previous response).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Most of my confusion and possibly critique relates to the division of mice into two groups.

The enrichment literature is full of potential explanations and speculation about the most active ingredients. In our current study we have left the black box closed, but believe that learning and social contexts are important drivers. It is absolutely correct, however, that stochastic effects and what the reviewer calls âintrinsic age-associated divergenceâ are important. The latter is a challenging idea, however: could such divergence indeed be genetically determined but become differentially apparent, despite the fact that all mice share the same genotype? We have added a short paragraph to the discussion to point to this interesting speculation.</p><p>âThe by now extensive literature on environmental enrichment covers different overarching mechanistic ideas, including the âlearning theoryâ, the âarousal theoryâ and the âdevelopmental theoryâ. As argued recently, all of these seem to be correct to a certain extent and contribute to a multi-factorial network of causes across scales (Kempermann 2019), RE captures only a small facet of this complexity but appears to be a remarkably strong factor. We hypothesize learning and social factors to make important contributions to the individuality effect. It is, however, an unresolved question, to which extent these enrichment factors are necessary for behavioral and structural individualization to emerge.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some comments on specific parts of the study and manuscript:</p><p>1) Line 100: &quot;Mice that showed in-between slope values (n = 10) were excluded from the clustering&quot; is inconsistent with the subject numbers listed on lines 88 (total n=38) and 96-97 (15 flat roamers, 15 down roamers).

Unless NBS (which I am admittedly not an expert on) defines the p-value differently, the p-value is a probability of observing data given the null, as opposed to a probability of an effect.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an embarrassing mistake that has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Reasons for only including female mice should be explicitly listed â I assume male mice were excluded to avoid aggression/mating?</p></disp-quote><p>This information was added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3: it would be helpful to annotate the rows and columns of these matrices with names of coarse structures.</p></disp-quote><p>As we do not want to imply conclusions about particular associations and the graphs got quite cluttered with the additional label we have refrained from doing so. We are comparing the gross patterns. In higher-resolution follow-ups that are powered to detect more differences we will provide the additional information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Potential ideas to further improve the study include:</p><p>1) Are anatomical changes driven by neurogenesis? I.e., does the size of the dentate gyrus correlate with DCX?</p></disp-quote><p>Our study was not powered to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Apart from access to a larger and richer space, the ENR group differs from STD in the number of mice and therefore potential social interactions. I'd be curious to know whether these results can be separated into social vs spatial exploration effects. For example, based on RFID data, do flat roamers tend to spend time with other mice more, while down roamers are more isolated? If it is possible to extract from the RFID data, I think an analysis that includes measures of social interactions would make this a far stronger study.</p></disp-quote><p>In principle yes, but not yet for the current study. The extraction of social information from the antenna data is an ongoing project and not trivial. We will need a higher-powered study and different readouts to optimally use this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Similar to the above comment, can the effect of activity be teased out from the RFID data? Exercise has been shown to correlate with brain structural differences; I wonder if some of the neuroanatomical variation seen comes about from mice just moving around more.</p></disp-quote><p>Raw antenna counts give a much lower correlation, even if corrected for unique antenna contents (that is to dismiss repeated signals from the same antenna). RE adds the component of territorial coverage, which seems to add to the contribution of âmere activityâ (at least as measured by unique antenna contacts). We are currently working on extracting more data, e.g. velocity, directionality, etc. to further qualify âactivityâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>â The interpretation of structural covariance is oversimplified especially in introduction. Specifically, REF 19 is being mischaracterized â this paper did suggest some convergence but also significance divergence with white matter connectivity. In the discussion the authors invoke the idea that structural covariance &quot;may reflect synchronized plastic changes occurring across multiple brain regions over time&quot;. This idea should be included in the motivation for the investigation as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Given references to prior related work by the authors and others, it is not currently clear what are the exact analyses that have not previously been done which are unique to this paper. The paper would benefit from a clear discussion paragraph stating what this study does that has not been done previously and what is a replication (differentiating replication from restatement of results already reported in the same mice).</p></disp-quote><p>The study uses the same general set-up as Zocher et al. 2019 and 2020, but is otherwise unique. No MRI was used in those studies. We have clarified, which of the other results are confirmative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The statement on p.7 that &quot;The majority of these ROIs were conserved as significant group differences when considering relative volumes (% of whole brain), suggesting normal scaling&quot; should be clarified. Do the authors mean normal scaling versus nonlinear scaling cf https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar2578? Note that dividing by total brain size is not really an effective way to &quot;control&quot; for the effect of total brain size (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922006012)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and we agree with the view that a significant proportion of the variance in the volume of many (but not all) brain structures is accounted for by overall differences in brain volume. Hence, using relative volumes will lower the standard deviations and may be more sensitive to subtle anatomical changes. In the context of the current study, we analyzed both absolute and regional volumes, the latter expressed as a percentage of the total brain volume. We note that the main statistically significant findings (5% FDR) regarding neuroanatomical differences between STD and ENR mice and the exploratory findings (p&lt;0.01 uncorrected) comparing âdownâ vs. âflatâ roamers were essentially unchanged, i.e. a very similar pattern of structures were identified. We therefore decided to only include absolute volumes in the current paper for the sake of simplicity. For ease of comparison, we include <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> to highlight the similarities in the results when comparing STD and ENR mice, using either atlas based segmentation or voxel-wise tensor based morphometry.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Neuroanatomical differences in absolute volumes between STD-ENR comparing absolute volumes for both atlas based segmentation (a) and voxel-wise tensor based morphometry (b), to the same analyses using relative volumes where inter-individual variance in mouse total brain volume is accounted for (c, d).</title><p>In panels (a) and (c), the highlighted regions shown pass statistical significance at a threshold of 5% FDR for multiple comparisons, with the colour bar indicating the effect size as standardized mean difference.

In both cases the great majority of effects are conserved with similar effect sizes, particularly for the hippocampus a mouse brain region known to show a high sensitivity to allometric effects.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80379-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The chi-square tests for equality of two correlation matrices would be better if replicated with permutation testing as REF 21 seems to indicate these tests are anti-conservative in small samples.</p><p>â NBS uses permutation testing which is good. However it is more rigorous to consider the t-statistic over a range of thresholds not just a single threshold. I'd suggest 2.5-3.5 in 0.1 intervals as a sensitivity analysis. Also it's not clear why t=2.4 is mentioned in results but t=3.1 in mentioned in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see comment above and the added panels in Figure 4.

Presumably, I am not understanding something but it should be more clear.</p></disp-quote><p>This confusing statement has been clarified. Please refer to our comments on that issue to referee #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â In addition, the rationale for excluding &quot;up roamers&quot; with higher slope values is not clear.
