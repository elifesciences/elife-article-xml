They impose structural constraints on the kinase domain holding it in a catalytically non-permissive state. The transition between inactive and active conformation is known to be largely regulated by the phosphorylation state of key tyrosines 416 and 527. Here, we identified that phosphorylation of tyrosine 90 reduces binding affinity of the SH3 domain to its interacting partners, opens the Src structure, and renders Src catalytically active. This is accompanied by an increased affinity to the plasma membrane, decreased membrane motility, and slower diffusion from focal adhesions. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 90 controlling SH3-medited intramolecular inhibitory interaction, analogical to tyrosine 527 regulating SH2-C-terminus bond, enables SH3 and SH2 domains to serve as cooperative but independent regulatory elements. This mechanism allows Src to adopt several distinct conformations of varying catalytic activities and interacting properties, enabling it to operate not as a simple switch but as a tunable regulator functioning as a signalling hub in a variety of cellular processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Src</kwd><kwd>SH3 domain</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>cell transformation</kwd><kwd>invasiveness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-03932S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koudelková</surname><given-names>Lenka</given-names></name><name><surname>Brábek</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Rösel</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001823</institution-id><institution>Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LX22NPO5102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koudelková</surname><given-names>Lenka</given-names></name><name><surname>Rösel</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Brábek</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Pelantová</surname><given-names>Markéta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The functional role of novel regulatory mechanism within prototypic oncogenic kinase c-Src is described with particular emphasis on cancer cell migration, invasiveness, oncogenic transformation, and multilevel regulation of Src itself.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Src kinase is a founding member of the Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (SFKs) that are crucial for a large variety of signalling and metabolic pathways such as cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, motility, and mechanosignalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guarino, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koudelková et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thomas and Brugge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yeatman, 2004</xref>). The significance of these processes in cellular homeostasis therefore implies a requirement for precise and tight regulation of the kinase. Aberrant Src activation leads to cellular transformation and has been found in several types of cancers including gastric, lung, pancreatic, ovarian, or breast neoplasms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frame, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irby and Yeatman, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Src and other SFKs share common multidomain architecture consisting of a myristoylated SH4 domain at the very N-terminus followed by a unique domain (UD), regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains, a CD linker, a catalytic domain, and a C-terminal tail containing the regulatory residue tyrosine 527 (Y527; chicken c-Src numbering will be used throughout the paper). The activity of the Src kinase is regulated in response to numerous cellular signals through allosteric conformational transitions. In the inactive state, Src adopts a closed conformation with the SH3 domain interacting with the CD linker, and the SH2 domain bound to the C-terminus phosphorylated on Y527. These autoinhibitory interactions pack both regulatory domains against the kinase domain at a site opposite to the catalytic cleft. In this position, SH3 and SH2 domains form contacts with lobes of the kinase domain, working as a clamp which locks the kinase domain in a catalytically non-permissive state characterised by the activation loop folded inside the catalytic cleft and the αC-helix of the N-lobe rotated away from the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boggon and Eck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Young et al., 2001</xref>). The shift to an open active conformation is accompanied by a release of intramolecular inhibitory interactions, which enables the kinase domain to adopt a catalytically favourable state with the unfolded activation loop accessible for phosphorylation of a regulatory tyrosine 416 (Y416) and the αC-helix rotated towards the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowan-Jacob et al., 2005</xref>). Kinase activity and engagement of regulatory domains into autoinhibitory interactions are controlled by the presence of ligands for SH3 and SH2 domains and by the phosphorylation status of two regulatory tyrosines, Y527 and Y416, with opposing effects. Phosphorylated Y527 in the C-terminal tail associates with the SH2 domain, resulting in an inhibition of kinase activity. The phosphorylation of Y416 in the activation loop stabilises the active conformation of the kinase domain and is necessary for full catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roskoski, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The role and mechanism of the inhibitory interaction between the SH2 domain and phosphorylated Y527 is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cowan-Jacob et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roskoski, 2005</xref>). The regulation of the SH3 domain engagement, however, appears to be more complex and less understood. Besides binding a proline motif within the CD linker, the SH3 domain forms another set of inhibitory contacts with the N-lobe of the kinase domain via the RT loop and the nSrc loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brábek et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, together with the SH2 domain, the SH3 domain holds the CD linker in a position which stabilises the inactive conformation of the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fajer et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the SH3 domain associates with membranes and provides structural support for intrinsically disordered SH4 and UD. Therefore, the SH3 domain seems to operate as a hub interconnecting signals from the flexible membrane-bound N-terminal part of Src together with information from the structured units of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maffei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pérez et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the multitude of interactions and signalling events known to be mediated by Src domains, the full complexity of the Src kinase regulatory network, including the hierarchy and autonomy of individual structural elements or their exact effect on Src conformation, remains to be understood.</p><p>In this study, we propose a novel mechanism of Src kinase regulation via phosphorylation of the SH3 domain on the tyrosine 90 (Y90). Using phosphomimicking or nonphosphorylatable substitutions of Y90, we showed that phosphorylation of Y90 increases Src kinase activity, reduces its affinity for SH3 domain ligands, induces the open conformation of the kinase, and slows down its molecular mobility within the cytoplasmic membrane. Furthermore, deregulating Y90 phosphorylation dynamics with a phosphomimicking mutation induces cellular transformation and increases the invasive potential of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Substitutions mimicking the Y90 phosphorylation state affect Src kinase activity</title><p>In a proteomic study which compared phosphoproteomes of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and Src-transformed MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luo et al., 2008</xref>), Y90 was identified as a novel site of tyrosine phosphorylation within the Src kinase. Y90 is localised on the binding surface of the Src SH3 domain and participates in the formation of the hydrophobic pocket involved in ligand binding, including the CD linker of Src. The interaction between the SH3 domain and the CD linker is one of the regulatory switches participating in the maintenance of the inactivated state of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boggon and Eck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, changes within the binding surface of the SH3 domain, such as phosphorylation of one of the amino acid residues, might affect Src regulation.</p><p>In order to analyse the role of Y90 phosphorylation on Src kinase activity, we prepared mutational variants of Src with either the phosphomimicking substitution of Y90 to glutamate (90E) or the nonphosphorylatable substitution of Y90 to phenylalanine (90F). These mutants, together with wild type (WT) Src (c-Src) and constitutively active Src (Src527F), were stably expressed in SYF cells, a lineage of MEFs with deleted genes for Src family kinases Src, Yes, and Fyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klinghoffer et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Initially, we tested the effect of the phosphomimicking substitution 90E on the phosphorylation of the Src activation loop tyrosine 416, which is known to correlate with Src kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boerner et al., 1996</xref>). We found that the 90E substitution results in a significant increase of Y416 phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of Y90 increases Y416 autophosphorylation of Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Substitutions mimicking the Y90 phosphorylation state affect Src kinase activity.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Lysates from SYF fibroblasts stably expressing the Src variants were analysed by immunodetection on western blots using antibodies against Src pY416, total Src, and actin as a loading control.

Src activity was measured in lysates prepared from SYF cells stably expressing the Src variants. Consistent with the analysis of Y416 autophosphorylation, we found the kinase activity of the Src90E variant to be significantly increased relative to that of c-Src. The nonphosphorylatable variant Src90F consistently displayed slightly lower, albeit not statistically significant, kinase activity than WT c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that Y90 within the Src SH3 domain is involved in the regulation of Src Y416 autophosphorylation and kinase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phosphomimicking mutation 90E reduces the SH3 domain ligand binding capacity</title><p>Elevated kinase activity of Src90E suggests that there may be impaired association of the CD linker to the SH3 domain. To further examine the effect of Y90 substitutions on the binding properties of the SH3 domain, we performed pull-down assays with GST-fused Src SH3 domain variants (WT, 90E, 90F). The number of proteins precipitated via GST-SH3-90E was greatly reduced compared to the GST-SH3-WT sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, the phosphomimicking substitution 90E almost completely abolished the binding of FAK, p130Cas, Stat3, and paxillin, the key interacting proteins of Src SH3 domain. Conversely, the 90F mutation had a minor or no effect on ligand interaction, except for FAK binding, which was partially abrogated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that phosphorylation of Y90 inhibits Src ability to interact with its signalling partners.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phosphomimicking mutation 90E reduces the SH3 domain ligand binding capacity.</title><p>The variants of Src SH3 domains (90F, 90E, wild type [WT]) were expressed as recombinant GST-SH3 fusion constructs in bacteria, isolated and used for pull-down from HeLa lysates.

We observed substantially decreased association of the phosphomimicking mutant Src90E to FAK and Stat3 when compared to c-Src. Affinity of full-length Src90E to paxillin and p130Cas was only slightly weakened, potentially due to significant contribution of Src SH2 domain to the interaction between these proteins. Src with the nonphosphorylatable substitution 90F exhibited similar binding to the selected SH3-interacting proteins as c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Phosphorylation of Y90 opens the Src structure</title><p>Elevated kinase activity and reduced ligand binding of the phosphomimicking mutant Src90E indicate that Y90 phosphorylation could also decrease the affinity of the SH3 domain for the CD linker, thus potentially causing a loosening of the compact conformation maintained by inhibited Src. To evaluate the effects of Y90 substitutions on Src structure, we assessed the compactness of the Src variants by employing an SrcFRET biosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koudelková et al., 2019</xref>). The SrcFRET biosensor allows for reading of Src conformational changes by monitoring an intramolecular FRET between a donor mCFP and acceptor mCit fluorophores inserted into the SH2 domain and at the very C-terminus of the kinase, respectively. In the inactive compact conformation, the fluorophores are in close proximity, which results in high values of FRET. Upon activation, the Src structure loosens, causing separation of the fluorophores and a decrease of FRET.</p><p>The sequence of the original SrcFRET sensor was modified by introducing the Y90 phosphomimicking and nonphosphorylatable mutations or the 527F activating mutation. We expressed the constructs in the U2OS cell line and measured FRET in lysates using a ratiometric approach. The nonphosphorylatable 90F version exerted higher FRET than the WT sensor, indicating a more compact conformation. Conversely, the phosphomimicking mutation 90E led to a decrease in FRET to an intermediate level between WT SrcFRET and 527F-mutated SrcFRET (SrcFRET527F), therefore opening the Src structure but to a lower extent compared to SrcFRET527F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of Y90 represents an autoactivatory mechanism that opens the Src structure.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Analysis of effects mediated by the Y90 substitutions on the Src kinase structure using SrcFRET sensor.

To obtain information on the absolute level of phosphorylated molecules, we used stable isotope-labelled phospho- and nonphospho-peptides of known concentrations that served as standards allowing calibration of measurements. We were able to detect phosphorylation of Y416 in 22% of WT Src molecules, which further increased to 57% in case of constitutively active form of Src. Phosphorylation of Y90 was present only in 1% of WT molecules but became five times more abundant upon kinase activation, as demonstrated with the SrcFRET527F variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Based on bioinformatic predictions, Y90 is likely to be phosphorylated by Src family kinases or Src itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tatárová et al., 2012</xref>). To support this notion, we took advantage of an established panel of Src activatory mutations, which we evaluated for their effect on structural compactness and catalytic activity by introducing them in the SrcFRET sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koudelková et al., 2019</xref>). For subsequent analyses, we selected three SrcFRET variants exhibiting distinct kinase activities: the original sensor with unmutated Src, representing a molecule with the lowest activity, SrcFRET527F with the intermediately high activity and SrcFRET-CA (Glu381Gly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorge et al., 1995</xref>) possessing the highest activity. Chosen variants were analysed for Y90 phosphorylation levels using quantitative MS. Y90 phosphorylation was detected in all variants, with 5- and 12-fold higher incidence compared to WT in activated constructs SrcFRET527F and SrcFRET-CA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The revealed positive correlation between Src catalytic activity and Y90 phosphorylation levels suggesting that Y90 is phosphorylated through autophosphorylation mechanisms. To further address the question of Y90 autophosphorylation, we expressed a kinase dead version of the Src527F biosensor with a K295M substitution (SrcFRET527F KD) and analysed the phosphorylation levels of Y90 and Y416 using quantitative MS. Despite the inactivating mutation, SrcFRET527F KD retained an open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). However, phosphorylation of both tyrosines in the kinase dead variant was negligible even though both endogenous Src and other SFKs are present in the U2OS cells we used for the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation of Y90 is dependent on the intrinsic kinase activity of Src and is therefore very likely to be autophosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Y90 phosphorylation state does not affect Src localisation but alters its mobility within the plasma membrane</title><p>Introduction of the Y90 mutations to the SrcFRET biosensor allowed us to analyse the effect of these substitutions on Src localisation.

Additionally, the Src SH3 domain acts as a scaffold providing structural support to this intrinsically disordered segment of the kinase.

For example, in SH3 domains of PST-PIP, the Btk kinase or the adaptor protein p130Cas, phosphorylation of tyrosines corresponding to Y90 causes decreased or changed affinity for ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gemperle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janoštiak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morrogh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu et al., 1998</xref>). In chronic myeloid leukaemia cells, the SH3-SH2 segment of Bcr-Abl kinase was found to be heavily phosphorylated on seven residues including the Y90 homolog, which induces full catalytic activity of the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meyn et al., 2006</xref>).

Using an immunoprecipitated Src and targeted MS approach, we were able to detect and quantify the level of Y90 phosphorylation even in resting untransformed cells efficiently and consistently. Y90 is phosphorylated in approximately 1% of WT Src molecules, but in the case of activated kinase its phosphorylation increases fivefold (5.3% of Src molecules). However, compared to activation loop phosphorylation (Y416), phosphorylation of Y90 is 22-fold and 10-fold less abundant when compared to WT and activated kinase, respectively. Importantly, although the enrichment of Y90 phosphorylation in the catalytically active kinase is lower compared to Y416 phosphorylation in terms of percentage of phosphorylated molecules, its increment with respect to the basal state is significantly higher. We suggest that this wider dynamic range of Y90 phosphorylation is consistent with and reflects the demonstrated regulatory function of Y90 phosphorylation.</p><p>It has been shown that autophosphorylation of Y416 is dependent on Src dimerisation and occurs via transphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spassov et al., 2018</xref>). In our experimental setup, quantification of Y416 phosphorylation by MS was performed in cells expressing both the analysed Src biosensor and endogenous Src. Interestingly, the level of Y416 phosphorylation was negligible in the kinase-dead variant of the biosensor. This could indicate that the Src biosensor cannot form a stable dimer with endogenous Src molecules. However, since Y416 is efficiently phosphorylated in all kinase-competent biosensor variants, dimerisation of these forms of the biosensor is likely unaffected. This observation is consistent with the previously described dependence of Src dimer formation on Src kinase activity, as Src inhibitors have been shown to block de novo Src dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spassov et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore propose that only if both Src molecules are kinase competent, they can form a dimer.</p><p>In the context of Src structure, Y90, together with asparagine 135 and tyrosine 136, forms the first hydrophobic pocket of the SH3 domain binding surface, which in the inactive conformation of the Src kinase accommodates a dipeptide containing the key proline 250 of the SH3-interacting motif within the CD linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 1997</xref>). The importance of Y90 for ligand binding was mentioned in an early study mapping conserved residues within the SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erpel et al., 1995</xref>). Substitution of Y90 for alanine led to a partially deregulated Src and a reduced affinity of the SH3 domain. Based on NMR analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of ligand binding by the p130Cas SH3 domain containing a homologous tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gemperle et al., 2017</xref>), we propose that the aromatic ring of unphosphorylated Y90 forms CH/π interactions with the dipeptide in the binding pocket. Through the negative charge of the phosphate group, phosphorylation of Y90 causes a disruption of these nonpolar bonds with a consequent decrease in affinity of the SH3 domain for its ligands. Y90 phosphorylation state might therefore influence the Src kinase via a dual mechanism of action: regulating its catalytic activity by modulating SH3 domain binding to the CD linker and affecting its ability to associate with interacting partners.</p><p>Molecular dynamics simulations show that residues of the CD linker are directly responsible for retaining the inactive conformation of the catalytic domain. The SH3 domain together with the SH2 domain stabilises this inhibitory position of the CD linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fajer et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that phosphorylation of Y90 within the binding surface of the SH3 domain leads to a decreased affinity for the CD linker, presumably followed by a destabilisation of contacts with the kinase domain and a shift to the catalytically active state.</p><p>The phosphomimicking mutant Src90E adopts a partially open conformation with the SH3 domain released from inhibitory interactions. Interestingly, the SH2 domain of Src90E appears to be still bound to the C-terminal tail. The presence of an intact SH2-C-terminus interaction is further supported by a uniform cellular distribution of Src90E, since disengaged SH2 domain causes the accumulation of Src in FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore suggest that the Src kinase may exist not just in the SH2-activated form but also in an SH3-only activated state.</p><p>The introduction of 90E or 90F mutations into the SH2-activated kinase (via 527F substitution) affected its activity and, more importantly, its transforming potential and cellular invasiveness. Specifically, the 90E mutation emphasised, and the 90F substitution reduced, the impact of 527F-activated Src. Thus, we assume that both regulatory domains cooperate and influence the kinase structure and activity with some degree of independency, enabling Src to adopt several active conformations (SH2-activated, SH3-activated, SH2+SH3-activated). This structural hierarchy increases the functional diversity and regulatory potential of the Src kinase and its downstream signalling.</p><p>Together with the SH4 and UD, the SH3 domain ensures the ability of Src to associate with the cytoplasmic membrane and provides a structural support to this intrinsically disordered N-terminal region of Src. Membrane contacts of the SH3 domain are maintained by RT and nSrc loops, which are also responsible for binding the unique and SH4 domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maffei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pérez et al., 2013</xref>). These SH3-mediated interactions were described to be governed by the ligand-binding state of the domain in a mutually exclusive manner where the presence of a ligand weakens the contacts of SH3 with the N-terminal domains and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maffei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). Controlling the phosphorylation state of Y90 within the SH3 domain provides a mechanism for regulation of these interactions and therefore of Src dynamics within membranes. We propose that phosphorylation of Y90 decreases the affinity of the SH3 domain towards ligands and consequently increases the association of the SH3 domain with the UD and the lipid layer, which results in slower mobility within membranes and prolonged residence in FA sites. This seems to be in agreement with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Machiyama et al., 2015</xref>, who were analysing movement of single Src molecules within the plasma membrane. They demonstrated decreased membrane motility and increased dissociation times from FAs of Src with W118A mutation, which abrogates ligand binding to the SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erpel et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Besides maintaining interactions with lipids and N-terminal unstructured domains, the RT and nSrc loops of the SH3 domain also form inhibitory contacts with the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brábek et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 1997</xref>). Residues of the RT loop responsible for interaction with the catalytic domain overlap with some of those associating with membranes and the UD (R95, T96). We speculate that phosphorylation of Y90 will block binding of the CD linker by the SH3 domain, which might cause a shift towards a state where the SH3 domain favours interactions with the cytoplasmic membrane and the UD over keeping contacts with the N-lobe, resulting in kinase activation. The SH3 domain could be therefore perceived as a crucial element interconnecting the lipid layer, unstructured, and structured regions of Src, thus forming a signalling hub which mediates transitions between catalytically inactive and active states of the kinase. Phosphorylation of Y90 might then represent an important molecular switch facilitating these processes, hence regulating Src catalytic activity, interactions, and mobility within cell membranes.</p><p>To conclude, we present a new model for the regulation of Src by tyrosine phosphorylation. In this model, the SH2 and the SH3 domains serve as cooperative but independent regulatory elements of the Src kinase. Their function and their engagement in the intramolecular inhibitory lock are controlled by phosphorylation on tyrosines Y527 and Y90. Both phosphorylations affect the opening of Src structure and its catalytic activity, but in opposite ways. Furthermore, unlike Y527, phosphorylation of Y90 greatly influences the repertoire of Src binding partners and enhances Src affinity for the plasma membrane. Taken together, the modular system of regulations through phosphorylation of key tyrosines and intramolecular interactions enables the Src kinase to adopt several different conformations of varying kinase activities and interacting properties. That allows Src to operate not as a simple on/off switch but as a tunable regulator functioning as a signalling hub in a variety of cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid constructs and cloning</title><p>To prepare SrcY90E and SrcY90F, c-Src cloned in pBluescript SK+ vector through <italic>BamHI</italic> and <italic>XbaI</italic> sites was mutated using QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) with the forward primer (5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">CCACTTTCGTGGCTCTC<underline>GAG</underline>GACTACGAGTCCCGGACTG</named-content>-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">CAGTCCGGGACTCGTAGTC<underline>CTC</underline>GAGAGCCACGAAAGTGG</named-content>-3′) for Y90E mutation and the forward (5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">CCACTTTCGTGGCTCTCT<underline>T</underline>CGACTACGAGTCCCGGACTG</named-content>-3′) and the reverse (5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">CAGTCCGGGACTCGTAGTCG<underline>A</underline>AGAGAGCCACGAAAGTGG</named-content>-3′) primers for Y90F variant.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Miquel Pons (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All three reviewers considered that the major limitation of the study was the lack of evidence that Y90 phosphorylation occurred to a significant extent in cells. Therefore, addressing the reviewers' suggestions and concerns relative to this point is necessary: Reviewer 1, point 3; Reviewer 2, point 2 in the public review and also Reviewer 2 recommendations; Reviewer 3's comment &quot;The biological relevance of this mechanism remains an open question&quot;.</p><p>2) Determining whether or not Y90 phosphorylation can occur via autophosphorylation is necessary.</p><p>3) Please also address Reviewer #1 points 1, 2, and minor comments; Reviewer #2, point 1, and include missing references and discussion indicated by Reviewer #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I think the biochemical and cellular studies in this manuscript are fairly convincing and the authors' model of how Y90 phosphorylation would be expected to affect the regulation of this kinase makes intuitive sense. However, it is difficult to view these results as being biologically significant without a better idea of whether Y90 phosphorylation actually plays a regulatory role in signaling. No data on how widely this phospho-event is observed are provided and there is a lack of evidence that Y90 phospho-levels are modulated under specific signaling regimes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The kinase phosphorylating Y90 may be c-Src itself (autophosphorylation) but if there are other kinases involved is an open question. Detection of pY90 in a kinase-dead Src variant may help identify other kinases.</p><p>The Y90E mutation has a clear effect on the kinase activity, probably through c-Src opening. The implied mechanism is a decrease in ligand binding by the SH3 domain that would affect not only the intramolecular interaction with the connector but also other activating intermolecular interactions. The result may be a change in the specificity of the mutated kinase. Have the authors any phosphoproteomic evidence in this direction? I am not suggesting the authors embark on a complete phosphoproteomics study, which would be beyond the scope of the present paper but it may be interesting for future studies to explore the effects of various mutations at the position of Y90.</p><p>Lipid-mediated Src dimerization involving the positively charged residues in the SH4 domain, which also interact with the SH3 domain, has been observed in constructs containing the myristoylated Src N-terminal regulatory element and full-length Src (bioRxiv 2022.05.31.494233; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.31.494233). Do Y90 mutations affect Src dimerization?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Phosphorylation of tyrosine 90 in SH3 domain is a new regulatory switch controlling Src kinase&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Volker Dötsch (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>All three reviewers were impressed by the new manuscript data that quantified the extent of Y90 and Y416 phosphorylation sites and have concluded that the manuscript has been significantly improved. However, there are two remaining issues with the text that need to be addressed. First, as noted in both the first reviews and also in the review of the revised manuscript, it is important that the findings are not exaggerated. Please update the text accordingly in all relevant sections (see reviewer #2). Second, please address the concern of reviewer #3 in the updated text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The major additions to the revised version of this manuscript are data quantifying the levels of Y90 phosphorylation on SrcFRET constructs using mass spectrometry with isotopic standard peptides. This is impressive work from a technical standpoint that shows that Y90 phosphorylation levels are increased in activated Src (Y527F). Unfortunately, the authors were not able to measure Y90 phosphorylation levels on endogenous Src, which somewhat diminishes the biological relevance of these results and leaves the question of whether endogenous Src is phosphorylated to any significant degree on Y90 unanswered. It also does not provide a clearer picture of how Y90 phosphorylation could play a role in Src's cellular function. Therefore, I suggest the authors further minimize their claims about the role of Y90 phosphorylation in regulating Src's cellular activity and, instead, focus more on the mechanistic and structural insight they have obtained. In addition to the new experimental data described above, the authors have provided additional experimental details that alleviate the technical concerns raised during the previous round of review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The detailed quantification of the phosphphoryltion levels of Y90 and Y416 is an important addition to the paper, as well as the experiments with a kinase dead mutant to test autophosphorylation. These were key experiments requested by the reviewers that have been addressed. Overall, the paper shows a reasonably convincing view of the role of Y90 as a regulatory element of c-Src and an estimate of its relative importance with respect to other regulatory events. As a result I would recommend the publication of the paper in its present form.</p><p>Having said that, maybe the authors could comment on the lack of phosphorylation of Y416 in the kinase dead mutant even in its open 527F form in spite of the presence of endogenous Src. Src autophosphorylation is supposed to be in trans (i.e. caused by a second Src molecule) and therefore phosphorylation of Y416 in the kinase dead mutant is expected. The fact that is not observed lowers the relevance of the lack of phosphorylation of Y90. This may be related to the use of the SrcFRET variant to enhance the yield of the IP. Maybe the presence of the fluorescent proteins in the sensor has an effect on the trans autophosphoryation?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82428.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, I think the biochemical and cellular studies in this manuscript are fairly convincing and the authors' model of how Y90 phosphorylation would be expected to affect the regulation of this kinase makes intuitive sense.

Thus, we validated existence of Y90 phosphorylation on MS and focused predominantly on cellular studies. We agree that data demonstrating the presence of Y90 phosphorylation in cells could be more robust. As noted above, we therefore included additional quantification of Y90 phosphorylation using MS analysis with labeled peptide standards enabling precise analysis of the amount of phosphorylated molecules in cells. The new results suggest that phosphorylation of Y90 does not represent a rare phosphorylation event but is an important regulatory element of Src activation. We believe that the combination of these approaches provides solid evidence of the regulatory role of Y90 phosphorylation in Src kinase activation, localization and cellular processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The kinase phosphorylating Y90 may be c-Src itself (autophosphorylation) but if there are other kinases involved is an open question.

These results suggest that phosphorylation of Y90 depends on catalytic activity of the kinase and is therefore very likely autophosphorylation.

I am not suggesting the authors embark on a complete phosphoproteomics study, which would be beyond the scope of the present paper but it may be interesting for future studies to explore the effects of various mutations at the position of Y90.</p><p>Lipid-mediated Src dimerization involving the positively charged residues in the SH4 domain, which also interact with the SH3 domain, has been observed in constructs containing the myristoylated Src N-terminal regulatory element and full-length Src (bioRxiv 2022.05.31.494233; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.31.494233). Do Y90 mutations affect Src dimerization?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not perform any phosphoproteomics study with our SrcY90 mutants. However, we did investigate the effect of the Y90E variant on tyrosine phosphorylation of several known Src substrates. Although we mostly observed increased phosphorylation when compared to WT Src, the phosphorylation of FAK on Y861 was significantly lower than that in case of WT Src (Figure 6D). These data were not discussed in detail in the manuscript because the literature is inconclusive as to the significance of the Src SH3 domain-dependent binding of Src to FAK. Although in suspension cells, Src binding to FAK has been shown to be independent of Src SH2 and conversely dependent on the Src SH3 domain (PMID: 11839732).</p><p>Regarding the effect of Y90 mutations on dimerization, we believe that they do indeed affect dimerization. We have some indirect evidence from line scan FCS suggesting that Y90E occurs more frequently as a dimer on the plasma membrane than other variants. However, due to the &quot;high noise&quot; in the data, the results were inconclusive and therefore we do not show them in the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers were impressed by the new manuscript data that quantified the extent of Y90 and Y416 phosphorylation sites and have concluded that the manuscript has been significantly improved. However, there are two remaining issues with the text that need to be addressed. First, as noted in both the first reviews and also in the review of the revised manuscript, it is important that the findings are not exaggerated. Please update the text accordingly in all relevant sections (see reviewer #2). Second, please address the concern of reviewer #3 in the updated text.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The major additions to the revised version of this manuscript are data quantifying the levels of Y90 phosphorylation on SrcFRET constructs using mass spectrometry with isotopic standard peptides. This is impressive work from a technical standpoint that shows that Y90 phosphorylation levels are increased in activated Src (Y527F). Unfortunately, the authors were not able to measure Y90 phosphorylation levels on endogenous Src, which somewhat diminishes the biological relevance of these results and leaves the question of whether endogenous Src is phosphorylated to any significant degree on Y90 unanswered. It also does not provide a clearer picture of how Y90 phosphorylation could play a role in Src's cellular function. Therefore, I suggest the authors further minimize their claims about the role of Y90 phosphorylation in regulating Src's cellular activity and, instead, focus more on the mechanistic and structural insight they have obtained. In addition to the new experimental data described above, the authors have provided additional experimental details that alleviate the technical concerns raised during the previous round of review.</p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted the penultimate paragraph of the Discussion where we speculated on the potential role of Y90 phosphorylation in focal adhesion. In addition, we have removed from the last paragraph of the Discussion a sentence with a rather strong statement about the relative importance of Y90 phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The detailed quantification of the phosphphoryltion levels of Y90 and Y416 is an important addition to the paper, as well as the experiments with a kinase dead mutant to test autophosphorylation. These were key experiments requested by the reviewers that have been addressed. Overall, the paper shows a reasonably convincing view of the role of Y90 as a regulatory element of c-Src and an estimate of its relative importance with respect to other regulatory events. As a result I would recommend the publication of the paper in its present form.</p><p>Having said that, maybe the authors could comment on the lack of phosphorylation of Y416 in the kinase dead mutant even in its open 527F form in spite of the presence of endogenous Src. Src autophosphorylation is supposed to be in trans (i.e. caused by a second Src molecule) and therefore phosphorylation of Y416 in the kinase dead mutant is expected. The fact that is not observed lowers the relevance of the lack of phosphorylation of Y90. This may be related to the use of the SrcFRET variant to enhance the yield of the IP. Maybe the presence of the fluorescent proteins in the sensor has an effect on the trans autophosphoryation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a new paragraph in the discussion that deals with this. However, we believe that our results, in the context of previously published data, strongly suggest that the biosensor is capable of dimer formation, and we conclude that two Src molecules can form a dimer only if both Src molecules are kinase competent.</p></body></sub-article></article>
