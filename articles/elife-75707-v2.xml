epilepsy. <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> splicing leads to expression of distinct functional protein isoforms. Splicing imparts multiple cellular functions of SynGAP proteins through coding of distinct C-terminal motifs. However, it remains unknown how these different splice sequences function in vivo to regulate neuronal function and behavior. Reduced expression of SynGAP-α1/2 C-terminal splice variants in mice caused severe phenotypes, including reduced survival, impaired learning, and reduced seizure latency. In contrast, upregulation of α1/2 expression improved learning and increased seizure latency. Mice expressing α1-specific mutations, which disrupted SynGAP cellular functions without altering protein expression, promoted seizure, disrupted synapse plasticity, and impaired learning. These findings demonstrate that endogenous SynGAP isoforms with α1/2 spliced sequences promote cognitive function and impart seizure protection. Regulation of SynGAP-αexpression or function may be a viable therapeutic strategy to broadly improve cognitive function and mitigate seizure.</p></abstract><kwd-group

<italic>SYNGAP1</italic>, the gene encoding SynGAP proteins, is a leading cause of sporadic neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) defined by impaired cognitive function, seizure, autistic features, and challenging behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study,

De novo loss-of-function variants leading to <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> haploinsufficiency cause a genetically defined developmental encephalopathy (ICD-10 code: F78.A1) that overlaps substantially with diagnoses of generalized epilepsy, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vlaskamp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mignot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holder et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weldon et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> is completely intolerant of loss-of-function (LOF) variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Llamosas et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the presence of a clear LOF variant in a patient will lead to the diagnosis of a <italic>SYNGAP1</italic>-mediated developmental encephalopathy. The range of neuropsychiatric disorders causally linked to <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> pathogenicity, combined with the complete penetrance of LOF variants in humans, demonstrate the crucial role that this gene plays in the development and function of neural circuits that promote cognitive abilities, behavioral adaptations, and balanced excitability.</p><p>SynGAP proteins have diverse cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Llamosas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kilinc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamache et al., 2020</xref>). The best characterized of these is the regulation of excitatory synapse structure and function located on forebrain glutamatergic projection neurons. In these synapses, SynGAP is predominately localized within the postsynaptic density (PSD), where it exists in protein complexes with synapse-associated-protein (SAP) families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 1998</xref>). Within these complexes, SynGAP proteins regulate signaling through NMDARs, where they constrain the activity of various small GTPases through non-canonical activity of a RasGAP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kilinc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamache et al., 2020</xref>). This regulation of GTPase activity is required for excitatory synapse plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2015</xref>). Reduced expression of SynGAP in both human and rodent neurons causes enhanced excitatory synapse function during early brain development and is a process thought to impair cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Llamosas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clement et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clement et al., 2013</xref>). SynGAP also regulates dendritic arborization. Reduced SynGAP protein expression impairs the development of dendritic arborization in neurons derived from both rodent and human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Llamosas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aceti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaelson et al., 2018</xref>), which disrupts the function and excitability of neural networks from both species. While reduced SynGAP expression enhances postsynaptic function regardless of glutamatergic projection neuron subtype, this same perturbation has an unpredictable impact on dendritic arborization, with some neurons undergoing precocious dendritic morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Llamosas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aceti et al., 2015</xref>), while others displaying stunted morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaelson et al., 2018</xref>).

These SynGAP C-terminal protein isoforms are expressed in both rodents and humans, and they are spatially and temporally regulated across mammalian brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gou et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, protein motifs present within these differentially expressed C-termini impart SynGAP with distinct cellular functions, with α-derived motifs shown to regulate post-synapse structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>), while the β-derived sequences linked to in vitro dendritic morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>). Absolute abundances of C-terminal isoforms are unclear, though estimates of relative expression of each have been made in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>), with α1 and α2 each contributing ~40%, β contributing ~15%, and γ contributing ~5%. <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygous null mice, which model the genetic impact of <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> haploinsufficiency in humans, express a robust endophenotype characterized by increased horizontal activity, poor learning/memory, and seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kilinc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clement et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komiyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sullivan et al., 2020</xref>).

Exon 19 is spliced into two reading frames (e19b/e19a) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because e19b lacks a stop codon, coding sequences from e20 and e21 are also included in mature transcripts. This leads to expression ofα1, α2, or γ C-terminal isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). γ isoforms arise from inclusion e20, while α1 and α2 arise from the absence of e20, but inclusion of e21. e21 itself has two reading frames, with one leading to expression of α1 while the other codes for α2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). SynGAP-β arises from splicing of e19 into the ‘a’ reading frame, which contains an internal stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To address how expression or function of isoforms contribute to cognitive function, behavior, and seizure latency, we created three distinct mouse lines, each with targeted modifications within the final three exons of the <italic>Syngap1</italic> gene. Each line expressed a unique signature with respect to C-terminal SynGAP protein variant expression or function. For example, in the <italic>Syngap1<sup>td/td</sup></italic> line, αisoform expression was disrupted while β forms were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Syngap1<sup>β*/β*</sup></italic> mice were opposite with respect to expression of α and β isoforms, with the former upregulated and the later disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Finally, the <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> line, which expressed point mutations that selectively disrupted an essential function of SynGAP-α1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), was useful for determining to what extent phenotypes in the other two lines may have been driven by upregulated or downregulated isoforms.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of <italic>Syngap1 alternative splicing and summary of isoform expression in three new Syngap1 mutant mouse lines</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Map showing alternative use of exons in N- and C-terminal isoforms.

The cassette was placed within the last <italic>Syngap1</italic> exon (e21) between the stop codons of α1 and α2 coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our prior study reported neuronal expression of fluorescent protein and normal total SynGAP (t-SynGAP) protein expression as measured by antibodies that recognize all splice forms. Due to our interest in understanding how in vivo expression of C-terminal variants impacts brain systems and behavior, we performed an in-depth characterization of behavioral phenotypes and SynGAP isoform expression in IRES-TD mice. Heterozygous (<italic>Syngap1<sup>+/td</sup></italic>) breeding of IRES-TD animals resulted in offspring of expected mendelian ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, while all WT (<italic>Syngap1<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) mice survived during the 100-day observation period, significant post-weaning death occurred in IRES-TD mice, with approximately two-thirds of homozygous mice (<italic>Syngap1<sup>td/td</sup></italic>) failing to survive past PND 50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It is well established that complete loss of t-SynGAP protein stemming from homozygous inclusion of null alleles leads to early postnatal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komiyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). However, ~ 50% t-SynGAP expression, like that occurring in heterozygous KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), has no impact on survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komiyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). Given the unexpectedly poor survival of <italic>Syngap1<sup>td/td</sup></italic> animals, we thoroughly examined SynGAP C-terminal isoform protein expression in this line. At PND21, when all three genotypes are abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), t-SynGAP protein in mouse cortex homogenate was reduced in <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/td</sup></italic> and <italic>Syngap1<sup>td/td</sup></italic> mice compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref><italic>; Source data1</italic>). Reduced t-SynGAP levels appeared to be largely driven by near-complete disruption of α1/2 protein expression from the targeted allele. Reduced α isoform expression coincided with increased protein levels of β-containing C-terminal isoforms. Even with β compensation, <italic>Syngap1<sup>td/td</sup></italic> mice expressed only ~50% of t-SynGAP at PND21. Whole exome sequencing was carried out in each genotype. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis revealed only a single mRNA, <italic>Syngap1</italic>, was abnormally expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). There was a ~ 25% reduction in mRNA levels in both <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/td</sup></italic> and <italic>Syngap1<sup>td/td</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While the IRES-TD cassette destabilized a proportion of <italic>Syngap1</italic> mRNAs, the similarity in mRNA levels from both <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/td</sup></italic> and <italic>Syngap1<sup>td/td</sup></italic> samples indicated that other mechanisms must also contribute to reduced protein expression of α1/2 isoforms. Indeed, a recent study identified 3’UTR-dependent regulation of α isoform protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yokoi et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the IRES-TD cassette is also disrupting translation of these C-terminal variants. We next addressed expression of SynGAP isoforms in adulthood. In this additional experiment, only <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/td</sup></italic> mice were used because of limited survival and poor health of homozygous mice in the post-weaning period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The general pattern of abnormal SynGAP levels persisted into adulthood, with both α isoforms reduced by ~50% compared to WT levels, while β isoforms were significantly enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, the effect on t-SynGAP was less pronounced in older animals and did not rise to significance.

However, survival data from <italic>Syngap1<sup>td/td</sup></italic> mice above, which also expressed a ~ 50% reduction of t-SynGAP, but loss of α isoform expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggest that expression of these isoforms is required for survival. α isoforms are highly enriched in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that reduced survival stems from altered brain function. Therefore, we next sought to understand how reduced α1/2 expression (but in the context of β compensation) impacted behaviors known to be sensitive to reduced t-SynGAP expression in mice. We obtained minimal data from adult <italic>Syngap1<sup>td/td</sup></italic> mice because they exhibit poor health and survival in the post-weaning period. However, two animals were successfully tested in the open field, and they exhibited very high levels of horizontal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A more thorough characterization of behavior was carried out in adult <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/td</sup></italic> mice, which have significantly reduced α isoforms, enhanced β expression, but relatively normal t-SynGAP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>)<italic>. Syngap1<sup>+/td</sup></italic> mice exhibited significantly elevated open-field activity, seized more quickly in response to flurothyl, and froze less during remote contextual fear memory recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). These phenotypes are all present in conventional <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clement et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aceti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Creson et al., 2019</xref>), which again express ~50% reduction of all isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, Morris water maze acquisition, which is impaired in <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komiyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2003</xref>)<italic>,</italic> was unchanged in <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/td</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, certain behaviors, including horizontal activity, freezing in response to conditioned fear, and behavioral seizure, are sensitive to reduced levels of α isoforms, but not necessarily to t-SynGAP levels. Moreover, ~ 50% loss of α1/α2 isoforms appear sufficient to disrupt long-term memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), but insufficient to disrupt spatial learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Enhanced α1/2 C-terminal isoform expression is associated with seizure protection and improved cognitive function</title><p>The results in IRES-TD mice suggested that certain core <italic>Syngap1</italic>-sensitive behavioral phenotypes are caused, at least in part, by reduced α1/2 isoform expression. If α isoforms directly contribute to behavioral phenotypes in mice, then increasing their expression may drive phenotypes in the opposite direction. To test this idea, we created a new mouse line designed to upregulate SynGAP-α expression in vivo. This line, called <italic>Syngap1<sup>β*/β*</sup>,</italic> contained a point mutation that prevented use of the e19a spliced reading frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), the mechanism leading to expression of the SynGAP-β C-terminal variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This design was expected to force all mRNAs to use the e19b reading frame, leading to an increase in α variants (and loss of β expression). This line appeared healthy, bred normally, and resulting offspring were of expected Mendelian ratios. The CRISPR-engineered point mutation had the predicted impact on SynGAP isoform expression. While there was no change in t-SynGAP expression, there was a copy-number-dependent decrease in β expression, and a modest, but significant, increase in α2 expression in neonatal mice and α1 in young adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Further, they expressed no change in freezing levels during remote contextual memory recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Unexpectedly, homozygous β* mice exhibited improved learning in the Morris water maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), with normal memory expression during the probe test.

However, it is also possible that compensatory changes in β expression underlies these phenotypes. This alternative is unlikely, given that α and β expression is anticorrelated in both mouse lines. Thus, for β to drive phenotypes, its expression would need to be both anti-cognitive and pro-seizure, which is inconsistent with isoform expression patterns in <italic>Syngap1<sup>-/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), where all protein variants are reduced by half. To directly test the hypothesis that behavioral phenotypes are sensitive to the presence of α isoforms, we attempted to create a third mouse line with point mutations that selectively impacted α isoforms, with minimal effect to SynGAP-β. We took advantage of a known molecular function exclusive to SynGAP-α1. This C-terminal variant is the only isoform that expresses a PDZ-binding motif (PBM). Importantly, cell-based studies have shown that the α1-exclusive PBM imparts unique cellular functions to this isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), such as the ability to become enriched at the post-synaptic density through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Past studies have shown that mutating the PBM disrupts the ability of SynGAP to regulate synapse structural and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>), including glutamatergic synapse transmission and dendritic spine size. Before this mouse could be engineered, we had to first identify PBM-disrupting point mutations within the α1 coding sequence that were silent within the open reading frames of the remaining C-terminal isoforms. In silico predictions and prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>) suggested that a double point mutation within the α1 PBM could meet these requirements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). To test this prediction, we introduced these point mutations into a cDNA that encoded the PBM and then tested how this impacted PDZ binding. Using an established cell-based assay that reports PDZ binding between the SynGAP PBM and PSD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), we found that these point mutations had a large effect on SynGAP-PDZ binding. When expressed individually in HeLa cells, PSD95-tRFP localized to the cytoplasm, while a SynGAP fragment containing the coiled-coil domain and α1 C-tail (EGFP-CCα1) was enriched in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). The co-expression of these two proteins led to SynGAP localization into the cytoplasm. However, this shift in localization did not occur when PBM point mutations were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>), indicating that the selected amino acid substitutions severely impaired binding to the PDZ domains. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation in heterologous cells indicated that the point mutations in the PBM disrupted the direct association of full-length SynGAP-α1 with PSD95 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5s1sdata1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>).

Moreover, using isoform-selective antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gou et al., 2019</xref>), we observed normal expression of SynGAP-β and SynGAP-α2 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–J</xref>). A reduced signal of ~60% was observed in samples probed with α1-specific antibodies. However, we also observed a similarly reduced signal in heterologous cells expressing a cDNA encoding the mutant PBM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5s1sdata1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>), indicating that these antibodies have reduced affinity for the mutated α1 motif. Together, these data strongly suggest that the α1 variant is expressed normally in <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> animals. This interpretation was supported by RNA-seq data, where normal levels of mRNA containing the α1 reading frame were observed in brain samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). These data, combined with the observation of no change in total SynGAP protein expression in <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–J</xref>), strongly support the conclusion that the PBM-disrupting point mutations do not change the expression levels of the major SynGAP C-terminal splice variants, including those containing the PBM. Thus, this animal model is suitable for understanding the putative biological functions mediated by α1-specific splicing.</p><p>Given the disruption to SynGAP-α1 PBM, we sought to understand how altering this functional motif impacted previously defined features of SynGAP at excitatory postsynapses. α1 is believed to be anchored within the PSD in part through PBM binding to PDZ domain containing proteins. However, SynGAP molecules multimerize in vivo and it is currently unknown to what extent this feature contributes to homo- <italic>vs</italic>. hetero-multimerization. Thus, it is unclear how a functional disruption to one isoform generally impacts native SynGAP complexes at synapses. This is important given that C-terminal isoforms have distinct functions within excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>). t-SynGAP levels were reduced in unstimulated PSD fractions prepared from either adult hippocampal homogenates or primary neurons from <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> mice (). Importantly, a corresponding increase in t-SynGAP was observed in the triton-soluble synaptosomal fraction, further supporting the observation of reduced t-SynGAP levels in the PSD. PSD abundance of SynGAP-β and α2 isoforms were not significantly different in PBM mice compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), which suggested that α1 may exist in distinct biochemical complexes compared to other C-terminal isoforms (i.e. homomeric SynGAP-α1 complexes). Unfortunately, this could not be tested directly in these samples due to reduced affinity of α1-specific antibodies in <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Therefore, we performed an additional experiment to address the potential existence of isoform-specific biochemical complexes. This required culturing neurons, inducing chemical LTP (cLTP), and then measuring how the stimulus impacted PSD abundance of total SynGAP and C-terminal isoforms. First, we found that a typical cLTP paradigm drove extrusion of total SynGAP from the PSD of WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6s1sdata1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>), while a weak cLTP stimulation did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which are findings consistent with past studies that defined SynGAP dynamics within biochemical fractions or subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, weak cLTP was capable of driving a reduction in total SynGAP from PSDs in <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies in the weak cLTP condition provided insight into the differential behavior of total SynGAP in PSDs from WT vs. PBM mice. For example, weak cLTP was sufficient to drive reduced PSD abundance for both α2 and β isoforms in both WT and PBM neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, α1 PSD abundance was unchanged in WT mice after weak cLTP, demonstrating that this isoform, when intact, exhibits distinct properties in response to synaptic NMDAR activation. Replicating this approach in PBM neurons revealed that this distinct feature of α1 was due to the existence of an intact PBM motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data indicate that reduced PSD abundance of t-SynGAP in <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> mice is driven by altered biochemical features and dynamics of α1. The other isoforms appear minimally impacted by the PBM mutation. Based on this model, spontaneous activity within <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> neurons may drive reduced SynGAP PSD abundance, presumably by reducing the stimulus threshold required to drive α1 out of this compartment. To test this, we measured SynGAP PSD abundance and ERK1/2 signaling in WT and PBM neurons with and without activity blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Acute blockade of synaptic activity normalized SynGAP levels in the PSD and ERK1/2 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similar treatments also normalized enrichment of SynGAP in dendritic spines and surface expression of GluA1 in neurons derived from <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). These results indicate that endogenous PBM binding of the α1 isoform regulates an activity-dependent process within excitatory synapses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>SynGAP synapse localization in <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM</sup></italic> mouse line.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blots showing relative distribution of SynGAP in PSD and Syn/Tx fractions from adult hippocampi.

This suggested that the PBM regulates SynGAP-specific functions in excitatory synapses, such as activity-dependent extrusion of α1 from the PSD. However, SynGAP-α1 undergoes LLPS and this mechanism is thought to facilitate the organization of the PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, disrupted SynGAP post-synaptic levels could also be attributable to altered structural organization of the PSD. To determine if the PBM contributes to the organization of macromolecular complexes within excitatory synapses, we immunoprecipitated PSD95 from neurons obtained from either WT or <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> mutant neurons. These neurons were treated with APV to avoid the confounds of elevated NMDAR signaling. These samples were then analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine how disrupting SynGAP-PDZ binding impacted the composition of PSD95 macromolecular complexes. In general, we found only minor differences in the abundance of proteins that comprise PSD95 complexes when comparing samples from each genotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1A</xref>). Only 1 out of ~161 proteins (from 133 distinct genes) known to be present within PSD95 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2017</xref>) met our threshold for significance, although there were modest changes in proteins with structurally homologous PBMs (Type-1 PDZ ligands), such as Iqseq2 and Dlgap3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, the vast majority of related PBM-containing proteins were not different in mutant neurons, including NMDAR subunits and TARPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Consistent with the mass spectrometry analysis, immunoblot analyses found no changes in TARPs or LRRTM2 in isolated PSDs from <italic>Syngap1<sup>PBM/PBM</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>).

These results indicate that SynGAP interacts with PSD95 in a non-PDZ-dependent manner. In support of this interpretation, there is significant overlap between the interactomes of PSD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2017</xref>) and SynGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilkinson et al., 2017</xref>) macromolecular complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Thus, within intact postsynapses, SynGAP and PSD95 interact, as part of a macromolecular complex, through binding to common protein intermediaries. Together, these data suggest that SynGAP PBM binding to PDZ domains is not a major factor promoting the organization of PSD95 macromolecular complexes or the PSD.

A summary of all measured phenotypes in these lines can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The overall conclusion from this study is that α-containing SynGAP isoforms promote cognitive functions that support learning/memory, while also protecting against seizure. It is important to understand the relationship between SynGAP isoform function and systems-level manifestations of the different isoforms, such as behavioral expression related to cognitive function and seizure. It has been shown previously that <italic>Syngap1</italic> C-terminal splicing imparts distinct cellular functions of SynGAP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, targeting endogenous isoform expression in animal models presents an opportunity to determine to what extent distinct cellular functions of SynGAP could contribute to various intermediate phenotypes present in <italic>Syngap1</italic> mouse models. Given that <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> is a well-established NDD gene and LOF mutations are highly penetrant in the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamdan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mignot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamdan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berryer et al., 2013</xref>), studying these relationships have the potential to provide much needed insight into the neurobiology underlying human cognitive and behavioral disorders that first manifest during development. Second, there is increasing interest in targeted treatments for patients with <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> disorders due to the penetrance of LOF variants, the relatively homogenous manifestations of the disorder (e.g. cognitive impairment and epilepsy), and the growing number of patients identified with this disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lim et al., 2020</xref>). Restoring SynGAP protein expression in brain cells is the most logical targeted treatment for this disorder because most known patients have de novo variants that cause genetic haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holder et al., 1993</xref>). The most logical therapeutic approach would be to reactivate native expression of the endogenous gene. However, the findings from this study indicate that targeted therapies for <italic>SYNGAP1</italic> disorders that enhance expression of α isoforms may be sufficient to provide a benefit to patients. Indeed, only a modest upregulation of α1/2 expression within a <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygous background was sufficient to improve behavioral deficits commonly observed in that mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Third, the discovery that SynGAP-α1/2 expression/function is pro-cognitive and provides protection from seizure suggests that these isoforms, and the cellular mechanisms that they regulate, could be harnessed to intervene in idiopathic cognitive and excitability disorders, such as neurodegenerative disorders and/or epilepsies with unknown etiology.</p><p>Several lines of evidence from this study support the conclusion that SynGAP-α isoform expression or function promotes cognition and seizure protection. IRES-TD and PBM mouse lines each had similar learning/memory and seizure threshold phenotypes, with both mouse lines exhibiting impaired phenotypes related to these two types of behavioral analyses. Indeed, these two mouse lines also shared a common molecular perturbation - reduced expression or function of alpha isoform(s). For example, IRES-TD homozygous mice lacked expression of both α1 and α2 isoforms and these animals exhibited severe phenotypes, including reduced post-weaning survival and dramatically elevated horizontal activity in the open field. Additional phenotypes were also present in heterozygous IRES-TD mice, which underwent more comprehensive testing because of better survival in the post-weaning period. These additional phenotypes included reduced seizure threshold and impaired freezing during a remote contextual fear expression test. PBM homozygous mice had normal expression of SynGAP protein, but lacked a functional domain present exclusively in α1 isoforms, a type-1 PDZ-binding domain. PBM homozygous mice shared phenotypes with IRES-TD mice, including impaired remote contextual fear expression, elevated horizontal activity in the open field, and a reduced seizure threshold. These mice also expressed impaired learning during Morris water maze acquisition. Importantly, these behavioral phenotypes are well established in <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clement et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aceti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Creson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that SynGAP protein loss-of-function underlies these abnormalities. Thus, it reasonable to speculate that α isoform LOF is one potential mechanism underlying these behavioral abnormalities. Dysregulation of excitatory synapse function in cortical circuits is one of many possible cellular mechanisms underlying common phenotypes in IRES-TD and PBM mutant mice lines. Whole cell electrophysiology experiments from developing cortical neurons in situ from each line revealed evidence of elevated excitatory synapse strength during the known <italic>Syngap1</italic> mouse critical period. Indeed, elevated excitatory synapse strength in developing forebrain glutamatergic neurons is a major cellular outcome present in <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygous knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clement et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clement et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaelson et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, elevated excitatory synapse strength is consistent with impaired cognitive function and reduced seizure threshold.</p><p>Studies in the <italic>Syngap1</italic>β* line also support this interpretation. These mice were devoid of SynGAP-β protein expression, yet we did not observe cellular or behavioral phenotypes consistent with <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygosity. Rather surprisingly, mice lacking SynGAP-β expression had intermediate phenotypes that opposed what was commonly observed in <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygous KO mice (and shared by IRES-TD/PBM lines). For example, β* mice exhibited improved spatial learning in the Morris water maze, reduced horizontal activity in the open field, and an elevated seizure threshold (evidence of seizure protection). These phenotypes were modest in effect size, but highly significant. These phenotypes were reproducible because open field and seizure phenotypes were also present in a separate series of experiments performed in the <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygous background. This demonstrates that the impact of the β* allele is penetrant even when expression of isoforms is reduced by half compared to WT mice. As a result, the β* allele partially rescued open field and seizure phenotypes present in <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/-. For impaired β expression to drive phenotypes, expression of this isoform would be anticorrelated with cognitive function and seizure protection. Put another way, reduced β expression would need to enhance phenotypes and increased expression of these isoforms would need to disrupt them. This outcome is unlikely given that it is inconsistent with phenotypes observed in <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/-, which have reduced expression of all isoforms, including SynGAP-β.</p><p>Phenotypes in β* mice are likely driven by significantly elevated SynGAP-α expression rather than reduced SynGAP-β. Electrophysiological studies in these mice revealed reduced excitatory neuron synaptic strength, a finding consistent with exogenously elevated SynGAP-α1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, these synapse-level results are consistent with seizure protection observed in β* mice. Phenotypes in PBM mice also support this hypothesis. This model does not have altered t-SynGAP expression, or a change in β expression. Yet, the behavioral- and synapse-level phenotypes are consistent with those observed in IRES-TD and <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/-. The observation that α isoforms promote cognitive function and seizure protection are consistent with known molecular functions of these isoforms, at least with respect to regulation of synapse strength and resultant impacts on neural circuit function. For example, α1 imparts SynGAP with the ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). This biophysical process is associated with regulation of Ras signaling in dendritic spines required for AMPA receptor trafficking that supports use-dependent synapse plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>).

Single cell transcriptomics data from adult mice indicate that <italic>Syngap1</italic> is principally expressed in glutamatergic neurons in the cortex and hippocampus rather than GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Single-cell mRNA expression data agree with experimental evidence of SynGAP protein expression in rodent neurons. For example, SynGAP protein expression is enriched in glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2003</xref>), with relatively high levels in upper lamina of isocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butko et al., 2013</xref>). Other studies show that SynGAP protein is absent from several types of forebrain GABAergic neurons, but was expressed in a subpopulation of morphologically distinct inhibitory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). Expression data agree with prior experimental observations from electrophysiological and behavioral measurements in mice where <italic>Syngap1</italic> expression was conditionally regulated in distinct neuronal subtypes.

As a result, baseline synaptic phenotypes related to <italic>Syngap1</italic> gene expression appear dominated by the ability of both α1 and α2 isoforms to suppress excitatory synapse function. Studies from several research groups have shown that SynGAP-α1 is a negative regulator of excitatory synapse structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rumbaugh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the role of α2 isoform protein function on excitatory synapse structure/function is less clear. One study suggested that α2 has an opposing function relative to α1 within excitatory synapses, with the former acting as an enhancer, rather than a suppresser, of excitatory synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>). However, a more recent study demonstrated that α2 has a similar, albeit less robust ability to suppress AMPA receptor content within dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that it too can act as a negative regulator of synapse function. Our results here support the view that both α1 and α2 can act as suppressors of excitatory synapse function. In our studies, α1 and α2 were both co-regulated in the IRES-TD and β* lines, with both isoforms downregulated in the former and upregulated in the latter. In both mouse lines, baseline excitatory synapse strength was inversely proportional to expression levels of α1/2 isoforms. If α1 and α2 had opposing functions at the synapse level, then co-regulation of both isoforms would be expected to lead to no significant differences in synapse function. As a result, we hypothesize that improvements in spatial learning and protection from seizure in β* mice arise through changes in excitatory synapse biology mediated by α isoforms. Thus, in-depth study of α isoform biology at both the cell biological and neural systems levels may reveal molecular and cellular approaches to improve cognition and mitigate uncontrolled excitability.</p><p>It is important to note that our interpretation that β* mouse phenotypes are most likely driven by changes in αisoforms does not preclude a fundamental role of β in sculpting neural systems, or that reduced expression of this isoform in <italic>Syngap1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> +/- has no role in disease pathobiology. Rather, our results highlight the importance of endogenous α isoforms in regulating excitatory synapse function and associated behavioral outcomes. What is known about the function of other C-terminal protein variants, such as β and γ? A recent study suggested that β and γ isoforms lack the ability to regulate excitatory synapse function, further strengthening the idea that α isoforms account for <italic>Syngap1</italic>-dependent regulation of excitatory synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>). However, <italic>Syngap1</italic> is known to regulate additional cellular process beyond regulation of excitatory synapse function, such as dendritic morphogenesis and patterning in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clement et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aceti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaelson et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence suggests that all isoforms can regulate dendritic morphogenesis in vitro, although SynGAP<italic>-</italic>β was shown to be a stronger regulator of this process relative to the other C-terminal isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araki et al., 2020</xref>). In vivo, β was found to be expressed earlier in development and to be less enriched in the postsynaptic density compared to other variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gou et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, β is well positioned to regulate non-synapse related neuronal processes. Future studies will be required to elucidate the specific cellular functions of non-alpha isoforms and how they contribute to the development of neural function and behavior. Given the complexities of <italic>Syngap1</italic> regulation on dendritic morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aceti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michaelson et

Cells were then subjected to negative and/or positive selection(s) before the presence of the correct recombination event was validated by PCR and Southern blot. ES cell clones with verified mutations were injected into blastocysts which were implanted into pseudo-pregnant females to obtain chimeras. Chimeric mice were bred with C57BL/6 Cre-deleter mice to excise the Neomycin selection cassette and to generate heterozygous mice carrying the Neo-excised knock-in allele. Progeny were genotyped by PCR. The recombinase-mediated excision event was further validated by Southern blot using 5’ external probes. Knock-in lines were maintained on C57BL/6 J background and bred for 3 generations prior to experimental use. <italic>Syngap1</italic> <sup>PBM</sup> animals were genotyped using the following primers, which amplified the locus spanning the LoxP site: Fwd: <named-content content-type="sequence">5’-ctggttcaaaggctcctggta-3’</named-content> Rev: <named-content content-type="sequence">5’- ctgtttgtttctcacctccaggaa-3’</named-content>.

A 200 bp PAGE purified ss-oligo repair template centering the CRISPR cut site was used as donor DNA. Recombination events were detected by PCR and Sanger sequencing of the DNA isolated from tails of F0 potential founders. This process identified 2 chimeric mice with evidence of the targeted nucleotide variants. Chimeras were then bred with C57BL6/J and resultant heterozygous F1 mice were used to start the colony.

The lysate was then centrifuged at 35,000 RPM for 30 min at 4 °C and lysate containing 1 mg of protein was incubated with 2 µg Psd95 antibody (Neuromab, catalog # 75–048) at 4 °C overnight with rotation. The following day, IPs were incubated with Dynabeads protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # 10,004D) for 2 hours at 4 °C. IPs were then washed three times with IP wash buffer (25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100). Dynabeads were re-suspended in 2 X LDS sample buffer and incubated at 95 °C for 15 min for elution. The eluate was incubated with DTT at a final concentration of 1 mM at 56 °C for 1 hr followed by a 45-min room temperature incubation with Iodoacetamide at a final concentration of 20 mM.</p><p>Samples were loaded onto 4–12% Bis-Tris gels and separated at 135 V for 1.5 hr. Gels were stained with InstantBlue (Expedeon, catalog # 1SB1L) to visualize bands. The heavy and light chains of Immunoglobulin were manually removed. Gels were then destained using 25% ethanol overnight. Gel lanes were cut, individual gel slices were placed into 96 well plates for destaining, and peptide digestion was completed at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were extracted with acetonitrile, dried down, and then desalted using stage tips. All LC-MS experiments were performed on a nanoscale UHPLC system (EASY-nLC1200, Thermo Scientific) connected to an Q Exactive Plus hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Thermo Scientific). Samples were resuspended in 10 μL of Buffer A (0.1% FA) and 2 μL were injected. Peptides were separated by a reversed-phase analytical column (PepMap RSLC C18, 2 μm, 100 Å, 75 μm X 25 cm) (Thermo Scientific). Flow rate was set to 300 nl/min at a gradient starting with 3% buffer B (0.1% FA, 80% acetonitrile) to 38% B in 110 min, then ramped to 75% B in 1 min, then ramped to 85% B over 10 min and held at 85%B for 9 min. Peptides separated by the column were ionized at 2.0 kV in the positive ion mode. MS1 survey scans for DDA were acquired at resolution of 70 k from 350 to 1800 m/z, with maximum injection time of 100ms and AGC target of 1e6. MS/MS fragmentation of the 10 most abundant ions were analyzed at a resolution of 17.5 k, AGC target 5e4, maximum injection time 65ms, and an NCE of 26. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s and ions with charge 1 and &gt;6 were excluded. The maximum pressure was set to 1180 bar and column temperature was constant at 50 °C. Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to process MS data and analyzed using Sequest HT against Uniprot mouse databases combined with its decoy database. With respect to analysis settings, the mass tolerance was set 10 parts per million for precursor ions and 0.02 daltons for fragment ions, no more than two missed cleavage sites were allowed, static modification was set as cysteine carbamidomethylation, and oxidation of methionine was set as a dynamic modification. False discovery rates (FDRs) were automatically calculated by the Percolator node of Proteome Discoverer with a peptide and protein FDR cutoff of 0.01. Label-free quantification was performed using Minora node in Proteome Discoverer. Abundances of identified PSD95 interacting proteins in WT and mutant neurons were compared using relative abundances such that proteins with a fold change in abundance ratio of &gt;2.0 or &lt; 0.5 were considered to be differentially associated to PSD95.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Hippocampal LTP and extracellular recordings</title><p>Acute transverse hippocampal slices (350 µm) were prepared using a Leica Vibroslicer (VT 1000 S), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babayan et al., 2012</xref>). Slices were cut into ice cold, high magnesium artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solution containing in mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 dextrose. Slices were then transferred to an interface recording chamber maintained at 31°C ± 1°C, oxygenated in 95% O<sub>2</sub> / 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and constantly perfused (60–80 ml/hr) with recording aCSF (in mM: 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 dextrose). Slices equilibrated in the chamber for approximately 2 hr before experimental use. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from CA1b stratum radiatum using a single glass pipette filled with 2 M NaCl (2–3 MΩ). Bipolar nicrome stimulating electrodes (65 µm diameter, A-M Systems) were positioned at two sites (CA1a and CA1c) in the apical Schaffer collateral-commissural projections to provide activation of separate converging pathways of CA1b pyramidal cells. Pulses were administered in an alternating fashion to the two electrodes at 0.05 Hz using a current that elicited a 50% maximal population spike-free response. After establishing a 10–20 min stable baseline, long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced in the experimental pathway by delivering 7 ‘theta’ bursts, with each burst consisting of four pulses at 100 Hz and the bursts themselves separated by 200 ms (i.e. theta burst stimulation or TBS). The stimulation intensity was not increased during TBS. The control pathway received baseline stimulation (0.05 Hz) to monitor the health of the slice. The fEPSP slope was measured at 10%–90% fall of the slope and all values pre- and post- TBS were normalized to mean values for the last 10 min of baseline recording. Baseline measures for all groups included paired-pulse facilitation and input/output curves. Recordings were digitized at 20 kHz using an AC amplifier (A-M Systems, Model 1700) and collected using NAC 2.0 Neurodata Acquisition System (Theta Burst Corporation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology</title><p>Acute coronal slices (350 μm) were prepared from 10 to 14 days old mice for 3 mouse lines. Ice-cold cutting solution was used for slice preparation and contained the following (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 1 NaH2PO4, 11 D-glucose and 26.3 NaHCO3, pH 7.4, 300–310 mOsm bubbled with 95%CO2 and 5%O2. The slices were then warmed to 37 °C for an hour approximately in standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), composed of (mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 24 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, and 10 D-Glucose, and equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4, ~ 300 mOsm). Following this, slices were maintained in bubbled aCSF at room temperature until transferred to a submerged-type recording chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). All experiments were performed at 32 °C ± 2 (perfusion rate of 2–3 mL/min). Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were conducted from visually identified L2/3 neurons using infrared DIC optics. L2/3 excitatory cells were identified by their soma shape and their location ~150 uM below the L1-L2 boundary. Regular spiking was confirmed in current clamp and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) were recorded from identified cells for 5 sweeps each lasting a minute, using the following internal solution (in mM): 120 CsCl, 10 K-HEPES, 10 EGTA, 5 QX314-Br, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 4 MgCl2 (pH 7.3, 290–295 mOsm). Perfusion solution aCSF was supplemented with 100 µM picrotoxin and 1 µM TTX. Cells with access resistance &gt;20 MΩ or were unstable ( &gt; 20% change) were discarded from further analysis. Recordings were made using borosilicate glass pipettes (3–6 MΩ; 0.6 mm inner diameter; 1.2 mm outer diameter; Harvard Apparatus). All signals were amplified using Multiclamp 700B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), filtered at 4 KHz, digitized (10 KHz), and stored on a personal computer for off-line analysis. Analog to digital conversion was performed using the Digidata 1,440 A system (Molecular Devices). Data acquisition and analyses were performed using pClamp 11.2software package (Clampex and Clampfit programs; Molecular Devices) and minianalysis (Synaptosoft). The events were considered mini-EPSCs if the peak of an event was &gt;5 pA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Behavior</title><p>At weaning, four mice were randomly allocated to one cage with respect to genotype with males and females being housed separately. Randomization of cage allocation was restricted in that, as much as possible, mice from the same litter were placed in different cages so that no single litter was overrepresented in any single experiment. Cages utilized for behaviors contained cardboard pyramidal-shaped huts with two square openings on opposing sides of the hut for the purposes of environmental enrichment and to assist with transfers from home cages to behavioral apparatuses. All mice were handled for several minutes on three consecutive days prior to commencement of behavioral testing. Tails were marked for easy identification and access from home cages during testing. Experimenters were blind to mouse genotype while conducting all tests.</p><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>Flurothyl-induced seizures</title><p>Flurothyl-induced seizure studies were performed based on prior studies with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozkan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clement et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dravid et al., 2007</xref>). Briefly, experiments were conducted in a chemical fume hood. Mice were brought to the experimental area at least 1 hr before testing. To elicit seizures, individual mice were placed in a closed 2.4 L Plexiglas chamber and exposed to 99% Bis (2,2,2-triflurothyl) ether (Catalog# 287571, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The flurothyl compound was infused onto a filter paper pad, suspended at the top of the Plexiglas chamber through a 16 G hypodermic needle and tube connected to a 1 ml BD glass syringe fixed to an infusion pump (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA, Model: 780101) at a rate of 0.25 ml/min. The infusion was terminated after the onset of a hind limb extension that usually resulted in death. Cervical dislocation was performed subsequently to ensure death of the animal. Seizure threshold was measured as latency (s) from the beginning of the flurothyl infusion to the beginning of the first myoclonic jerk.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-2"><title>Morris water maze</title><p>Mice were run in a standard comprehensive Morris water maze paradigm including a cue test with a visual platform and an acquisition protocol with a hidden platform. All phases of the paradigm were run in a dedicated water maze room in the Scripps Florida Mouse Behavior Core. A water maze system including a plastic white opaque pool (Cat# ENV-594M-W, Med Associates), measuring ~122 cm diameter at the water surface, supported by a stand (ENV-593M-C) and equipped with a floor insert (ENV-595M-FL) covering a submerged heater was utilized for all water maze experimentation. An adjustable textured platform (17.8 cm diameter, ENV-596M) was placed atop the floor insert in one of two different quadrants, depending on the specific phase of the paradigm (NW quadrant for initial training and probe test and SE quadrant for reversal training and probe tests), for mice to escape the water. Water temperatures were controlled to 22.5°C ± 0.5 °C using a built-in heater and monitored with a digital temperature probe. This water temperature motivated the mice to escape the water without eliciting hypothermic conditions. The tank was emptied, cleaned and refilled once every three days to avoid unsafe accumulation of bacteria. Water was made opaque by the addition of a white opaque non-toxic paint (Crayola) forcing mice to utilize extra-maze cues when locating the hidden platform (0.5 cm beneath the surface of the water). These spatial cues (large black cardboard circle, star, square, white X on black background) were placed on the walls of the room at different distances from the pool. The pool edge was demarcated with directional units (W, N, E, S) to aid assignment of invisible platform ‘quadrants’ to the pool arena outlined by the video tracking system. Various strip lights were positioned on the walls near the ceiling to allow for a moderate level of lighting (200 lux), enough for the mice to see the extra-maze cues adequately without eliciting undue anxiety. Thirty minutes prior to commencement of daily trials, the lights and heater were turned on, and mouse home cages were placed on heating pads on a rack in the water maze room to provide a warm place for the mice between trials. Cage nestlets were replaced with strips of paper towels to better facilitate drying after trials. Mice were monitored during trials for signs of distress and swimming competence. None of the mice tested had swimming issues, and floating was discouraged with gentle nudges. Mice received four trials per day during cue and acquisition phases and one trial per day for probe trials. Three cages (12 mice) were run at a time such that ITIs for each day lasted about 20 min with trial duration lasting until the mouse found the platform or a maximum of 60 s. Each trial commenced when the mouse was automatically detected in the pool by the tracking system (Ethovision, Noldus). Each mouse was lowered into the pool facing its edge at one of the four directional units (W, N, E, S) in a clockwise manner, with the first of the four trials starting closest to the platform (‘NW quadrant’), which was positioned in the central area of the quadrant dictated by the tracking system. This same series of daily trial commencements were followed for all mice for each of the cue tests, acquisition protocol, and reversal protocol. If the mouse did not locate the platform in 60 s, the experimenter’s hand guided them to the platform. Because the mice are eager to escape the water, the mice quickly learned to follow hand direction to the platform, minimizing physical manipulation of the animals during the trials. Mice were allowed 15 s on the platform at the end of each trial before being picked up, dried with absorbent wipes, and placed back into their warmed home cage.</p><p>On the first day of testing, mice were given a cue test with the platform positioned just above the surface of the water and a metal blue flag placed upon it for easy visual location of the platform. This test allows for detection of individual visual and swimming-related motor deficits and allows the mice to habituate to the task (climbing on the platform to escape the water). The platform was placed in a different location for each of the four trials with spatial cues removed by encirclement of the pool with a white plastic curtain.</p><p>On the next day, acquisition trials began with the hidden platform remaining in the same location (“NW quadrant”) for all trials/days and the curtain drawn back for visibility of the spatial cues. Several measures (distances to platform) and criteria to reach the platform (approximately 90% success rate, approximately 20 s latency to find platform) during the acquisition phases were recorded and achieved before mice were deemed to have learned the task. The performances of the four trials were averaged for each animal per day until criteria were met.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-3"><title>Open-field test</title><p>Naive mice were individually introduced into one of eight adjacent open-field arenas for 30 min and allowed to explore. Open field arenas consisted of custom made clear acrylic boxes (43 × 43 × 32 h cm) with opaque white acrylic siding surrounding each box 45 × 45 × 21.5 h cm to prevent distractions from activities in adjacent boxes. Activity was monitored with two CCTV cameras (Panasonic WV-BP334) feeding into a computer equipped with Ethovision XT 11.5 for data acquisition and analyses. A white noise generator (2325–0144, San Diego Instruments) was set at 65 dB to mask external noises and provide a constant noise level. Fluorescent linear strip lights placed on each of the four walls of the behavioral room adjacent to the ceiling provided a lower lighting (200 lux) environment than ceiling lighting to encourage exploration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-4"><title>Contextual fear conditioning</title><p>A dedicated fear conditioning room in the TSRI Florida Mouse Behavior Core contains four fear conditioning devices that can be used in parallel. Each apparatus was an acrylic chamber measuring approximately 30 × 30 cm (modified Phenotyper chambers, Noldus, Leesburg, VA). The top of the chamber is covered with a unit that includes a camera and infrared lighting arrays (Noldus, Ethovision XT 11.5, Leesburg, VA) for monitoring of the mice. The bottom of the chamber is a grid floor that receives an electric shock from a shock scrambler that is calibrated to 0.40 mA prior to experiments. The front of the chamber has a sliding door that allows for easy access to the mouse. The chamber is enclosed in a sound-attenuating cubicle (Med Associates) equipped with a small fan for ventilation. Black circular, rectangular and white/black diagonal patterned cues were placed outside each chamber on the inside walls of the cubicles for contextual enhancement. A strip light attached to the ceilings of the cubicles provided illumination. A white noise generator (~65 dB) was turned on and faced toward the corner of the room between the cubicles. The fear conditioning paradigm consisted of two phases, training, followed by testing 1 and 26, or 30 d thereafter. The 4.5 min training phase consisted of 2.5 min of uninterrupted exploration. Two shocks (0.40 mA, 2 s) were delivered, one at 2 min 28 s, the other at 3 min and 28 s from the beginning of the trial. During testing, mice were placed into their designated chambers and allowed to roam freely for 5 min. Immobility durations (s) and activity (distances moved (cm)) during training and testing were obtained automatically from videos generated by Ethovision software. Activity suppression ratio levels were calculated: 0–2 min activity during testing/0–2 min activity during training +testing.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Methodology, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;SynGAP C-terminal splicing enables isoform-specific tuning of NMDA receptor signaling linked to cognitive function&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shigeo Okabe (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although the reviewers find your manuscript novel and comprehensive, they think that additional experiments are required to fully support the main conclusions. We realize that the current corona situation makes it very difficult to perform additional experiments in the near future. However, if you decide to address the review comments with additional experiments when able, we are willing to consider a resubmission of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study reports the role of the PBM (PDZ-binding motif) of SynGAP in the regulation of synaptic structure, signaling, and transmission. Moreover, this study shows that the SynGAP PBM is important for setting the threshold for the dispersal of SynGAP induced by NMDAR activation. In addition, the deletion of PBM suppresses STP and LTP and impairs spatial learning, contextual fear memory, spontaneous alteration without affecting anxiety-related behavior.</p><p>SynGAP is known to interact with PSD-95 in the postsynaptic density (PSD), but the function of this interaction has remained unclear. This study addresses this question using a mouse genetic approach and various in vitro and in vivo experiments. In addition, the results are of high quality and largely convincing. I think this is an important contribution to the understanding of SynGAP functions as well as the roles of the PBMs and their interactions with synaptic PDZ proteins.</p><p>1. The deletion of the SynGAP PBM leads to suppressed STP and LTP. I am wondering whether LTD and mGluR-LTD are also impacted because LTP and LTD are known to interfere with each other, and altered synaptic signaling might also affect LTD and mGluR-LTD, which may also affect neuronal functions.</p><p>2. The roles of the SynGAP PBM on unitary functions of excitatory synapses remain largely unclear, which can easily be addressed by measuring mEPSCs at mutant hippocampal synapses. The increased spine diameter and surface GluA1 levels in Figure 2A suggests this possibility.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Kilinc et al. investigate the function of the SynGAP1 PDZ-binding motif, present in the α1 isoform, by characterizing a novel mouse model with PBM inactivating mutations. As expected, the PBM mutations in SynGAP1 abolish its interaction with PSD-95, whilst maintaining wild-type levels of the protein. Neurons from Syngap1PBM/PBM mice have reduced SynGAP1 content in dendritic spines and in PSD fractions and exhibit a range of synaptic and excitability phenotypes strikingly reminiscent of neurons from Syngap1 knockout mice. Interestingly, many of the synaptic phenotypes are rescued by NMDA receptor blockade, suggesting that NMDAR-dependent signalling causes part of the dysfunction in these neurons. In addition to altering PSD composition, neurons with the mutant SynGAP1 isoforms have altered LTP and are proposed to have a reduced threshold for NMDAR-dependent signalling. Together these phenotypes cause deficits in behaviours affecting learning and memory, similar to full Syngap1 knockouts, revealing the importance of the PBM in cognitive function.</p><p>This manuscript is very well written and logically presented, addressing fundamental questions about SYNGAP1, a critically important gene in human neurodevelopment disorders and synaptic structure and function. However, despite the clear synaptic and behavioural phenotypes in the mouse model, it is still somewhat unclear how dysfunction of the α1 isoform causes these disturbances. If further experiments can solidify the proposed this mechanism, I would highly recommend this work for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) One of the central posits in this manuscript is that mutation of the PBM causes increased Syngap1 mobility and lowers the threshold for NMDA receptor-dependent signalling. However, the evidence for this appears to be insufficient, relying mostly on a single experiment (Figure 3D-J). Further work to bolster these results would be highly valuable, given that discovering the function of the PBM is one of central the aims of this paper.</p><p>- The increased SynGAP1 mobility in PBM deficient neurons and after wcLTP is suggested by a reduced abundance in the PSD fraction, but this is an indirect measure. Other experiments should be designed to conclusively show this. For instance, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) can be used to directly measure the mobility of GFP-tagged proteins in dendritic spines. Alternatively, the wcLTP protocol could be used in cultured neurons to measure the dispersion of syngap1 out of dendritic spines or PSD95 puncta by immunostaining, similar to Figure 2 Supplement 1A-B. This experiment may even be improved by using α1-specific antibody for immunostaining if this is possible.</p><p>- The experiments showing that PBM mutations lowers the threshold for NMDA receptor-dependent signalling should also be strengthened. Can these experiments be replicated with a different NMDA-dependent stimulus? Does 10uM glycine have a functional effect on PBM mutant neurons? I.e. Is there a change in spine size, surface GluA1 levels or electrophysiological properties?</p><p>2) It is difficult to appreciate how important the α1 isoform is without knowing how abundant it is compared to other isoforms in the brain. Can the authors show the relative expression of each isoform at the mRNA and/or protein level?</p><p>3) The mobility of the SynGAP1 protein appears to be a critical to its function. However, a comprehensive discussion on why SynGAP1 localization is altered after NMDAR activation, and how defects in this process leads to the observed synaptic phenotypes is lacking in the discussion. In addition, how does the movement of SynGAP1 out of the PSD affect downstream GTPase signalling? What is the proposed mechanism for how the blockade of NMDA receptors rescues the localization and synaptic phenotypes in neurons from Syngap1PBM/PBM mice? All of these themes are brought up in the paper but are not sufficiently discussed and detailed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Kilinc et al. reports the plasticity-related function of SynGAP C-terminal domain in SynGAP alpha1 isoform by generating a genetically modified mouse line containing critical point mutations in the exon 21b, which disrupt the interaction between SynGAP alpha1 isoform and PSD-95. The specific alterations in the C-terminal domain induced impairment of LTP in the hippocampus and also memory-related tasks. Experiments in cultured neurons provided additional cell biological insights into the regulation of synaptic plasticity by the SynGAP alpha1 C-terminal domain. This reviewer positively evaluates the authors' findings that link the specific splice variant of SynGAP to synaptic function and memory-related circuit function. However, several points should be corrected and improved in a future manuscript.</p><p>1. The authors found increased sensitivity to weak glycine-dependent NMDAR activation in PBM/PBM neurons, which resulted in the phosphorylation of GluA1. This finding is seemingly inconsistent with the slice electrophysiology data of reduced short-term and long-term potentiation. To link these two experiments, it will be helpful to check the response of acute slices to weak stimulation (weak stimulation can induce more responses in PBM/PBM slices?) and also evaluate the level of SynGAP in PSD fraction after strong glycine-dependent NMDAR activation (less GluA1 phosphorylation in PBM/PBM neurons in culture?).</p><p>2. The underlying hypothesis of using strong and weak cLTP induction is that the difference in glycine concentration induces a different level of increase in AMPAR surface expression in culture. The validity of this hypothesis is not tested in this manuscript.

The first mutant mouse (IRES-TD mouse) with insertion of IRES-TDtomato cassette in the last exon (exon21) showed elevated open field activity, reduced time in the induction of seizure by flurothyl, less freezing behavior in remote contextual fear memory recall, and increase in frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in L2/3 somatosensory neurons. In addition, IRES-TD mice showed a reduction in total SynGAP protein, alpha1, and alpha2 isoforms and increased β isoform in the forebrain. The second mutant mouse (β* mouse) with a mutation in the early splice acceptor of exon19 showed a slight reduction in open field activity, increase in time for seizure induction, no change in freezing behavior in remote contextual memory recall, and decrease in frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in L2/3 somatosensory neurons. Β* mice showed no change in total SynGAP protein, a modest increase in alpha2, and a reduction in β in the forebrain. The third mutant mouse (PBM mouse) has point mutations in exon21 for disrupting the function of the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) of SynGAP to interact with PSD95. This mutant showed elevated open field activity, reduced time in the induction of seizure, less freezing behavior in remote contextual memory recall, and increased frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in L2/3 somatosensory neurons. PBM mice showed no change in total SynGAP, alpha2, and β proteins but reduced immunoblot signal of alpha1 in the forebrain. This reduced immunoblot signal was proposed to be related to less sensitivity of the alpha1 specific antibody to the mutated isoform. By thorough behavioral and physiological analyses of three independent mutant mouse lines, the authors conclude that the level of α isoforms, rather than the total SynGAP, is critical in several neural circuit functions related to cognition and seizure protections. Previous studies revealed multiple roles of SynGAP in neural circuit development and activity-dependent regulations. This new study provides important information about the isoform-specific functions of SynGAP, especially the critical role of α isoform content for proper synapse and circuit activity.</p><p>The results obtained from multiple mutant mouse lines support the key claims of the paper.

The phenotypic similarity between IRES-TD mice and PBM mutant mice suggests critical roles of α isoforms in multiple behavioral phenotypes. However, the effect of PBM mutant still needs to be carefully evaluated. If alpha1 is the only isoform expressed in the brain, the interpretation of introducing PSD95-nonbinding mutant is straightforward, but in the presence of other isoforms, dominant-negative effects of PBM mutant should be considered. It is possible that PBM mutant complexed with different isoforms impair localization or function of other isoforms, leading to an effect similar to the reduction of total SynGAP protein. Clarification of this point by additional experimental data is necessary. For example, in Figure 6A, did the PSD fraction from the PBM mutant contain a similar amount of alpha2 and β isoforms? Also, in Figure 7, native PSD95 complexes from Syngap1PBM mutants were characterized. In the PSD95 complexes, was the amount of other SynGAP isoforms unchanged?</p><p>3. The authors selected remote contextual fear conditioning coupled with protein analysis in the forebrain. This selection may be based on the motivation of finding deficits in forebrain-related long-lasting memory in mutant mice.

The deletion of the SynGAP PBM leads to suppressed STP and LTP.

Many labs, including ours, find that SynGAP is required for input specific LTP but not LTD (the one exception is mGLUR-dependent LTD in hippocampal synapses, though this is chemically induced).

As expected, the PBM mutations in SynGAP1 abolish its interaction with PSD-95, whilst maintaining wild-type levels of the protein. Neurons from Syngap1PBM/PBM mice have reduced SynGAP1 content in dendritic spines and in PSD fractions and exhibit a range of synaptic and excitability phenotypes strikingly reminiscent of neurons from Syngap1 knockout mice. Interestingly, many of the synaptic phenotypes are rescued by NMDA receptor blockade, suggesting that NMDAR-dependent signalling causes part of the dysfunction in these neurons. In addition to altering PSD composition, neurons with the mutant SynGAP1 isoforms have altered LTP and are proposed to have a reduced threshold for NMDAR-dependent signalling. Together these phenotypes cause deficits in behaviours affecting learning and memory, similar to full Syngap1 knockouts, revealing the importance of the PBM in cognitive function.</p><p>This manuscript is very well written and logically presented, addressing fundamental questions about SYNGAP1, a critically important gene in human neurodevelopment disorders and synaptic structure and function. However, despite the clear synaptic and behavioural phenotypes in the mouse model, it is still somewhat unclear how dysfunction of the α1 isoform causes these disturbances. If further experiments can solidify the proposed this mechanism, I would highly recommend this work for publication in eLife.</p><p>1) One of the central posits in this manuscript is that mutation of the PBM causes increased Syngap1 mobility and lowers the threshold for NMDA receptor-dependent signalling. However, the evidence for this appears to be insufficient, relying mostly on a single experiment (Figure 3D-J). Further work to bolster these results would be highly valuable, given that discovering the function of the PBM is one of central the aims of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The new focus of the manuscript is to determine if and how endogenous SynGAP isoforms contribute to synaptic and behavioral impairments rather than how the PBM specifically regulates SynGAP functions. The new focus is now possible given the existence of two new mouse lines that inversely regulate α and β isoforms. We find that endogenous α isoforms bidirectionally regulate synapse function and behavior, and loss of their expression can account for many phenotypes present in Syngap1 mouse models. Indeed, genetically increasing expression of α isoforms can rescue intermediate phenotypes expressed in Syngap1 heterozygous mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is difficult to appreciate how important the α1 isoform is without knowing how abundant it is compared to other isoforms in the brain.

Our data support the view that these isoforms are relatively equally expressed.

However, a comprehensive discussion on why SynGAP1 localization is altered after NMDAR activation, and how defects in this process leads to the observed synaptic phenotypes is lacking in the discussion. In addition, how does the movement of SynGAP1 out of the PSD affect downstream GTPase signalling? What is the proposed mechanism for how the blockade of NMDA receptors rescues the localization and synaptic phenotypes in neurons from Syngap1PBM/PBM mice?

To account for differences in epitope to antibody affinity, true absolute quantification of different isoform would require mass spectrometry-based approach such as SureQuant. A recent publication (Araki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020) carefully assessed expression of SynGAP isoforms in multiple brain regions in wild-type mice. Using custom antibodies, the authors probed for individual isoforms across development and estimated that SynGAP-α1 constitutes 35.0 ± 0.9% of total SynGAP in adult forebrain (SynGAP-α2, 44.9 ± 1.5%; SynGAP-β, 15.7 ± 0.8%; SynGAP-γ, 4.3 ± 0.3%).</p><p>Our internal data is consistent with these published findings, which also suggest that SynGAP-α1 and SynGAP-α2 are the most abundant in adult forebrain.

Clarification of this point by additional experimental data is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised Results section for Figure 6, we include new data that addresses the concern of heterodimerization of SynGAP isoforms and possible dominant negative effects of a1 isoforms with PBM mutations. These new data can be found in two places: (1) new panels in Figure 6; (2) a new supplemental figure (Figure 6 – supplement).</p><p>First, we include additional panels in Figure 6 that include isoform-specific expression in the PSDs of WT and PBM mice. These new data demonstrate that there is no change in relative abundance of a2 and b isoforms in the PSDs from whole hippocampus taken from PBM mice. The original figure only included PSD levels using a pan-SynGAP antibody. The original data indicated that there was less total SynGAP (using a pan-isoform antibody) in the PSD from PBM mouse hippocampi. The newly included panels extend these results by including isoform abundance data (revised Figure 6A – two additional panels). These new data indicate that the reduction in total SynGAP PSD levels is driven by reduced a1 levels because a2 and b abundance did not change in these same samples (and trended toward an increase). While we did not blot for g isoforms, it is very low expressed relative to the others (see point 1 above), indicating that changes to this isoform would not be sufficient to drive the reduction in total SynGAP from PSDs. We did not blot for a1 directly in these experiments because the mutated PBM reduces affinity for a1 antibodies. These data suggest that a1 may act independently from the other C-terminal variants in the PSD.</p><p>Experiments in Supplemental Figure 6 were designed to more directly address the possibility that mutated a1 in PBM mice influenced other isoforms in the PSD, perhaps through hetero-multimerization of SynGAP isoforms. This experiment was also designed to mitigate reduced a1-antibody affinity caused by PBM mutations. We performed weak and strong chemical LTP (cLTP) paradigms in cultured primary neurons from WT and PBM mice. Strong cLTP drives extrusion of total SynGAP (measured with pan-antibody) from the PSD(Figure S6A), which accompanies increases in synapse signaling and insertion of AMPARs (Araki et al., 2020). However, we found that weak cLTP does not extrude SynGAP (Figure S6B), which is consistent with past studies (Araki et al., 2020). In contrast, weak cLTP stimulations were capable of driving reduction in total SynGAP from PSDs in PBM mice. Blotting with isoform-specific antibodies in the weak cLTP studies provided insight into the differential behavior of total SynGAP in PSDs from WT mice compared to PBM mice. To arrive at these measurements, we compared relative expression of SynGAP proteins in the PSD in control and weak cLTP conditions within different wells of the same cultured neuron plates (either WT or PBM mice). Thus, the reduced affinity of a1 antibodies in this experiment is not an issue. In WT neurons, weak cLTP was sufficient to drive reduced PSD abundance for both a2 and b isoforms. However, a1 expression was unchanged, demonstrating that this isoform exhibits distinct behavior within biochemical fractions in response to synaptic NMDAR activation. Replicating this approach in PBM neurons revealed that the distinct biochemical behavior of a1 relative to the other isoforms was due to the existence of an intact PBM motif. Indeed, disrupting the PBM resulted in a1 behaving similar to the other isoforms during weak cLTP. As a result, these data suggest that the reduction in total SynGAP in WT PSDs that occurs in response to strong cLTP can be explained through dynamics of a1. A reasonable biochemical explanation for this difference can be attributed to decreased potential mobility of a1 homomers due to increased basal affinity for binding partners with PDZ domains. Presumably, this reduced basal affinity for binding partners in the PSD is lost because of PBM mutagenesis. Thus, PBM mutagenesis removes a unique biochemical property a1 isoforms, which has functional consequences for neuronal function and behavior (Figures 6, 8, and 9). Moreover, the significant reduction in a2 and b in WT PSDs after weak cLTP does not drive changes in total SynGAP levels likely because a1 is substantially enriched in the PSD relative to the other isoforms (Gou et al., 2020).</p><p>Together, these data add substantially to our understanding of how different SynGAP isoforms behave in the PSD in response to NMDAR signaling. This is evidence supporting the idea that SynGAP C-terminal isoforms can behave independently of each within the PSD in response to NMDAR activation. These new data suggest that mutant a1 is not acting as a dominant negative through sequestering the other isoforms. Rather, it suggests that a1 is largely in complex with itself within the PSD and responds differently to NMDAR activation compared to the other isoforms. Further work will be required to fully establish the nature and composition of SynGAP isoform complexes and how they respond to biological stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 9A-C. The sample size (n = 8) for mEPSC measurements in the PBM/PBM mice seems small to draw a safe conclusion, and thus should be increased, or the authors should explicitly state the limits associated with interpretation of this sample size.</p></disp-quote><p>Collectively, our data demonstrate that PBM mutations drive a form of <italic>Syngap1</italic> loss-of-function. Analysis of <italic>m</italic>EPSCs from various cortical and hippocampal excitatory neurons with reduced <italic>Syngap1</italic> gene expression demonstrate increased excitatory synapse strength, particularly in development. Thus, increased excitatory synapse strength in developing cortical neurons with a disrupted a1 PBM is generally consistent with <italic>Syngap1</italic> loss of function. N=8 is on the low side for mEPSC analysis but not critically low, and the results obtained in this experiment in PBM mice (Figure 9) are consistent with increased AMPAR dendritic spine surface expression and reduced synapse and PSD expression of SynGAP protein in neurons from the same mouse line (Figure 6). In the revised Results section for Figure 9, we include a cautionary note that the sample size for this ePhys experiment is on the low side.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is unclear why the authors selected Morris water maze as the second behavioral test, which is not designed to evaluate long-lasting memory. The rationale behind selecting two distinct memory-related behavioral tests, remote contextual memory test and water maze-based training performance, should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We included these two paradigms in order to assess learning and memory mechanisms known to be sensitive to <italic>Syngap1</italic> gene function. MWM learning results from plasticity in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex driven by new associations connecting location of the hidden platforms to visual cues surrounding the maze. Learning can be evaluated through assessment of the acquisition curves. Memory can be independently evaluated from learning through inclusion of a probe test. <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygous null mice exhibit deficits in MWM acquisition (i.e., poor spatial learning), which has been affirmed in three past studies from three different groups using three distinct strains of <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygous null mice (Komiyama et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2003; Muhia et al., 2010). In each of these past studies, there was no impact of <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygosity on the probe test, demonstrating no “spatial memory deficits” in this strain. Thus, MWM acquisition (i.e., spatial learning) is highly sensitive to <italic>Syngap1</italic> expression, which means that this paradigm can be used to assess how <italic>Syngap1</italic> gene function impacts hippocampal/cortical-associated learning mechanisms.</p><p>In contrast, remote contextual memory (RCM) in <italic>Syngap1</italic> mice is a test of long-term memory rather than learning. This paradigm drives a learned association between the training context and an aversive footshock. Retrieval of the memory is tested 30 days after training – the “remote period”. During this 30-day period, information originally encoded in the hippocampus and amygdala is slowly integrated into cortical circuits for long-term storage. Past studies in <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygous null mice have repeatedly shown that there is no phenotype 1 day after training (<italic>regular long-term memory</italic>; Guo et al., 2008; Muhia et al., 2010; Creson et al., 2019), but phenotypes emerge selectively when memory is retrieved 30 days later (<italic>remote memory</italic>; Creson et al., 2019). Thus, this task can reveal how <italic>Syngap1</italic> gene function contributes to long-term memory mechanisms resulting from systems consolidation mechanisms. As a result, by including these two behavioral paradigms, we were able to broaden our survey of how individual isoforms impact both learning and memory mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The phenotype in the Morris water maze is difficult to interpret. SynGAP heterozygote mice show impairment, but IRES-TD mice showed no change. This is inconsistent with other behavioral tests. Β* mice showed improvement in the training session, but the 24 h probe test did not show a difference. It is difficult to connect the data with the result of contextual fear memory. This point should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>IRES-TD mice run in the MWM were heterozygous for the targeted allele. Thus, they only had ~50% reduction of a1/2 isoforms and ~0-25% reduction in total SynGAP protein (Figures 2 and 2S). This drove some phenotypes but others were unaffected (such as MWM). This suggests that MWM is sensitive to loss of total SynGAP protein. We could not test Td/Td mice because they died shortly after weaning, but we suspect based on the totality of all the data in the three lines (and <italic>Syngap1</italic> het nulls), MWM would be affected in Td/Td mice if we were able to test them. b* mice do show improved acquisition rates but no change in the probe test, which is consistent with improved (faster acquisition of) spatial learning but normal memory. We hypothesize that this may be due to increase in a1/a2 expression in these mice. It is conceivable that improvements in spatial learning are sensitive modest increases in α isoform expression, even though modest decreases in the same isoforms do not drive impairments. This is quite an exciting result because a1 expression could serve as a platform for understanding molecular and cellular mechanisms that improve cognitive functions in the forebrain. Indeed, we are currently planning a new project that will directly test this hypothesis – we are creating a series of conditional, inducible SynGAP-isoform mice that can be crossed to <italic>Syngap1</italic> Het null mice. These planned studies are beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>Regarding RCM, as mentioned above in Point #4, this paradigm drives unique forms of learning and memory and therefore may have different sensitivities to <italic>Syngap1</italic> isoform expression relative to MWM. As a result, it is reasonable for distinct <italic>Syngap1</italic> lines to have different learning/memory phenotypes. These differences suggest that SynGAP isoforms function in different cell types across the forebrain to support various neural mechanisms for learning/memory.</p><p>Aspects of Point#5 are now included in the revised Results section for Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. While Synap1 is expressed mainly in excitatory neurons, it would be useful if the authors included some single-cell transcriptomic data from the literature and public databases (like Allen Brain Atlas) and discussion on the relative distribution of Syngap1 in neuronal cell types in the cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We spent considerable time mining the Allen Brain single cell sequencing data for <italic>Syngap1</italic>. These efforts led to a new figure (Figure 10) in the revised manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we discussed these new data in the context of prior studies that addressed SynGAP expression/function in excitatory versus inhibitory neurons. Briefly, we found that <italic>Syngap1</italic> expression is several-fold higher, on average, in glutamatergic versus GABAeric neurons in cortex + hippocampus mouse data sets. There was even less transcript detected in non-neuronal cells. Within the glutamatergic populations, the highest expression was in more superficial cortical neurons (L5a, L4, L2/3 IT neurons). There was slightly less expression in large output channel neurons, such as L5 PT neurons and CA1 neurons. These scRNA-seq data agree with experimental evidence of SynGAP protein expression in rodent neurons. Roger Tsien’s group reported that SynGAP protein expression was enriched in upper lamina of cortex and this pattern was consistent with high protein levels in excitatory synapses. Mary Kennedy’s group demonstrated that SynGAP protein was absent in several types of GABAergic neurons, but was expressed in a subpopulation of morphologically distinct inhibitory neurons. The scRNA-seq data also agree with prior experimental observations from electrophysiological and behavioral measurements in mice. Commonly observed and robust phenotypes observed in conventional <italic>Syngap1</italic> null mice were phenocopied in mice where <italic>Syngap1</italic> null heterozygosity was restricted to excitatory neurons in the forebrain (EMX1 population; Ozkan et al., 2014). Moreover, major electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes in <italic>Syngap1</italic> heterozygous mice were rescued when <italic>gene</italic> expression was restored in in the EMX1 population (Ozkan et al., 2014). In contrast, our group observed minor phenotypes in mice when <italic>Syngap1</italic> expression was disrupted in GABAergic neurons (GAD2 population; Ozkan et al., 2014). Another group found similar results. In that study, most <italic>Syngap1</italic> Heterozygous null mouse phenotypes were insensitive to selective disruption in a GABAergic neuron population, though one behavioral measure of cognition was mildly affected (Berryer et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Syngap1 is a GAP for both Ras and Rap GTPases, which have opposite effects on dendrites and synapses. The authors assessed Ras activity through p-ERK/ERK Western blots. It would be useful if they also blot with P-BRaf/BRaf to assess Rap activity. Knowing their relative activity would help further interpret the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and agree that these experiments would be enlightening. However, we believe that this level of analysis is beyond the scope of the present study. We have ongoing projects in the lab that are exploring potential dichotomy of SynGAP function on synapses and dendritic morphogenesis, with the hypothesis that SynGAP may regulate distinct GTPases within sub-cellular compartments to drive differential effects on synapses relative to dendrites. This study extends to different types of glutamatergic neurons (distinct lamina and brain areas in vivo). The potential differences in SynGAP function across distinct sub-cellular regions could be enabled through alternatively spliced sequences. As a result, we do plan on performing these experiments, but they would be part of new study to be disclosed in a future manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.
