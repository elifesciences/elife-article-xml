within red blood cells. De novo phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis via the Kennedy pathway is essential, requiring choline that is primarily sourced from host serum lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). LysoPC also acts as an environmental sensor to regulate parasite sexual differentiation. Despite these critical roles for host lysoPC, the enzyme(s) involved in its breakdown to free choline for PC synthesis are unknown. Here, we show that a parasite glycerophosphodiesterase (PfGDPD) is indispensable for blood stage parasite proliferation. Exogenous choline rescues growth of PfGDPD-null parasites, directly linking PfGDPD function to choline incorporation. Genetic ablation of PfGDPD reduces choline uptake from lysoPC, resulting in depletion of several PC species in the parasite, whilst purified PfGDPD releases choline from glycerophosphocholine in vitro. Our results identify PfGDPD as a choline-releasing glycerophosphodiesterase that mediates a critical step in PC biosynthesis and parasite survival.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria kills over half a million people every year worldwide. A single-celled parasite called <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for the most lethal form of the disease. This malaria-causing agent is carried by mosquitos which transmit the parasite to humans through their bite. Once in the bloodstream, the parasite enters red blood cells and starts to replicate so it can go on to infect other cells<bold>.</bold></p><p>Like our cells, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is surrounded by a membrane, and further membranes surround a number of its internal compartments. To make these protective coats, the parasite has to gather a nutrient called choline to form an important building block in the membrane.</p><p>The parasite gets most of its choline by absorbing and digesting a molecule known as lysoPC found in the bloodstream of its host. However, it was unclear precisely how the parasite achieves this. To address this question, Ramaprasad, Burda et al. used genetic and metabolomic approaches to study how <italic>P. falciparum</italic> breaks down lysoPC.</p><p>The experiments found that mutant parasites that are unable to make an enzyme called GDPD were able to infect red blood cells, but failed to grow properly once inside the cells. The mutant parasites took up less choline and, as a result, also made fewer membrane building blocks. The team were able to rescue the mutant parasites by supplying them with large quantities of choline, which allowed them to resume growing. Taken together, the findings of Ramaprasad, Burda et al. suggest that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> uses GDPD to extract choline from lysoPC when it is living in red blood cells.</p><p>More and more <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites are becoming resistant to many of the drugs currently being used to treat malaria. One solution is to develop new therapies that target different molecules in the parasite. Since it performs such a vital role, GDPD may have the potential to be a future drug target.</p></abstract><kwd-group

During its massive intraerythrocytic growth, the parasite produces de novo large amounts of membrane to support expansion of its parasite plasma membrane (PPM), the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) and other membranous structures of the growing parasite, as well as for formation of daughter merozoites. This extensive membrane neogenesis, which culminates in a sixfold increase in the phospholipid content of the infected RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wein et al., 2018</xref>), requires an intense phase of phospholipid synthesis during the metabolically active trophozoite and schizont stages of the parasite life cycle.</p><p>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant membrane lipid in the malaria parasite, comprising 30–40% of total phospholipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Botté et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gulati et al., 2015</xref>), and the parasite has evolved to produce this vital phospholipid via multiple enzymatic pathways from a variety of metabolic precursors from the host milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kilian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Under normal conditions, ∼89% of PC is synthesized from free choline and fatty acids via the CDP-choline-dependent Kennedy pathway that is common among eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wein et al., 2018</xref>). Choline is phosphorylated to phosphocholine (P-Cho) by choline kinase (CK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ancelin and Vial, 1986b</xref>), then converted to CDP-choline by a CTP:phosphocholine cytidyltransferase (CCT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ancelin and Vial, 1989</xref>) and finally condensed with diacylglycerol (DAG) by a choline/ethanolamine-phosphotransferase (CEPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vial et al., 1984</xref>) to produce PC. PC is also generated via an alternate serine-decarboxylase-phosphoethanolamine-methyltransferase (SDPM) pathway also found in plants and nematodes, that uses host serine and ethanolamine (Eth) as precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pessi et al., 2004</xref>). In this case, precursor P-Cho for the CDP-choline pathway is produced by triple methylation of phosphoethanolamine (P-Eth) by a phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase (PMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Witola et al., 2008</xref>). Phosphoethanolamine is in turn generated from ethanolamine sourced either from the serum or converted from serine by an unidentified parasite serine decarboxylase. Unlike yeast and mammals, the malaria parasite is unable to convert PE directly to PC through phospholipid methyl transferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Witola et al., 2008</xref>), so the Kennedy and SDPM pathways intersect only at the point of PMT activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). PC can also be potentially produced by direct acylation of lysoPC via the Lands’ cycle by an unknown lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT). However, this pathway is considered to not contribute significantly to PC synthesis under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wein et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis in malaria parasites.</title><p>The CDP-choline dependent Kennedy pathway, the SDPM pathway and Lands’ cycle produce PC from the metabolic precursors lysoPC, choline (Cho), ethanolamine (Eth), serine (Ser, including that obtained from digestion of haemoglobin, Hb), and fatty acids, all salvaged from the host milieu. PC is primarily produced through the Kennedy pathway using Cho sourced mainly from serum lysoPC. Breakdown of lysoPC into choline is thought to occur in the parasitophorous vacuole via a two-step hydrolysis process involving an unidentified lysophospholipase (LPL) and a glycerophosphodiesterase (GDPD; PF3D7_1406300) (this work).

Choline analogs have potent antimalarial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ancelin et al., 2003</xref>), whilst inhibiting or disrupting enzymes in the PC synthesis pathways severely reduces or blocks intraerythrocytic growth. As examples of this, compounds that inhibit <italic>P. falciparum</italic> CK (PfCK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Serrán-Aguilera et al., 2016</xref>) or PfCCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Contet et al., 2015</xref>) in the CDP-choline pathway kill the parasite, and disruption of the PfPMT gene to block PC synthesis via the SDPM pathway results in morphological and growth defects but is not lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Witola et al., 2008</xref>). These findings suggest that the CDP-choline pathway provides the major route to PC synthesis whilst the SDPM pathway forms an important alternative route.

Whilst free choline can cross the PPM efficiently through an unidentified carrier, choline transfer from serum into the infected RBC across the erythrocyte membrane via a parasite-induced new permeability pathway (NPP) appears rate-limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ancelin and Vial, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biagini et al., 2004</xref>). Perhaps to overcome this limitation, the parasite has evolved to scavenge most of the required choline from exogenous lysoPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wein et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, lysoPC also acts as an environmental sensor that controls sexual differentiation in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Active lysoPC metabolism into PC via the CDP-choline pathway prevents sexual commitment, while in contrast limited availability of lysoPC reduces formation of asexual progeny and triggers differentiation into the transmissible gametocyte stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>). Metabolic labelling experiments showed that ∼68% of free choline in the parasite comes from exogenous lysoPC, indicating that the majority of the lysoPC is broken down to choline before entering PC synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is unclear how and where lysoPC is converted to choline in the parasite and the enzymes involved in this process are unknown.</p><p>LysoPC breakdown to free choline requires a two-step hydrolysis reaction: deacylation of lysoPC by a putative lysophospholipase to give glycerophosphocholine (GPC) that is then hydrolysed by a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDPD) to generate choline and glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Mutant parasites developed normally throughout the erythrocytic cycle of treatment (cycle 0) and were able to egress and invade fresh RBCs.

The reduction in several PC species (10 out of 22 detected species) was significant (p&lt;0.05) but less than 1.5-fold, while levels of most PE, PS, and PI species were more drastically reduced. Greater than two-fold reductions were evident in the case of seven species (PE(32:3), PE(36:5), PE(32:32), PS(34:1), PS(18:1/18:2), PS(18:1/18:1), PS(18:0/18:1), and PS(34:1)). These changes were accompanied by substantial enrichment of DAG levels in the RAP-treated parasites, with 15 out of 27 species showing significantly higher levels compared to controls.</p><p>Previous work has shown that under choline-limiting conditions the parasite can switch from the CDP-choline pathway to the SDPM pathway to produce PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wein et al., 2018</xref>).

We interpreted our lipidomics results as suggesting that a similar switch occurs in PfGDPD-null parasites in order to maintain PC biosynthesis, at the expense of most of the available serine and ethanolamine pool being redirected towards PC biosynthesis, in turn resulting in lowered PE and PS production. This disturbance in precursor availability likely reduces usage of DAG, the primary backbone for glycerolipid and neutral lipid production, resulting in its accumulation. Collectively, these results indicated the onset of disruption in PL biosynthesis and were consistent with a major role for PfGDPD in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PfGDPD ablation severely reduces choline uptake from lysoPC</title><p>In view of the prior evidence that most choline scavenged by the parasite is through degradation of host serum-derived lysoPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>), we next investigated whether PfGDPD plays a role in choline release from exogenous lysoPC. To do this, we performed isotopic lipid analysis of parasites grown in the presence of deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H) choline-labelled lysoPC 16:0 (<sup>2</sup>H-lysoPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In initial experiments, RAP- and mock-treated GDPD:HA:loxPint parasites were incubated from 24 hr in cycle 0 for 14 hr in culture medium containing <sup>2</sup>H-lysoPC, followed by lipid extraction and LC-MS analysis.

Only a small, statistically insignificant decrease was observed in the labelled proportions for 5 out of 9 PC species detected in the RAP-treated parasites compared to the controls, indicating no effects of RAP-treatment on lysoPC metabolism.</p><p>Reasoning that efficient choline uptake from lysoPC in the RAP-treated parasites might be maintained by the residual levels of PfGDPD enzyme still present in cycle 0, we next performed a similar experiment using the clonal PfGDPD-null line G1. These parasites, supported by choline supplementation, had already been maintained for multiple erythrocytic cycles (over 12 weeks) and were therefore expected to be completely devoid of PfGDPD. We maintained G1 and B4 parasite lines in choline for one further cycle, then starved them of choline from the start of the next cycle followed by <sup>2</sup>H-lysoPC treatment from 24 hr.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> top panel, the choline regimen did not affect incorporation of labelled choline from <sup>2</sup>H-lysoPC, as labelled proportions in the B4 controls in this experiment were comparable to mock-treated parasites used in the previous experiment without choline pre-treatment. However, a consistent and significant decrease (25–50%) in labelling of 10 out of 13 PC species was observed in the choline-starved PfGDPD-null G1 parasites compared to the B4 controls. These results strongly suggest that PfGDPD plays an important role in metabolism of exogenous lysoPC for PC synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Loss of PfGDPD prevents de novo PC synthesis</title><p>To further explore the effects of loss of PfGDPD on phospholipid biosynthesis, we next performed a global lipidomic analysis of the metabolically labelled PfGDPD-null G1 clone parasites under choline-starved conditions, comparing them to PfGDPD-expressing B4 parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> bottom panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This revealed large-scale changes in phospholipid and neutral lipid species in the choline-starved G1 parasites. Several PC species (7 out of 14 PC species) were significantly depleted in choline-starved G1 parasites, with three species - PC(16:0/18:3), PC(16:0/16:1) and PC(16:0/20:5) - decreased in abundance more than two-fold. This was accompanied by a concomitant increase in levels of lysoPC (LPC) species, LPC(16:0) and LPC(18:0). Similar to what we observed in PfGDPD-null schizonts, we noticed significant accumulation of DAG species (DAG(18:0/20:4) and DAG(18:0/22:5)), pointing to Kennedy pathway dysfunction.</p><p>Several phosphatidylglycerol (PG(18:1/18:2), PG(18:1/18:1) and PG(36:3)) and acyl-phosphatidylglycerol (acyl-PG) species were also notably depleted. All PI species detected were significantly depleted in choline-starved G1 parasites, as observed in PfGDPD-null schizonts. On the other hand, in contrast to the PfGDPD-null schizonts, most PE and PS species were unchanged between the mutant G1 parasites and the B4 controls. Another notable feature was the significant depletion of several species of TAG in choline-starved G1 parasites, with 8 species showing almost two to fivefold decrease in abundance. We also observed a twofold increase in the abundance of the betaine lipid diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine (DGTS) in G1 parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We were able to match the MS/MS spectra of three DGTS species (DGTS(34:1), DGTS(35:1) and DGTS(38:2)) in our samples to that of a commercially available DGTS standard (DGTS(32:0)) thus confirming correct identification of the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, this pathway likely involves at least two catabolic steps: deacylation of lysoPC by a putative lysophospholipase to produce GPC, then hydrolysis of the GPC to generate choline and G3P. Recombinantly expressed PfGDPD has previously been shown to have magnesium-dependent hydrolytic activity against GPC to produce G3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Denloye et al., 2012</xref>). Reasoning that PfGDPD likely catalyzes the second step in this pathway, we exploited the 3xHA epitope tag introduced into the PfGDPD protein in the GDPD:HA:loxPint parasite line to directly examine whether affinity-purified parasite-derived PfGDPD-HA has the capacity to release choline from GPC. Good yields of PfGDPD-HA were obtained from saponin lysates of mock-treated GDPD:HA:loxPint schizonts while residual or undetectable levels were obtained from RAP-treated GDPD:HA:loxPint parasites and the GDPD-null clonal line, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Since erythrocytic growth of the malaria parasite requires extensive membrane biogenesis, de novo PC synthesis by the parasite is essential. Host serum lysoPC, well established as the main precursor for PC synthesis in the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wein et al., 2018</xref>), can enter the parasitized erythrocyte efficiently through rapid exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dushianthan et al., 2019</xref>) after which it may be transported into the parasite by exported phospholipid transfer proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Ooij et al., 2013</xref>). However, the enzymes involved in the generation of choline from lysoPC have been unknown. Here we have established PfGDPD as an essential player in this process.</p><p>Ablation of PfGDPD expression produced a phenotypic defect during trophozoite development as either a direct or general stress response to disrupted PC synthesis, similar to that observed upon inhibition of other enzymes involved in CDP-choline pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">González-Bulnes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Serrán-Aguilera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Contet et al., 2015</xref>). Unsurprisingly for an enzyme playing a key role in membrane biogenesis, previous transcriptional studies have shown that PfGDPD is expressed early in the erythrocytic cycle. Our observation that DiCre-mediated disruption of PfGDPD results in parasites that undergo normal development in the erythrocytic cycle of RAP-treatment (cycle 0) is therefore likely due to the presence of residual enzyme produced early during ring stage development (prior to gene excision) and persisting throughout that cycle. In support of this, PfGDPD-null parasites that were rendered completely devoid of the enzyme through propagation for several cycles in choline-supplemented media exhibited maturation defects within ∼24 hr of choline removal.</p><p>We infer that PfGDPD acts as a glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase and releases choline from the intermediary GPC during lysoPC breakdown from the following findings. First, site-directed mutagenesis showed that PfGDPD retains the same essential catalytic sites and metal-ion dependency as a bacterial choline-releasing GDPD enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shi et al., 2008</xref>). Second, supraphysiological concentrations of choline rescued the PfGDPD-null development and growth defect. Third, PC levels and incorporation of choline from lysoPC into PC are reduced in PfGDPD-null parasites. And fourth, PfGDPD affinity-purified from parasite lysate released choline from GPC in vitro.</p><p>Previous work has shown that supplying an excess of choline can rescue the growth of parasites in lysoPC-deprived conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Witola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wein et al., 2018</xref>). High concentrations of exogenous choline partially surpass the bottleneck in choline transport across the red blood cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biagini et al., 2004</xref>) and increase choline influx through infected RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirk et al., 1991</xref>). LysoPC-deprived parasites can readily take up this choline and use it for PC synthesis as shown by previous metabolic labelling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>). The impact of exogenous choline was well pronounced in our PfGDPD-null mutants as they completely failed to survive in the absence of choline but achieved near-wild type growth rates in high choline concentrations. This complete dependence on exogenous choline despite the abundant presence of lysoPC (amounting to ∼17% of total lipid content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia-Gonzalo and Izpisúa Belmonte, 2008</xref>) in the Albumax II-supplemented culture media used in our studies or supplementation with GPC, is a further confirmation that ablating PfGDPD function interferes with choline acquisition from lysoPC and mimics a lysoPC-deprived state.</p><p>As well as its effects on PC levels, ablation of PfGDPD reduced both PE and PS content in the parasite, likely due to redirection of ethanolamine and serine precursors into PC synthesis. Consistent with this, ethanolamine supplementation marginally improved growth of PfGDPD-null parasites. Loss of PfGDPD also reduced – but did not eliminate – incorporation of lysoPC-derived choline. This suggests that alternate pathways such as direct lysoPC acylation into PC via the Lands’ cycle, two acylation steps to convert GPC to PC or the SDPM pathway may contribute to PC synthesis under choline-starved conditions. However, our results strongly suggest that PfGDPD-mediated choline release from lysoPC remains the primary, indispensable pathway to meet the choline requirements of the intraerythrocytic parasite.</p><p>The observed depletion of TAG in choline-starved PfGDPD-null parasites was unexpected since there is no previously reported role for a glycerophosphodiesterase in neutral lipid metabolism. An intense phase of de novo TAG biosynthesis from DAG is known to accompany trophozoite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palacpac et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vielemeyer et al., 2004</xref>), followed by a rapid hydrolysis of TAG in mature schizonts resulting in localized release of fatty acids essential for merozoite maturation prior to egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gulati et al., 2015</xref>). Our results could simply reflect the different developmental stages of the choline starved G1 and B4 parasites at the point of lipid extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) as a result of the developmental arrest that inevitably occurs in G1 parasites upon choline deprivation. However, the changes in lipid levels (PC in particular) that we observe here are more drastic than the normal temporal dynamics of these lipids during blood stage progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gulati et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the perturbations are to an extent indeed the result of loss of PfGDPD. A block in PC synthesis can either cause the depletion of the PC-derived DAG pool and block TAG synthesis, or lead to increased metabolism of TAG to feed fatty acids into the compensatory Lands’ cycle that acylates lysoPC to PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caviglia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moessinger et al., 2014</xref>). Studies in other organisms increasingly show a bidirectional link between TAG and PC synthesis in which PC-derived DAG is used for TAG synthesis and TAG-derived fatty acids are used for synthesis of PC through the Lands’ cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bates and Browse, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caviglia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moessinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soudant et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van der Veen et al., 2012</xref>). The reduced haemozoin formation in GDPD-null parasites could also be a result of this decrease in TAG levels.

Indeed it was recently shown that knockdown of a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lysophospholipase results in reduced TAG levels, reduced haemozoin formation and a block in trophozoite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Asad et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our lipidomics analysis identified the betaine lipid DGTS, prevalently found in photosynthetic organisms like green algae, mosses and ferns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giroud et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sato et al., 1995</xref>).

Enzymes involved in SAM synthesis are upregulated in lysoPC-limiting conditions and diversion of SAM pools from histone methylation towards compensatory PC biosynthetic pathways is the primary link between PC metabolism and sexual differentiation in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harris et al., 2022</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that blocking PC biosynthesis in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> triggers a compensatory pathway that produces DGTS as a functional substitute for PC in the parasite.</p><p>Based on protein localisation, ligand docking and sequence homology analyses, we can further speculate regarding aspects of PfGDPD function that we have not explored in this study. It has been previously suggested that the gene could use alternative start codons via ribosomal skipping to produce distinct PV-located and cytosolic variants of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Denloye et al., 2012</xref>). PfGDPD could potentially perform similar functions in both compartments by facilitating the breakdown of exogenous lysoPC both within the PV and within the parasite cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>). This scale of enzyme activity may be essential for the parasite to meet its choline needs, given the high levels of PC synthesis during parasite development and its crucial importance for intraerythrocytic membrane biogenesis. PfGDPD may also have other roles during asexual stages such as temporal and localised recycling of intracellular PC or GPC by the PfGDPD fraction expressed in the cytosol. Finally, our ligand docking simulations do not rule out additional catalytic activity towards other glycerophosphodiester substrates such as glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphoserine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Further investigation that involves variant-specific conditional knockout of the <italic>gdpd</italic> gene could help us further dissect the role of PfGDPD in the parasite. Orthologs of PfGDPD form a <italic>Haematozoan</italic>-specific ortholog group (OG6_139464 in OrthoMCL DB release 6.4) that encompasses only blood parasites that have an intra-erythrocytic stage, that is the genera <italic>Babesia</italic>, <italic>Theileria</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Hepatocystis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We speculate that this entire ortholog group could have a conserved role in choline acquisition for the critical process of PC biosynthesis to support an intra-erythrocytic lifestyle. PC biosynthesis is the main biosynthetic process in blood stages of <italic>Babesia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Florin-Christensen et al., 2000</xref>) and compounds that inhibit PC biosynthesis have been shown to have anti-parasite activity against <italic>Babesia</italic> and <italic>Theileria</italic> blood stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">AbouLaila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Richier et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a malaria parasite choline-releasing glycerophosphodiesterase catalyses a critical step in choline acquisition from exogenous lysoPC. Since PfGDPD-mediated procurement of choline is indispensable for normal PC biosynthesis and asexual blood stage development in the parasite, it may represent a potential new drug target.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Gene (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">PfGDPD</td><td align="left" valign="top">PlasmoDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plasmodb.org">https://plasmodb.org</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">PF3D7_1406300</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>P. falciparum</italic> GDPD gene</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>P. falciparum</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">GDPD:HA:loxPint</td><td align="left" valign="top">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">For inducible disruption of PfGDPD in B11 line.

Cultures were diluted 10-fold into fresh RBCs after the 5th day to prevent overgrowth. Parasitaemia assessment was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Malleret et al., 2011</xref>). In brief, 20 µL resuspended parasite culture was incubated with dihydroethidium (5µg/ml, Cayman) and SYBR Green I dye (0.25 x dilution, Invitrogen) in a final volume of 100 µL medium for 20 min at RT protected from light. Samples were analyzed (100,000 events) on a ACEA NovoCyte flow cytometer. For quantification of developmental stages, synchronous ring stage cultures were diluted to ∼0.1 and ∼1% parasitaemia and Giemsa-stained blood films were prepared at 40/48 hpi (1% starting parasitemia) and 88/96 hpi (0.1% starting parasitemia). For stage quantification, at least 20 fields of view were recorded using a 63 x objective per sample. Erythrocyte numbers were then determined using the automated Parasitaemia software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gburri.org/parasitemia/">http://www.gburri.org/parasitemia/</ext-link>) and the number of the different parasite stages was manually counted on these images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>GDPD:loxPint:HA synchronous ring stage parasites were treated with RAP and allowed to progress to 40 hr in the next cycle to obtain a population of growth arrested GDPD-null parasites.

stages of the malaria parasites that is used to salvage lipid precursors needed for membrane biogenesis and parasite growth in red blood cells. A previously identified glycerophosphodiesterase (PfGDPD), is shown to mediate the hydrolysis of host lyso-phosphatidycholine to generate choline, which in turn is required for parasite de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Extensive analysis of the localization, growth phenotype and lipidomic profiles of PfGDPD deficient parasites indicate that this salvage pathway is essential for lipid homeostasis and asexual parasite development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82207.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>McConville</surname><given-names>Malcolm J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01ej9dk98</institution-id><institution>The University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Sigala</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03r0ha626</institution-id><institution>University of Utah School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.14.496138">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.14.496138v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

In the revised manuscript we have now dealt specifically with these 4 requests, as laid out in detail below. Note that we assume that for Essential Revision #1 above, the editor means the ‘parasitophorous vacuole’ rather than the ‘food vacuole’, which was not requested by the Reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The gene knock out studies, as well as enzyme activity analysis of PfGDPD were carried out in an earlier study (Denloye et al., 2012), which highlighted its role in parasite survival and possible role in providing choline for phospholipid synthesis in the parasite.</p><p>The phospholipid analysis shows a generalized response of disturbance in lipid homeostasis; phospholipid analysis in the first cycle (+RAP/-RAP) shows effect on levels of several phospholipids which are overall down, and a generalized increase in DAGs and TAGs.

What is the explanation for DAG and TAG increase under KO conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the implied view of the Reviewer that our first lipidomics analysis, that of RAP+ and RAP- parasites at schizont stage in cycle 0 (original Figure 5A), whilst revealing a reduction in key structural phospholipids, does not reliably inform on the function of GDPD. While we chose this time point as a starting point for the lipidomics analysis for the reasons detailed (see lines 203-211 of the original submission), we initially underestimated the confounding effects of residual GDPD activity still present in the RAP+ parasites at the end of cycle 0 (original Figure 2D). Even those residual levels of GDPD can break down GPC to choline (Figure 6), likely explaining why our first lipidomics experiment revealed only a small and non-significant decrease in lysoPC-derived choline incorporation into PC (original Figure 5B). This, we suspect, combined with the compensatory SDPM pathway, resulted in unchanged PC levels in the cycle 0 schizonts. The ambiguity inherent in this experiment therefore motivated us to repeat the lipidomic analysis with the completely GDPD-null clonal line G1, following prolonged maintenance in culture (original Figure 5C), ultimately leading to a much clearer picture of GDPD function.</p><p>Although we did not directly assess upregulation of PMT activity in the GDPD-null G1 parasites, we believe that the reduction in PE and PS levels detected reflects activation of the SDPM pathway. This is because we detected a significant reduction in only PS, PE and π levels and not an overall decrease in all PLs (PC and PG are essentially unaffected). The reviewer is correct in stating that PS synthesis is independent of PC or PE synthesis under normal conditions, but upon activation of the SDPM pathway both serine and ethanolamine are expected to be redirected towards PC synthesis. Reflecting this, in the absence of lysoPC, serine contributes to 38.2% of PC biosynthesis in the parasite as shown by Wein <italic>et al.</italic> (2018).</p><p>Regarding levels of DAG and TAG in the GDPD-null parasites; in fact we observed increases in DAG but not in TAG levels (only one species of the detected TAG species was significantly upregulated; see Figure 5 —figure supplement 1). We suspect that the disturbance in precursor availability (choline, ethanolamine and serine) reduces DAG usage as the backbone for PL synthesis, resulting in its accumulation. We have now modified the revised manuscript (line 232 onwards) to specifically mention this possibility, as follows: “This disturbance in precursor availability likely reduces usage of DAG, the primary backbone for glycerolipid and neutral lipid production, resulting in its accumulation. Collectively, these results indicated the onset of disruption in PL biosynthesis and were consistent with a major role for PfGDPD in this process.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the cell biology study of the KO line, parasites show developmental arrest at trophozoite, reduction in merozoite number as well as effect on food vacuole functioning resulting in decreased haemozoin crystal. These could be generalised stress response and no direct correlation is established with the GDPD reduction. Why haemozoin crystal formation is hindered in the KO parasites, and how is it linked with disturbance in lipid metabolism and specifically PC synthesis?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the phenotypes described could simply result from a general stress response following GDPD ablation and the resulting decrease in PC levels. In the revised manuscript we have now modified line 326 to reflect this view, as follows: “Ablation of PfGDPD expression produced a phenotypic defect during trophozoite development likely resulting from a direct or general stress response to disrupted PC synthesis, similar to that observed upon inhibition of other enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway (Contet et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Bulnes et al., 2011; Serran-Aguilera et al., 2016).”</p><p>We note that Reviewer #3 also raised a similar question regarding haemozoin crystal formation. The reduced haemozoin formation could be a result of the stress response or due to the decrease in TAG levels we observe (original Figure 5C). Neutral lipids have been suggested to play a role in the parasite haem detoxification pathway and promote haemozoin formation (Hoang et al. 2010). Indeed it was recently shown that knockdown of a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lysophospholipase results in reduced TAG levels, reduced haemozoin formation and a block in trophozoite development (Asad et al. 2021). It is therefore entirely plausible that the associated developmental defect is due to disruption in haem detoxification rather than directly by reduced PC levels. Since the TAG-haemozoin link is not well established in the current scientific literature (Matz JM et al., 2022), we previously refrained from drawing any further conclusions in our original submission. However, in view of this Reviewer’s comments (as well as those of Reviewer #3 – see below), we now briefly discuss this from line 383 in the revised manuscript – “The reduced haemozoin formation in GDPD-null parasites could also be a result of this decrease in TAG levels. Neutral lipids have been suggested to play a role in the parasite haem detoxification pathway and promote haemozoin formation (Hoang et al., 2010). Indeed it was recently shown that knockdown of a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lysophospholipase results in reduced TAG levels, reduced haemozoin formation and a block in trophozoite development (Asad et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Rescue of KO parasites with choline is intriguing but somewhat inexplicable.

The reviewer is correct in observing that choline “should be able to recover parasite growth to only a certain level”. Consistent with that, while we see a significant rescue of parasite growth rate, choline does not completely restore wild-type growth rates (Figure 4B and 4E). This matches previous observations by others (Witola et al., 2008, Wein et al., 2018).</p><p>The mechanism underlying the rescue of GDPD-null parasites by choline is important and this question was also raised by Reviewers #2 and #3. A plausible explanation can be gleaned from prior work done in this area. LysoPC is generally the main source of choline for the parasite because at the normal choline concentration in human plasma (~10 uM), choline influx through the RBCM is very low so there is a bottleneck in transport of free choline across the red blood cell membrane (RBCM) (Biagini et al., 2004). However, at supraphysiological concentrations of choline as used in our study (500 uM), choline influx into the infected RBC is increased (Kirk et al., 1991). Incorporation of exogenous choline into PC has been previously demonstrated in lysoPC-starved parasites in Brancucci et al. (2017) using high levels (1mM) of d<sub>9</sub>-labelled exogenous choline. Thus, in the absence of lysoPC, the parasite can use exogenous choline to make PC so long as it is provided at relatively high concentrations.</p><p>The main question we address in our study is whether disrupting GDPD function mimics a lysoPC-deprived state, thereby implicating GDPD in lysoPC breakdown. We demonstrate this by metabolic labelling using a choline-labelled lysoPC species and show a 25-50% reduction in sourcing of choline from lysoPC in the absence of GDPD. As to the mechanistic proof of choline rescue of GDPD-null parasites, we maintain that we can rely on the previous studies (detailed above) that have reported both choline rescue and choline incorporation into PC in lysoPC-deprived parasites, and that repetition of those data using labelled choline is unnecessary. Instead, in our revised manuscript we have now discussed this issue further (lines 344 onwards), as follows: “Previous work has shown that supplying an excess of choline can rescue the growth of parasites in lysoPC-deprived conditions (Wein et al., 2018; Witola et al., 2008). High concentrations of exogenous choline partially surpass the bottleneck in choline transport across the red blood cell membrane (Biagini et al., 2004) and increase choline influx through infected RBCs (Kirk et al., 1991). LysoPC-deprived parasites can readily take up this choline and use it for PC synthesis as shown by previous metabolic labelling studies (Brancucci et al., 2017). The impact of exogenous choline was pronounced in our PfGDPD-null mutants as they completely failed to survive in the absence of choline but achieved near-wild type growth rates in high choline concentrations. This complete dependence on exogenous choline despite the abundant presence of lysoPC (amounting to ~17% of total lipid content (Garcia-Gonzalo and Izpisua Belmonte 2008)) in the Albumax II-supplemented culture media used in our studies or supplementation with GPC, provides further confirmation that ablating PfGDPD function interferes with choline acquisition from lysoPC and mimics a lysoPC-deprived state.” We trust that these modifications to our manuscript are acceptable to the Reviewer.</p><p>Supplying exogenous GPC does not rescue growth of the GDPD-null parasites. We now include these data in the revised submission (Figure 4C) and discuss them in lines 188 and 354.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>– I did not get the supplementary figures on the website or in the BioRxiv site.</p></disp-quote><p>We trust that this problem is now solved with the submission of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4B: the parasitaemia is marked in log scale which is confusing to compare between different sets.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s point here but given the wide range of the parasitaemia levels in the -RAP and +RAP cultures, we feel it appropriate to present the data using a log scale to best visualise the differences between the choline-supplemented and control conditions. We hope this is acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5: Why LPCs are getting accumulated in the KO, which are targets of Lysophospholipase, whereas the direct target of GDPD is Glycero-phosphocholine. What is the status of glycero-phosphocholine in these parasites?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer raises an interesting point. In our experience, lysoPC measurements vary somewhat in our lipidomics data. This may be due to lysoPC in the Albumax II- supplemented media that may accumulate within the red blood cells (and that we could not get rid of entirely by washing the parasite pellet). As the Reviewer will see from the presented data, the differences in lysoPC levels referred to are not statistically significant due to wide inter-replicate variability. Therefore, we do not attribute much meaning to these “changes” in lysoPC levels.</p><p>Regarding the status of GPC in the parasites, this is a polar metabolite and therefore unfortunately was not captured by the lipid extraction and LC-MS methods that we employed in this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5C: The labelled proportion of the majority of PC species is not significantly different between the two clones.</p></disp-quote><p>All species above and including PC(16:0_16:1) show significant reduction in labelled proportions in G1 parasites compared to the B4 controls (a 25-50% decrease with p value &lt;0.05 from three replicates). We had previously shown absolute differences in the dot plot (G1-B4). We have now revised the dot plots shown in Figure 5B and C to present the same data as percentage change in labelling ((G1-B4)/B4 *100) to enable easier interpretation. The changes with p value &lt;0.05 have also been now explicitly highlighted in the revised Figure 5C. Line 258 has also been altered to “However, a consistent and significant decrease (25-50%) in labelling of 10 out of 13 PC species was observed in the choline-starved PfGDPD-null G1 parasites compared to the B4 controls.” We hope these revisions are satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The experimental setup for Figure 5C is confusing, the G1 parasite strain is expected to be completely devoid of PfGDPD, if the GDPD is only enzyme responsible for release of choline from GPC, then how can this parasite utilize lyoPC for labelling the newly synthesised PC.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point here. We also expected no labelling in the G1 parasites, but we suspect that alternate pathways such as direct acylation of lysoPC into PC via the Lands’ cycle could contribute to the labelled fraction in the PC pool. The enzymes involved in these pathways remain to be elucidated. We suggest this in lines 360 onwards of the revised manuscript, as follows: “This suggests that alternate pathways such as (i) direct lysoPC acylation into PC via the Lands’ cycle, (ii) two acylation steps to convert GPC to PC, or (iii) the SDPM pathway may contribute to PC synthesis under choline-starved conditions. However, our results strongly suggest that PfGDPD-mediated choline release from lysoPC remains the primary, indispensable pathway to meet the choline requirements of the intraerythrocytic parasite.” We hope that this text clarifies our interpretation of our observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What is the significance of betaine lipid DGTS upregulation, DGTS is synthesised without the use of choline but using DAGs, how does this data correlate with other lipidomic profile, DAG levels as well as with the choline rescue.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss at length the potential significance of DGTS in the Discussion (lines 389 onwards). Accumulation of DGTS as a non-choline/phosphorous substitute for PC in the choline-starved GDPD-null clonal G1 line is similar to that observed previously in fungi and marine bacteria under similar conditions. As mentioned earlier, due to the presence of residual GDPD levels and possibly activation of the SDPM pathway, RAP-treated cycle 0 GDPD:loxPint:HA schizonts are not severely choline-starved and their lipidomic profile (new Figure 5A) is not relevant here. However, extensive DAG accumulation is seen in both lipidomic profiles due to dysfunctional phospholipid metabolism and likely far exceeds any of its use in DGTS synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Is GDPD localization to the PV and/or cytoplasm critical for parasite viability? Some discussion of this question seems warranted at a minimum. This key question could be strongly addressed if the authors extend the experiment in Figure 2G to test if episomal expression of GDPD variants either lacking the SP (and thus presumably just cytoplasmic) or lacking Met19 (which may prevent a cytoplasmic population and just retain the PV population) rescue parasites from loss of endogenous GDPD.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s experimental suggestions here, but respectfully suggest that they address questions that are beyond the remit of the present study. While the suggested experiments appear initially straightforward, they could well turn out to represent a substantial additional workload. The suggestions are based on the reasonable but as yet untested assumption that the internal Met19 is indeed a cryptic translation initiation site. Simple substitution of Met19 might interfere with the enzymatic function of the longer translation product, and different amino acid substitutions may have to be explored. The relative expression levels of the two isoforms (if they exist) may be important. However, we do agree that some discussion of this issue is warranted, and the revised manuscript now includes this on lines 404-411.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Do the GDPD mutations studied episomally in Figure 2G impact or reduce protein stability and expression? The microscopy data in the figure supplement suggest that all proteins are expressed but quantitative comparison is difficult. Can the authors show by western blot (normalized to loading control) that WT and enzyme mutants are all expressed at similar levels? This experiment seems critical since the 2012 Klemba study reported that a different active site mutant resulted in insoluble protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this point. We have now quantified the mean GDPD-mCherry fluorescence intensity from a number of imaged parasites as a measure of GDPD expression. The results do not detect any statistically significant differences between the different lines. These data have now been added to the revised manuscript as Figure 2—figure supplement 3G. Line 152 of the manuscript has also been amended to read: “Mutagenesis of these key residues did not alter the expression or subcellular localization of the transgenic PfGDPD variants (Figure 2—figure supplement 3F and G) but completely abolished rescue of parasite growth upon disruption of the chromosomal gene (Figure 2G).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Is the mechanism of choline uptake into parasites known? Are New Permeability Pathway mechanisms involved (e.g., does furosemide antagonize uptake?)?</p></disp-quote><p>Current understanding of the mechanism of choline uptake is explained above in our response to Reviewer #1. Choline indeed crosses the host red blood cell membrane via the New Permeability Pathway and into the parasite through a parasite choline carrier (Biagini et al., 2004). The revised manuscript now mentions this (line 72 onwards). Choline transport into the host RBC can be blocked by furosemide. However, furosemide does not affect choline uptake by the parasite via the choline carrier.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For the experiment in Figure 5A, does addition of exogenous choline to +RAP parasites lead to phospholipid levels that phenocopy -RAP conditions? This experiment may give insight into other GDPD functions beyond choline-dependent phospholipid synthesis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion and could be considered for future work. We did plan to include a sample corresponding to the G1 clone in the presence of choline for the lipidomics analysis shown in Figure 5C, but due to certain practical restraints we had to limit our analysis to the 2 sample groups shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The 2012 Klemba paper previously showed that recombinant GDPD could hydrolyze glycerophosphocholine. Figure 6 in the present paper is a valuable extension of this experiment to endogenous GDPD from parasites, and these experiments are important to strongly support the proposed enzyme function in choline mobilization. Comparison of IP samples of GDPD {plus minus}RAP or to stable GDPD-deletion clone G1 provides some but incomplete support for specific function, as there could also be other functional losses in parasites that accompany GDPD deletion or co-purifying proteins that accompany GDPD pull-down that impact choline release in these experiments. Do anti-mCherry IPs under +RAP conditions of the parasites complemented with WT but not mutant enzymes (in Figure 2G) phenocopy GPC and choline levels in B4- parasites, as expected if differences between B4- and B4+ or G1 parasites are due to the specific activity of GDPD?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the earlier demonstration by Denloye et al., 2012 that recombinant GDPD hydrolyses GPC to produce G3P was important, and we were very happy to be able to complement those data in our study by demonstrating that native, parasite-derived enzyme can generate free choline from GPC. Equally importantly, our approach also enabled us to show that even the residual amounts of GDPD in RAP-treated cycle 0 schizonts display measurable catalytic activity, nicely explaining the mild phenotype of the parasites at that point in their development.</p><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s reservations regarding the fact that our pull-down experiments do not completely rule out a role for co-purifying proteins in the GPC hydrolysis we observed. Co-purification of other proteins that contribute to GPC hydrolytic activity is a formal possibility but arguing against this, we did not detect any additional Coomassie-stained bands other than PfGDPD in the SDS PAGE analysis of our pull-down fractions (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, our complementation experiments with WT and mutant mCherry-tagged GDPD show unambiguously that parasite viability is not supported by mutant enzymatically inactive PfGDPD, which might still form interactions with partner proteins. The reviewer’s suggestion is a good one to rule out a possible enzymatic role (or co-factor role) for partner proteins, but we consider this unlikely in the light of knowledge of other GDPD enzymes, which generally function without protein co-factors. From a practical perspective, there is substantial expense associated with the mass-spectrometric analysis required to show hydrolysis to free choline in our assays. For all these reasons, we have not performed the proposed experiments using anti-mCherry to pull-down mCherry-tagged GDPD from parasites complemented with such constructs. We hope this is acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The catalytic function of this protein has already been investigated in Denloye et al., 2012, this figure should be removed and instead the data from this previous article can be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>It is unclear which figure the reviewer refers to here. If it is Figure 6, we agree with the reviewer that the catalytic function of recombinant GDPD has been partially characterised previously by Denloye et al., 2012. In our revised manuscript we have now added a sentence (line 292) specifically mentioning this, as follows:</p><p>“Recombinantly expressed PfGDPD has previously been shown to possess magnesium-dependent hydrolytic activity that releases G3P from GPC (Denloye et al., 2012)”. However, in agreement with the view of Reviewer #2 (see above) we believe it is important to retain our experimental data in the current manuscript for three reasons. First, we confirm the hydrolytic activity of GDPD using a protocol that is completely different from Denloye et al., 2012, in that our in vitro assays used PfGDPD isolated directly from parasites as opposed to the recombinant protein used previously. Second, we used LC-MS to directly quantify GPC and choline in the reactions, whereas Denloye et al., 2012 measured G3P production using a two-step assay as a measure of GDPD activity. Finally – and importantly – our data confirm that even the residual amounts of GDPD in our RAP-treated cycle 0 parasites display measurable, choline releasing catalytic activity. This was crucial to explain the phenotype and lipidomics profile of cycle 0 schizonts. We trust that the reviewer accepts our reasoning on this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Not all defects, especially at the lipid level, can be explained with the current data and their interpretations: Why Do TAGs and DAGs increase in the mutant? Is there a link between accumulation of hemozoin crystals and neutral lipid accumulation, as recently reported (Asad et al. BMC Biology), have the author tested it? How do the authors explain that choline complementation rescues the parasite when this chline is believed to exclusively being generated from LPC?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there could indeed be a link between hemozoin generation and neutral lipid accumulation; please see our response above to Reviewer #1. Much further experimentation will be required to confirm this link and we suggest that this is beyond the remit of this current work.</p><p>The second point raised by this Reviewer is also mentioned above in our response to Reviewer #1. Briefly, lysoPC is the preferred source of choline for the parasite. However, high concentrations of exogenous choline partially surpass the bottleneck in choline transport across the red blood cell membrane (Biagini et al., 2004) and increase choline influx through the infected RBC (Kirk et al., 1991). LysoPC-deprived parasites readily take up this choline and use it for PC synthesis, as previously shown by metabolic labelling studies (Brancucci <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Some graphs don't have any error bars.</p><p>– Statistical significance is not always shown, and the tests performed are not discussed in the figure captions.</p><p>– Representation of the lipidomic data is often hard to follow, individual FA species of each lipid group is only shown in the supplementary figures, which also do not show the statistical significance of the data; were any stat tests done?</p><p>– No statistical significance is shown in Figure 5B and C.</p><p>– I would propose to the authors to replace the bubble charts that is quite difficult to read and interpret, with only the significant results of PE, PS, PC, LPC and DAG in the form of the bar graphs shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical significance was calculated for all the data. As stated in the methods, in all cases – “Student’s t-test were used to compare group means and where necessary Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons was applied to the p-value of statistical significance.”</p><p>Bar graphs in Figure 5 represent the average labelled proportion in each parasite line. Their variability has been shown as error bars in the dot plots on the side that denote the differences between the proportions. Statistical significance is now shown in the revised Figure 5C for labelling data.</p><p>In the main Figure 5C bubble plot, a scale has been provided depicting the p-value associated with each point. Bubbles bigger than the size denoted are statistically significant. In the supplementary figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), ONLY the statistically significant species are displayed (as described in the figure legend). We would like to retain the bubble charts as they provide the reader with an eagle-eye’s view of two lipidomic experiments within the space of a single figure and inform on the main changes we discuss in the text. The reader can always then refer to the supplementary bar graphs. We trust this is acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the PfGDPD-null mutant it would of interest to see if the expression of other transcripts has changed, and this can expand on how this parasite can survive solely on the exogenous choline despite having completely lost this proposed essential protein.</p><p>– Transcriptional analyses will also reveal why despite the LPC/PC balance being offset, sexual conversion is not induced.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these suggestions, and indeed we did initially consider bulk RNAseq analysis of the mutants. However, due to the severe developmental defect we observed in the mutants (in both the 3D7 and NF54 lines), we felt there would be wide transcriptional variations across the board that would likely confound any meaningful changes arising from PfGDPD ablation. Furthermore, since provision of high concentrations of exogenous choline likely merely replaces choline that the parasite would have derived from breakdown of lysoPC, we doubt that there is any alternate pathway to be elucidated through transcriptomics. As described above in our response to Reviewer #2, we suspect that the lack of sexual conversion in the GDPD-null NF54 parasites is simply because the parasites die (due to a choline deficiency) before they can progress to gametocytogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The lipidomic analyses is extremely detailed and it seems to be overly condensed to a single image and not fully deliberated in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad the reviewer appreciates our lipidomics efforts. Since we also have a large amount of phenotypic and biochemical data (the manuscript already contains 7 figures), we had no choice but to condense the lipidomic work into a themed figure. We have tried to be both informative and concise in our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What is the relation between the accumulation of DGTS and DAG? This could be addressed in the discussion of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We discuss significance of DGTS in the Discussion (Lines 383-396). While DGTS is made from DAG, a good degree of DAG accumulation is seen in both lipidomic profiles due to dysfunctional phospholipid metabolism and this would far exceed any of its use in DGTS synthesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
