By degrading numerous regulatory proteins, this pathway also plays a pivotal role in regulating many cellular functions such as cell cycle and gene expression. Malignant cells are more dependent on proteasome function than non-transformed cells because they divide rapidly and produce abnormal proteins at a higher rate than normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deshaies, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kisselev et al., 2012</xref>). Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) bortezomib (Btz), carfilzomib (Cfz), and ixazomib are approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Btz is also approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). MM cells are exquisitely sensitive to PIs because the production of immunoglobulins by these malignant plasma cells places an enormous load on the proteasome and other components of the protein quality control machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cascio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cenci et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shabaneh et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Clinically, Btz and Cfz are administered once or twice weekly as a subcutaneous (Btz) or intravenous bolus. They cause rapid inhibition of proteasome activity in the patients' blood but are metabolized rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Within an hour after the administration, PIs concentrations in the blood drop below the levels needed to kill tumor cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamilton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moreau et al., 2011</xref>). Although Btz has a very slow off-rate and Cfz is an irreversible inhibitor, proteasome activity recovers within 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shabaneh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamilton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Connor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weyburne et al., 2017</xref>). This activity recovery may explain discrepancies between robust activity against cell lines derived from various cancers, continuously treated with Btz (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.carcerrxgene.org/">http://www.carcerrxgene.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shabaneh et al., 2013</xref>), and a lack of clinical efficacy except in MM and MCL. In addition, recovery of activity has recently been implicated in PI resistance in MM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Op et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In cells treated with PIs, a transcription factor Nrf1 (also known as TCF11, encoded by the <italic>NFE2L1</italic> gene) upregulates the transcription of genes encoding all proteasome subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Steffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>). When the proteasome is fully functional, Nrf1 is constitutively degraded in a ubiquitin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Steffen et al., 2010</xref>). When the proteasome is partially inhibited, the ubiquitylated Nrf1 is recognized by DDI2 (DNA-Damage-Inducible I Homolog 2), a ubiquitin-dependent aspartic protease that activates Nrf1 by a site-specific cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koizumi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lehrbach and Ruvkun, 2016</xref>). Although knockdown of DDI2 blocks the PI-induced transcription of proteasome genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koizumi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lehrbach and Ruvkun, 2016</xref>), initial studies implicating DDI2 in the activation of Nrf1 did not determine whether DDI2/Nrf1-dependent transcription leads to the recovery of activity after clinically relevant pulse treatment with PIs. In this work, we asked whether DDI2 is involved in activity recovery after such treatment. Unexpectedly, we found that proteasome activity recovered in the absence of DDI2, and activity recovery preceded the upregulation of proteasome genes. This data demonstrates the existence of a novel, DDI2-independent pathway for the recovery of proteasome activity in PI-treated cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To analyze DDI2 involvement in the recovery of proteasome activity after treatment with PIs, we used commercially available clones of HAP1 cells, in which DDI2 was knocked out by CRISPR, and a clone with an unaltered DDI2, which we will refer to as a wild type (wt, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We analyzed three different clones that were generated by using two different gRNAs (Key Resources Table). We treated cells for 1 hr with a range of concentrations of Cfz and Btz and then cultured them in drug-free media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We measured inhibition of the proteasome’s β5 site, which is the prime target of Cfz and Btz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kisselev et al., 2012</xref>), immediately after the 1 hr treatment, and 12 or 24 hr thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), which is when recovery plateaued (not shown). In a parallel experiment, we used a CellTiter-Glo assay, which measures intracellular ATP levels, to determine cell viability 12 and 24 hr after treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Initial inhibition of proteasome was observed at sub-lethal concentrations, and proteasome activity recovered in cells treated with such concentrations. Surprisingly, no differences in the recovery between wt and DDI2-KO clones were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Deletion of DDI2 did not affect recovery, despite inhibition of Btz-induced proteolytic activation of Nrf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings confirm that DDI2 activates Nrf1, but indicate that it is not involved in the recovery of proteasome activity in Btz and Cfz-treated HAP1 and DDI2 KO cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recovery of proteasome activity is DDI2 independent.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Expression of DDI2 in the CRISPR-generated clones of HAP1 cells used in this work was analyzed by western blot.

Proteasome activity in these cells and their sensitivity to PIs were similar to HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The knockdown did not significantly affect the recovery of proteasome activity in cells treated with 100 nM Btz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Finally, we found that inactivation of DDI2 by the D252N mutation of the catalytic aspartic acid residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koizumi et al., 2016</xref>) did not block the recovery of activity after pulse treatment of HCT-116 cells with Btz and Cfz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).

While this study was underway, two other laboratories found that knockout of DDI2 reduced recovery of proteasome activity in multiple myeloma and NIH-3T3 cells pulse-treated with PIs by ~30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Northrop et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, Nrf1 knockdown did not completely block the recovery of proteasome activity in mouse embryonal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>). The clinical impact of our study and these studies in the literature is somewhat limited because we all conducted a single pulse treatment and did not explore whether Nrf1/DDI2 plays a more prominent role in the recovery of proteasome activity after repeated treatment with PIs. These limitations, however, do not question the existence of the DDI2-independent recovery pathway.</p><p>Our findings necessitate reconsidering the role of the DDI2/Nrf1 pathway in basal and inhibitor-induced proteasome expression. Previous studies have also reported that DDI2/Nrf1 contributes to the maintenance of basal levels of proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Waku et al., 2020</xref>) and that Nrf1 is essential for the basal proteasome expression in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), and retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; yet, in our experiments, the effects of DDI2 KO on the basal proteasome activity was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> ). These differences may reflect that heavy secretory MM cells, embryonic cells, and certain specific tissues require higher levels of proteasome activity and use the DDI2/Nrf1 pathway to supplement other pathways responsible for proteasome expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Motosugi and Murata, 2019</xref>). Other studies demonstrated the importance of Nrf1-dependent proteasome expression during cardiac regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2021</xref>) and thermogenic adaptation of the brown fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartelt et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several studies found that the knockout of DDI2 sensitizes cells to proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weyburne et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Op et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Northrop et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dirac-Svejstrup et al., 2020</xref>). This was further interpreted as supportive of a role for DDI2-dependent recovery in the de-sensitization of cells to PI-induced apoptosis. Although we confirmed this observation in HAP1 cells (not shown), the present findings raise a possibility that DDI2 desensitizes cells to PI by a different mechanism. Activation of non-proteasomal Nrf1-dependent oxidative stress response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ribeiro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) may help overcome the deleterious consequences of PI-induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lipchick et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, the ability of DDI2 to bind and participate in the degradation of large ubiquitin conjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dirac-Svejstrup et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2022</xref>) may help alleviate the stress associated with proteasome inhibition. DDI2 and proteasome are involved in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kottemann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krogan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Groisman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aliyaskarova et al., 2023</xref>), and impairment of the proteasome in the absence of DDI2 can lead to excessive spontaneous DNA damage, even without DNA-damaging agents. Finally, the proteolytic activation of another yet-to-be-identified DDI2 substrate cannot be ruled out. In summary, our study provides strong evidence for a novel pathway responsible for the recovery of proteasome activity in inhibitor-treated cells. It should stimulate research on additional biological roles of DDI2, which can explain the embryonic lethality of DDI2 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siva et al., 2020</xref>) and DDI2’s role in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lei et al., 2023</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculations</title><p>We want to propose a model explaining the upregulated biogenesis of proteasomes without an increase in the efficiency of proteasomal mRNA translation. To gain activity, the catalytic subunits must assemble into mature particles in a complex process involving multiple dedicated chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rousseau and Bertolotti, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budenholzer et al., 2017</xref>). The efficiency of nascent subunits incorporation into the mature proteasomes is not known. One study found that proteasomes degrade a significant fraction of nascent proteasome subunits within 2–4 hr after synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McShane et al., 2016</xref>), after which the remaining fraction is highly stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We hypothesize that nascent proteasome subunits are partitioned between immediate degradation and assembly, and the inhibition of the proteasome blocks degradation and increases the efficiency of proteasome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Increased expression of proteasome assembly chaperone POMP and an increase in proteasome assembly intermediates after treatment with PIs has been previously reported see Figure 6 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meiners et al., 2003</xref>. If nascent polypeptides take 1–2 hr to assemble into proteasomes, this model explains translation-independent recovery of proteasome activity in the first hour after the removal of PIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The fraction of nascent polypeptides degraded may be much larger than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> because that experiment used 1 hr pulse labeling and was, therefore, unable to detect nascent proteins that are degraded within minutes after synthesis. Thus, partitioning proteasome nascent polypeptides between degradation and assembly allows cells to instantaneously upregulate proteasome biogenesis immediately after proteasome inhibition. This model will be tested in future experiments.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Escape from rapid degradation of nascent subunits can explain rapid recovery of proteasome activity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Turnover of proteasome subunit in human RPE-1 cells was measured by quantitative mass-spectrometry following 1 hr labeling with heavy isotopes.

Each sample contained three technical replicates.</p><p>To determine proteasome’s β5 activity in the cell extracts, cells were lysed in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5% CHAPS, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 100 µM ATP, 1 mM DTT, and 1 x PhosSTOP. The cells were incubated for 15 min on ice, centrifuged at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 15–20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for the experiments. Protein concentrations were determined using Pierce Coomassie Plus (Bradford) Assay reagent (Cat. #23238) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. An aliquot of cell lysate containing 1 µg of protein was spiked into a 100 µL per well of the 26 S assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 40 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 100 µM ATP) containing 100 µM of Suc-LLVY-AMC. The mixture was thoroughly mixed and preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min. An increase in fluorescence was monitored continuously at 37 °C at the excitation wavelength of 380 nm and emission of 460 nm. The slopes of the reaction progress curves for three technical replicates were averaged, and the inhibition was calculated as a percentage by dividing the slopes of the inhibitor-treated samples by the slope of mock-treated controls. Assays were calibrated with AMC standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kisselev and Goldberg, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Lysates were prepared, and total protein was quantified as described above for the fluorescent proteasome assays. Samples were mixed with lithium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer and heated before fractionation on either NuPAGE Bis-Tris 8% Midi Gel (Invitrogen, Cat. #WG1003BOX) or SurePAGE Bis-Tris 8% mini gel (GenScript, Cat. #M00662), using MES-SDS running buffer (GenScript Cat. #M00677). The proteins were transferred on 0.2 µm pore-diameter Immobilon–pSQ PVDF membrane (Cat. #ISEQ00010) using Invitrogen Power Blotter 1-Step Transfer Buffer (Thermo Cat. #PB7300). The membrane was blocked with 5% Milk in TBST and probed with antibodies listed in the Key resources table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RNA isolation and qPCR</title><p>The mRNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat. #15596018) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Then, cDNA synthesis was performed using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems cat. #4368814). Before the qPCR run, the RNA and cDNA were quantified by UV absorbance using NanoDrop2000 (Thermo Scientific). The Real-time qPCR was performed using 2 x SYBR Green Bimake qPCR Master Mix on a Bio-Rad C1000 thermal cycler CFX96 Real-Time System.

Cells were washed in a cold PBS containing 100 μg/mL CHX and were resuspended in the hypotonic buffer containing 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 mM KCl, 1 x Complete protease inhibitor (EDTA-free), 100 µg/mL CHX, 1 mM DTT, and 0.2 units/mL RNAsin Plus. Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate were added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 0.5%, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15–20 min 4 °C. Extracts were loaded on 5–55% gradients of sucrose in 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 0.1 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 µg/mL cycloheximide, 1 x complete EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail, and 100 units/mL RNAsin. Following the centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 2.5 hr at 4 °C, the gradients were manually fractionated into 200 μL fractions. Fractions containing the non-translated mRNA, 80 S ribosomes, and polysomes were pooled.

This field has been mired by fierce debates over the role of the protease Ddi2 in activating the transcription factor Nrf1/NFE2L1. As the authors of this manuscript point out, most of the previous research centers on the continuous treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors rather than a brief pulse of inhibition that better models the situation when these drugs are used clinically. The authors find that the initial recovery of proteasome activity is independent of Ddi2 and involves a mechanism distinct from transcription. The authors intriguingly point to a model in which the assembly of proteasomes is regulated. If true, this would be a significant finding, but for now, this model remains more speculative.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The pulsed treatment of proteasome inhibitors is a strength of this lab that few others use. It better mimics the clinical use of these inhibitors and allows for a more detailed analysis of the initial response to inhibition. The authors have used multiple different clones of Ddi2 knockouts and siRNA against Ddi2 to rule out the necessity of Ddi2 in the early production of proteasomes when cells are inhibited with proteasomes. establishing a thorough knockout approach while also avoiding compensatory mutations. These experiments are well controlled, showing both the levels of Ddi2 upon knockout or knockdown and demonstrating that the cleavage of Nrf1, one of two known targets of Ddi2, is impaired. However, it should be noted that faint bands for Ddi2 mysteriously remain even in the knockout.</p><p>This article sensitively monitors the recovery of proteasome function with the β5 activity assay and for the production of new proteasome transcripts by qPCR. This precision and a detailed analysis of the timing are strengths that pointed to a more rapid recovery than transcription alone.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This paper's major weakness is the difficulty in establishing the authors' model that assembly is regulating this process. They do a convincing job demonstrating that activity recovers before transcription. The evidence that translation is unaffected depends entirely on the polysome RNA profiling from two replicates. Clearer and orthogonal data would help establish this finding. The stability of subunits is interesting and important in its own right.</p><p>In short, the authors establish that Ddi2 is unnecessary for the initial, non-transcriptional recovery of proteasome activity after a pulse of proteasome inhibition.</p><p>It is not clear what clinical impact this work will have. Although it models the pulse of proteasome inhibition more perfectly, it only looks at a single pulse rather than multiple treatments. Thus, ruling out Ddi2's importance for clinical benefit may be premature. More significantly, this work suggests that assembling proteasomes might be a regulated process worth substantial follow-up that will be interesting to follow.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91678.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work Ibtisam and Kisselev explore the role of DDI2 in the proteasome function recovery after a clinically relevant pulse dosing using different proteasome inhibitors and their corresponding PK properties. The authors report that despite lack of NRF1 activation by DDI2 there was no difference in recovery from pulsed proteasome inhibition observed in DDI2 KO cells as compared to WT controls suggesting DDI2 is not required for recovery in this system. They further show that transcription of the proteasome subunits is initiated only after partial recovery of proteasome activity is already observed suggesting that non-transcriptional mechanisms might be also involved.

The authors also provide convincing data that DDI2 is not required for proteasome activity recovery post-PI pulse treatment in the systems they explored.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors show that the recovery of one specific catalytic activity of the proteasome post-PI treatment is transcription independent. However, in this work they do not explore the other catalytic activities of the proteasome, the protein levels of the individual subunits and most importantly the level of the different assembled proteasome complexes and how they change over time. Without this data the proposed mechanism is still speculative, in particular the conclusion on the role of translation, and ignores other findings in the field that suggest that alternative mechanisms (such as proteasome complex assembly regulation for instance) might be just as plausible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91678.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ibtisam</surname><given-names>Ibtisam</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02v80fc35</institution-id><institution>Auburn University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Auburn</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kisselev</surname><given-names>Alexei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02v80fc35</institution-id><institution>Auburn University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Auburn</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for recognizing the importance of our work on transcription-independent early recovery of proteasome activity. We also thank them for their thoughtful criticisms and suggested improvements, which we addressed in the revised version as described below.</p><p>The reviewers and editors asked for data to support the model that early recovery of proteasome activity is due to accelerated proteasome assembly. This model is backed by published data that proteasome assembly intermediates increase dramatically in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 6 in Ref. 46 of the revised manuscript). We expanded the discussion of this paper in a paragraph that describes our model. Another key experiment to confirm this model would be to determine what fraction of nascent polypeptides is degraded within minutes after synthesis, which is not trivial, and Ibtisam ran out of time to conduct these experiments because she had to graduate in spring before the expiration of her visa. This type of experiment usually uses metabolic labeling by a heavy or radioactive amino acid that always includes a prior depletion of a non-labeled amino acid. However, the fundamental flaw of this approach, which is not recognized by the scientific community, is that depletion of an amino acid stresses cells and reduces the rate of protein synthesis, especially if this amino acid is methionine. Thus, this model is not easy to test, and should be considered a speculation. We therefore moved the description of this model, together with Fig. 4, into a separate &quot;Ideas and Speculations&quot; section and removed this model's description from the abstract.</p><p>Reviewer 1 raised the possibility that a background band detected on the western blot of DDI2 KO cells could be a highly homologous protease DDI1. This is highly unlikely because, according to Protein Atlas, DDI1 is selectively expressed in the testis and is not expressed in the cell lines we used. Reviewer 1 also suggested that we should base our conclusion on Nrf1 KD, which we de-facto did because we confirmed that DDI2 KD blocks Nrf1 activation (Fig. 1d).</p><p>In response to Reviewer 1 critiques regarding the presentation of proteasome subunits stability data in Fig. 4 (Ref. 45 of the revised manusript), we removed PSMB8 and replaced chaperons with the subunits of the 26S base. We changed color palettes, symbols, and axis scales to improve clarity.</p><p>We acknowledged in the discussion that our work did not exclude DDI2 role in the recovery of proteasome after repeated pulse treatments, as suggested by Reviewer 1.</p><p>We agree with Reviewer 2 that using “proteasome levels” is inaccurate when describing our activity measurement data. However, in the manuscript, we use &quot;levels&quot; only when discussing data in the literature. We believe measuring activity and not the total levels is more important because not all proteasomes are active, e.g., latent 20S proteasome core particles.</p><p>Reviewer 3 expressed concern that our conclusions were based on data in HAP1 cells, which are haploid, and appear not very sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. This is why we used DDI2 KD in MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cells, which are highly sensitive to proteasome inhibitors (Weyburne et al., Ref. 11). In our experience, full extent of proteasome inhibitor cytotoxicity is not revealed until 48hr after treatments, and viability determined at 12hr and 24hr as on Fig. 1c should not be used to determine sensitivity (it was used for activity assay normalization). We added a new supplementary figure showing that HAP1 cells are as sensitive to proteasome inhibitors as MDA-MD-231 cells when cell viability is assayed 48hr after treatment (new Fig. S2). Another panel on this new figure demonstrates that the baseline proteasome activity is very similar in HAP1, MD-MB-231 and SUM149 cells. We also added data demonstrating that inactivation of DDI2 by mutation does not change the recovery of proteasome activity in HCT-116 cells (new Fig. 1g). Recovery in MDA-MB-231, SUM149, and HCT-116 cells was measured at 18hr, which is still within the 12 – 24hr window when other investigators observed partially DDI2-dependent recovery.</p><p>We have conducted an experiment in which we followed activity recovery for up to 72hr. We found that activity plateaued at 24hr and opted against the repeat because there were no changes. We feel that the manuscript should not include one biological replicate data. The fact that the recovery is incomplete and that cells seem to survive with lower levels of proteasome activity is interesting; however, investigating the molecular basis for this phenomenon is beyond the scope of the current project.</p><p>We were not disputing the conclusions of previous studies that DDI2/Nrf1 is responsible for enhanced expression of proteasomal mRNA in cells continuously treated with proteasome inhibitors. In fact, we confirmed that pulse-treatment causes similar increase (Fig. 2b). As for papers that measured activity recovery after pulse treatment, we objectively discuss our results in the context of these papers.
