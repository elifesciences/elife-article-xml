Wnt morphogens, which are essential regulators of stem cell biology, yet the structural basis of Wnt signaling through Fzd remains poorly understood. Here we report the structure of an unliganded human Fzd5 determined by single-particle cryo-EM at 3.7 Å resolution, with the aid of an antibody chaperone acting as a fiducial marker. We also analyzed the topology of low-resolution XWnt8/Fzd5 complex particles, which revealed extreme flexibility between the Wnt/Fzd-CRD and the Fzd-TM regions. Analysis of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in response to Wnt3a versus a ‘surrogate agonist’ that cross-links Fzd to LRP6, revealed identical structure-activity relationships. Thus, canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling appears to be principally reliant on ligand-induced Fzd/LRP6 heterodimerization, versus the allosteric mechanisms seen in structurally analogous class A G protein-coupled receptors, and Smoothened. These findings deepen our mechanistic understanding of Wnt signal transduction, and have implications for harnessing Wnt agonism in regenerative medicine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>Frizzled</kwd><kwd>canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling</kwd><kwd>surrogate Wnt agonist</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01DK115728</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009729</institution-id><institution>Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM117372</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kossiakoff</surname><given-names>Anthony A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM082545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kossiakoff</surname><given-names>Anthony A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-76SF00515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gati</surname><given-names>Cornelius</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000011/2016-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsutsumi</surname><given-names>Naotaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM structure of monomeric human Frizzled5 was determined with a universal fiducial antibody at 3.7 Å overall resolution, which supports a simple Fzd/LRP6 heterodimerization mechanism of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Frizzled (Fzd) receptors recognize lipidated and glycosylated growth factors, called Wnts, that play crucial roles in stem cell biology, embryonic development and adult tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). Although Fzd receptors are part of the class F G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and involved in G protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wright et al., 2018</xref>), they primarily activate the canonical β-catenin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carmon and Loose, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 1997</xref>). Binding of Wnt to Fzd induces formation of a ternary signaling complex with the co-receptor LRP5/6, recruiting the intracellular complex comprised of Dishevelled (Dvl), Axin, APC, CK1 and GSK3. This event silences the destruction complex, leading to accumulation of transcriptional co-activator β-catenin and the induction of Wnt target genes. Because aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling can lead to tumorigenesis, inhibition of Wnt signaling is a prime target as a cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastas and Moon, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, Wnt’s essential function in orchestrating stem cell proliferation and differentiation have also prompted interest in its use to promote tissue regeneration upon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clevers et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Unlike class A GPCRs, where ligand-induced allostery is well established, the structural and mechanistic basis of Wnt signaling through Fzd remains enigmatic. Wnt signaling requires both a seven transmembrane (TM) GPCR-like (Fzd) and a 1TM (LRP5/6) receptor. On one hand, the clear similarity of Fzd to GPCRs suggests that ligand-induced conformational change could be at play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wright et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling requires Fzd cross-linking with LRP5/6 by both Wnts and Norrin, implying a heterodimerization mechanism analogous to single-pass TM receptors such as cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janda et al., 2017</xref>). To what extent Wnt-induced conformational changes versus simple Fzd/LRP6 heterodimerization play a deterministic role in signaling is not completely clear. Moreover, although structural information on the Fzd cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and its recognition mechanism with both Wnts and Norrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janda et al., 2012</xref>) is available, a structural understanding of the Fzd-7TM regions has lagged behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The class F GPCRs include Smoothened (Smo) and ten Fzd family members which are classified into five subgroups based on homology and Wnt specificity: Fzd1/2/7, Fzd3/6, Fzd4, Fzd5/8 and Fzd9/10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacDonald and He, 2012</xref>). The overall architecture of Fzd receptors consists of an N-terminal CRD, or ligand-binding domain, that serves as the Wnt binding module, and a seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) that is connected to the CRD by a long hinge region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The hinge region can be further subdivided into a flexible segment from the CRD to the first conserved cysteine residue, and the ordered segment from the cysteine to TM1, with the total lengths varying from 50 to 115 amino acid residues. The hFzd4-7TM structure, lacking the CRD, has been recently reported along with structure-based mutagenesis data and molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), but it contains thermostabilized mutations that make it difficult to ascertain the relevance of the TM conformations in comparison to Smo and class A GPCRs.</p><p>In order to deduce insights into the structural basis of Fzd activation, we determined a fiducial-assisted cryo-EM structure at 3.7 Å resolution of hFzd5, lacking any thermostabilizing mutations. We also analyzed Wnt/Fzd complex particles that revealed a flexibly connected Wnt/CRD module that does not allow us to resolve a high-resolution structure of a stable binary Wnt/Fzd complex. The Fzd-TM structure guided the design of a series of mutations to explore the role of transmembrane coupling in signaling by both Wnt and a surrogate agonist. The identical structure-activity relationships shown by the natural versus the synthetic bi-specific agonist strongly suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling through Fzd is largely dependent on cross-linking with LRP6, rather than class-A GPCR-like conformational changes. Thus, the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling mechanism is more reminiscent of ligand-induced heterodimerization of single-pass receptors, such as cytokine and receptor Tyrosine kinases (RTK). Understanding this signaling mechanism is key to utilizing the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway in regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination and analysis</title><p>The initial attempts at reconstructing the 65 kDa hFzd5 molecule were hampered due to the particle shape being dominated by the spherical features of the detergent micelle, an issue that complicates structure determination of small membrane proteins by cryo-EM. To facilitate unambiguous alignment of the particles, we sought to introduce features into the particle that would both increase its size and provide an asymmetric shape that would enable facile alignment for 3D reconstruction of hFzd5. We introduced the BRIL domain (cytochrome b562 RIL) fused in place of intracellular loop 3 of hFzd5. In order to optimize a rigid connection between hFzd5 and BRIL, we grafted two short linkers, each comprising five amino acid residues from A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor-TMs between TM5/6 of Fzd5 and BRIL (See Methods), as used for the first full-length Smo structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>). We employed an anti-BRIL Fab, BAG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukherjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) with an anti-Fab nanobody (Nb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ereño-Orbea et al., 2018</xref>) to complex with the BRIL fusion hFzd5 (hFzd5<sub>ICL3</sub>BRIL).

However, the CRD, the CRD-proximal flexible hinge and a part of ECL3 (A27-Y150, N151-K191 and P487-P498, respectively) are either missing or ambiguous in the 3D reconstruction, suggesting intrinsic flexibility between the 7TM and the ligand binding-module. Given the flexibility between the CRD and 7TM regions and their lack of intimate structural coupling, it seems unlikely that Wnt binding to CRD domain could be propagated through a conformational change to the 7TM bundle to modulate signaling in a manner analogous to authentic GPCRs. Indeed, the hinge of Fzd8, a Fzd5/8 subfamily member, is also quite extended and is ~40 amino acid residues longer than the one of Fzd5, but they share similar Wnt specificity and signaling properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voloshanenko et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We also imaged <italic>Xenopus</italic> Wnt8 (XWnt8) bound to full-length hFzd5 (hFzd5FL) without the BRIL fusion, the Fab, or the Nb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). After successfully purifying a stable complex, 2D class averages revealed two rather blurred densities that match the size of Wnt/Fz in detergent micelle. However, the densities for both regions are limited to low resolution due to extreme segmental variation and flexibility, and therefore do not allow us to resolve a complete structure of the complex. It is likely that LRP6, missing in our complex, could stabilize the Wnt/CRD module. Nevertheless, an approximate placement of hFzd5FL and XWnt8 in the 2D class averages reveals Wnt projecting straight up from the Fzd-TM-micelle, with a narrow stricture of missing density for the linker region. These 2D classes represent an average relative position of the two molecules that exist in a spectrum of angular variations. This allowed us to visualize both Wnt and Fzd densities, but probably represent only a part of many alternative Wnt/Fzd-CRD positions in the total population of particles. Attempts of 3D classification and reconstruction were not successful due to their severe segmental heterogeneity. Despite the limitations of the Wnt/Fzd data, the particles further support the conclusion that the Wnt/Fzd-CRD module is not in intimate contact with the TM-regions of Fzd and is therefore unlikely to participate in a tightly structurally coupled allosteric relay upon Wnt binding.</p><p>Although Smo has one of the shortest hinges among human Class F GPCRs, the cryo-EM structure of the Smo/G protein complex showed the EM map of the CRD was not well-defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qi et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the crystal structures of full-length Smo showed that the CRD could ‘sit’ on the ordered extracellular loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>) suggesting Smo-CRD is less flexible than Fzd-CRD.

For example, it has been proposed that during Smo signaling, the long TM6-ECL3 α-helix interacts with the CRD to sense ligand-induced conformational rearrangement by the CRD. This could facilitate allosteric communication between the CRD, TM6 and TM7 for receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deshpande et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2018</xref>).

Smo and most Fzds have two cysteines dispersed in their ECL3s, and Smo shows an intra-ECL3 disulfide bond in the structure. In contrast, there is no ECL3 cysteine for Fzd4. The differences in cysteine distribution in the hinge region and ECL3 between Fzd4 and Fzd5 might explain the cell signaling data from a chimeric Fzd4, where the whole hinge region was replaced by the Fzd5 hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bang et al., 2018</xref>). Although cell-surface expression was confirmed, the chimeric receptor was completely inactive to Norrin stimulation, and it was concluded that the loss of the Norrin-Fzd4 hinge interaction disrupted signaling. However, a more plausible explanation may be that the disruption of the disulfide network impaired the structural integrity of the chimeric receptor. Consistent with this explanation, several Fzd4 mutations of the hinge cysteines (C181R, C204Y, and C204R) render Fzd4 inactive in patients with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Milhem et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In Fzd-7TM, the ‘orthosteric’ pocket for small-molecules (eg. vismodegib, Anta XV, TC114, LY2940680 and SAG1.3 for Smo-7TM) has a constriction that restricts ligand access (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). In the putative ‘druggable’ pocket, Fzd5 has a bulky ionic residue K506<sup>7.41</sup> (superscript denotes generic numbering for class F GPCRs residue). This residue is conserved in ten Frizzled members, potentially restricting the small molecule access together with the neighboring bulky sidechain of Y507<sup>7.42</sup>. The approximate minimum diameters of the pockets are 4.9 Å for Fzd5 and 4.2 Å for Fzd4, whereas Smo has a 5.8 Å diameter stricture near the entrance of the cavity. Alanine substitution of either K506<sup>7.41</sup> or Y507<sup>7.42</sup> severely impaired cell surface protein expression of full-length hFzd5, implying the importance of these residues for protein stability likely through inter-helical packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the small pockets evident in the Fzd-7TM structures might help to explain the difficulty of developing small molecule modulators for Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a recent report showed the Smo agonist SAG1.3 acted as a partial agonist for Fzd6-Gi signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kozielewicz et al., 2020</xref>).

However, the cytoplasmic end of Fzd5-TM5 is in an inward position compared to Fzd4-TM5 and aligns well with the Smo-TM5 in its inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

Delineating between a Wnt-induced allosteric mechanism through Fzd, a la’ GPCR, and a simple Fzd/LRP heterodimerization mechanism remains challenging. Thus, we approached this experiment by comparing structure-activity relationships for canonical signaling induced by the natural ligand Wnt3a, versus a synthetic agonist that cross-links Fzd5 and LRP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janda et al., 2017</xref>). ‘Surrogate Wnt’ molecules serve as cross-linkers of Fzd and LRP6 receptors to form signaling heterodimers, but with distinct binding modes compared to Wnt, and therefore are devoid of any ‘intrinsic’ structural features of Wnt that might be contributing to an allosteric mechanism. We examined β-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) signaling downstream of hFzd5 upon stimulation with either hWnt3a or a surrogate Wnt using the Fzd1/2/4/5/7/8 knockout cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voloshanenko et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We then tested a series of mutants in this assay system. Fzd5-Y507A<sup>7.42</sup> signaled as robustly as the wild-type receptor regardless of its low expression, indicating the expression levels are not limiting signaling strength.

This is further supported by the long and flexible linker between the Fzd-TM and CRD, which does not allow intimate structural coupling between ligand binding and conformational changes in the TM. This stands in contrast to Smo, which has a more rigid linker, allowing allosteric signal transduction by sensing the stimulus on CRD. It is possible that G protein signaling is more reliant on the conformational change of Fzds. Also, it is still unclear if the proximity of LRP6 to Fzd induces conformational changes in Fzd as a result of heterodimerization, but if so, this would be driven by structural properties intrinsic to the receptors, not Wnt. The canonical Wnt system, comprising both a 7TM GPCR-like receptor (Fzd) and a single-pass 1TM receptor (LRP5/6), has presented a mechanistic conundrum in that GPCRs signal through ligand-induced allostery, whereas single-pass TM receptors generally signal via ligand-induced dimerization, exemplified by RTK and JAK/STAT cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wilmes et al., 2020</xref>). In this case, the preponderance of structural and mechanistic data point to a unique example of a heterodimerization-driven mechanism by a GPCR-like receptor Fzd and a Type-I receptor LRP5/6. This feature opens up the possibility of ‘tuning’ Wnt signaling through the use of alternative agonist molecules, such as antibodies and other dimeric scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tao et al., 2019</xref>), to obtain a more granular understanding of Wnt biology and for developing regenerative therapeutics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>)</td><td>Sf9</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CTL-1711 <break/>(RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0549">CVCL_0549</ext-link>)</td><td>Insect cells used for baculovirus production</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup></td><td>Gift from Prof. H Gobind Khorana (PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12370423">12370423</ext-link>)</td><td/><td>Mammalian cells used for baculovirus expression of hFzd5FL and hFzd5<sub>ICL3</sub>BRIL</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T with Fzd1/2/4/5/7/8 KO</td><td>Gift from Prof. Michael Boutros (PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28733458">28733458</ext-link>)</td><td/><td>For signaling assay</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Mouse monoclonal M1 hybridoma</td><td>Gift from Prof. Brian K Kobilka (PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17962520">17962520</ext-link>)</td><td/><td>To purify anti-FLAG M1 (mouse IgG2a) antibody to prepare FLAG affinity column (15 mg/ml resin).

The chimeric protein was made using the inactive BRIL-fusion Smoothened with V329F<sup>3.40</sup> mutation in TM3 (PDB: ID 5L7D) as a reference, which yielded well-diffracting crystals in the report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>). Wild-type hFzd5 (residue 27–428 and 441–546, UniProt ID: Q13467) was connected to BRIL using two short linkers derived from A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor (ARRQL between residue 428 and N-terminus of BRIL, and ARSTL between C-terminus of BRIL and residue 441) and cloned with an N-terminal HA signal peptide and a FLAG epitope into the mammalian baculovirus expression (BacMam) vector pVLAD6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dukkipati et al., 2008</xref>), that has a C-terminal 3C protease site followed by a protein C epitope and an octahistidine tag. While we did not have to test multiple constructs for cryo-EM screening, we noticed that the extended helical linker was suitable for the Fab marker, which would have otherwise led to a ‘collision’ between the Fab/Nb unit and the detergent micelle. We also note that hFzd5<sub>ICL3</sub>BRIL had an overall 5-fold higher yield after expression and purification compared to hFzd5FL, indirectly suggesting its superior stability.</p><p>P0 virus was prepared in Sf9 by co-transfecting the expression vector and BestBac Linearized Baculovirus DNA (Expression Systems, CA, USA) using a standard method, and the virus was amplified from P0 to P2. hFzd5<sub>ICL3</sub>BRIL was expressed in HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells with BacMam baculovirus transduction. 4% (v/v) P2 virus was added to cells at a density of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per ml and culture flasks were shaken at 37 °C for 24 hr with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After centrifugation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 5 mM EDTA and 1:1000 protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC, Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA), weigh and stored at −20°C. Approx. 30 grams of cell pellet was thawed and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer in a lysis buffer composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mg/ml iodoacetamide, and 1:1000 PIC. The lysate was centrifuged at 48,000 x g for 1 hr and the membrane pellet was resuspended and nutated for 2 hr in 400 ml of a solubilization buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl (HBS), 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Sol-Grade, Anatrace), 0.2% (w/v) cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS, Anatrace), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mg/ml iodoacetamide, and cOmplete PIC (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).</p><p>After centrifugation at 48,000 x g for 1 hr, 10 ml Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was stirred at 4°C overnight. The resin was collected in a column, washed with HBS with 0.1% (w/v) DDM, 0.02% (w/v) CHS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mM imidazole (wash buffer) and eluted in wash buffer supplemented with 230 mM imidazole. 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was then added to the eluate, which was further purified over the in-house anti-FLAG M1 affinity sepharose column. The resin was washed with HBS + 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> supplemented with detergents, which was gradually exchanged from 0.1% DDM to 0.01% GDN. The receptor was eluted in HBS with 0.002% (w/v) GDN, 0.0002% (w/v) CHS, 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide and 5 mM EDTA, and further purified by a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column Superdex 200 10/300 GL equilibrated with SEC buffer comprised of HBS, 0.002% (w/v) GDN and 0.0002% (w/v) CHS.</p><p>The anti-BRIL Fab was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukherjee et al., 2020</xref>).

The protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) cells and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography, followed by removal of the His-tag by TEV digestion. The final step in the purification was a SEC on a Superdex 75 prep grade column whereby monodisperse Nb was obtained. The purified receptor was incubated with 1.4-fold and 2-fold molar excess of anti-BRIL Fab and anti-Fab Nb, respectively, at 4°C for overnight. The mixture was concentrated to 500 µL and injected into a SEC column Superdex 200 10/300 GL equilibrated with the SEC buffer. The peak fractions were concentrated to ~2 mg/ml and 0.01% digitonin was added at this point. The solution was further concentrated to ~8 mg/ml for cryo-EM analysis.</p><p>To prepare the Wnt/Fzd complex, we expressed XWnt8 and hFzd5FL separately from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells or HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells, respectively. For solubilized XWnt8, we employed the XWnt8/mFzd8CRD co-expression system developed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janda et al., 2012</xref>). Untagged XWnt8 and C-terminal Fc fusion mFzd8CRD were stably co-expressed in cell culture media, and secreted XWnt8/mFzd8CRD-Fc was captured on Protein A sepharose resin (Sigma). After washing the resin with HBS on column, only XWnt8 was eluted from the column with Wnt elution buffer containing 10 mM Hepes-Na pH 7.2, 500 mM NaCl and 0.1% DDM, in which DDM ‘wash out’ lipidated Wnt from CRD with competition. The eluted XWnt8 was then captured by ConA glycan affinity resin (Vector Laboratories) for detergent exchange. The detergent composition was gradually changed as follow; 0.1% DDM, 0.09% DDM/0.01% GDN, 0.05% DDM/0.05% GDN, 0.01% DDM/0.09% GDN, 0.1% GDN and 0.01% GDN. XWnt8 in GDN is eluted with HBS containing 0.01% GDN and 250 mM each Methyl α-D-glucopyranoside and Methyl α-D-mannopyranoside (Sigma). hFzd5FL was prepared by essentially the same scheme as hFzd5<sub>ICL3</sub>BRIL. Briefly, wild-type hFzd5FL with N-terminal FLAG and C-terminal octahistidine tags was expressed on cell membrane using BacMam system, extracted in 1% DDM/0.2% CHS and first purified with Ni-NTA resin. Pool fractions of hFzd5FL from Ni-NTA resin in 0.1% DDM/0.02% CHS was further purified with anti-FLAG M1 affinity sepharose with detergent exchange to 0.01% GDN/0.002% CHS, and a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column equilibrated with the SEC buffer. 1.2 molar excess XWnt8 was added to the SEC purified hFzd5FL, and incubated at 4°C for overnight. The mixture was concentrated to 500 µL and injected into a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column equilibrated with the SEC buffer. The peak fractions were concentrated to 5–15 mg/ml with final &lt;1 CMC (0.06%) digitonin for cryo-EM specimen preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cryo-EM specimen preparation and data collection</title><p>2.5 µL of either the hFzd5<sub>ICL3</sub>BRIL/anti-BRIL Fab/anti-Fab Nb sample or the XWnt8/hFzd5FL sample was applied to glow-discharged 300 mesh gold grids (Quantifoil R1.2/1.3). Excess sample was blotted to a filter paper for 5 s before plunge-freezing using a Leica EM GP (Leica Microsystems) at 8°C and 90% humidity.</p><p>Cryo-EM data were collected at the CryoEM facility at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus. Images were collected on a Titan Krios operated at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan imaging filter and K3 camera in correlated double sampling super-resolution mode at a nominal magnification of 81,000x, corresponding to a physical pixel size of 1.078 Å. Each movie was recorded for a total of 6.125 s with 0.1225 s exposure per frame at an exposure rate of 9.5 electrons/pixel/second at the specimens, that yielded an electron counting of ~7.5 electrons/pixel/second at the camera. The datasets were collected using SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>) software with the defocus range between −0.8 and −2.0 μm and beam-image shift to collect 9 movies from nine holes per stage shift and focusing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cryo-EM data processing</title><p>A total 10,898 movies were collected and subjected to beam-induced motion correction using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) with binning to the physical pixel size. All subsequent data processing steps were performed with cryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). Patched contrast transfer function parameters were estimated for each micrograph from the dose-weighted averages of all frames with default parameters. Initial auto-picking templates were generated after a round of reference-free picking on a subset of micrographs. A total of 6,483,398 ‘particles’ were picked with template-based auto picking. Several rounds of 2D classification resulted in 570,859 particles. Particles in this subgroup were subjected to several rounds of heterogeneous refinement and non-uniform refinement. A final subset of 207,021 particles were used for the final reconstruction. During the subsequent process, we noticed several ‘conformations’ were picked up in 3D classification attempts, as a hinge-like motion around the BRIL domain. The BRIL domain is notorious for its flexible nature, and is often poorly resolved or even disordered in crystallographic reconstructions. The final non-uniform refinement reconstruction yielded a structure at 4.6 Å resolution. The best final reconstruction (nominal resolution of 3.7 Å), was achieved with the full map fed into the ‘local-refinement’ routine, with a fulcrum on the BRIL domain. We attempted several ways of masking of individual parts, which did not result in a reconstruction as good as the using the full map including the detergent belt. The resolution of the final map was determined by gold standard Fourier shell correlation using the 0.143 criterion.</p><p>For the XWnt8/hFzd5FL dataset, a similar data processing approach was utilized. Initially, beam induced motion was corrected for 6,161 raw movies using MotionCor2. Dose-weighted micrographs were imported into cryoSPARC for all subsequent steps. The ‘Patch CTF’ routine was applied for CTF estimation, followed by template-free and template-based particle picking. A total of 6,431,867 ‘particles’ were picked for the final set, which underwent successive rounds of 2D classification to clean up the dataset. From 2D classes alone, it was already apparent that the XWnt8/hFzd5FL was highly dynamic and did not yield any discernible secondary structure features. The resulting 245,114 particles were further processed by ab-initio reconstructions and heterogeneous refinement in an attempt to further classify subsets. The final dataset of 33,149 particles was used for the 2D classification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5c</xref> and to generate a 3D reconstruction with unsatisfying quality.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Model building and refinement for hFzd5<sub>ICL3</sub>BRIL/Fab/Nb</title><p>The homology model of hFzd5 was built on SWISS-MODEL server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://swissmodel.expasy.org/">swissmodel.expasy.org</ext-link>) using the crystal structures of rubredoxin fusion hFzd4TM (PDB ID: 6BD4) and BRIL fusion multi-domain Smo (PDB ID: 5L7D) as templates.

The structure shows clear density for the transmembrane, the BRIL, the Fab and the nanobody domains, but not for the FZD-CRD. Another attempt at solving a structure of FZD5 in complex with XWnt8 was unsuccessful due to inherent flexibility between the FZD TMD and the CRD-Wnt complex. The TMD of FZD5 shows a very narrow allosteric binding pocket as observed previously for FZD4. Taken together the authors hypothesize that it is very unlikely that Wnt ligands exert their function via the classic allosteric binding pocket of “normal” GPCR and propose a simple heterodimerization model with LRP receptors to activate β-catenin dependent Wnt signaling. To validate this model, they compare the signaling ability of FZD5 point mutants of the allosteric pocket induced by Wnt ligands or structurally unrelated synthetic Wnt surrogates.</p><p>This is a beautiful study and the results are interesting and advance our mechanistic understanding on Wnt signaling. The manuscript is well-written, the data presented in the study are of high quality and the conclusions are supported by the data presented.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) It would be useful to provide some more details about the constructs design. For example, how was the insertion of the BRIL domain optimized among loops? Why not fused as continuation of appropriate transmembrane helices? Did the insertion of the BRIL domain improve the hFzd5 stability?</p><p>2) Is it possible that the insertion of the BRIL domain (or together with Fab/Nb) can affect Fzd conformation or oligomeric state (because of its bulkiness)? It is also possible that different experimental conditions result in different oligomeric states of Fzd. The authors should comment on these points.</p><p>3) The signaling strength of low-expressed/unstable Y507A is similar to (or higher than) wild-type, which is not seen in K506A. Could the author clarify this observation from the structural point of view</p><p>4) The heterodimerization model provides valuable insight into the activation mechanism of canonical Wnt signaling. The data supports that allosteric activation via small ligands of the binding pocket in the center of the TM domain does not play a major role. However, it cannot fully be excluded, and though the authors state that this cannot be fully ruled out, this point needs to be emphasized in the paper.</p><p>5) This is the first structure of a FZD TM domain without any thermostabilizing mutations. It would be informative to comment on whether any structural differences between the FZD5 and FZD4 TM can directly be attributed to such mutations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>General assessment</p><p>Considering the fundamental importance of Wnt signaling in basic biology and medicine, as well as the scarcity of the structural information about the core signaling components, the partial structure of Fz5 reported here merits publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I have no problem with the structure of TM regions and the mechanistic interpretations built upon the structural as well as functional data of the mutants. However, I found that the structural analysis and conclusion about the extracellular parts are very crude and highly misleading. Either extensive re-analyses or omission of the data/arguments is strongly advised.</p><p>Substantive concerns</p><p>1) Authenticity of the ECL structures</p><p>In contrast to the TM region of Fz5 which showed high structural similarity with that of Fz4, the extracellular region comprising three ECLs and hinge differs significantly (Figure 2C). This region is of great biological importance because it is situated in a position that could structurally and functionally link ligand-binding CRD and the TM bundle, and therefore the accuracy of the model is critical. I found that the way authors present the loop structure (Figure 1—figure supplement 4B) is highly misleading. First of all, arbitrarily separating certain chunk of EM map and overlaying the model structure should be avoided, because there is no way of knowing which part of the molecule actually contributed to the observed volume. Using the data provided, I made volume map figure myself using Chimera after normalizing the data (mean=0, stdev=1) with the threshold of 3 σ. When viewed from different orientation, the quality of the fitting becomes unacceptably low, with the region near Arg601 having almost no density. I also have serious doubts about the disulfide bonding between C190 and C590 (mislabeled as C484 in the figure). If you look closely the alignment (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), C590-containing ECL3 invariably has two Cys in all Fz/Smo except for Fz4, which are disulfide-bonded in Smo. Connecting C590 with C190 would leave the surface-exposed C592 in an unpaired state. Considering the conservation across Fzs, C190 (C232 in Fz8) is most likely bonded to preceding C182 (C228 in Fz8). Therefore, the plausible interpretation would be C182-C190 and C590-C592. This is not trivial point, because it points to the possibility that the main-chain tracing of the current model could be completely wrong, which would undermine the overall discussion about the extracellular disulfide network.</p><p>2) Heterodimerization mechanism</p><p>The authors repeatedly mention, even in the article title itself, that ligand-induced heterodimerization is the mechanism responsible for the canonical Wnt signaling. I can agree that it does not conform to the allosteric mechanism found in class A GPCR, but the choice of word (heterodimerization) will cause great confusion/misunderstanding among readers, partly because the GPCR heterodimerization has also been postulated. I understand that the authors refer to the heterodimerization between Fz5 and LRP6, and that such interaction is undeniably critical based on the numerous published results as well as the authors' own surrogate agonist experiments. But authors failed to discuss equally-well documented mechanism of Fz homodimerization, which is not mutually exclusive with the heterodimer theory. Fz CRD alone is reported to undergo homodimerization (ref 17), so is Wnt3-CRD complex (ref 10). Probably the more important question to ask is whether the Fz-LRP heterodimer undergoes homodimer(or oligomer)ization. It is regrettable that the authors did not perform more extensive analysis on the di/oligomerization tendency of FL Fz5 before and after the Wnt8 binding. I would have liked it very much if statistical analysis on the dimer/monomer ratio found in the earlier SEC fractions were presented.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structure of human Frizzled5 by fiducial-assisted cryo-EM supports a heterodimeric mechanism of canonical Wnt signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Overall, I think the paper is almost ready for the publication in <italic>eLife</italic> considering the fundamental importance of Wnt signaling in basic biology and medicine, as well as the scarcity of the structural information about the core signaling components. However, I could not find satisfying changes in the text regarding my second concern (i.e., clarification of the terminology of &quot;heterodimerization mechanism&quot;).</p><p>1) Heterodimerization mechanism</p><p>Maybe my comment in the previous review was not clear. I was not suggesting the authors to emphasize the alternative signaling mechanism involving Fz-Fz homodimerization. My concern was the choice of the word (heterodimerization mechanism) because readers may get the wrong impression that they are claiming the GPCR (Fz) heterodimerization as the major signaling mechanism, particularly when readers only read Abstract. In the Abstract, I suggest changing &quot;ligand-induced heterodimerization&quot; to something like &quot;Fzd/LRP6 heterodimerization&quot;.</p><p>2) EM images of Wnt8-Fz5</p><p>The authors revised the text to further emphasize the limitation of the data, which is fair and appropriate. And I can agree with their intention to keep the figure as the main figure. However, the newly added 3D cross-section of the Figure 1E is highly inappropriate. First of all, the 2D class averages of the original Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 5 are of low quality and can contain many misaligned particles. In general, calculating a 3D volume map does not make the data more reliable than calculating 2D averages (it is the opposite). More importantly, the &quot;local refinement&quot; feature in cryoSPARC program can only be performed after accurately determining the overall 3D structure, which is not the case here. This point is clearly mentioned in the developer's website (https://cryosparc.com/blog/local-refinement-snrnp-case-study) as &quot;Before we can use any of the local refinement tools, we need an accurate picture of the overall structure…&quot;. Besides, there are no description about the mask they used in the local refinement nor the explanation of the heat map values. I strongly suggest authors to remove the &quot;refined 3D map&quot; for the Wnt-Fz complex from both Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 5E.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58464.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) It would be useful to provide some more details about the constructs design.

The authors should comment on these points.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we cannot entirely exclude that the BRIL insertion into the ICL3 of Fzd5 alters the propensity of Fzd5 for distinct conformational and oligomeric states. In reality, cryo-EM analysis and protein crystallization techniques both have aspects that can bias towards certain conformational states, but we are careful not to extend our interpretations beyond the most plausible explanations.</p><p>Concerning the oligomeric state, we predominantly observed peaks of monomeric hFzd5I<sub>CL3</sub>BRIL and hFzd5FL on size-exclusion chromatography. The BRIL insertion does not noticeably change the preference for distinct oligomeric states. Also, to our knowledge, it has not been reported that the insertion of BRIL into the ICL3 of GPCRs triggers changes to their oligomeric states. Hence, we focus our discussion on the description of the oligomeric states without extending our speculations on their functional implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The signaling strength of low-expressed/unstable Y507A is similar to (or higher than) wild-type, which is not seen in K506A. Could the author clarify this observation from the structural point of view</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Our flow cytometry data show that the K506A variant has absolutely no detectable expression, whereas the Y507A variant has a relatively low cell surface expression that was enough to saturate the Wnt3a-dependent signaling. This suggests while the Y507A mutation impairs expression, the K506A is detrimental to the stability of hFzd5. Among ten Frizzled family members, K<sup>7.41</sup> is 100% conserved where the sidechain plays a role in the inter-helical packing between TM6 and TM7 as mentioned, by bridging Y<sup>6.51</sup> (90% conserved, L for Fzd8), E<sup>6.54</sup> (100% conserved) and Y<sup>7.42</sup> (70% conserved, I for Fzd4/9/10) in the structure, which suggests its functional importance. We edited the corresponding discussion lightly to imply the class-conserved K506 is more important than Y507.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The heterodimerization model provides valuable insight into the activation mechanism of canonical Wnt signaling. The data supports that allosteric activation via small ligands of the binding pocket in the center of the TM domain does not play a major role. However, it cannot fully be excluded, and though the authors state that this cannot be fully ruled out, this point needs to be emphasized in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that although the close packing of the TMs suggests that the pocket of the receptor occludes small molecules, we cannot fully exclude that certain classes of small molecules can be accommodated in the “ligand-binding” pocket. In fact, we have cited the publication reporting the Smo agonist SAG1.3 could act as a partial agonist for Fzd6-Gi signaling. This is in good agreement with our existing discussion regarding the mechanism of Fzd receptor activation.</p><p>Our data suggest that simple cross-linking of Fzd and LRP6 can trigger the intracellular β-catenin signaling, as the surrogate agonists have shown. This mechanism is not mutually exclusive with alternative mechanisms to activate intracellular signaling pathways that might be triggered by small-molecule ligands. Hence, we further interpret that the conformational change model might be more applicable to intracellular signaling mediated by G proteins. Fzd-dependent G protein signaling might be more sensitive to conformational change. The possibility of conformational change during G protein signaling has been included in the current revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) This is the first structure of a FZD TM domain without any thermostabilizing mutations. It would be informative to comment on whether any structural differences between the FZD5 and FZD4 TM can directly be attributed to such mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>The stabilizing mutations of Fzd4 were designed by the group of Prof. Xu based on multiple sequence alignment of Fzd members. For three of the four mutations, amino acids that occur naturally in Fzd5 were chosen (C450I, C507F, and S508Y for the Fzd4 structure). The remaining one is also similar (M309L for the Fzd4 structure, and Fzd5 has V at the corresponding position). Based on this analysis, we hypothesize that Fzd5 is perhaps naturally more stable compared to Fzd4. Given these similarities, we cannot draw any meaningful conclusion by comparing variations at these particular sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Substantive concerns</p><p>1) Authenticity of the ECL structures</p><p>In contrast to the TM region of Fz5 which showed high structural similarity with that of Fz4, the extracellular region comprising three ECLs and hinge differs significantly (Figure 2C). This region is of great biological importance because it is situated in a position that could structurally and functionally link ligand-binding CRD and the TM bundle, and therefore the accuracy of the model is critical. I found that the way authors present the loop structure (Figure 1—figure supplement 4B) is highly misleading. First of all, arbitrarily separating certain chunk of EM map and overlaying the model structure should be avoided, because there is no way of knowing which part of the molecule actually contributed to the observed volume. Using the data provided, I made volume map figure myself using Chimera after normalizing the data (mean=0, stdev=1) with the threshold of 3 σ. When viewed from different orientation, the quality of the fitting becomes unacceptably low, with the region near Arg601 having almost no density. I also have serious doubts about the disulfide bonding between C190 and C590 (mislabeled as C484 in the figure). If you look closely the alignment (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), C590-containing ECL3 invariably has two Cys in all Fz/Smo except for Fz4, which are disulfide-bonded in Smo. Connecting C590 with C190 would leave the surface-exposed C592 in an unpaired state. Considering the conservation across Fzs, C190 (C232 in Fz8) is most likely bonded to preceding C182 (C228 in Fz8). Therefore, the plausible interpretation would be C182-C190 and C590-C592. This is not trivial point, because it points to the possibility that the main-chain tracing of the current model could be completely wrong, which would undermine the overall discussion about the extracellular disulfide network.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our initial model was not sufficiently conservative. Our interpretation of the EM volume was C182(unmodeled)-C486/C190-C484, however, we also made variants with C182(unmodeled)-C190/C484-C486 during our model building attempts, and we agree that it is not appropriate to judge the disulfide bonding network based on this map.</p><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestions, we have made the following adjustments.</p><p>1) We have removed residues P487 to P498, which includes the flexible region in ICL3 and R495, from our model. We agree that the EM volume of this region is ambiguous. Although ICL3 likely adopts multiple conformations, including the one we have previously modeled, we recognize that it implies false precision when a single model is placed (subsection “Structural comparison between hFzd5, hFzd4 and hSmo”).</p><p>2) We have removed residues F188 to C192 and the sidechain of C484 from our model. This is to avoid misleading conclusions about the most flexible yet important regions of the structure. Further, we have revised the Discussion in our manuscript accordingly. We note that the hinge domain and ICL3 of the Fzd5/8 subfamily have a unique distribution of cysteine residues among the class F GPCRs, and wish to perform additional experiments to more adequately address this question.</p><p>Further, we apologize for the inconsistency in residues numbering. In the initial submission, we provided the coordinates directly from Phenix refine. Here, we have attached a revised model with renumbered residues, so it is consistent with the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Heterodimerization mechanism</p><p>The authors repeatedly mention, even in the article title itself, that ligand-induced heterodimerization is the mechanism responsible for the canonical Wnt signaling. I can agree that it does not conform to the allosteric mechanism found in class A GPCR, but the choice of word (heterodimerization) will cause great confusion/misunderstanding among readers, partly because the GPCR heterodimerization has also been postulated. I understand that the authors refer to the heterodimerization between Fz5 and LRP6, and that such interaction is undeniably critical based on the numerous published results as well as the authors' own surrogate agonist experiments. But authors failed to discuss equally-well documented mechanism of Fz homodimerization, which is not mutually exclusive with the heterodimer theory. Fz CRD alone is reported to undergo homodimerization (ref 17), so is Wnt3-CRD complex (ref 10). Probably the more important question to ask is whether the Fz-LRP heterodimer undergoes homodimer(or oligomer)ization. It is regrettable that the authors did not perform more extensive analysis on the di/oligomerization tendency of FL Fz5 before and after the Wnt8 binding. I would have liked it very much if statistical analysis on the dimer/monomer ratio found in the earlier SEC fractions were presented.</p></disp-quote><p>In several crystal structures, the isolated Fzd-CRDs in complex with lipids or Wnt3a were observed in dimeric arrangements, and we have cited the corresponding publications. However, we have previously carried out single-molecule TIRF microscopy imaging of full-length Fzd8 and LRP6 on live cell membranes with and without Wnt (Janda et al., 2017). We have found that the predominant state of the signaling complexes is a 1:1 monomer of the Fzd8/LRP6 heterodimer, with less populated higher oligomeric states. We have not seen evidence of Fzd homodimers on cells, although this issue remains to be fully resolved. We have also observed and described a small population of hFzd5<sub>ICL3</sub>BRIL/Fab/Nb dimers in the cryo-EM 2D class averages. Given the published data in hand, we feel that we have given a fair and transparent account of this issue and do not think that anything else is within the scope of the current paper.</p><p>We also note that purified hFzd5FL and hFzd5<sub>ICL3</sub>BRIL in detergent micelles elute from size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) at volumes predictive of monomers. The addition of XWnt8 only leads to a marginal faster migration through the size-exclusion column, suggesting a 1:1 complex formation. However, the SEC profiles also show some higher molecular weight shoulders. These are very common for most other GPCRs we have purified, and the amount of the small shoulder varies between experiments and protein preparations. As we cannot know whether it represents the physiological dimer (multimer) or artifacts (such as misfolded and aggregated receptors, and unnatural head-to-tail dimers often observed for detergent-solubilized membrane proteins), we are hesitant to quantify the ratio based on the unclear SEC observation that can lead to erroneous conclusions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors addressed the primary concern I expressed in the initial review (i.e., the authenticity of the ECL structure) by removing some segments from the model and accordingly modifying the figures. Overall, I think the paper is almost ready for the publication in eLife considering the fundamental importance of Wnt signaling in basic biology and medicine, as well as the scarcity of the structural information about the core signaling components. However, I could not find satisfying changes in the text regarding my second concern (i.e., clarification of the terminology of &quot;heterodimerization mechanism&quot;).</p><p>1) Heterodimerization mechanism</p><p>Maybe my comment in the previous review was not clear. I was not suggesting the authors to emphasize the alternative signaling mechanism involving Fz-Fz homodimerization. My concern was the choice of the word (heterodimerization mechanism) because readers may get the wrong impression that they are claiming the GPCR (Fz) heterodimerization as the major signaling mechanism, particularly when readers only read Abstract. In the Abstract, I suggest changing &quot;ligand-induced heterodimerization&quot; to something like &quot;Fzd/LRP6 heterodimerization&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we revised the word in the Abstract and the impact statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) EM images of Wnt8-Fz5</p><p>The authors revised the text to further emphasize the limitation of the data, which is fair and appropriate. And I can agree with their intention to keep the figure as the main figure. However, the newly added 3D cross-section of the Figure 1E is highly inappropriate. First of all, the 2D class averages of the original Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 5 are of low quality and can contain many misaligned particles. In general, calculating a 3D volume map does not make the data more reliable than calculating 2D averages (it is the opposite). More importantly, the &quot;local refinement&quot; feature in cryoSPARC program can only be performed after accurately determining the overall 3D structure, which is not the case here. This point is clearly mentioned in the developer's website (https://cryosparc.com/blog/local-refinement-snrnp-case-study) as &quot;Before we can use any of the local refinement tools, we need an accurate picture of the overall structure…&quot;. Besides, there are no description about the mask they used in the local refinement nor the explanation of the heat map values. I strongly suggest authors to remove the &quot;refined 3D map&quot; for the Wnt-Fz complex from both Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 5E.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we deleted all data regarding the attempts at 3D refinement of XWnt8/hFz5FL.</p></body></sub-article></article>
